        "title": "Meta’s Upbeat Quarterly Report Buys Time for AI, Metaverse",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Plaforms Inc. reported better-than-expected sales for the second quarter, offering evidence that the company’s investments in artificial intelligence are helping it sell more targeted and personalized advertisements.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nKamala Harris Wipes Out Trump’s Swing-State Lead in Election Dead Heat Intel to Cut Thousands of Jobs to Reduce Costs, Fund Rebound Ukraine Receives First F-16 Fighter Jets After Long Wait Iran’s Leader Orders Retaliatory Strike on Israel, NYT Says Luxury Heir Alleges His $13 Billion Hermès Fortune Has Vanished\n\nThat progress, which sent the social media company’s shares up in late trading Wednesday, will buy time for Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to invest in more future-looking products. Addressing investors and analysts, he spent most of his time expounding on Meta’s push into large language models that will power AI chatbots and praising the company’s AI smart glasses and virtual reality headsets.\n\n“There are all the jokes about how all the tech CEOs get on these earnings calls and just talk about AI the whole time,” he said Wednesday. “It’s because it’s actually super exciting and it’s going to change all these different things over multiple time horizons.”\n\nZuckerberg said that AI will “end up affecting almost every product that we have in some way.”\n\nIn the more immediate term, Meta has been using AI to improve the way advertisements find interested users, adding efficiency to its most lucrative business. The company is using algorithms to better determine when and where to show ads, and is also starting to roll out generative AI features so that marketers with small budgets can create more interesting promotions.\n\nMeta had 3.27 billion users across all of its apps as of June 30, an increase of 7% from the prior year.\n\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent company reported sales of $39.1 billion for the quarter ended June 30, compared with analysts’ estimates of $38.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meta expects sales for the current quarter of $38.5 billion to $41 billion, compared with the average projection for $39.2 billion.\n\nMeta shares jumped about 5% in late trading.\n\nMeta has been spending heavily on data centers and computing power, as Zuckerberg works to build a leading position in the industry-wide AI race. Meta tweaked its full-year projections for capital expenditures, setting a new forecast of $37 billion to $40 billion, raising the low end of an earlier range by $2 billion.\n\nThe company is investing in large language models, the technology that underpins AI chatbots. Meta recently unveiled its largest model to date, which Zuckerberg said cost hundreds of millions of dollars in computing power to train. It has also spent heavily on other long-term project, including AI-powered smartglasses, and a series of virtual worlds known as the metaverse. Reality Labs, the division within Meta that is tasked with building all of these futuristic technologies, reported a loss of nearly $4.5 billion on the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nBalancing investment with the more immediate need for financial returns has been a challenge at times for Meta. Zuckerberg’s moves that have helped support the stock’s performance — job cuts, a $50 billion share buyback program, and Meta’s first-ever quarterly dividend — come as he has remained clear that the company’s spending will keep going up. The company said in a release Wednesday that it plans to increase capital expenditures “significantly.”\n\n“While we continue to refine our plans for next year, we currently expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025 as we invest to support our artificial intelligence research and product development efforts,” Meta said.\n\nThere are some early signs that the AI-focused products are gaining popularity, though not necessarily contributing to the company’s bottom line. Zuckerberg said that Meta’s chatbot, Meta AI, is on pace to become the most widely used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year. Eventually, he believes that every business will need one — if not multiple — AI-powered chatbots to handle customer service queries and interactions, he added Wednesday.\n\nDemand for Meta’s smart glasses, which are built via a partnership with EssilorLuxottica’s Ray-Ban, is outpacing the company’s ability to build them, Zuckerberg said.\n\nZuckerberg said in April that “smart investors” would see the long-term promises of artificial intelligence and metaverse technology, even if the financial returns are years away. Earlier this month, he told Bloomberg investing too much would be better than investing too little.\n\nWatch: Inside Mark Zuckerberg’s AI Era (Video)\n\n“I think that there’s a meaningful chance that a lot of the companies are over-building now, and that you’ll look back and you’re like, ‘oh, we maybe all spent some number of billions of dollars more than we had to,’” Zuckerberg said. “On the flip side, I actually think all the companies that are investing are making a rational decision, because the downside of being behind is that you’re out of position for like the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years.”\n\nMeta shares, which closed at $474.83 in New York, rose in extended trading following the results. The stock has risen 34% so far this year.\n\n(Updates with quotes from Zuckerberg on Meta’s earnings call)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow to Calculate the Value of an MBA ‘Dancing With Death’: What It’s Like to Dismantle a Ship Inside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter Scammers Target Middle East Influencers With Meta’s Own Tools The Miseducation of America’s Nurse Practitioners\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta's Reality Labs posts $4.5 billion loss in second quarter as former employees question its future",
        "content": "Meta (META)’s Reality Labs is still bleeding cash.\n\nThe division, which focuses on the company’s AR, VR, and metaverse initiatives, reported a loss of $4.48B in its Q2 earnings on Wednesday. Reality Labs revenue accounted for less than 1% of Meta’s total revenue.\n\nThe numbers come after Yahoo Finance reported last week that the multi-billion dollar losses at Reality Labs are the result of a lack of a clear vision, frequent restructuring, and leaders who don’t have AR and VR expertise.\n\nWe interviewed more than a dozen former Reality Labs employees who have been granted anonymity due to non-disclosure agreements and fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities. Since that report, more insiders have reached out to Yahoo Finance, confirming the details in the story and offering additional insight.\n\n“A few years ago I would have predicted that holographic AR would be possible before smart AI but now it looks like those technologies will actually be ready in the opposite order,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “We’re well positioned for that because of the Reality Labs investments we’ve already made.”\n\nLosses in the metaverse division have exploded in the last four years, even as Zuckerberg shifts his focus to AI. In 2020 Reality Labs lost over $6 billion. The unit sunk $10 billion in 2021, $13 billion in 2022 and $16 billion in 2023.\n\nIn June, Reality Labs laid off roughly 100 employees, according to two people familiar with the matter. The cuts included several vice presidents, managers, as well as dozens of employees in the research division and technology engineering teams. Insiders tell Yahoo Finance that several “big bets projects” were also canceled.\n\n“A software company is trying to get into hardware and doesn't know how to manage it,” said a former manager in engineering. “They’re getting ahead of themselves with product launches and work teams when they don't even know what the technology is yet.”\n\nMeta’s current hardware products on the market include its Quest 3 and Quest Pro headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses. In April it announced it would offer its operating system, Horizon, to external hardware companies.\n\nThe company has recently been teasing that its prototype augmented reality glasses is nearly ready to unveil. Referred to internally as \"Orion,\" Meta has thrown tens of billions of dollars at the nine-year-old project.\n\nHowever, some former employees who worked on the glasses question whether the company will ever release it to the public.\n\n“I would expect pretty substantial losses per device on the glasses,” a former engineer said. “Probably closer to the $1,000 per unit range, but it depends on what they end up trying selling them for and what features they end up including. They don’t even know if they’ll ever make them to sell.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2021, the metaverse became a buzzword following Zuckerberg’s announcement that his social media company, Facebook, would be renamed to Meta. Zuckerberg enthusiastically claimed that humanity would one day in the near future socialize, work, and play in a shared virtual world.\n\nHowever, recent data suggests the metaverse revolution may be dwindling. Research from consumer analytics firm, CivicScience, found that adoption and intent to purchase AR and VR headsets has plateaued this year.\n\nAccording to market intelligence firm, IDC Global, shipments of AR and VR headsets dropped some 67% year-over-year in Q1 2024. Meta’s market share has plummeted as others like Apple (AAPL) entered the scene, falling from 62% in Q4 2023 to 37% in Q1 2024.\n\n“With AR and VR, Meta came up with a solution when there never really was a problem,” said a former Reality Labs employee. “It’s not worth the amount of investment they’re putting into it. If they’re smart they’ll scale back to 10% the size of the operation they are now. Someone else can come up with the hardware and use Meta’s Horizon OS. That will make Zuck happier - being part of the Metaverse.”\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X @YasminKhorram and on LinkedIn.

        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) came out with quarterly earnings of $5.16 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.70 per share. This compares to earnings of $3.23 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9.79%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this social media company would post earnings of $4.32 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.71, delivering a surprise of 9.03%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nMeta Platforms , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry, posted revenues of $39.07 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.91%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $32 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nMeta Platforms shares have added about 30.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 14%.\n\nWhat's Next for Meta Platforms?\n\nWhile Meta Platforms has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Meta Platforms: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4.89 on $39.39 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $20.26 on $159.37 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Software is currently in the top 40% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Synchronoss (SNCR), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 6.\n\nThis mobile services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.07 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +125.9%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nSynchronoss' revenues are expected to be $43.09 million, down 27.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In July, most AI stocks entered a correction as the rotation into sectors such as homebuilders and banks gained momentum. Still, any pullbacks in these stocks present a buying opportunity. We are in the early innings of a new technological era that could continue for decades.\n\nNvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang calls this ongoing shift to accelerating computing the next industrial revolution. Bloomberg Intelligence research shows that generative AI will grow at a 42% compounded annual growth rate over the next 10 years. As AI proliferates through industries such as education, gaming and life sciences, it will spur an investment cycle in AI training and inference.\n\nThese three AI stocks are at the forefront of the generative AI infrastructure buildout. One is a key supplier enabling the buildout of AI data centers. The other two provide the semiconductors and networking infrastructure needed to accelerate computing for generative AI training and inference.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVertiv (VRT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Veritiv (VRTV).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs cloud service providers (CSPs) build out AI data centers to support large language model training and inference, Vertiv (NYSE:VRT) is well-positioned to benefit. It sells the entire critical infrastructure for data centers and has 50 years of experience in the industry.\n\nVertiv’s advantages are clear: instead of offering one-point products, it provides a comprehensive end-to-end solution. First, it offers thermal management solutions that include liquid cooling technologies. Secondly, its portfolio includes data center power management products like transformers, distribution units, busways and microgrid integration capabilities. These solutions, plus its IT systems, offer an integrated end-to-end solution for CSPs.\n\nAfter declining by over 15% over the past three months, Vertiv has become one of the interesting AI stocks to consider. After all, Q2 results highlighted the continued demand momentum across the business. Notably, this was another beat and raise quarter for Vertiv, as organic orders rose by 57% and organic net sales grew 14%.\n\nIn the quarter, adjusted operating margins hit 19.6%, a 510-basis points margin expansion. In response, the company raised its profit and free cash flow guidance for 2024. Now, management expects adjusted EPS between $2.47 – $2.53. Thus, using the low-end guidance, it trades at 31 times EPS, a fair multiple given the AI tailwinds ahead.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Exterior view of Nvidia's global headquarters in Santa Clara, California.

A significant portion is going towards building data centers powered by Nvidia chips. Nvidia is in a one-horse race because its Hopper and new Blackwell chips have a huge performance advantage.\n\nStory continues\n\nShifting the trillion-dollar installed base of traditional data centers to AI ones spells a multi-year tailwind for Nvidia. That’s why Bank of Americadoubled down on shares with a $150 price target. Analyst Vivek Arya notes that generative AI deployments are in the second year of a potential 3–5-year investment cycle.\n\nIts new Blackwell chips are already in production and will be on the market later this year. This increases Nvidia’s revenue visibility into next year. Moreover, the company is combining its Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, NVLink, Quantum, Spectrum, mix and switches, high-speed interconnects and CUDA ecosystem to offer a complete solution to customers.\n\nAs of this writing, NVDA stock is one of the bargain AI stocks after pulling back from $140 to $113. At a forward non-GAAP price-to-earnings of 41, NVDA is trading below its 5-year average of 47. That’s too cheap for a stock expected to grow revenues by 97% this fiscal year.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the AI chip race, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has emerged as the runner-up behind Nvidia. The company is the leader in the custom AI chip market. For instance, it has long worked with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) on its tensor processing units.\n\nDue to the growing size and complexity of large language models, companies are opting for custom-designed AI chips to lower costs. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has launched its Tranium and Inferentia chips, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has its Maia chip.\n\nToday, Broadcom counts Google as its largest customer, producing their TPUs. Besides, it’s already working with Microsoft and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) on custom AI chips. Considering Broadcom is the leader in custom silicon, this is a massive tailwind.\n\nAt the same time, its AI networking revenues are soaring. In Q2 2024, the company saw strong demand from AI data center clusters for its switches, network interface cards and optical interconnects. The combined demand for AI networking and custom accelerators drove a 280% YOY surge in AI revenues to $3.1 billion.\n\nConsidering this acceleration in AI revenues, Broadcom is one of the best AI stocks. In FY2022, AI revenues were 10% of semiconductor revenues or about $2.5 billion. In FY2024, management expects this percentage to exceed 30% with AI sales of $11 billion, a quadruple from FY2022. This revenue momentum will continue into FY2025, making AVGO stock a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled that an interest rate cut was close, while a slew of strong earnings from the technology sector also boosted stocks.\n\nGains in futures came following a strong session on Wall Street, after the Fed’s comments and some positive earnings sparked heavy buying into technology stocks. Wall Street also rebounded from a bulk of losses logged over the past week.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.6% to 5,588.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.9% to 19,678.50 points by 19:35 ET (23:35 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 41,141.0 points.\n\nFed says rate cuts are close, flags inflation progress\n\nThe Fed kept interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday, as widely expected.\n\nBut Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged progress in bringing down inflation and cooling the labor market- both factors which set the stage for a potential rate cut in September. Powell explicitly mentioned the possibility of a cut in September, although he noted that it was still contingent on positive data.\n\nThe Fed will have some inflation and labor market readings to consider before its September meeting. Markets are almost entirely pricing in a 25 basis point cut in September, according to CME Fedwatch.\n\nFocus is now on upcoming nonfarm payrolls data, due on Friday, for more cues on the labor market. The prospect of lower rates presents more liquidity for stock markets, which bodes well for valuations.\n\nTech rallies with Meta up front; Apple awaited\n\nTechnology stocks surged in aftermarket trade following positive earnings from Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). The stock rose nearly 7% after clocking stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings and also presenting a robust outlook.\n\nTech was also the biggest boost to Wall Street during the session, with major chipmakers rallying on the heels of strong earnings from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM). The two steadied in aftermarket trade after strong gains during the session.\n\nThe positive earnings helped investors largely look past middling results from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which missed estimates. Chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) also clocked weak earnings, sending its stock down 11% in aftermarket trade.\n\nTech earnings are set to continue with majors Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) set to report on Thursday.\n\nStrength in tech sparked strong gains in Wall Street on Wednesday. The S&P 500 surged 1.5% to 5,522.30 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rallied 2.6% to 17,598.79 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged on its limited tech exposure, rising only 0.2% to 17,598.79 points.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut tech stocks were still nursing steep losses over the past three weeks, as they were hit by a mix of profit-taking and as expectations of interest rate cuts sparked a pivot into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures surge on rate cut bets, strong tech earnings\n\nSingapore's Keppel HY profit rises on upbeat infra, connectivity performance\n\nArm stock dives 11% as slow AI gains lead to tepid outlook\n\nView comments",

        "content": "MENLO PARK, Calif., July 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Meta Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: META) today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Meta (PRNewsfoto/Meta)\n\n\"We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO. \"We've released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we're driving good growth across our apps.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n\nThree Months Ended June 30, % Change In millions, except percentages and per share amounts  2024 2023 Revenue $                  39,071 $                  31,999 22 % Costs and expenses 24,224 22,607 7 % Income from operations $                  14,847 $                    9,392 58 % Operating margin 38 % 29 % Provision for income taxes $                    1,641 $                    1,505 9 % Effective tax rate 11 % 16 % Net income $                  13,465 $                    7,788 73 % Diluted earnings per share (EPS) $                      5.16 $                      2.98 73 %\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Operational and Other Financial Highlights\n\nFamily daily active people (DAP) – DAP was 3.27 billion on average for June 2024, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Ad impressions – Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 10% year-over-year. Average price per ad – Average price per ad increased by 10% year-over-year. Revenue – Total revenue was $39.07 billion, an increase of 22% year-over-year. Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 23% year-over-year. Costs and expenses – Total costs and expenses were $24.22 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Capital expenditures – Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $8.47 billion. Capital return program – Share repurchases were $6.32 billion of our Class A common stock and dividend payments were $1.27 billion.

Headcount – Headcount was 70,799 as of June 30, 2024, a decrease of 1% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\n\nWe expect third quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $38.5-41 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 2% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\n\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\n\nWhile we do not intend to provide any quantitative guidance for 2025 until the fourth quarter call, we expect infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.\n\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $37-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $35-40 billion. While we continue to refine our plans for next year, we currently expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025 as we invest to support our artificial intelligence research and product development efforts.\n\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.\n\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\n\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\n\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\n\nDisclosure Information\n\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\n\nAbout Meta\n\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\n\nContacts\n\nInvestors:\r\nKenneth Dorell\r\ninvestor@meta.com / investor.fb.com\n\nPress:\r\nRyan Moore\r\npress@meta.com / about.fb.com/news/\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on April 25, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is July 31, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\n\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\n\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\n\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.

        "content": "Tech Stocks On Track For Best Session In 5 Months Ahead Of Fed Meeting; Small Caps Target Highest Close Since January 2022: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?\n\nTech stocks soared to their best session in five months on Wednesday, ahead of the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. This broad tech rally was propelled by a sharp rebound in chipmakers, buoyed by robust corporate earnings and easing concerns over chip export restrictions to China.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates at 5.25-5.50%, but market attention is fixed on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET, for any hints of a potential rate cut in September, which market participants have fully priced in.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 surged 2.7%, with 87 of its constituents in positive territory, led by Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), which jumped 11%. The tech-heavy index hasn’t experienced such a rally since February 2024.\n\nThe Biden administration is planning to introduce new regulations next month to restrict the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to Chinese chipmakers, with key allies like Japan, the Netherlands, and South Korea being exempt, according to Reuters.\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SOXX) soared over 5%, also marking its strongest session since late February 2024.\n\nThe S&P 500 also posted solid gains, rising 1.6%. Small caps, tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), increased by 1.1%, eyeing their highest close since January 2022. Blue chips climbed 0.7%.\n\nThe dollar eased 0.2%, weighed down by a disappointing July private employment report released earlier by the ADP. The Japanese yen, tracked by the Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (NYSE:FXE), rallied 1.4% following an overnight rate hike by the Bank of Japan.\n\nIn commodities, gold rose 0.7%, surpassing $2,400 per ounce, and silver climbed 1.4%. Oil prices surged 3% amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East following the assassination of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh by Israeli forces in Iran.\n\nBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) edged up 0.3%.\n\nWednesday’s Movers In US Major Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Nasdaq 100 19,306.28 2.7% S&P 500 5,523.20 1.6% Russell 2000 2,267.02 1.1 % Dow Jones 41,030.77 0.7%\n\nUpdated at 12:55 p.m. ET\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro data:\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 1.6% higher to $550.40. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.7% to $410.22. The tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust Series (NASDAQ:QQQ) fell 2.6% to $469.60. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) rose 1.1% to $224.09. Sector-wise, the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) outperformed, rallying 3.4%, while the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLV) lagged, up 0.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWednesday’s Stock Movers\n\nStocks moving on earnings were:\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc.

        "title": "What Are the Hottest Growth Stocks Right Now? 7 Top Picks.",
        "content": "Investing in growth stocks gives investors the opportunity to outperform major benchmarks like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. Growth-oriented firms regularly exhibit rising revenue. Some of these companies are narrowing their losses and look like they will become profitable soon. Other growth stocks are already profitable and continue to expand their profit margins on top of superb revenue growth.\n\nIt’s possible to find these companies if you know where to look. Ironically, you can start with any benchmark or ETF. Each index or ETF features assets that outperform the stock market. Roughly 150 companies in the S&P 500 have negative year-to-date (YTD) returns, indicating that the index is getting carried by successful stocks. Fewer than 300 stocks in the S&P 500 are up by more than 5% YTD.\n\nHowever, the hot growth stocks on this list are notable exceptions. Some of them have crushed the S&P 500 while others look ready to shine.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) continues to deliver solid growth rates due to its lead in the online advertising industry. The tech behemoth reported 14% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in the second quarter as total sales came to $84.7 billion.\n\nWhile ad revenue makes up the majority of total sales, investors should monitor Google Cloud as it makes up a larger percentage of total revenue. Cloud revenue totaled $10.3 billion and was up by 28.8% YOY, comprising 12.2% of Q2 of fiscal year 2024 revenue. Google Cloud is growing at a faster pace than ad revenue, and artificial intelligence tailwinds should strengthen that trend. The end result should be higher revenue growth for a company that has also strengthened its profit margins.\n\nAlphabet grew its net income by 28.6% YOY, resulting in a 27.9% net profit margin. The company continues to support a dividend and currently yields 0.47%. Shares are up by 21% YTD and have gained 183% over the past five years.\n\nGarmin (GRMN) Garmin company logo on a storefront\n\nSource: Karolis Kavolelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nGarmin (NYSE:GRMN) is a leading fitness brand that operates in several industries. The stock has outperformed the S&P 500 with a 40% YTD gain. Shares are also up by 134% over the past five years and trade at a 25 P/E ratio. Garmin currently offers a 1.69% yield and a low single-digit dividend growth rate.\n\nRecent financial results make the low P/E ratio look like a bargain. Revenue increased by 20% YOY to reach $1.38 billion. Net income jumped by 36% YOY to reach $276 million, resulting in a 20.0% net profit margin.\n\nStory continues\n\nFitness is the company’s most important segment. It grew at 40% YOY in the second quarter and made up roughly a quarter of the company’s total sales. The Outdoor segment makes up slightly more revenue than Fitness but only grew by 11% YOY. Garmin’s fastest growing segment, Auto OEM, logged a 58% YOY growth rate.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) has offered affordable products for more than 60 years. The iconic retailer has also delivered robust returns for long-term investors. Shares are up by 31% YTD and have soared by 91% over the past five years. The stock trades at a 30 P/E ratio and offers a 1.19% yield. Walmart’s  dividend growth rate has normally been slow, but this year’s 9% dividend hike suggests optimism for future hikes. It’s also Walmart’s 51st consecutive year of raising the dividend.\n\nThe company’s first quarter FY2025 results indicate that growth is still strong. Revenue increased by 6.0% YOY to reach $161.5 billion. A 21% YOY growth rate for global e-commerce sales and 24% YOY growth for the global advertising business contributed to mid single-digit revenue growth. Adjusted EPS increased by 22.4% YOY to reach 60 cents per share. Walmart is now sitting on $9.4 billion in cash. That’s after the company poured $1.1 billion into stock buybacks.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is gaining momentum in the AI chip industry. The tech giant generated a record $3.1 billion in sales for its AI products in the second quarter FY2024. Talks about a potential partnership with OpenAI only strengthen the case that Broadcom can become a leading AI chipmaker.\n\nThe AI industry is still in growth mode, so Broadcom’s efforts to gain market share can result in sizable returns for investors. However, that wasn’t the only good news from the earnings report. Revenue increased by 43% YOY to reach $12.5 billion, prompting the company to raise its full-year guidance.\n\nBroadcom’s 10-for-1 stock split brought more attention to the asset. However, it’s been outperforming the market for many years. Broadcom stock is up by 40% YTD and has gained 446% over the past five years. Also, AVGO offers a 1.38% yield and has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a leading social media giant that has 3.24 billion daily active users. Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp make it a juggernaut in the industry, and that trio has resulted in plenty of ad revenue.\n\nRevenue increased by 27% YOY while net income jumped by 117% YOY in the first quarter. The company continues to refine its bottom line and distribute additional profits as dividends and stock buybacks. Meta Platforms has what it takes to become a compelling stock for dividend growth investors, and its returns should make more investors intrigued. Shares have gained 36% YTD and are up by 149% over the past five years.\n\nProfit margins have been soaring in recent quarters. Meta Platforms logged a 33.9% net profit margin this quarter and looks poised to enhance its profit margins in the future. Wall Street analysts like what the stock has to offer. Meta Platforms is rated as a strong buy and has a projected 17% upside from current levels.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) continues to attract customers even as other restaurants face challenges. Inflation doesn’t have as much of an impact on Chipotle customers since they are looking for healthier food options. Healthy food comes at a premium, and few fast food restaurants offer the health and convenience of Chipotle chains.\n\nInvestors saw this dynamic on full display when the company reported Q2 earnings. Revenue increased by 18.2% YOY to reach $3.0 billion while diluted earnings per share jumped by 32.0% YOY. Chipotle opened 52 new restaurants this quarter and remains on track to open 285-315 restaurants this year. The restaurant chain also opened an international licensed restaurant.\n\nThe stock has cooled off a bit after its 50-for-1 stock split. Shares are down by more than 25% from their all-time high but are up by 13% YTD. CMG stock has more than tripled over the past five years. Wall Street analysts have rated the stock as a moderate buy with a projected 26% upside.\n\nIron Mountain (IRM) Iron Mountain (IRM) logo on truck\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) stores physical and digital data for more than 240,000 customers worldwide. The firm’s customer base includes 90% of Fortune 1,000 companies. The stock has delivered a 45% YTD gain and is up by 216% over the past five years. Iron Mountain has a 2.62% yield and a respectable dividend growth rate. However, it is a REIT which means your dividends are treated as ordinary income.\n\nThe firm benefits from high retention rates. It’s difficult for companies to switch to another company that protects and stores their digital data. It’s even more challenging for companies to use another competitor to store their physical assets. This formula for success resulted in 12% YOY revenue growth in the first quarter. Net income soared by 18% YOY to reach $77 million.\n\nIron Mountain affirmed its full-year guidance. Forecasts include 11% YOY revenue growth and an 8% YOY increase in AFFO per share. Iron Mountain is currently rated as a strong buy among five Wall Street analysts.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in GOOG and AVGO.

        "title": "Meta Investors Have Laser-Focus on Capex After Microsoft Letdown",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. investors will be hoping it can do a better job than Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. in convincing Wall Street that lofty spending on artificial intelligence will be worth it.\n\nWall Street is taking a more skeptical view of how much is being spent on AI by tech firms and when it will start to pay off in terms of improved growth and profitability. The Facebook parent already irked investors in April by hiking its spending forecast above estimates. Microsoft shares slid on Wednesday after it reported slower growth in its cloud computing unit and said capital expenditures would increase again in the next fiscal year.\n\n“The key question is whether Meta takes capex up even more,” said Denny Fish, who manages the $7.2 billion Janus Henderson Global Technology and Innovation Fund. “The demand environment is pretty good, revenue trends have been strong, and the valuation is still reasonable. However, it sold off last quarter, when things were pretty pristine except for capex, which shows you how much investors are concerned about this.”\n\nMeta, which reports on Wednesday after the close, has already shown some growth uplift from AI as the technology helps improve ad targeting on its social media products. It’s also adding new AI features to WhatsApp, including an AI assistant that can help businesses connect with customers, answer questions, and sell their goods and services via chat.\n\nBut investors may have less patience with Meta than other Big Tech names. The shares suffered two post-earnings blowups in 2022 as Meta stuck to its guns on its metaverse strategy, sinking billions of dollars into an unpopular virtual-reality vision. It turned that around in 2023 by proclaiming a year of efficiency marked by heavy cost cuts, and pleased Wall Street in January with a $50 billion buyback and its first-ever quarterly dividend.\n\nThe shares are up 31% this year, outperforming peers in part because of Meta’s relatively cheap valuation. Meta trades at about 21 times projected profits, well below the Nasdaq 100’s multiple of 25 times. Still, the stock has fallen recently amid a broader rotation out of the sector, and a misstep on spending could extend the selloff. Options data indicates an implied one-day move of about 8.8% — in either direction — after the results.\n\nAnalysts are expecting Meta to report $9.5 billion in capital expenditures this quarter, up around 50% from the year-ago period, while full-year capex is seen coming in at almost $38 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net earnings per share are expected to grow 59% this quarter, and revenue is forecast to rise about 20%.\n\nStory continues\n\nResults from other Magnificent Seven companies have highlighted the importance of capex numbers — and the need for firms to conclusively beat expectations. Alphabet shares dropped last week after the Google parent sunk more resources into AI, fueling higher spending than analysts expected. Microsoft shares slid in premarket trading on Wednesday after growth in the Azure unit disappointed.\n\nOf course, the focus of any spending may be as important as the amount. Bank of America analyst Justin Post wrote in a note that cost cuts in Meta’s augmented reality and virtual reality initiatives could “materially boost” investor sentiment, even if the savings are redirected toward spending on AI.\n\n“While investors have been constructive on AI investment spending and opportunity, we think there is little investor support for the magnitude of Reality Labs spending,” Post wrote, referring to the business division that includes the metaverse.\n\nMeta’s Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged concerns about spending in a recent interview on the Bloomberg Originals series The Circuit with Emily Chang.\n\n“There’s a meaningful chance that a lot of the companies are over-building now, and that you’ll look back and you’re like, ‘oh, we maybe all spent some number of billions of dollars more than we had to,’” he said. Still, over-spending is rational, he said, “because the downside of being behind is that you’re out of position for like the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years.”\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nMicrosoft Corp.’s Azure cloud-computing service posted a slowdown in quarterly growth, disappointing investors anxious to see a payoff from huge investments in AI. The shares fell in premarket trading. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. shares rallied premarket after the chipmaker gave an upbeat revenue forecast, underscoring that its new AI processors are boosting growth. Samsung Electronics Co. reported its fastest pace of net income growth since 2010 and said it plans to double output of the high-end chips fueling the artificial intelligence boom next year. The US is preparing to exclude semiconductor-equipment makers in the Netherlands and Japan from its latest round of restrictions targeting China, people familiar with the situation said, while warning the plans are fluid and may change. Shares in Tokyo Electron Ltd. and ASML Holding NV jumped. Intel Corp. plans to eliminate thousands of jobs to reduce costs and fund an ambitious effort to rebound from an earnings slump and market share losses. Pinterest Inc. warned that revenue in the current quarter will be lower than analysts’ predictions, sending shares plunging in premarket trading.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPremarket\n\nT-Mobile Autohome CDW CGI Entegris TTM Tech Postmarket\n\nMeta Platforms MediaAlpha Qualcomm Lam Research Fair Isaac Cognizant Ansys PTC Inc.

        "title": "Why Apple and other tech giants turned to dividends — ‘They’ve won’",
        "content": "Investors raked in record dividend payments last year, and more of Big Tech is joining the party. After helping drag the market to record highs, mega caps like Meta and Alphabet have joined fellow tech giants Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia in returning cash to shareholders. While dividends may be more commonly associated with traditional value stocks, rather than market darlings helping drive the A.I. boom, analysts said the move opens these stocks to new categories of investors—and utilizes cash that has few places to go.\n\nFacebook-parent Meta introduced a 50-cent dividend in February, which helped fuel a historic rally for the stock. Three months later, Alphabet followed suit with a dividend of 20 cents per share, sparking a 10% gain in the Google-parent’s shares.\n\nIn doing so, the companies finally joined the likes of Microsoft, which first declared a dividend in 2003, and Apple, which reinstated its quarterly dividend in 2012 after suspending it for 17 years. In the first quarter of 2024, the latter two companies were the third- and eighth-biggest dividend payers in the world, according to the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index.\n\nCompanies in growth-mode are typically focused on reinvesting in the business, not redistributing earnings back to shareholders, but CFRA Research’s Angelo Zino and Baird’s Ted Mortonson both said these dividend payments don’t represent a threat to future dominance.\n\n“I don’t view it as a problem,” Mortonson said. “I view it as they’ve won. They’ve won the technology side. They've won on the business-model side, and they're going to win on the Gen AI cycle.”\n\nMassive cash flows and few acquisition options make Big Tech dividends natural move\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven,\" a movie-inspired moniker that refers to Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, accounted for half of the S&P 500’s total gains last year, according to a report from Morgan Stanley. Amazon and Tesla—the latter an outlier in the group due to its much weaker profitability—are the only two members that do not pay a dividend.\n\nIn May, Nvidia increased its dividend by 150%, from $0.04 to $0.10, but only to make way for a 10-for-1 stock split that resulted in a quarterly payout of just $0.01. It's worth remembering the dividend yields for Big Tech remain quite low relative to the rest of the market. The average yield for a dividend-paying stock in the S&P 500 is about 2.3%, according to Barron’s. That’s well above the likes of Microsoft (0.73%), Apple (0.55%), Alphabet (0.47%) and Meta (0.42%), per Morningstar.\n\nStory continues\n\nZino noted these companies' payouts represent a marginal portion of their free cash flows, which together exceed $200 billion as of last quarter. With a collective cash balance of over $400 billion, including a whopping $162 billion at Apple, there's only so many ways for the tech giants to deploy it.\n\nOne option is massive share buybacks. Meta's and Alphabet’s dividend announcements came with $50 billion and $70 billion repurchase authorizations, respectively. Apple set the record for the largest buyback in U.S. history by repurchasing $110 billion of shares in May, topping the $100 billion mark it previously set in 2018.\n\nPotential acquisitions, however, appear to be drying up as Big Tech draws antitrust scrutiny. Widely expected regulatory hurdles, for example, might have scuttled talks over Google’s $23 billion bid for cybersecurity startup Wiz last week.\n\nSo, despite hefty investments in AI, there’s plenty to reinvest and then some.\n\n“They better pay a dividend,” Mortonson said of the tech giants, “because they’re going to be free cash flowing better than some countries.”\n\nBoth Mortonson and Zino noted paying dividends makes these Big Tech stocks eligible for inclusion in income and dividend funds, expanding their investor pools dramatically. The recent sell-off of tech stocks, meanwhile, could also make these companies more appealing to value-focused investors.\n\n“We see potential for them to significantly hike those dividends here over the next three years or so,” Zino said.\n\nFor investors seeking both eye-watering growth and consistent returns, it just might be a win-win.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.\n\nThe market also appears to be starting to get concerned about the ever-rising trend in AI-focused capital spending without a lot of visiblity and discussion on the part of management with respect to outlay's ROI, as we saw with the Alphabet earnings release. It will be interesting if the coming Microsoft quarterly release will produce a comparable reaction or something different.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+31.5% vs. +6.2%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 175 million monthly actives.\r\n\r\nMeta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern, an issue that we also we encountered with Alphabet recently. It will be interesting to see how the market will react to the latest capex numbers from Meta.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta here >>>)\r\n\r\nJPMorgan Chase’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past year (+33.5% vs. +30.4%). The company’s second-quarter 2024 results show a rebound in investment banking (IB) business. High rates, buyouts, opening branches and solid loan balance will aid net interest income (NII), though higher funding costs will weigh on it.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Zacks analyst estimates for NII (managed) and loans imply a CAGR of 1.8% and 3.8%, respectively, by 2026. While there has been a resurgence in deal-making activities, a complete revival will still take some time. So, the performance of the IB business is not expected to improve much.\r\n\r\nThe volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates will likely hurt fee income growth. Owing to these challenges, we expect non-interest income (managed) to rise in 2024 but decline next year. Mounting costs will hurt profits, and we expect it to rise 5.4% in 2024.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Applied Energetics have underperformed the Zacks Lasers Systems and Components industry over the past year (-44.5% vs. -34.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $269.19 million reported a sharp revenue decline in first-quarter 2024 due to contract modifications, increasing operating expenses and declining cash reserves.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, its reliance on government contracts and competition from established defense contractors, coupled with deficiencies in financial reporting controls, present significant challenges.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Applied Energetics expanded operations at the University of Arizona Tech Park, establishing a new Battle Lab, and increasing laser manufacturing capacity to support technology maturation and customer demonstrations. With 25 patents and more than $50 million invested in intellectual property, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing directed energy weapons and counter-UAS markets. Recent contracts with the USMC, Army and Navy validate AERG’s technology.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Applied Energetics here >>>)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nTech stocks led the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lower Tuesday as the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) closed at the lowest level since early June.\n\nIt was the fourth day the tech-heavy index lost 1.5% or more in the month of July, especially notable as there had not been any losses of that magnitude in the two prior months.\n\nAhead of June's Consumer Price Index reading on July 11, the Nasdaq 100 had been up 23% year to date. But after the CPI registered its first monthly drop in inflation since 2020, investors kicked off a stomach-churning rotation from large stocks into small.\n\nSince then, the Nasdaq has surrendered half those gains, sending many investors into relative shock upon learning that the laggard Russell 2000 index (^RUT) has nearly caught up to the volatile index known as home to the largest tech players.\n\n\"[I] didn’t have [the] Russell 2000 catching the Nasdaq 100 year-to-date on my bingo card to start this month. Getting close,\" wrote Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets and former NYSE floor governor.\n\nThe Russell 2000 is now sporting a better return this year than the artificial intelligence-fueled S&P Select Tech SPDR Fund (XLK) — and it's only a few points away from catching the S&P 500.\n\nIn the month of June alone, the Nasdaq outperformed the Russell 2000 by over 7 percentage points. Then, in July, the relationship violently inverted such that the Russell outperformed the Nasdaq by nearly 14 percentage points. It's the biggest month-to-month flip in leadership that we have data for, going back to 1988.\n\nThe narrative in the press followed the rotation as grave concerns over market concentration in the Magnificent Seven gave way to a small-cap miracle rally.\n\nTo be clear, sector rotation is a healthy feature of bull markets. When a leading group of stocks takes a back seat, other pockets of the market should take their place such that — at the index level — volatility is subdued. Extremes on either side average out.\n\nBut, given the speed and strength of the recent move, Wall Street is now assessing the damage to institutional portfolios.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley's derivatives team, \"volatility of the last two weeks started out being very rotational.\"\n\nHowever, as the move gained steam, institutions began reining in leverage (borrowed money) and reducing directional bets on stocks. \"What began as a de-grossing event has quickly turned more towards a shift in directional exposure to equities,\" the team continued.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of this, and there's still a Fed meeting later today and a Meta quarterly report to close July.

        "title": "Fed decision, BOJ, Microsoft, Meta Platforms - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- The Bank of Japan hiked interest rates earlier Wednesday, putting the focus on the Federal Reserve, which concludes its July meeting later in the session. Wall Street looks set to end the month on a positive note as investors digest earnings from the likes of Microsoft.\n\n1. BOJ hikes, and the Fed is next…\n\nThe Bank of Japan started the week’s central bank parade earlier Wednesday, raising interest rates and signaling its resolve to unwind a decade of massive monetary stimulus.\n\nThe Japanese central bank hiked its overnight call rate target to 0.25% from 0-0.1% by a 7-2 vote and laid out a detailed quantitative tightening plan that will reduce monthly bond buying in several stages to around Y3 trillion, half the current rough target, by early 2026.\n\nWednesday's rate hike comes amid some improvements in Japanese inflation over the past two months, especially as consumer spending improved on stronger wages.\n\nThis trend furthered the central bank’s forecast that inflation will climb to its 2% annual target sustainably, and that monetary conditions will have to tighten accordingly.\n\nIn the U.S., by contrast, a benign June inflation report has investors looking for the policymakers to lay the groundwork for a September rate cut.\n\nThe Federal Reserve concludes its July meeting later Wednesday, and is widely expected to maintain its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, as it has done since last July.\n\nFutures are fully priced for a quarter-point easing in September, with a small chance of a reduction of 50 basis points, and have 66 basis points of easing priced in by Christmas.\n\n2. Futures rise as investors digest corporate results\n\nU.S. stock futures rose Wednesday as investors awaited the conclusion of the latest Federal Reserve meeting while parsing through a series of important earnings reports.\n\nBy 04:10 ET (08:10 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 77 points, or 0.2%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 42 points, or 0.8%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 252 points, or 1.3%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve concludes its two-day policy meeting later in the session, and investors will be looking for clues over the timing and number of rate cuts to expect this year.\n\nThere are more earnings to digest Wednesday, including from Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) [see below] after the close. Other names set to release numbers include Boeing (NYSE:BA) before the bell, as well as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) and Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) later on.\n\nThis is the final session of July, and both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are on course to end the month lower, with the latter seen losing over 3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, on the other hand, is on track to finish the month higher by more than 4%, as the market rotated out of the major tech stocks into companies that are smaller and more cyclically oriented.\n\n3. Microsoft’s cloud growth disappoints\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointed with its fourth-quarter update after the close Tuesday, as the tech giant indicated it would spend more money on artificial intelligence infrastructure, even as growth slowed in its cloud business.\n\nThis offered another sign that the payoff from hefty investments in the technology may take longer than Wall Street had hoped.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud business, Azure, which is widely viewed as a barometer for AI demand, grew 29%, marking a slowdown from 31% growth seen in the previous quarter.\n\nAdditionally, AI-related growth accounted for about 8% of Azure's total growth, up from 7% in the third quarter.\n\nHowever, this came as Microsoft continued to ramp up investments, with capital spending jumping to $19 billion in the quarter, up from $14 billion in the prior quarter, and nearly double the $10.7 billion seen a year ago.\n\nIt wasn’t all bad news for the sector though, as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) increased its 2024 forecast for artificial intelligence chip sales by $500 million and said supplies would remain tight through 2025.\n\n4. Meta expected to see jump in revenue\n\nMeta Platforms is the latest of the mega-cap tech giants to release quarterly results this week, with the numbers due after the close Wednesday.\n\nMeta, which owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, among other products and services, is expected to report a 20% rise in quarterly revenue, helped by strong ad sales driven by the Olympics and elections in several countries.\n\nHowever, like fellow tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft, investors will want to see if the billions it is spending on tech infrastructure to support AI development is starting to yield returns.\n\n\"We remain positive on Meta and think Reels, Messaging and AI-driven ad improvements are still early, and could lead to positive product surprises and revenue upside,\" analysts at BofA Securities said.\n\n\"With political spend, and potential TikTok ban in 1Q'25, Meta could also see an ad spend benefit in 2H'24.\"\n\n5. Crude prices rise on elevated political tensions\n\nCrude prices soared Wednesday after the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran ratcheted up tensions in the Middle East, raising the prospects of a wider conflict hitting supplies.\n\nBy 04:10 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 1.8% to $76.08 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.7% to $79.38 a barrel.\n\nMultiple media reports said that Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike, and could mean a potential escalation in the Israel-Hamas war, which stretched into a ninth month in July.\n\nIt could also result in a resurgence in tensions between Iran and Israel, after a series of missile strikes between the two earlier this year, and furthered fears of an all-out war in the Middle East, especially after Israel carried out strikes against Lebanon-based, Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah on Tuesday.\n\nThis news has overshadowed data from the American Petroleum Institute showing on Tuesday that U.S. inventories saw a draw of nearly 4.5 million barrels last week.\n\nThe reading marked a fifth straight week of draws in U.S. inventories, as fuel demand remained underpinned by the travel-heavy summer season.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFed decision, BOJ, Microsoft, Meta Platforms - what's moving markets\n\nWorld Bank approves $1.5 billion in financing for Ethiopia\n\nBOJ Governor Ueda's comments at news conference\n\nView comments",

Furthermore, Q2 EPS is projected to soar 45% to $4.69 versus $3.23 a share in the comparative quarter.\n\nThis comes as Omnicom Group OMC, the largest advertising agency in the US was able to exceed top and bottom line expectations earlier in the month.\n\nNotably, Meta has surpassed earnings expectations for six consecutive quarters posting an average EPS surprise of 13.3% in its last four quarterly reports. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta AI & Metaverse\n\nAs ad spending continues to recover since the pandemic Wall Street will also be looking for updates on the contributions and outlook of META AI, an intelligent AI assistant offered across Meta’s apps including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\nSocial media peers such as Snapchat SNAP and Pinterest PINS have also expanded their services with AI assistants but Meta has stood out in its quest to expand into the metaverse. Like Wall Street, investors have had mixed opinions in regards to Meta’s spending on virtual and augmented reality to build out the metaverse with the company appeasing shareholders when it cut back on doing so.\n\nYTD Performance\n\nMeta’s stock has soared +27% year to date which has impressively topped many of its “Magnificent Seven” peers and the broader indexes while largely outperforming Snap’s -26% and Pinterest's -14%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMonitoring Meta’s Valuation\n\nAfter recently pulling back below $500 a share, META trades at 23X forward earnings which is on par with the S&P 500. It’s also noteworthy that META trades pleasantly below its decade-long high of 74.5X forward earnings and at a slight discount to the median of 25.1X during this period.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAfter such a sharp YTD rally, Meta Platforms stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Despite META trading at what has become a very reasonable valuation, the ability to reach or exceed Q2 expectations and offer positive guidance will be crucial to more upside.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Arm Holdings: Is the AI Stock a Buy Heading into Earnings?",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence theme has gripped the market over the last year, with many scrambling for exposure. Many AI-related stocks have soared, but the tide has turned recently, with several of the stocks at the forefront of the trade losing steam lately.\n\nInterestingly enough, we’ll hear from one of the companies involved in the theme, Arm Holdings ARM, on July 31 after the market’s close. Arm constructs, develops, and licenses high-performance, low-cost, energy-efficient IP solutions for CPUs, GPUs, NPUs, and other interconnected technologies.\n\nIn its short history, the company has delivered so far, posting results that have easily exceeded our expectations over the last year. Let’s take a closer look at how the company stacks up heading into the release.\n\nArm Holdings Posts Record Results\n\nArm’s quarterly releases have reflected favorable underlying business trends, with earnings and revenue in its latest release exceeding the high end of prior guidance. Shares have been volatile year-to-date, experiencing big post-earnings moves but overall up a staggering 80%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe favorable results were driven by record royalty revenue, with Armv9 (the company’s most advanced technology) penetration growing rapidly. In fact, revenue from chips based on Armv9 technology contributed around 20% of royalty revenue in the period, up from roughly 15% in the period prior.\n\nLicensing revenue throughout its latest period was also notably strong, driven by high-value contracts and snowballing demand for the company’s power-efficient technology for AI-related applications.\n\nThe company wrapped up the favorable release with a positive statement: 'We believe these fundamental trends will continue and we expect next quarter to also deliver strong year-over-year growth in revenue and profits.’\n\nAnalysts have agreed on the company’s bright outlook, with the $0.35 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for the quarter to be reported up nearly 10% since mid-May. Revenue expectations have primarily remained the same, however, with the company forecasted to post $907 million in sales. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIncreased penetration of Armv9 will be a key item to watch for the release, with licensing revenue also critical. All in all, the company appears ready to post strong quarterly results, but the recent broader weakness surrounding AI stocks could weigh on shares post-earnings if the results don’t wow the market.\n\nMeta Platforms On Deck\n\nMeta Platforms META, a partner of Arm Holdings, is also gearing up to unveil quarterly results this week on July 31 after the market’s close. The company faced pressure following its latest release due to the announcement of higher CapEx to accelerate its infrastructure investments for its artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors will look for more color on CapEx trends surrounding AI, which was also a focal point in Alphabet’s GOOGL quarterly release. Alphabet’s comments surrounding AI CapEx spooked some. Earnings expectations for META’s release have increased over recent months, with the $4.69 per share expected reflecting 45% Y/Y growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nValuation multiples for the tech giant have remained sound, with the current 21.3X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 31.5X. Meta Platforms currently sports a Style Score of ‘C’ for Value. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn investor favorite amid the AI frenzy, Arm Holdings ARM is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results. In its short history, the company's quarterly releases have lived up to expectations, regularly exceeding expectations and posting strong growth.\n\nArm is expecting another strong report, but the recent weakness among AI-related stocks could take hold post-earnings if the results don’t wow investors. Nonetheless, the stock remains a prime long-term selection for those seeking exposure to AI, with the company continuing to enjoy positive earnings estimate revisions across all timeframes.\n\nA partner of the company, Meta Platforms META, is also reporting quarterly results this week, with investors likely to focus heavily on AI CapEx as they did in Alphabet’s GOOGL quarterly release.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "US stock futures mixed before Fed; Microsoft drops on disappointing earnings",
        "content": "Investing.com-- S&P futures were flat and Dow futures fell in evening deals on Tuesday as investors hunkered down before a decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve, while disappointing earnings from Microsoft weighed on major technology stocks.\n\nBut Nasdaq futures rose, aided by a rebound in chipmaking stocks following stronger-than-expected earnings from AMD, which showed artificial intelligence still remained an earnings driver for the sector.\n\nS&P 500 Futures steadied at 5,476.75 points, while Dow Jones Futures fell 0.4% to 40,795.0 points by 19:39 ET (23:39 GMT). Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.4% to 19,021.0 points.\n\nMicrosoft cloud revenue misses estimates despite spending increase\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell more than 3% in afterhours trade after its fourth-quarter cloud revenue growth missed Wall Street estimates. The stock had fallen as far as 7%, but pared losses after it said on an earnings call that cloud growth would accelerate in the coming quarters.\n\nWhile the firm’s overall earnings just edged past estimates for the June quarter, revenue from Azure, the company’s cloud business, grew 29%, missing estimates of 30.2% and also slowing from the 31% rise in the prior quarter. This came even as investment in AI saw capital expenditure surge by $5 billion in the quarter.\n\nAzure is Microsoft’s main platform for its AI offerings, and serves as a barometer for demand for the sector. The Redmond, Washington-based tech giant is among the frontrunners on Wall Street to monetize AI, having tied up with OpenAI to release a slew of products over the past year.\n\nMicrosoft’s earnings sparked losses across most of its heavyweight tech peers, given that they came just a week after earnings from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) showed a similar trend.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), which are set to report earnings on Wednesday, fell 1% and 0.7%, respectively, while Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which will report earnings on Thursday, fell 0.5%.\n\nChipmakers rebound on strong showing from AMD\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) surged over 8%, while rival NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) added 5.4% after AMD clocked stronger-than-expected earnings and forecast upbeat revenue for the current quarter, citing strong demand from AI.\n\nAMD’s earnings sparked gains across chipmaking stocks. But they highlighted a potential division in AI-fueled earnings- where the suppliers of AI-related equipment appeared to be faring better than their customers, especially following Microsoft’s disappointing showing.\n\nStory continues\n\nA measure of bargain buying also aided chipmakers, after heavy losses on Tuesday and over the past two weeks.\n\nWall Street nurses losses with Fed on tap\n\nWall Street indexes ended lower on Tuesday as investors pivoted from tech and into more economically sensitive sectors amid caution over the Fed and major tech earnings.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep rates steady at the conclusion of a meeting on Wednesday. But any signals on its plans to cut rates will be closely watched, as recent inflation data fueled growing conviction the Fed will begin cutting in September.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.5% to 5,436.44 points on Tuesday, while the NASDAQ Composite fell 1.3% to 17,141.98 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, rising 0.5% to 40,743.33 points.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures mixed before Fed; Microsoft drops on disappointing earnings\n\nSamsung flags strong AI demand as second-quarter profit soars on higher chip prices\n\nEarnings call: TriMas Q2 2024 results show mixed segment performance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Top Research Reports for Microsoft, Meta &amp; JPMorgan Chase",
        "content": "Tuesday, July 30, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), as well a micro-cap stock Applied Energetics, Inc. (AERG). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nMicrosoft shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+13.4% vs. +11.1%). The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. \r\n\r\nProductivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million in the third quarter. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth. \r\n\r\nHowever, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.\n\nThe market also appears to be starting to get concerned about the ever-rising trend in AI-focused capital spending without a lot of visiblity and discussion on the part of management with respect to outlay's ROI, as we saw with the Alphabet earnings release. It will be interesting if the coming Microsoft quarterly release will produce a comparable reaction or something different.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+31.5% vs. +6.2%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 175 million monthly actives. \r\n\r\nMeta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern, an issue that we also we encountered with Alphabet recently. It will be interesting to see how the market will react to the latest capex numbers from Meta.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta here >>>)\r\n\r\nJPMorgan Chase’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past year (+33.5% vs. +30.4%). The company’s second-quarter 2024 results show a rebound in investment banking (IB) business. High rates, buyouts, opening branches and solid loan balance will aid net interest income (NII), though higher funding costs will weigh on it. \r\n\r\nAccording to the Zacks analyst estimates for NII (managed) and loans imply a CAGR of 1.8% and 3.8%, respectively, by 2026. While there has been a resurgence in deal-making activities, a complete revival will still take some time. So, the performance of the IB business is not expected to improve much.\r\n\r\nThe volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates will likely hurt fee income growth. Owing to these challenges, we expect non-interest income (managed) to rise in 2024 but decline next year. Mounting costs will hurt profits, and we expect it to rise 5.4% in 2024.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Applied Energetics have underperformed the Zacks Lasers Systems and Components industry over the past year (-44.5% vs. -34.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $269.19 million reported a sharp revenue decline in first-quarter 2024 due to contract modifications, increasing operating expenses and declining cash reserves. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, its reliance on government contracts and competition from established defense contractors, coupled with deficiencies in financial reporting controls, present significant challenges. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, Applied Energetics expanded operations at the University of Arizona Tech Park, establishing a new Battle Lab, and increasing laser manufacturing capacity to support technology maturation and customer demonstrations. With 25 patents and more than $50 million invested in intellectual property, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing directed energy weapons and counter-UAS markets. Recent contracts with the USMC, Army and Navy validate AERG’s technology.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Applied Energetics here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG), Sony Group Corporation (SONY) and Carrier Global Corporation (CARR).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

Weak Entertainment, Technology & Services and Games & Network segments remain woes.\n\nStrong Data Center Demand Aids Carrier's (CARR) Prospects\r\nPer the Zacks Analyst, Carrier is benefitting from a robust rise in organic orders and a significant increase in HVAC orders, driven by data center demand.\n\nInvestments to Benefit CMS Energy (CMS) Amid Rising Costs\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, investments will boost CMS Energy's grid upgrades. Yet rising costs for closure of solid waste disposal facilities for coal ash may hurt the stock.\n\nFactSet (FDS) Gains From Idacti Buyout, Competition High\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, the Idacti acquisition supports FactSet's ongoing initiative to digitally revamp its content collection infrastructure. Rising competition from other players is an overhang.\n\nExelixis' (EXEL) Cabometyx Strong Amid Stiff Competition\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, lead drug Cabometyx maintains momentum with continued label expansions and the pipeline development is encouraging. However, competition is stiff.\n\nNewell's (NWL) Productivity & Pricing Actions Boost Margins\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Newell has been gaining from strong productivity, pricing and favorable mix. These factors have been aiding margins. Gross margin rose 490 basis points in second-quarter 2024.\n\nCredit Sales, Receivables Growth Drive Bread Financial (BFH)\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Bread Financial is set to grow on credit sales growth driven by existing partners, as well as new product and brand partner additions. Yet, high expenses weighing on margin ail.\n\nNew Upgrades\n\nIntuitive Surgical's (ISRG) da Vinci System Helps Offset Risks\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, growing adoption of Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci system is driving its revenues as well as helping offsetting risks like supply-chain issues and rising costs.\n\nSolid Bookings & Fleet Expansion to Aid Royal Caribbean (RCL)\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Royal Caribbean is likely to benefit from robust booking trends, fleet expansion and digital initiatives. Also, strength in consumer onboard spending bodes well.\n\nEMCOR (EME) Banks on Solid US Construction Business, Buyouts\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, EMCOR benefits from strong mix and pipeline of projects in large and growing market sectors within the U.S. Construction business and recent buyouts.\n\nNew Downgrades\n\nLower Rig Count to Hurt Helmerich & Payne (HP)\r\nThe Zacks analyst believes that the fall in U.S. oil and natural gas rig count indicates a drop in future drilling services. This might erode Helmerich & Payne's revenues and cash flows.\n\nWeak Repairable Claims & Economic Woes to Hurt LKQ\r\nDecreasing repairable claims in North America along with economic softness in Europe are expected to clip LKQ's near-term sales and earnings, making the Zacks analyst bearish on the stock.\n\nHigh Rates, Weak Liquidity Position to Hurt Navient (NAVI)\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, high interest rates have limited the demand for Navient's refinance loan originations. Also, with high debt and limited liquidity, capital deployment plans seem unsustainable.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Christopher Jasper reports:\n\nBoss Guillaume Faury said Tuesday that disruption to supply chains at his own company and a safety and quality-control crisis at rival Boeing are having a knock-on effect for carriers relying on new fleets to deliver ambitious reductions in CO2 output.\n\nAir New Zealand said earlier it would drop the 2030 goal as delivery delays make it increasingly likely that less-efficient jets will need to be retained. At the end of March it had outstanding orders for five Airbus A320neo short-haul jets and eight Boeing 787 widebodies.\n\nMr Faury conceded that the move reflected “the broader situation of slower deliveries from the aircraft manufacturers. Replacing the old generation of planes with modern ones is a significant driver of CO2 reduction. And a slowdown in the ramp up has an impact on the speed of the replacement.”\n\nHe said that new aircraft typically reduce fuel burn and emissions by 20pc, rising to as much as 40pc when very old models are being stood down.\n\nAir New Zealand, which withdrew from the UN-backed Science Based Targets initiative, said efforts to reduce emissions were also being held back by the lack of availability – and cost – of sustainable aviation fuel.\n\nAirbus confirmed that it expects to deliver 770 airliners this year, down from an initial target of around 800, as suppliers struggle to meet demand for components including engines, seats, cabin trim and landing gear. The company has pushed back plans to lift A320 build rates to 75 per month by a year to 2027 as a result of the parts crunch.\n\nOperating profits at the company fell by more than half in the second quarter as its space business booked a charge of €989m against underperforming telecoms, navigation  and observation programmes, more than flagged in a profit warning last month. Faury said Airbus is evaluating all options for the division, including a restructuring or partial sale.\n\nStory continues\n\n07:23 PM BST\n\nNvidia slumps as Big Tech sell-off deepens\n\nUS chip giant Nvidia dropped 5.7pc today as investors waited with bated breath for a steer from tonight’s Microsoft results on how well artificial intelligence-focused companies are performing.\n\nThe sell-off of technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq index down 1pc.\n\nMicrosoft, widely seen as a frontrunner in the artificial intelligence race, will release its quarterly results at 9pm today.

Christopher Jasper reports:\n\nThe closure of the £500m Restoring Your Railway fund, announced by Rachel Reeves on Monday, leaves the future of projects across England and Wales hanging in the balance in a blow to small-town Britain.\n\nThe fund was established in 2020 as part of Boris Johnson’s “levelling up” agenda and has so far helped finance the reopening or near reopening of two lines and six stations. A dozen more projects are at an advanced stage and 20 others have received some funding.\n\nBriefing notes issued following the Chancellor’s speech, in which she claimed that Labour had inherited a £22bn hole in the public finances from the Tories, suggest that scrapping the Restoring Your Railway programme will save £76m next year.\n\nRailFuture, which campaigns for better passenger and freight services and has 20,000 members, said Ms Reeves’ intervention was “shortsighted” and at odds with Labour’s aim of putting infrastructure and construction at the heart of plans to revive the economy.\n\nRead the full story...

Melissa Lawford reports:\n\nAngela Rayner, the Deputy Prime Minister, will cut the capital’s housebuilding target from 100,000 homes per year to 80,000 as she tears up the Tory method for calculating housing need.\n\nMs Rayner plans to scrap the old system that placed a huge emphasis on building in cities, according to her draft National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) published on Tuesday.\n\nAlthough this will mean more houses are needed in many rural parts of the country, the demands on London are being cut in a move that will make targets easier to hit for Mr Khan, the capital’s Mayor.\n\nMs Rayner intends to restore councils’ mandatory targets after they were scrapped by the Tories, as part of Labour’s manifesto pledge to build 1.5m homes over the next five years.\n\nRead the full story...

Its stock is down 1.5pc.\n\nOther megacap stocks such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook-owner Meta, Alphabet and Tesla also fell, as investors refrained from big bets ahead of tech earnings scheduled through the week.\n\nAI favorite Nvidia slumped 6.2pc, leading a sharp erosion in chip stocks and pushing the Philadelphia Semiconductor index of 30 top US semiconductor companies down 2.9pc.\n\nLast week, results from Tesla and Google-owner Alphabet induced a broad-based market sell-off in the previous week.\n\nThe bar is set high for these highly valued technology behemoths, whose quarterly results will be scrutinised for signs they have the momentum to spur further AI-led equity rallies.\n\nBrian Klimke, chief market strategist at Cetera Investment Management, said:\n\nBig Tech has had a great rally and for it to continue, they’re going to have to show benefits of AI and the investments they made in it.\n\nIf not, we could see more of a rotation into smaller cap stocks and value stocks.\n\n05:17 PM BST\n\nPfizer lifts profit forecast on strong sales of cancer and heart drugs\n\nPfizer raised its annual profit forecast on Tuesday. Bits shares dipped 0.9pc this afternoon with investors unconvinced that over its future plans.\n\nIt was helped by cancer treatments acquired through a $43bn deal for Seagen and strong sales of its heart disease drug as the company deals with a sharp revenue drop from Covid products.\n\nThe market for Pfizer’s Covid vaccine and treatment has shrunk by billions of dollars a year.\n\nPfizer chief Albert Bourla responded with several acquisitions, including the Seagen deal and cost-cutting measures. The New York-based drugmaker has also sharpened its focus on cancer treatments.\n\nInvestors fled from Pfizer as Covid worries declined and the company’s shares are trading at around half their pandemic-era highs.\n\nJ.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott said he expects Pfizer’s stock to continue to trade in the current range due to limited revenue growth and stronger expectations for many of its rivals.\n\nHe said:\n\nWe believe stronger new launch performance and/or further progress on the pipeline will be necessary to significantly change the narrative.\n\n05:13 PM BST\n\nFacebook agrees $1.4bn settlement in privacy lawsuit\n\nFacebook-owner Meta has agreed to a $1.4bn (£1.1bn) settlement with Texas in a privacy lawsuit.\r\n\r\nThe tech giant is to pay out over claims that it used biometric data of users without their permission, officials from the US state said on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nKen Paxton, the Texas Attorney General, said the settlement is the largest-ever secured in a legal action by a single state. In 2021, a judge approved a $650m settlement with the company over similar claims in Illinois.\r\n\r\nFiled in 2022, the Texas lawsuit alleged that Meta was in violation of a state law that prohibits capturing or selling a resident’s biometric information, such as their face or fingerprint, without their consent.\r\n\r\nMeta, which made no admission of wrongdoing, said:\n\nWe are pleased to resolve this matter, and look forward to exploring future opportunities to deepen our business investments in Texas, including potentially developing data centers.

The top riser was Standard Chartered, up 5.9pc, followed by Burberry, up 3.7pc. The top faller was medical device company ConvaTec, down 5.8pc, followed by gambling group Entain, down 5.5pc.\n\nMeanwhile, the mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 0.9pc. The top riser was wealth manager St James’s Place, up 24.8pc, followed by sausage roll giant Greggs, up 5pc. The biggest faller was Ocado, down 6pc, followed by City firm Close Brothers, down 2.9pc.\n\n04:33 PM BST\n\nMicrosoft shares dip 1pc ahead of results\n\nMicrosoft shares have dipped this afternoon as investors wait for tonight’s financial results.\n\nThe software giant, with a market capitalisation of $3.1 trillion (£2.4 trillion), has benefited hugely from the hype around artificial intelligence.\n\nIts shares up more than quarter in the past year, with investors hopeful that it is able to translate its investments in AI into greater revenues at its cloud computing unit Azure.\n\nTed Mortonson, managing director at wealth management firm Robert W. Baird, said:\n\nMicrosoft has to beat in a big way and they’ve got to show Gen AI monetisation. [It is] the most over-owned name globally, next to Nvidia. So those two really have to put up some good numbers.\n\nAnd you’re going to have to see Azure accelerate ... to make it work.\n\n04:25 PM BST\n\nDrug giant’s sales in China cause shares to sink\n\nShares in the drug giant Merck plunged 10pc after shipments of its Gardasil vaccine in the important China market declined in the second quarter, sparking investor concerns.\n\nGardasil, which prevents cancer caused by the human papillomavirus, has been one of Merck’s top growth drivers aside from cancer immunotherapy Keytruda - the world’s top-selling prescription medicine - with much of its increase coming from demand from China.\n\nSales of the drug have more than doubled since 2020 and are expected to close in on $10bn (£7.8bn) this year.\n\nMerck said it was trying to determine the reason for the change in China, where it was seeing lower shipments from its distributor Zhifei to vaccination centers.\n\n04:22 PM BST\n\nWorld stocks mixed amid investor jitters, while commodities tumble\n\nWorld stocks are mixed in choppy trading today. Investors are jittery ahead of major corporate earnings reports and central bank moves - with the much-anticipated Microsoft rates out after 9pm tonight.\n\nMeanwhile, concern over the global economic outlook dented commodities and oil prices touched lows from early June.\n\nBrent Crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, fell 1.4pc as worry over Chinese energy demand outweighed any concern about tensions in the Middle East or Venezuela.\n\nCopper and iron ore prices were also lower, and aluminium fell to multi-month lows. It came after little by way of support from China’s Politburo, which at its July meeting announced no new detailed efforts to boost the economy.\n\nChris Scicluna, an economist at Daiwa Capital, said:\n\nChina has got its own problems and doesn’t look like it’s going to snap into gear.\n\nUnderstandably, we might have been hoping for the global economy to be gaining traction and momentum to be picking up ... but it looks like maybe things are coming off the boil a bit.\n\nThe MSCI World index dropped 0.3pc. However, the pan-European Stoxx 600 rose 0.5pc, and France’s Cac 40 and Germany’s Dax both rose 0.4pc. The FTSE 100 is down 0.2pc.\n\n04:10 PM BST\n\nUS job openings fall as high interest rates slowly cool a hot labour market\n\nUS job openings fell slightly last month, a sign that the American labour market continues to cool in the face of high interest rates.\n\nThere were 8.18m job vacancies in June, down from 8.23m in May, the US Labor Department reported this afternoon. The June number was stronger than expected: forecasters had expected 8m job openings.\n\nStill, the report showed other signs of a slowing job market. Employers hired 5.3m people, the fewest since April 2020 when the pandemic was hammering the economy.\n\nThe number of people quitting their jobs - a decision that reflects confidence in their ability to find higher pay or better working conditions elsewhere - slid to 3.3m, the fewest since November 2020.\n\nBut layoffs dropped to 1.5 million, lowest since November 2022 and down from 1.7 million in May, a sign that employers remain reluctant to let go of staff.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its meeting this week but to begin cutting them at its next gathering in September.\n\n04:05 PM BST\n\nUS consumer confidence edges up in July\n\nAmerican consumers felt more confident in July as expectations over the future rebounded.\n\nThe Conference Board, a business research group, said that its consumer confidence index rose to 100.3 in July from 97.8 in June.\n\nThe index measures both Americans’ assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months.\n\nThe July figure was slightly higher than market expectations, according to Briefing.com.\n\nDana Peterson, Conference Board chief economist, said:\n\nConfidence increased in July, but not enough to break free of the narrow range that has prevailed over the past two years.\n\nEven though consumers remain relatively positive about the labor market, they still appear to be concerned about elevated prices and interest rates, and uncertainty about the future ... things that may not improve until next year.\n\n03:57 PM BST\n\nInvestors ‘investors pile back’ into FTSE 250\n\nThe FTSE 250 has jumped by 1.2pc in trading today, as investors warm to the index - which contains UK-focused stocks.\n\nThe FTSE 100 is currently flat.\n\nChris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG, said:\n\nNews from Standard Chartered has helped provide some support to the FTSE 100, but fresh weakness for mining stocks and Diageo’s poor results have cast a shadow over the index.\n\nThe FTSE 100’s recent poor performance has seen its mid-cap cousin the FTSE 250 move further ahead, as investors pile back into UK-focused stocks despite the tough times ahead highlighted in the chancellor’s statement yesterday.\n\n03:54 PM BST\n\nYen weakens before Bank of Japan rate decision\n\nMarkets believe there could be an interest rate hike tomorrow by the Bank of Japan.\n\nThe Japanese central bank will announce its rate decision at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday. Markets are currently pricing in a 55pc chance of a 0.1 percentage point hike.\n\nThe yen weakened against the pound and the dollar ahead of the decision. It follows a significant rally this month that has seen the dollar lose around 4pc against the Japanese currency.\n\n“We’ve obviously had a very big move in the month of July,” said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies in New York. Traders “are probably cleaning up ahead of the events, and month-end flows are dominating today.”\n\nSome economists are also not convinced that the BOJ is ready to hike rates.\n\nJane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank, said:\n\nThe market certainly has been quite excited about a rate hike, but economists and Bank of Japan watchers are far less certain.\n\n03:47 PM BST\n\nWall Street drifts as profit reports keep pouring in\n\nAmerican stock indexes are drifting in quiet trading this afternoon as profit reports keep pouring in from big companies during Wall Street’s so-called earnings season.\n\nThe S&P 500 is down 0.1pc. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.4pc, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4pc.\n\nTrading on Wall Street has been relatively quiet so far this week ahead of profit reports from some of the market’s most influential companies. Microsoft will say how much it earned during the spring after trading ends this evening. Facebook-owner Meta, Apple and Amazon will follow in the coming days.\n\nThose four are among the small group of Big Tech stocks that drove the S&P 500 to dozens of records this year, in part on investors’ frenzy around artificial intelligence technology.\n\nBut they ran out of momentum this month amid criticism they have grown too expensive and expectations had run too high.\n\nLast week, investors found profit reports from Tesla and Alphabet underwhelming, which raised concerns that other stocks in what is known as the “magnificent seven” group of Big Tech stocks could also fail to impress.\n\nHelpfully for the market, other stocks rose up to cushion their fall, including smaller stocks and companies whose profits are closely tied to the strength of the economy.\n\n03:35 PM BST\n\nHanding over\n\nWith that I am going to head off and leave you in the capable hands of Alex Singleton.\n\nMy parting gift is this chart on the US national debt:\n\nLook how far America has come!#debt! 🎉 pic.twitter.com/QS5W6DKN7x\n\n— jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) July 30, 2024\n\n03:28 PM BST\n\nDrivers face longer wait for mis-selling compensation as review extended\n\nMotorists who may have been mis-sold loans will have to wait even longer for potential compensation after a lengthy extension to a regulatory review.\n\nOur reporter Michael Bow has the details:\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has extended an investigation into motor finance loans to May 2025 from an original deadline of September.\n\nThe watchdog is examining whether millions drivers may have been unfairly treated over the sale of loans used to fund the purchase of vehicles.\n\nSome have compared the issue to the PPI scandal.\n\nThe Financial Ombudsman Service upheld two complaints over so-called discretionary commissions paid to car dealers earlier this year, prompting action by the FCA.\n\nBanks like Lloyds have already booked a £450m provision while other lenders like Close Brothers have cut their dividend.\n\nUnder the new timetable, lenders can delay responding to complaints until December 2025.\n\nThe FCA said the chances of having to establish a full blown redress scheme were now more likely, leading to the timetable extension.\n\n03:08 PM BST\n\nThousands of reports of outages\n\nDown Detector, a website that tracks web outages, has received thousands of reports of Microsoft outages, which began at around 1pm UK time on Tuesday.\n\nThe productivity suite Microsoft 365, the Xbox Live gaming service, Minecraft servers and the Microsoft store all appear to have been affected.\n\nThe outage is ongoing, according to the website.\n\nIt comes as Microsoft is set to report quarterly results this evening.\n\n02:39 PM BST\n\nWall Street rises at opening bell\n\nThe main US stock indexes opened higher as cautious investors awaited Big Tech earnings later,\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 82.2 points, or 0.2pc, at the open to 40,622.13 ahead of jobs market numbers which could offer clues on the timing of interest rate cuts in the US.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 15.2 points, or 0.3pc, at the open to 5,478.73&ZeroWidthSpace;, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 53.9 points, or 0.3pc, to 17,424.1.\n\n02:37 PM BST\n\nMicrosoft suffers outage weeks after mass tech blowout\n\nMicrosoft has said it is investigating some outages on some of its Office applications and services weeks after an anti-virus update on some of its operating systems caused a global IT meltdown.\n\nThe tech giant, which reports its second quarter results after markets close on Wall Street later, tweeted that “multiple Microsoft 365 services and features” had been impacted.\n\nEarlier this month, 8m computers running on the Windows operating system crashed after the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike released a flawed software update.\n\nThe outage caused travel chaos and left some businesses unable to take payments.\n\nWe're currently investigating access issues and degraded performance with multiple Microsoft 365 services and features.

Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC - after they came under scrutiny following a number of high-profile collapses over the past decade.\n\nThe FRC said on Tuesday that audit results for BDO “declined significantly from 69pc to 38pc” in its annual review.\n\nIt added that rival Forvis Mazars’ results declined from 56pc to 44pc year-on-year.\n\n“Given their strategic importance to the audit market, both firms must urgently address the causes of these declines and undertake significant audit quality improvement plans which will be closely monitored by the FRC,” the regulator said.\n\nIt said it would work with the companies to monitor audit quality but could take “stronger action” if it fails to see improvements by next summer.\n\n01:40 PM BST\n\nRayner: I will force councils to build houses if they miss targets\n\nAngela Rayner has vowed to impose housebuilding plans on councils that refuse to meet new targets under a major overhaul of the planning system.\n\nOur politics live blog editor Jack Maidment has the details:\n\nThe Deputy Prime Minister said she “will not hesitate” to intervene in areas that don’t build enough as she released swathes of the green belt for development.\n\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, she unveiled sweeping planning reforms designed to unblock construction and deliver 1.5 million new homes by 2030.\n\nMs Rayner announced that she is re-imposing mandatory housing targets, which were scrapped by Rishi Sunak, and increasing them from 300,000 a year to 370,000 a year.\n\nRead on for details on the proposals.\n\n01:25 PM BST\n\nGas prices edge lower amid strong stockpiles\n\nGas prices have steadied as Europe’s ample stockpiles allays concerns about stronger global competition.\n\nDutch front-month futures fell 0.8pc to less than €34 per megawatt hour after rising more than 4pc on Monday.\n\nPrices have been rising amid increasing competition from Asia for liquefied natural gas (LNG) which Europe relies on more after Vladimir Putin halted Russian pipeline supplies following his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nFrank van Doorn, head of trading at Vattenfall Energy, said: “Europe has become more dependent on LNG, which means that if there’s anything happening in the LNG world — like extreme search and demand in Asia or upstream problems, for example — prices will react.”\n\nThe UK equivalent contract was down 1.3pc to less than 79p per therm.\n\n01:11 PM BST\n\nGerman inflation rises as economy shrinks\n\nGerman inflation edged higher at the start of the third quarter after its economy suffered a contraction in the three months to June.\n\nThe consumer prices index for Europe’s largest economy rose by 2.3pc in July, faster than the 2.2pc in the previous month and higher than economists’ predictions that it would be unchanged.\n\nGermany Inflation Ratehttps://t.co/AZNsXwF4x5pic.twitter.com/5uv8s2Dwro\n\n— TRADING ECONOMICS (@tEconomics) July 30, 2024\n\n01:03 PM BST\n\nPound inches down ahead of interest rate decision\n\nThe pound has edged lower against the dollar as investors look ahead to the Bank of England’s interest rate decision on Thursday.\n\nSterling traded down 0.1pc at $1.285, after having touched a near three-week low of $1.281 against the dollar on Monday.\n\nThe euro gained 0.2pc against the pound to 84.3p, with the common currency helped by data showing the eurozone’s economy grew slightly more than expected in the three months to June.\n\nTraders are pricing in a 58pc chance that the Bank of England will cut interest rates by 25 basis points from 5.25pc to 5pc on Thursday, with two cuts priced in by the end of the year.\n\nIt comes as prices in British shops rose at the joint-slowest rate since October 2021 this month, held down by falls in the cost of non-food items, according to the British Retail Consortium.\n\nJane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank, said: “If we just go back week or two ago, the market was thinking 50:50 chance of a rate cut but economist surveys are more confident that there will be a move this week.”\n\n12:41 PM BST\n\nScottish drinks maker boosted by surging Irn-Bru demand in England\n\nGrowing demand for Scottish soft drink Irn-Bru among English customers has helped boost sales for owner AG Barr.\n\nThe company, which owns a string of drinks brands including Rubicon and is based in Cumbernauld in Scotland, said sales of its soft drinks increased by about 7pc this year.\n\nIt expects to report total sales of about £221m for the six months to the end of July, 5pc higher than the prior year.\n\nAG Barr said that sales of Irn-Bru, the sparkling soft drink launched in Scotland more than a century ago, were higher in terms of both value and volume - meaning it sold more than a year ago.\n\nIt also said Irn-Bru was growing its share of the soft drinks market in England as the brand, badged Scotland’s “other national drink”, grows in popularity across the border.\n\nThe company launched a new advert for the drink linked to the Scotland men’s football team qualifying for the Euro 2024 tournament, which it said had been “highly successful”.

That is indicated by the results of the Ifo Business Climate Index in July.\n\nKathleen Brooks, research director XTB, said: “Germany is once again the sick man of Europe.”\n\n11:37 AM BST\n\nDemand for zero-alcohol Guinness surges among teetotal Gen Z\n\nNon-alcoholic Guinness sales have doubled in Europe amid surging demand from teetotal Gen Z drinkers.\n\nMelissa Lawford and Hannah Boland have the details:\n\nGuinness 0.0 now accounts for 3pc of all global Guinness sales after consumption doubled across Europe in the year to June, according to maker Diageo’s preliminary results.\n\nDebra Crew, chief executive of the distiller, said: “We literally cannot make enough of it. It is flying off the shelves.”\n\nGuinness 0.0 was launched in 2021 and in the last six months has become the UK’s top selling non-alcoholic beer.\n\nRead how, despite the strong Guinness sales, it was a tough year for Diageo.

whoever wins the White House in November, the chief executive of global bank Standard Chartered said.\n\nOur reporter Michael Bow has the details:\n\nBill Winters said he expected the new US administration’s “hawkish” approach to stay in place for next four years, with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump likely to maintain the same foreign policy of the last eight years.\n\n“The Biden administration has been very hawkish on China, with the combination of trade restrictions and sanctions and the Trump administration was also hawkish on China,” he said.\n\n“Whoever wins this election, Harris or Trump is likely to continue to be hawkish on China.”\n\nThe US presidential run-off in November is likely to pit Harris against Trump after President Biden announced he would not run again.\n\nStandard Chartered is based in the UK but its clients are based in Asia, leaving it more exposed to rising US-China tensions.\n\nMr Winters said the bank had swerved any fall-out from the chilly relationship so far, saying the services offered by the bank benefited from China having to “open up”.\n\n11:06 AM BST\n\nOil prices fall amid doubts over China demand\n\nIn energy markets, oil prices hit seven-week lows amid doubts over demand from China.\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, was down 0.2pc to less than $80 a barrel amid worries over the health of the world’s second largest economy.\n\nUS-produced West Texas Intermediate was down 0.2pc to less than $76.\n\nChina suffered a slowdown in growth in the three months to June, falling to the worst pace in five quarters, as faltering consumer spending undermined a boom in exports.\n\nSteve Clayton, head of equity funds at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Traders are struggling to see anything other than a fully supplied market for crude in the months ahead, suggesting that major producers are going to need to show supply restraint if prices are to make any sort of meaningful recovery.”\n\n10:52 AM BST\n\nFoxtons sales and lettings revenue rises\n\nLondon’s largest estate agent continued the recovery in its share price as it said profits targets remain on track.\n\nFoxtons said it is on course to deliver its medium-term target of £25m to £30m adjusted operating profit amid a turnaround that has seen its share price rise 72pc over the last year.\n\nBritain’s largest letting agency by share of instructions increased revenue by 11pc to £78.5m as its lettings, sales and financial services businesses all delivered growth.\n\nPre-tax profits rose 24pc to £7.5m, boosting its shares by 2.3pc today.\n\nChief executive Guy Gittins said:\n\nDespite macro headwinds and the election interruption, we continued to outperform the market, delivering strong sales revenue growth of 28pc and market share growth of 30pc.\n\nGrowth was also delivered in lettings, with a double-digit increase in new business volumes, further bolstered by the acquisitions we made in 2023.\n\n10:26 AM BST\n\nEurozone recovery means to need to rush interest rate cuts, say economists\n\nThe European Central Bank will be in “no rush” to cut interest rates after official data showed the eurozone economy grew faster than expected, according to economists.\n\nJack Allen-Reynolds of Capital Economics, said:\n\nThe eurozone’s recovery continued at a decent pace in Q2 and it should get a small boost from the Paris Olympics in Q3.\n\nBut the bigger picture is that the timeliest surveys are fairly weak and we expect the economy to undershoot consensus forecasts over the next few years.\n\nIn the third quarter, we think that the Olympics will add about 0.2pc to France’s GDP, raising eurozone GDP by 0.04 percentage points.\n\nBut that boost will disappear in the fourth quarter and the latest surveys suggest that underlying growth prospects are subdued.\n\nJuly’s PMIs were surprisingly weak and the European Commission’s economic sentiment indicator, published this morning, was some way below its long-run average too.\n\nTogether with the better-than-expected second quarter growth number, this will reinforce ECB policymakers’ view that there is no rush to loosen monetary policy significantly.\n\n10:15 AM BST\n\nEx-BT boss Jansen hired as WPP chairman\n\nWPP has appointed former BT boss Philip Jansen as its new chairman as the advertising giant grapples with the rapid rise of artificial intelligence.\n\nOur reporter James Warrington has the details:\n\nMr Jansen, who stepped down as BT chief executive in February after five years in the role, will join the WPP board in September.\n\nHe will take over as chairman in January, succeeding Roberto Quarta, who has led the ad group for almost a decade.\n\nIt comes at a critical time for WPP, which has restructured its sprawling network of agencies and has embarked on a heavy cost-cutting plan.\n\nThe London-listed group is also contending with the impact of AI on advertising and is planning to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on the new technology.\n\nDuring his time at BT, Mr Jansen oversaw radical cost-cutting that included a plan to slash 55,000 jobs from the business.

YouTube’s advertising revenues improved 13% year over year to $8.7 billion.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Meta Platforms, Inc. Revenue (TTM)\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. revenue-ttm | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\n\nMeta Platforms’ focus on improving ad ranking and measurement by leveraging AI has been a key catalyst driving advertisers’ return on investment. \r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for advertising revenues in Asia-Pacific is pegged at $7.546 billion, indicating growth of 17.3% in the second quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for advertising revenues in Europe, the United States and Canada, and the Rest of the World is pegged at $8.78 billion, $16.89 billion and $4.52 billion, indicating 20.8%, 19.5% and 23.5% growth, respectively.\n\nClick here to know how Meta Platforms’ overall second-quarter performance is likely to be.\n\nMETA Leveraging AI to Boost Growth\n\nMETA has been leveraging AI and machine learning to boost the potency of its social-media offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Threads. Effective usage of AI has been helping the company keep its users engaged. AI-driven feed recommendations have been a key catalyst. \r\n\r\nHowever, rising expenses related to investments in developing more advanced models and AI services are expected to keep margins under pressure. The Reality Labs business continues to burn cash, which doesn’t bode well for META’s near-term prospects.\r\n\r\nThe company, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is expected to have benefited from Instagram’s growing popularity in international markets, particularly in Asia. Much of it can be attributed to the growing popularity of short-form videos, Reels on Instagram. \r\n\r\nReels have been attracting Gen-Z to the platform amid competition from Snapchat, X and TikTok. AI has helped in improving recommendations, which drove a more than 40% increase in time spent on Instagram.\r\n\r\nThreads growth has been noteworthy for Meta Platforms. The company has been focusing on the retention of users, which is expected to have benefited user growth.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ commitment to prioritizing user safety and well-being through initiatives aimed at enhancing parental supervision, messaging privacy and time management on its platforms. These factors are expected to have driven user base growth in the second quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nFamily Daily Active People or DAP, defined as a registered and logged-in user who visited at least one of the Family products (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger or WhatsApp) on a given day, is expected to be 3.26 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Do the Estimates Say?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.69 per share, up 0.64% over the past 30 days and indicating 45.2% year-over-year growth. \r\n\r\nIt expects total revenues between $36.5 billion and $39 billion for the second quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nThe consensus estimate for second-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $38.27 billion, indicating growth of 19.59% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nUpcoming Earnings to Watch For\n\nMeta Platforms belongs to the Zacks Internet Software industry.

        "title": "Meta to report second quarter earnings with ad sales, AI spending top of mind",
        "content": "Facebook and Instagram parent Meta (META) reports its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, and the company’s AI spending and advertising business performance are set to take center stage.\n\nAI spending is a key measure for Wall Street as investors anxiously await a return on Big Tech’s investments in the technology. During its prior quarter, Meta CFO Susan Li raised the company’s full-year total expense estimate from between $94 billion and $99 billion to between $96 billion and $99 billion.\n\nFor the second quarter, Meta is expected to report earnings per share of $4.74 on revenue of $38.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Meta saw earnings per share of $2.98 on revenue of $31.9 billion during the same period last year.\n\nThe company’s Family of Apps revenue, which includes revenue from Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, is expected to come in at $37.7 billion, up from $31.7 billion in Q2 last year. Like Google, Meta could get a lift from advertising surrounding this year’s election as well as the Olympics. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg during an appearance at SIGGRAPH 2024 in Denver, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“Meta heads into its Q2 earnings in a position of strength,” Forrester VP and research director Mike Proulx said ahead of the company’s earnings announcement.\n\n“Expect to hear continued growth in Reels as Meta’s short-form video solution cuts into TikTok’s market share. And while Threads has proven it can go head-to-head with X, whether it can effectively monetize or not remains a question,” Proulx added.\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill offered a similarly positive outlook for Meta, writing in an investor note that the firm’s intra-quarter checks have continued to remain bullish on the social media giant’s growth.\n\n“Most of the experts we spoke with noted healthy ad budgets with 'strong' Meta spend growth, albeit some starting to see impact of tougher [comparisons],” Thill said.\n\nWhile Meta’s advertising revenue looks set for strong performance, that doesn’t mean that every aspect of the company’s earnings report will be positive. Wall Street is still trying to determine how much longer tech companies will need to plow money into AI before they see some kind of revenue payoff.\n\nLast week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Meta’s latest open-source large language model (LLM) called Llama 3.1. What’s more, the Facebook founder said the industry should focus on open-source AI rather than closed-source models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\n“AI remains the dominant focus for Meta as the battle of the LLMs is just getting started,” Proulx said. “Expect mentions of ‘the metaverse’ or Horizon Worlds to be little to none during the earnings call.”\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking of Meta’s Reality Labs segment, analysts are anticipating the business to generate revenue of $376 million, up from $276 million in the same period in 2023. Still, Reality Labs continues to hemorrhage cash.\n\nIn Q1, Meta reported that the segment, which is tasked with developing the hardware and software meant to power Zuckerberg’s metaverse dream, lost some $3.8 billion. The division has also been plagued by turnover and a lack of clear vision, adding to Reality Labs’ troubles, Yahoo Finance’s Yasmin Khorram reported.\n\nMeta’s announcement also comes after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced on Tuesday that he secured a $1.4 billion settlement between the state and Meta over the company’s alleged use of Texans’ biometric data without their permission for its Tag Suggestions feature.

        "title": "Google’s antitrust defense could benefit from the threat of SearchGPT",
        "content": "The new risk Google faces from AI challengers could play a role in the ultimate outcome of a landmark antitrust trial where a judge must decide whether the tech giant illegally monopolized online search.\n\nThe trial, brought by the Justice Department and a group of US states, centers on the government’s argument that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) illegally blocked rivals from competing. Google claims it came to dominate search because its service was better.\n\nBut even as the company waits for a ruling from US District Court Judge Amit Mehta, fresh threats to its preeminence are emerging via new ways of searching the web.\n\nThese threats could improve Google’s odds of lessening any consequences if Judge Mehta does find it liable for breaking competition law, according to antitrust experts.\n\n\"If a violation is found, Google will say the market is already solving itself,\" George Washington University antitrust law professor William Kovacic said. Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai departs federal court last October in Washington DC, after testifying in the antitrust case against his company. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nJust last week Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI debuted a new prototype search engine called SearchGPT and positioned it as a new means of searching the web — a potential threat to Google's long-standing search dominance.\n\nMicrosoft's Bing also has generative AI features powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT, as well as its Copilot and Prometheus software.\n\nGoogle, for its part, offers generative AI capabilities in its AI Overviews — its latest search product powered by its Gemini model. The company also offers its LaMDA, T5, PaLM, and GLaM models. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. His company debuted a new prototype search engine called SearchGPT and positioned it as a new means of searching the web. (Photo by Jason Redmond / AFP) (Photo by JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) (JASON REDMOND via Getty Images)\n\nOther new ways of searching the web are offered by AI-fueled large language models (LLMs), like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, introduced in November 2022, and Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine designed using multiple LLMs that attracted major funding from Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang.\n\n'Market developments are already solving the problems'\n\nNew search options won't necessarily help Google's defense of its past behavior, but they could significantly soften a punishment if the US government and states prevail in their antitrust trial.\n\nThat's because Google would have an opening to argue during a separate phase of the trial that any anticompetitive problems identified in the complaint no longer exist, or have dwindled.\n\nThe argument Google can make to the judge is \"'you don’t have to do a lot here, because the development of new products, new technology, the emergence of competitive alternatives means that market developments are already solving the problems identified,'\" Kovacic said.\n\nStory continues\n\nBakerHostetler’s antitrust and competition practice leader, Carl Hittinger, agreed that market changes that open up more options for consumers could work in Google's favor. Amit Mehta, left, acting as an attorney before the New York State Supreme Court in 2012. He now is the judge overseeing the Google antitrust case. Photo: DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images) (DON EMMERT via Getty Images)\n\n\"If consumers move over to another product, if they have that option and they can, then there's no anticompetitive harm there,\" Hittinger said.\n\nOn the other hand, the judge may not view SearchGPT and emerging search platforms as direct Google Search competitors since, for now, those products are not pre-installed as defaults across a variety of devices.\n\nOne of the key factors for the judge to consider in crafting a remedy, Hittinger said, is what's in the public interest.\n\n'It's an awesome responsibilty'\n\nThe government has yet to say what precise remedy it desires should it prevail.\n\nRemedies can include injunctive relief, such as controls on a company's future conduct, or structural relief, like requiring divestitures.\n\nFederal rules also allow Google to ask Judge Mehta to reopen the case, prior to his decision, in order to consider new material evidence. And even if an injunction is issued, new and material evidence can be brought into court to request that it be amended.\n\nIf Google is found liable, it is expected to appeal the case. That could come with a request from Google to table the remedies phase until the case has made its way through the appellate system.\n\nKovacic predicted that the governments will prevail on at least some of their claims, and said no matter what the outcome, Judge Mehta's decision is consequential.\n\n\"You can imagine how hard of an issue this is for the court,\" Kovacic said. \"Holding the fate of the entire search sector — it's an awesome responsibility.\"\n\nThe Google antitrust trial is the most prominent since another landmark case in the 1990s that eventually forced Microsoft (MSFT) into a settlement that opened its computer operating system to competitors in the early 2000s. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates pictured in 2001, the year his company agreed on the framework for a settlement in the government's marathon antitrust case against the software giant. Photo by HENNY RAY ABRAMS/AFP via Getty Images (HENNY RAY ABRAMS via Getty Images)\n\n'The landscape changes'\n\nIt remains to be seen what the antitrust trial and new rivals in the search business will mean for Google and its parent, Alphabet.\n\nCertainly a lot is at stake. In 2023, Google's search advertising business generated more than $175 billion in revenue.\n\nCoupled with Google's YouTube ads and Google network revenue, advertising accounted for a staggering $237 billion of the company's $307 billion in total revenue.\n\nBut the new marketplace threats to Google’s search empire still have a ways to go to unseat the leader.\n\nSo far, LLMs and rival search platforms haven’t radically changed how most internet users search the web. Bing gained about 1% of the search market share since the launch of Copilot, but Google still holds more than 90% of it.\n\nHittinger, who represented AT&T in another landmark antitrust case that ended in a breakup of the telecommunications giant in the 1980s, said changes in technology tend to impact difficult antitrust cases.\n\n\"While you're deciding the case, the world moves on and the landscape changes,\" he said.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "My Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Just Proved Again Why It's the Best Buy of the Group",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" has been a dominant group in the market over the past few years. It's made up of:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nMy top Magnificent Seven stock to buy just reported its latest results, and they were outstanding. However, the market didn't reward the stock, and it's down alongside the rest of the group. Is this a buying opportunity for one of the best stocks on Wall Street? I think so.\n\nAlphabet's business is rising steadily\n\nMy favorite stock in the Magnificent Seven right now is Alphabet. Over the past year, Alphabet has posted some excellent results and is starting to perfect its artificial intelligence (AI) product offering.Additionally, its advertising segment (which accounts for around three-fourths of all revenue) is doing well for how mature the business segment is. In the second quarter, sales rose 11% year over year to $64.6 billion. W\n\nWhile some investors may be concerned that this growth isn't nearly as quick as it needs to be for Alphabet to stand out, I don't view it that way. Alphabet's ad segment is a reliable business that creates massive cash flows for the company, allowing it to invest in next-generation technology like AI. It also funds the growth of another vital segment: Google Cloud.\n\nGoogle Cloud is the smallest of the big three cloud computing players. This size disadvantage can be traced back to Google's late entry into this market, but it's still growing quickly. In Q2, revenue grew 29% year over year to $10.3 billion. It also posted an operating margin of 11%, which is still far behind what industry leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) delivered in the first quarter with a 38% margin. Once Google Cloud reaches scale and improves its operating margin to similar levels, this segment will provide a meaningful profit boost, although that is still some years away.\n\nAltogether, Alphabet's quarter was solid, with revenue growing 14% year over year and earnings per share (EPS) rising from $1.44 to $1.89. It was hard to find a fault in the quarter, but it was also difficult to find a \"wow\" moment.\n\nThe stock fell 5% the day after trading, dragging the rest of the market down with it. But I think this pullback is a mistake and provides investors with an opportunity to get into the stock, now that it's down around 10% from its highs.\n\nUnlike its peers, the stock doesn't have an expensive premium\n\nFor the most part, the Magnificent Seven stocks are incredibly pricey when compared to the broader market. However, Alphabet doesn't have the same premium, so investors don't have as much risk on the table by investing in Alphabet. After the pullback, Alphabet's stock trades for 23 times forward earnings.\n\nStory continues GOOG PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile that only retraces its valuation to a few months ago, it prices it in the vicinity of the broader S&P 500 index, which trades at 22.7 times forward earnings. When you buy Alphabet stock at these levels, you're essentially buying an above-average company for a market-average price. That's a great deal, and investors should take advantage of it.\n\nThrough Alphabet's consistent revenue growth, expanding dividend, and aggressive share repurchase programs (Alphabet repurchased over $15 billion in stock during Q2), it's a shoo-in for a company that can grow earnings faster than 10% annualized. That's a fantastic investment proposition, and it's one that investors need to understand.\n\nYou don't have to hit a home run every time you invest. Sometimes, the steady growers that can outperform the market by a couple of percentage points each year are the best investments, and I think Alphabet falls into this category.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By Yuvraj Malik\n\n(Reuters) - Meta Platforms is expected to report a 20% rise in quarterly revenue, helped by strong ad sales driven by the Olympics and elections in several countries, but investors will want to see if its spending on AI is starting to yield returns.\n\nThe social media giant, like its tech rivals Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft, is spending billions on tech infrastructure to support AI development. In April, Meta's upward revision in full-year expenses shaved off nearly $170 billion from its market capitalization in a single day.\n\nAlphabet's warning last week that capital expenses would stay high this year, overshadowed a jump in ad sales and pushed its stock down.\n\nMeta is betting on an open-source approach for its generative AI push. The company released its mostly free Llama 3.1 artificial intelligence model last week, and said developers can use and modify its AI models free of charge.\n\nIt has burnished its ad-buying products with AI tools and introduced new AI features such as a chat assistant to drive engagement on its social media properties. On Monday, it said it would roll out a new tool called AI Studio that would allow users to create, share and design personalized AI chatbots.\n\n\"We are bullish on Meta's position as a key pillar of open-source AI,\" Jefferies analysts said, adding that the company could potentially unlock new revenue streams by licensing its AI models or creating AI apps.\n\nMeta shares have risen 32% this year, compared with a near 16% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nThe company will also need to show its bread and butter ad business is thriving when it reports second-quarter results on Wednesday.\n\nGroupM, one of the world's largest media buying firms, raised its 2024 global advertising growth forecast to 7.8% in June, from 5.3% in December, which augurs well for Meta.\n\nSmaller ad-dependent companies Pinterest and Snap are scheduled to report results on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\n\"We remain positive on Meta and think Reels, Messaging and AI-driven ad improvements are still early, and could lead to positive product surprises and revenue upside,\" analysts at BofA Securities said.\n\n\"With political spend, and potential TikTok ban in 1Q'25, Meta could also see an ad spend benefit in 2H'24.\"\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Shounak Dasgupta)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Obama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year Returns. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks in former U.S. president Barack Obama's portfolio.\n\nFormer United States President Barack Obama took office during one of the worst recessions in U.S. history, yet the stock market reached new highs during his tenure. Stepping into office in 2009, the year after stocks plummeted nearly 40% amid the financial crisis of 2007-2008, Obama made a remarkably well-timed market prediction. On March 3, 2009, just days before the S&P 500 hit an intraday low of 666 and a closing low of 676.53, the then-president stated, \"What you're now seeing is profit-and-earnings ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you've got a long-term perspective on it.\" By the time he left office on January 20, 2017, the S&P 500 had soared to 2,263.69, reflecting a gain of about 225% since his predictive remark.\n\nThe \"Obama Years\" coincided with rapid technological advancements that significantly impacted the stock market. Apple Inc.'s iPhone, introduced less than two years before he took office, exemplified this era of innovation. In addition, during Obama's presidency, billionaire Reed Hastings transformed Netflix Inc. from a DVD rental-by-mail company into a video-streaming giant, revolutionizing entertainment consumption. On the other hand, renewable energy, particularly solar energy, struggled during the president's tenure. Despite the administration's solar subsidies, investors were largely disappointed as those subsidies eventually faded. First Solar Inc., one of the largest U.S. solar equipment producers, saw its stock plummet by as much as 74% due to falling solar panel prices, making it the worst-performing S&P 500 stock of the Obama era.\n\nHow Did the Obamas Make Their Money?\n\nFrom speaking at events worldwide to writing memoirs and signing a major production deal with Netflix, the Obamas have led a busy and highly lucrative life post-White House. Michelle Obama's first memoir, \"Becoming,\" published in November 2018, became that year's No. 1 best-selling book. Her second book, \"The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times,\" also achieved bestseller status. Similarly, Barack Obama's latest memoir, \"A Promised Land,\" sold nearly 890,000 copies within 24 hours of its November 2020 release. These ventures, along with the six-figure pension that all former presidents receive, have significantly boosted the Obamas' net worth, which is at least $70 million according to the International Business Times. The New York Post, however, estimates their fortune to be much higher, at $135 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, Barack Obama’s income isn’t limited to speaking fees and pensions. Like many other wealthy individuals, he has invested significantly in the stock market. So what does his portfolio look like? When he took office in 2009, Obama, like all presidents, was required to make financial disclosures by law. At that time, Obama held $200,000-$450,000 in the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares that tracks the S&P 500 index, according to a report by CBS News.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThese investments were selected from the top holdings of the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares, one of Barack Obama's primary investments during his presidency, according to official disclosures. We have provided each stock's trailing 10-year returns to assess their performance over the decade. Data from approximately 919 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024 was also analyzed to determine the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each firm.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple, our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy picks 14 small and large-caps every quarter and it has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNote: The stocks are sorted in ascending order of their trailing 10-year returns.\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 246\n\nTrailing 10-Year Returns: 23.14%\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the elite stocks in the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares (NASDAQ:VFINX) that Barack Obama held stakes in during his time in office.\n\nIn the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported a 27% increase in revenue, reaching $36.5 billion, with a significant 97% of this revenue generated from ads. Looking ahead to 2024, Meta's ad revenue is projected to grow by 17%. Reels, which has been showing strong performance and engagement recently, experienced a 20% ad load in the first quarter, up from 16.2% in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe social media giant has been drawing attention for several reasons. For example, BMO Capital has maintained its Market Perform rating for META following an interview with Instagram Head Adam Mosseri. The interview revealed that Instagram is boosting performance bonuses for content creators and underscored the potential need for new revenue streams within the app. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing a shareholder lawsuit against Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), led by Amalgamated Bank, which alleges misleading information about user data misuse in 2017 and 2018.\n\nConversely, Mizuho analysts have raised concerns about potential challenges for META stock in a recent research note, despite maintaining a bullish stance. Mizuho is particularly worried about possible announcements during the upcoming July earnings call. They expect the CEO to discuss increased capital expenditures (capex) for AI and metaverse initiatives, which could be negatively received by investors.\n\nIn the March quarter of this year, Insider Monkey’s data indicated that 246 out of the 919 hedge funds tracked had purchased and held shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Among these, Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners emerged as the largest stakeholder, with a $5.58 billion investment in the company.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META): Meta was a top contributor in the quarter following fourth quarter earnings results in which the company reported accelerating revenue growth and expanding margins driven by a rebound in online advertising and strong user growth. On February 2nd, Meta reported 4Q23 revenue of $40.1 billion (+25% y/y up from +23% in 3Q23) and EPS of $5.33 (+203% y/y), and the midpoint of 1Q24 revenue guidance was $35.8 billion (+25% y/y), all well ahead of investors’ expectations. The company reported impressive revenue acceleration in its core advertising businesses, including new products like Reels and Threads. Advertiser adoption of Meta’s AI targeting tools helped drive strong ROI and higher spend across multiple categories.\n\nMETA owns multiple social media platforms, each with more than one billion users, has an 81% gross margin, and generated $44 billion of FCF in 2023. Both its Facebook and its Instagram franchises have more than 2 billion Daily Active Users and generate the bulk of the company’s revenue. Recently, the company’s short form video offering, Reels, and public text-sharing app, Threads, achieved mass user engagement and growing advertiser adoption which have helped return the company to strong revenue and free cash flow growth. Even after the recent stock price advance, META shares trade at 20x Wall Street’s consensus estimates for 2025 EPS, estimates that we think could prove to be too low.”\n\nOverall META ranks 7th on our list of former U.S. president Barack Obama's portfolio stocks. You can visit Obama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year Returnsto see the other stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Analysts at Barclays said in a note Tuesday that the recent sell-off in several tech stocks has been excessive, presenting a buying opportunity for selective investors.\n\nThe current market environment, characterized by numerous potential catalysts such as central bank decisions and major earnings reports, has created significant volatility. However, Barclays believes that certain tech stocks remain strong.\n\n\"Fundamentally, we remain positive Tech on account of potentially strong EPS growth,\" wrote the bank.\n\nAccording to Barclays, the market is bracing for a \"catalyst-bonanza\" this week, with key economic data, decisions from the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan, and earnings reports from around 40% of the S&P 500's market cap.\n\nThey state that this has caused short-dated volatility to trade at a premium. Despite this, \"owning optionality does not appear particularly onerous\" given the alignment with historical volatility patterns.\n\nBarclays is optimistic about the tech sector's potential for strong earnings per share (EPS) growth, despite the recent downturn driven primarily by positioning and technical factors.\n\nThe analysts state, \"Selectively buy the dip: The recent Nasdaq sell-off was, in our view, mostly driven by positioning/technicals. However, fundamentally we remain positive Tech on account of potentially strong EPS growth.\"\n\nBarclays has identified three tech stocks that stand out based on their screening criteria, which include the severity of the selloff over the past month and muted earnings-related implied moves.\n\nThe stocks are Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX). These stocks, according to Barclays, offer potential upside powered by upcoming earnings.\n\nWhile the broader market remains volatile, Barclays' analysis indicates that the selloff in these specific tech stocks may have been overdone, presenting a timely opportunity for investors to potentially benefit from a rebound.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBarclays says sell-off in these 3 tech stocks has gone too far\n\nWall St set for muted open on cusp of Big Tech results, Fed verdict\n\nWSJ investigation uncovers alarming flaws in Tesla's Autopilot leading to crashes\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – July 30, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nMagnificent 7 Earnings Preview: Can Investors Buy Tech Now?\n\nGet ready for some action this week in the stock market as four of the Magnificent 7 tech giants — Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple —gear up to report their quarterly earnings.\n\nThese tech titans have been the primary drivers of this year’s return, pushing the market to new heights. But with the recent bout of market volatility, the big question remains: Is now the time for investors to dive into tech stocks?\n\nHere, we will explore the broader picture of the sector and potential outcomes of these quarterly earnings reports and try to figure out if any or all of them are worthy additions to investor portfolios at current levels.\n\nStrong Earnings Growth… But AI Concerns Loom\n\nLast week, following the quarterly report from Alphabet, investors started to grow cautious. Concerns about overinvestment into AI infrastructure and its ability to generate profits moving forward have been the main cause of selling over the last week.\n\nManagement’s comments about Capex regarding AI will be an important talking point for all these stocks.\n\nAlong with weakness in Alphabet, Semiconductor stocks and the other Mag 7 stocks have experienced considerable selling. But are these concerns overblown? I think they may be, and with another quarter of impressive growth likely coming, and reasonable valuations from the group, this dip could be a buying opportunity.\n\nAmazon is expected to post a 63.64% year-over-year increase in earnings to $0.54 per share, with revenue projected at $140.88 billion, driven by robust AWS and North American retail operations. Apple, despite a slight revenue dip to $81.64 billion, is forecasted to achieve earnings of $1.19 per share, bolstered by its services and wearables segments.\n\nMeta Platforms anticipates a significant earnings jump to $3.04 per share, a 45% jump and $31.05 billion in revenue, fueled by strong ad revenue and user engagement. Microsoft is projected to deliver $2.72 per share in earnings and $62.03 billion in revenue, reflecting Azure's impressive performance and continued strength in Office and LinkedIn.\n\nOverall, the Mag 7 is expected to bring in +26.8% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.7% higher revenues.\n\nValuations: Amazon and Meta are Relatively Cheap\n\nLooking at the valuations of these tech giants we see a spectrum of results. Although they are broadly trading at reasonable levels, two of them look much more appealing than the others.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms stands out with a free cash flow (FCF) yield of 4.1%, above its 10-year median of 3.2%, making it particularly attractive. Amazon too boasts an FCF yield of 2.6%, above its 10-year median of 1.8%.\n\nApple, on the other hand, has a FCF yield of 3%, which is below its 10-year median of 5.7%, indicating it may be pricier relative to its historical norm. And Microsoft shows a similar trend with an FCF yield of 2.2%, below its 10-year median of 3.6%.\n\nUncertainty Into Year End but Forecasts are Strong\n\nI think it may be a bit of a crapshoot buying these names ahead of earnings, but the reasonable valuations and secular tailwinds these companies enjoy make them compelling buys if they sell off further following the reports.\n\nCritical to the performance of these stocks through the end of the year is investors' perception of AI. Can these companies turn a profit in their new AI products? The answer is probably yes, but shareholders want to see hard evidence.\n\nAnother worthy consideration is the setup in the broader market and the approaching US Presidential Election. Big tech has been carrying the market higher all year, and it may be time for a pause in this run. Additionally, as the election approaches so does the perceived uncertainty, and investors may rotate into defensive sectors until after it concludes.\n\nHowever, it is hard to understate the long-term growth catalysts at these big tech companies – they are almost all expected to grow earnings faster than the market, which will drive even higher stock prices in the coming years.\n\nAny pause they take now, or in the coming months, is likely an opportunity to acquire shares in these generational assets.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Meta (META) Q2 Earnings Report Preview: What To Look For\n\nSocial network operator Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) will be reporting earnings tomorrow after the bell. Here's what to look for.\n\nMeta met analysts' revenue expectations last quarter, reporting revenues of $36.46 billion, up 27.3% year on year. It was a mixed quarter for the company: Meta delivered solid revenue, operating profit, and EPS growth, which beat analysts' estimates. That was driven by more daily active users than expected and 6% year-on-year growth in average ad prices. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter missed analysts' expectations and it took up its forecasted operating expenses and capital expenditures for the full year.\n\nIs Meta a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Meta's revenue to grow 19.7% year on year to $38.31 billion, improving from the 11% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $4.78 per share. Meta Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Meta has only missed Wall Street's revenue estimates once over the last two years, exceeding top-line expectations by 1.7% on average.\n\nLooking at Meta's peers in the consumer internet segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Netflix delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 16.8%, meeting analysts' expectations, and Coursera reported revenues up 10.8%, topping estimates by 3.5%. Netflix traded down 1.5% following the results while Coursera was up 45.1%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Netflix's results here and Coursera's results here.\n\nInvestors in the consumer internet segment have had steady hands going into earnings, with share prices up 2% on average over the last month. Meta is down 8.1% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $532.7 (compared to the current share price of $464).\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "content": "Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve starts its latest policy-setting meeting, while investors look forward to more corporate earnings, particularly from the important tech sector. BP has already impressed with its second-quarter numbers.\n\n1. Fed starts policy-setting meeting\n\nThe Federal Reserve starts its July policy meeting later in the session, and after a benign June inflation report, investors after looking for the policymakers to lay the groundwork for a September rate cut.\n\nThe U.S. central bank concludes its latest meeting on Wednesday, and is widely expected to maintain its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, as it has done since last July.\n\nInvestors are looking for signals about when and how many rate cuts may occur this year, and will therefore be intently following any policy guidance issued by the central bank, as well as the post-meeting press conference with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nFed officials have repeatedly stated that they are looking for more evidence that inflation is steadily returning to 2% before cutting rates, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated earlier this month that the central bank may not wait until inflation reaches this target before cutting rates.\n\nFutures are fully priced for a quarter-point easing in September, with a small chance of a reduction of 50 basis points, and have 66 basis points of easing priced in by Christmas.\n\n2. Futures edge higher with corporate results in focus\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Tuesday as investors awaited the start of the latest Federal Reserve meeting as well as key corporate earnings.\n\nBy 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 60 points, or 0.1%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 12 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 35 points, or 0.2%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is set to start its two-day policy meeting later in the session, and investors will be looking for clues over the timing and number of rate cuts to expect this year.\n\nThe main earnings release Tuesday will be from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) after the close, but there will also be results from the likes of Merck (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Procter&Gamble (NYSE:PG) before the open, as well as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) post closing bell.\n\nSo far, more than 40% of the S&P 500 companies have reported their results with 79% posting earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to LSEG.\n\n3. Microsoft’s Azure sales in spotlight\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) releases its quarterly results after the close Tuesday - the first of a series of numbers from the tech giants this week, including Facebook-parent Meta (NASDAQ:META) on Wednesday and then both Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors will be looking to see if sales in Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing business have picked up enough to justify the billions of dollars being spent on artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nThe software behemoth is expected to report that Azure's growth stayed steady quarter-over-quarter at about 31% between April and June, according to data from Visible Alpha, helped by its tie-up with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft's capital spending likely surged about 53% year-over-year to $13.64 billion in the period, according to 16 analysts polled by LSEG. A big step up from the $10.95 billion in expenditure it recorded in the previous quarter.\n\nShares of Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell sharply last week after the company reported a quarterly capital spending that exceeded estimates by nearly $1 billion, while the revenue boost from AI integrations remained modest, sparking a selloff in major tech companies.\n\n4. BP (NYSE:BP) lifts its dividend after Q2 results\n\nBP (LON:BP) released impressive second-quarter results earlier Tuesday, resulting in the energy giant raising its dividend after beating profit forecasts.\n\nBP reported an underlying profit of $2.76 billion for the second quarter of the financial year, up from $2.59 billion in the same quarter in 2023, and slightly higher than the $2.72 billion it earned in the first three months of the year.\n\nThe oil major generated substantial cash flow of $8.1 billion, enabling it to lower net debt to $22.6 billion as well as raising its dividend by 10% and announcing another share buyback, worth $1.75 billion, for the last quarter.\n\n“Our decision to increase our dividend by 10%, and extend our buyback program commitment to 4Q 2024, reflects the confidence we have in our performance and outlook for cash generation,” said CFO Kate Thomson.\n\n“We are maintaining a disciplined financial frame and remain committed to growing value and returns for BP.”\n\nAt 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), BP shares rose 2.5% to £4.65, trading largely flat year-to-date.\n\n5. Crude prices remain weak\n\nCrude prices steadied Tuesday, traded near two-month lows on continuing concerns about demand in China, the world's largest crude importer, while traders shrugged off the risk of conflict escalating in the Middle East.\n\nBy 04:00 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.1% to $75.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $79.09 a barrel.\n\nTraders were seen pricing out a risk premium from crude after media reports said Israeli officials were not seeking all-out war with Lebanon in their retaliation for a rocket strike that killed 12 in Israel-occupied Golan Heights.\n\nCrude prices are trading near two-month lows amid persistent concerns over slowing demand, especially in top importer China after last week’s weak growth data.\n\nThat said, the Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, pledged at the end of its July meeting to pursue a \"proactive\" fiscal policy, suggesting more stimulus ahead.\n\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets later in the week to discuss output levels, although recent weakness in crude is likely to see the cartel downplay any plans for scaling back production cuts.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFed meeting, Microsoft earns, BP dividend - what's moving markets\n\nBank of Korea board split on rate cut timing amid hot housing market, minutes show\n\nNew UK government cuts billions of pounds of spending to fix 'unsustainable' finances\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell on Tuesday, reversing a rebound from the prior session as sentiment remained on edge before interest rate decisions from the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve in the coming days.\n\nChinese markets continued to lag their peers, with local benchmarks hitting six-month lows as concerns over a slowing economic recovery showed few signs of easing.\n\nRegional markets took middling cues from Wall Street, which ended flat on Monday as caution over the central bank meetings kept investors from making big bets.\n\nU.S. stock index futures fell in Asian trade ahead of Wednesday’s Fed rate decision, while a slew of heavyweight technology earnings were also in focus.\n\nJapanese stocks sink amid uncertainty over BOJ\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 index fell 0.9% as did the broader TOPIX, amid uncertainty over the BOJ’s upcoming rate decision.\n\nAnalysts were largely split over a potential rate hike by the BOJ, following some mildly positive readings on inflation in the past two months. But underlying inflation- which is a key factor for the BOJ’s rate decisions- remained well below the bank’s 2% annual target.\n\nForecasts for the BOJ meeting ranged from a hold to a hike of 10 or 15 basis points.\n\nBut apart from the rate decision, uncertainty also persisted over the BOJ’s plans to begin tapering its quantitative easing programs. The bank had said it will elaborate on its plans during its July meeting.\n\nAn end to QE heralds less support for Japanese stock markets, with the BOJ set to taper down its asset purchases.\n\nChina stocks test 6-mth low, PMIs awaited\n\nChina’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively, with both indexes at their lowest levels since early-February. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slid 1.2% to an over three-month low.\n\nChinese stocks saw an extended rout through July as concerns over a slow economic recovery were exacerbated by middling signs on stimulus from Beijing.\n\nUncertainty over what the trajectory of the U.S. presidential race, with regards to U.S.-China trade relations, also kept traders averse to Chinese markets.\n\nFocus this week is squarely on a string of purchasing managers index readings from China, which are set to offer more cues on Asia’s largest economy.\n\nBroader Asian markets retreated, with technology stocks dropping in anticipation of earnings from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) later this week.\n\nSouth Korea’s KOSPI lost 1%, while Taipei shares of TSMC (TW:2330), the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, shed 1.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAustralia’s ASX 200 fell 0.8%, retreating before a consumer price index inflation reading for the second quarter. Monthly CPI indicators through the quarter herald a strong reading on Wednesday, which gives the Reserve Bank more impetus to keep rates high, or even potentially hike further.\n\nFutures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a negative open, after the index clocked wild swings in recent sessions as it struggled to make new highs above 25,000 points.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks sink as BOJ, Fed meetings approach; China shares hit 6-mth low\n\nAustralia's government on alert to support airline Rex as it hits turbulence\n\nBHP and Lundin Mining boost copper access, to buy Filo for $3.25 billion\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Another chance for mega tech to impress investors\n\nThis week the megacaps get another chance to prove themselves when Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Apple (AAPL?) all report second-quarter earnings.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) got the reporting party started on Tuesday after-the-bell to little fanfare. Disappointing results from both those names led to a general selloff on Wednesday, which saw the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite clocking their worst performance since 2022. Weakness was obvious in Tesla's results, which missed earnings per share expectations by 9 cents and saw auto revenue slip 7% year over year.[1] On the other hand, Alphabet handily beat expectations on both the top and bottom line, but it was worse-than-expected YouTube advertising revenue that caused investors to punish the stock.[2] Alphabet shares took another leg lower on Thursday when OpenAI announced the prototype of its search engine, SearchGPT. As a result of these early earnings results, other mega-cap tech names such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta and Apple fell in sympathy.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MCD.\n\nThe markets climbed their way out of the trenches late last week, boosted by a better-than-expected gross domestic product report which saw the U.S. economy expanding by 2.80% [3] and the June Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCEPI) that showed inflation continuing to ease.[4] Despite that, many tech names ended the week lower, with Meta, Microsoft and Apple down approximately 2% for the week, Nvidia falling 3% and Alphabet down nearly 6%.\n\nThe bar was set high coming into the second-quarter season with little room for error for corporations releasing results. Despite the recent rotation out of tech, many of these names still have very rich valuations and investors want to see they are justified by strong fundamentals. Thus far, the trend of investors rewarding positive surprises less than usual and punishing negative surprises more than usual remains in play.\n\nAccording to FactSet, the current consensus for S&P 500 EPS growth is for 9.80% year over year, an increase from 9.70% last week.[5] Thus far 78% of companies that have reported have surpassed analyst profit estimates, while only 60% have beaten on revenues.[6]\n\nSecond peak week\n\nThis week marks the second peak week of the second-quarter earnings season with nearly 2,500 companies anticipated to release results. All eyes will be on mega tech once again, as Microsoft reports on Tuesday, Meta on Wednesday and Apple and Amazon on Thursday, all after the close.?\n\nStory continues Will the Next Batch of Tech Earnings Encourage Investors to Rotate Back In?\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nOutlier earnings dates this week\n\nAcademic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.[7]\n\nThis week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their second-quarter 2024 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. Ten companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, eight of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those names are F5 Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV), McDonald's Corp. (NYSE:MCD), IDEX Corp. (NYSE:IEX), Meta Platforms, Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA), The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY), Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) and Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). The two names with positive DateBreaks Factors are ANSYS Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) and Smurfit WestRock PLC (NYSE:SW).\n\n* Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company's 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.\n\nMcDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Monday July 29, BMODateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\nMcDonald's Corp is set to report second-quarter 2024 results on Monday, July 29. While this is only two days later than they reported last year, it would be the latest they've ever reported for the second quarter.\n\nMcDonald's rang the alarm on the U.S. consumer last quarter after disappointing earnings per share results pointed to a pull-back in discretionary spending. Consumers continue to be even more discriminating with every dollar that they spend as they faced elevated prices in their day-to-day spending, which is putting pressure on the industry, CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's first-quarter earnings call.\n\nThe Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Wednesday July 31, BMODateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\nBoeing is set to report second-quarter 2024 results on Wednesday, July 29, the latest they've ever reported for the second quarter, but still sticking with their Wednesday reporting trend.\n\nAfter all of the setbacks and bad press Boeing has received this year, it probably isn't particularly surprising to see them move their earnings date later. On Wednesday the planemaker plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge for misleading U.S. regulators in order to get the 737 Max jetliner approved before it was ready, leading to two fatal crashes.[8] It isn't just the issue with the 737 Max jetliners, but other models such as 777 freighters that are incomplete and awaiting additional parts or updated software, costing the company about $1 billion a month as they scramble to get these idle planes up and running.[9]\n\nSecond-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis season peak weeks will fall between July 22 and Aug. 9, with each week expected to see over nearly 2,000-plus reports. Currently Aug. 8 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,438 companies anticipated to report. Thus far only 69% of companies have confirmed their earnings date (out of our universe of 11,000-plus global names), so this is subject to change. The remaining dates are estimated based on historical reporting data.?

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures retreated in evening deals on Monday as sentiment remained strained in anticipation of a Federal Reserve meeting and earnings from some of the country’s biggest companies.\n\nA rebound in technology stocks ran out of steam this week, with the sector nursing deep losses over the past two weeks amid profit-taking, a shift into more economically sensitive sectors and underwhelming earnings from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nTraders were reluctant to buy back into the sector, with several tech majors set to report quarterly earnings this week, beginning with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.2% to 5,494.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.2% to 19,169.75 points by 19:13 ET (23:13 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.2% to 40,707.0 points.\n\nMicrosoft to kick off next round of major tech earnings\n\nThe Redmond, Washington-based tech giant is set to report its June quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the firm is set to clock strong growth in earnings on the back of more artificial intelligence products, investors will be watching for any increased expenditure, and whether AI demand appeared to be sufficiently boosting earnings.\n\nThe increased caution comes after high AI spending and some sluggish revenue metrics soured otherwise strong earnings from peer Alphabet last week. The stock had tumbled after its earnings.\n\nBeyond Microsoft, tech heavyweights Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are set to report earnings on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nOther major earnings are also on tap this week, with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Merck&Company Inc (NYSE:MRK), Procter&Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) due in the coming days.\n\nWall Street indexes were largely unchanged on Monday amid caution ahead of the earnings. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% to 5,463.54 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.1% to 17,370.33 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1% to 40,539.93 points.\n\nFed meeting awaited for more rate cues\n\nMarkets were also on edge before a Fed meeting this week, with the bank widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of the meeting on Wednesday.\n\nBut any signals on when the bank plans to begin cutting rates will be closely watched, given encouraging signs from inflation and positive comments from Fed officials in recent months.\n\nMarkets are pricing in a 25 basis point cut by the Fed in September, according to CME Fedwatch.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStory continues\n\nUS stock futures fall with Fed meeting, mega tech earnings on tap\n\nAd group WPP lines up former BT boss Philip Jansen as its new chair, FT reports\n\nMeta to let users to create custom AI characters\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Magnificent 7 Earnings Preview: Can Investors Buy Tech Now?",
        "content": "Get ready for some action this week in the stock market as four of the Magnificent 7 tech giants—Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL)—gear up to report their quarterly earnings.\n\nThese tech titans have been the primary drivers of this year’s return, pushing the market to new heights. But with the recent bout of market volatility, the big question remains: Is now the time for investors to dive into tech stocks?\n\nHere, we will explore the broader picture of the sector and potential outcomes of these quarterly earnings reports and try to figure out if any or all of them are worthy additions to investor portfolios at current levels. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStrong Earnings Growth… But AI Concerns Loom\n\nLast week, following the quarterly report from Alphabet (GOOGL), investors started to grow cautious. Concerns about overinvestment into AI infrastructure and its ability to generate profits moving forward have been the main cause of selling over the last week.\n\nManagement’s comments about Capex regarding AI will be an important talking point for all these stocks.\n\nAlong with weakness in Alphabet, Semiconductor stocks and the other Mag 7 stocks have experienced considerable selling. But are these concerns overblown? I think they may be, and with another quarter of impressive growth likely coming, and reasonable valuations from the group, this dip could be a buying opportunity.\n\nAmazon is expected to post a 63.64% year-over-year increase in earnings to $0.54 per share, with revenue projected at $140.88 billion, driven by robust AWS and North American retail operations. Apple, despite a slight revenue dip to $81.64 billion, is forecasted to achieve earnings of $1.19 per share, bolstered by its services and wearables segments.\n\nMeta Platforms anticipates a significant earnings jump to $3.04 per share, a 45% jump and $31.05 billion in revenue, fueled by strong ad revenue and user engagement. Microsoft is projected to deliver $2.72 per share in earnings and $62.03 billion in revenue, reflecting Azure's impressive performance and continued strength in Office and LinkedIn.\n\nOverall, the Mag 7 is expected to bring in +26.8% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.7% higher revenues.\n\nValuations: Amazon and Meta are Relatively Cheap\n\nLooking at the valuations of these tech giants we see a spectrum of results. Although they are broadly trading at reasonable levels, two of them look much more appealing than the others.\n\nMeta Platforms stands out with a free cash flow (FCF) yield of 4.1%, above its 10-year median of 3.2%, making it particularly attractive. Amazon too boasts an FCF yield of 2.6%, above its 10-year median of 1.8%.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (AAPL), on the other hand, has a FCF yield of 3%, which is below its 10-year median of 5.7%, indicating it may be pricier relative to its historical norm. And Microsoft (MSFT) shows a similar trend with an FCF yield of 2.2%, below its 10-year median of 3.6%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUncertainty Into Year End but Forecasts are Strong\n\nI think it may be a bit of a crapshoot buying these names ahead of earnings, but the reasonable valuations and secular tailwinds these companies enjoy make them compelling buys if they sell off further following the reports.\n\nCritical to the performance of these stocks through the end of the year is investors perception of AI. Can these companies turn a profit in their new AI products? The answer is probably yes, but shareholders want to see hard evidence.\n\nAnother worthy consideration is the setup in the broader market and the approaching US Presidential Election. Big tech has been carrying the market higher all year, and it may be time for a pause in this run. Additionally, as the election approaches so does the perceived uncertainty, and investors may rotate into defensive sectors until after it concludes.\n\nHowever, it is hard to understate the long-term growth catalysts at these big tech companies – they are almost all expected to grow earnings faster than the market, which will drive even higher stock prices in the coming years.\n\nAny pause they take now, or in the coming months, is likely an opportunity to acquire shares in these generational assets.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy Amid the Big Tech Tumble",
        "content": "The rotation out of technology stocks continues, with the Nasdaq Composite index down 2% in the past month versus a 12% gain in the Russell 2000 index comprised of small-cap stocks. However, the decline in the Nasdaq does not reflect the huge selloff that’s taken place in many individual technology stocks in recent weeks. Several of the mega-cap tech stocks that led the rally in this year’s first half are down more than 10%.\n\nThe decline in technology stocks comes despite the fact that many companies have reported strong second-quarter financial results and have other catalysts that should be driving their share prices higher. For long-term investors, an opportunity has opened to buy stocks of great companies on the dip. It’s not clear how long the current rotation will last, so investors should act quickly.\n\nHere are three stocks to buy amid the big tech tumble.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIBM (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nRotation or not, tech giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) just delivered another strong earnings report. It’s the latest in a string of better-than-expected financial results for the company. For this year’s second quarter, IBM announced EPS of $2.43 compared to $2.20 expected on Wall Street. Revenue in the April through June quarter totaled $15.77 billion, which surpassed consensus estimates of $15.62 billion.\n\nThe company, which provides hardware, software and consulting services, attributed the strong results to a rebound in technology spending, as well as growing expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI). IBM said that its book of business for generative AI now stands at $2 billion, double the amount it was in April of this year. The company is also in the process of acquiring software firm HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP) for $6.4 billion, which should be accretive to its earnings.\n\nIBM stock is up 18% on the year but trades at a reasonable valuation of 19 times future earnings estimates. It also pays a quarterly dividend that yields a healthy 3.48%.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) stock is down 9% in the past month and looks ripe for the picking. The company’s shares are currently trading at 24 times future earnings estimates, which is in line with the average among S&P 500-listed companies and historically low for Meta Platforms. The dip also comes as the tech giant further extends its lead in AI, having just released a new version of its Llama model.\n\nCalled Llama 3.1, the new technology comes in three different versions, with one being the largest and most advanced AI model to date from Meta Platforms. As was the case with all previous versions of Llama, the newest model is open source, which means it can be accessed by people for free. While analysts criticize Meta for making its AI models available for free, the company insists its approach will lead to future benefits.\n\nStory continues\n\nMETA stock is up 33% on the year, even with the current dip in its share price.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s also Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which remains the most successful and profitable of the streaming companies. The company just reported Q2 financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines due largely to a 34% increase in its advertising-supported memberships. The company announced an EPS of $4.88 versus $4.74 expected among analysts who track the company’s progress.\n\nRevenue amounted to $9.56 billion compared to $9.53 billion, which was the consensus expectation on Wall Street. Sales were up 17% from a year earlier. Total memberships at Netflix rose 16.5% year-over-year to 277.65 million worldwide. That number was better than the 274.4 million expected among analysts. Management said the company is benefitting from advertising revenue on its streaming platform, with the ad-supported tier now accounting for more than 45% of all new sign-ups.\n\nNFLX stock is up 31% year-to-date, though it has come down 7% in the past month despite its strong Q2 print.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rose 0.4%.\n\nIn commodities markets, oil fell 1.1%, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light crude dropping below $76, hitting a fresh 7-week low as bearish demand developments in China outweighed supply concerns from rising Middle East tensions.

        "content": "Meta Platforms META is set to report its second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 31.\r\n\r\nIt expects total revenues between $36.5 billion and $39 billion for the second quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $38.27 billion, indicating an increase of 19.59% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings stands at $4.69 per share, up 0.6% over the past 30 days, suggesting growth of 45.2% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 13.3%.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Meta Platforms, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nMETA is riding on strong advertising revenue growth prospects. In the first quarter of 2024, advertising revenues increased 26.8% year over year to $35.64 billion and accounted for 97.8% of revenues. At constant currency, advertising revenues increased 26% year over year.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ advertising revenues are expected to benefit from strong spending by advertisers as they leverage its growing AI prowess. \r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2024 advertising revenues is currently pegged at $37.51 billion, suggesting 19.1% year-over-year growth. \r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ offerings — WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Facebook — currently reach more than three billion people daily. Its staggering reach and increasing ad impressions (up 20% year over year in the first quarter of 2024) make META one of the most important players in the digital ad sales market apart from Alphabet’s GOOGL Google and YouTube.\r\n\r\nIn its recently concluded second-quarter 2024, Google’s advertising revenues rose 11.1% year over year to $64.62 billion. YouTube’s advertising revenues improved 13% year over year to $8.7 billion. \r\n\r\nMETA has been leveraging AI and machine learning to boost the potency of its social-media offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Threads. Effective usage of AI has been helping the company keep its users engaged. AI-driven feed recommendations have been a key catalyst. \r\n\r\nHowever, rising expenses related to investments in developing more advanced models and AI services are expected to keep margins under pressure. The Reality Labs business continues to burn cash, which doesn’t bode well for META’s near-term prospects.\n\nMETA Shares Outperform Sector, S&P 500\n\nMETA shares have gained 31.5% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 18.3% and the S&P 500’s 14.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has also outperformed peers including Pinterest PINS, Snap SNAP, Bumble and GOOGL.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance Chart Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms stock is not so cheap, as the Value Style Score of C suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, META is trading at 6.9X, higher than the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s 6.3X and the Zacks Internet Software industry’s 2.43X.\n\nPrice/Sales Ratio (F12M) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMETA Leverages AI to Boost Growth\n\nMeta Platforms is leveraging AI to boost engagement. Currently, 30% of the posts on Facebook feed are delivered by its AI recommendation system. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. \r\n\r\nMETA is now incorporating AI tools into WhatsApp to make businesses more customer-oriented. The rapid adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) is transforming conversational messaging platforms like WhatsApp to perform conversational commerce, including transactions like ride-hailing and grocery purchases. The AI tools will enable businesses to help customers find new products. \r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is leveraging AI to boost Facebook’s appeal among young adults, a demography that prefers YouTube and Snap’s Snapchat.\r\n\r\nPowered by cutting-edge AI, META is offering user-centric features, positioning Facebook as a platform that resonates with young adults. It has upgraded Reels and Feed ranking technologies, resulting in better content recommendations. A newly developed model architecture allows for efficient learning from large datasets, significantly improving the performance of Facebook Reels.\r\n\r\nHowever, monetization of these AI initiatives is expected to take considerable time. Meta Platforms now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. Hence, the growth prospects remain modest in the near term.\r\n\r\nRisk-averse investors should note that growing regulatory concerns don’t bode well for META’s prospects. It is suffering from privacy regulations in Europe and the United States and is also expected to face antitrust issues in its usage of AI.\n\nConclusion\n\nMETA’s usage of AI bodes well for its long-term prospects. Hence, investors who already own the stock may expect the company's growth prospects to be rewarding over the long term.\r\n\r\nHowever, META’s near-term prospects are full of challenges. Modest growth prospects and stretched valuation make it a risky bet for investors.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\n\r\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) the Best Jim Cramer Stock to Buy on the Dip?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation.Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a program last week tried to make sense of the decline in tech stocks, saying companies with the “best fundamentals” got “hammered once again.”\n\n“I did not expect that to happen.”\n\nCramer said that sometimes it’s difficult to own the “winners.” The CNBC host said it’s important to understand the bear cases around stocks otherwise you will never know what “you are up against.”\n\nJim Cramer tried to find out whether the latest decline in top tech stocks was just a “periodic selloff” that presented an “opportunity.”\n\n“When we get this kind of rotation, you never know whether these stocks are selling off because there’s something wrong or because they are up huge.”\n\nJim Cramer pointed to a caveat when it comes to holding winning stocks. When you have the losers, there are no profits, but when you own winners in your portfolio, you can see losses because people want to take some profits off the table, Cramer said.\n\nThe CNBC host said when top stocks go down, people holding those in their portfolios often end up thinking about whether they should also sell these stocks and if something has “changed.”\n\n“From what I can tell you, nothing has changed about the stocks we are going talk about tonight. But it is true that the stocks are a heck of a lot more expensive than they were one year ago.”\n\nIn this program, we took a look at some top tech stocks that fell last week and explained the reasons they lost value according to Jim Cramer. We also discussed these companies’ fundamentals and hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Jim Cramer Talking About Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Falling Stock Amid Latest Market Rotation?\n\nCopyright: rvlsoft / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program said Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) seemed “solid” but it’s a “little unnerving” for people to own a stock that is not much liked by the front runner in the presidential race.\n\n“Even though Trump is rabidly anti-China, he’s willing to support Tik Tok, a Chinese company, as a counter-balance to Mark Zuckerberg.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer was referring to Trump’s recent statement where he said he’s “for TikTok.”\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill chose Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) as one of his top AI picks in the consumer AI space.\n\nThe social media giant is using AI to optimize ad targeting and recommendation systems to boost engagement and ads revenue. In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.  However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it’ll bode well for the stock down the road.\n\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta’s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world’s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users across its platform. The company generates revenue predominantly from advertising. which accounts for over 95% of its total revenue, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal fourth quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings surpassing analyst estimates. The better-than- expected revenues were attributed to strong advertiser demand and Al-driven ad improvements. Moreover, the company materially raised its fiscal first quarter sales and earnings guidance above analysts’ estimates, buoyed by continued strong advertiser demand trends and enhancements to Reels. Advantage+. Click-to-message, and Shop Ads. Further, management noted that ongoing investment in Al is enhancing user engagement and advertiser returns through improved targeting and measurement. Separately, Meta authorized a new share repurchase plan representing approximately 5% of its market capitalization and announced the initiation of its first dividend, implying an approximate 0.4% yield.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 weekly preview: Spotlight on Big Tech earnings, FOMC",
        "content": "U.S. stocks edged higher on Friday, with Wall Street ending a volatile week on a high as investors assessed new U.S. inflation data.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 654.27 points, or 1.64%, closing at 40,589.34. The S&P 500 rose 1.11%, finishing at 5,459.10, and the Nasdaq Composite increased by 1.03%, ending at 17,357.88.\n\nThe gains were driven by a combination of oversold market conditions, a stronger-than-expected GDP report on Thursday, and expectations that the Federal Reserve might start cutting rates soon due to economic resilience.\n\nDespite Friday's rally, the indexes still experienced losses for the week. The S&P 500 fell by 0.8%, while the Nasdaq dropped 2.1%, with both indexes recording back-to-back weekly declines for the first time since April.\n\nLooking ahead to this week, key economic data releases this week include the JOLTS job openings report on Tuesday, the ISM manufacturing index on Thursday, and the employment report on Friday.\n\nThe July FOMC meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, with the much-anticipated post-meeting statement set to be released at 2:00 PM ET, followed by Chair Powell’s press conference at 2:30 PM.\n\n“We think the July Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that concludes Wednesday will signal that the Fed is on track to cut soon and open the door to a cut in September but will stop short of explicitly pre-signaling a rate reduction at that following meeting,” Evercore ISI strategists said in a note.\n\n“We believe Powell will wait until Jackson Hole end August – by which time the Fed will have another month’s data – to deliver the explicit September cut signal,” they added.\n\nIt's that week of the Q2 earnings season\n\nApart from the FOMC’s statement, much of the market’s attention this week will be directed toward the Big Tech earnings results, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) all set to report in the coming days.\n\nWall Street analysts and investors are eager to gain insights into these tech giants' latest AI-driven capital spending and key trends in both enterprise and consumer technology expenditures.\n\nFor Apple, Barclays analysts expect a more favorable outlook for the September quarter, leading to upward revisions in estimates for iPhone, Mac, and Services, as well as their projections for fiscal 2025.\n\nThey said feedback from its Asia checks suggests better-than-expected September-quarter builds, with IP16 production in the low 20 million range. Late cycle demand for IP15 Pro models has slightly improved following WWDC due to their AI compatibility.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The stock has already run in anticipation of iPhones bottoming and the upcoming ramp of AI features,” analysts added.\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nOppenheimer: \"We remain positive on equities and continue to see fixed-income securities as complimentary to stocks in providing portfolio diversification. Some near-term profit-taking in the day-to-day action of the market particularly in segments of the market that have had exceptional run-ups since last year into this year should be expected and continues to appear to us quite normal. Such activity combined with a process of rebalancing and rotation into other segments of the stock market in our view can be healthy and should contribute to the broadening of the markets’ progress that began last year and becomes more evident in the second half of this year.\"\n\nUBS: “Following an impressive run since late last year, investors have increasingly become concerned about the pace and timing of artificial intelligence (AI) revenue and what it may mean for continued investments in AI infrastructure. With results still due from some big firms this week, market volatility is likely to continue. But we think the tech sector should find support in the coming weeks and resume its leadership. In fact, the recent pullback creates a re-entry opportunity, in our view, especially for those companies with strong earnings growth visibility.\"\n\nBTIG: “We can probably drift a bit higher on SPX towards its gap at 5550, before moving lower to fill a gap at 5375. Internally, the rotations remain vicious. The 12-day rate-of-change for RTY vs. NDX is over 20%. Since 1985, that ranks as the 5th biggest such move ever, only eclipsed by a few days in December 2000 and Jan. 2nd, 2001. Tactically we think a 'reversal of that reversion' is likely, with semis (SMH) oversold into support while homebuilders (ITB) are overbought and rallying on anticpated rate cuts, when in fact higher rates were part of their bull thesis over the last couple of years. We are also seeing breakouts among the defensive stocks, and areas like staples, utlities, REITs, and healthcare all look strong.\"\n\nStrategas: \"On average, the market bottoms 213 days later and 23% lower after the first Fed cut in a series of rate cuts. S&P 500 operating earnings decline by about 10% on average in the 12 months following the first easing. In short, be careful what you wish for when it comes to an easing of monetary policy. There is, naturally, a chance, broadly supported by recent policy, that policymakers have decided to effectively “outlaw” recessions. While it seems appealing, such an approach makes it difficult to control inflation. What we don’t know is whether the fact that President Biden is not seeking reelection weakens his resolve or urgency in providing stimulus for the broader economy in the months leading up to the election.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEarnings call: Eni aims for growth and net zero by 2030 amid strategic divestments\n\nEarnings call: ASE Technology sees mixed Q2 results, plans expansion\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com — As all eyes focus on the several mega-cap giants expected to report this week, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it's the value play that's stealing the Q2 earnings season show.\n\nFlying below the radar of most headlines, several of these stocks have gathered significant momentum and are now posting incredible financial results, leading to a repricing of their shares.\n\nBut if finding winners among mega-cap names can be tricky, finding them among lesser-known stocks can be even harder.\n\nNot to our premium users, though, who, for less than $8 a month, have been scoring incredible results on our AI-powered list of value plays for July.\n\nSuch is the case of Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) and Centene Corp (NYSE:CNC), both picked by our AI in July. After posting incredible earnings beats on Friday, they rallied a massive 16.8% and 8.6%, respectively, providing our users with chunky gains.\n\nThese rallies add to the phenomenal list of winning picks for Q2 earnings season so far. Just to name a few of our winners from last week alone:\n\nCharter Communications: +16.9% after reporting. Pool Corporation (NASDAQ:POOL): +10% after reporting. Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH): +9.2% after reporting. Darling Ingredients (NYSE:DAR): +7.2T% after reporting. Manhattan Associates Inc (NASDAQ:MANH): +8.4% after reporting. CNC: +8.6% after reporting.\n\nHonestly, when was the last time you picked so many huge gainers in a single week? (And to be fair, it was not a particularly good week for the broader market.)\n\nBut wait - it gets even better.

Instead of relying solely on momentum models, our approach integrates decades of comprehensive stock market fundamental and technical analysis a multitude of data sets.\n\nThat's how our composed Tech Titans strategy managed to simply obliterate the market since our official launch in November last year (numbers as of premarket today):\n\nStory continues\n\nTech Titans: +80.69% S&P 500: 28.82%\n\nThis is no backtest; this is real-world performance, unfolded in real time to our users' benefit.\n\nActually, our backtest suggests that going for the long run will give you even heftier gains. See chart below for reference: \r\nSource: ProPicks\n\nThis means a $100K principal in our strategy would have turned into an eye-popping $1,879,800K by now.\n\nAs earnings season kicks into high gear, will you keep on guessing or have an insight into the winners?\n\nFor less than $8 a month, that decision has never been easier. *And since you made it all the way to the bottom of this article, we'll give you a special 10% extra discount on all our plans with the coupon code PROPICKS2024!\n\nRelated Articles\n\nValue plays are crushing Q2 earnings season\n\nInvestment firm Sixth Street to acquire Enstar in $5.1 billion deal\n\nMcDonald's posts surprise drop in quarterly global sales as spending slows\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Central bank meetings, Apple, corporate earnings - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures rise at the start of a week that includes several major central bank meetings, including the Federal Reserve, as well as earnings from key tech companies. Apple is taking its time incorporating artificial intelligence features into its key products, while the European corporate results season also continues.\n\n1. Fed leads central bank parade this week\n\nThe spotlight this week will be on central banks, with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan all set to hold policy meetings.\n\nThe Fed concludes its July policy meeting on Wednesday, and is widely expected to maintain its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, as it has done since last July.\n\nHowever, markets are overwhelmingly expecting a September rate cut, especially after Friday’s personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s favorite gauge of inflation, showed signs of cooling prices.\n\nThus the statement by Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be studied carefully to see if he sets the stage for a rate cut at the next meeting.\n\nThe Bank of Japan concludes its latest policy setting meeting on Wednesday, and speculation over the prospect of a rate hike is mounting despite a fragile economy and weak consumer sentiment.\n\nThe Bank of England meets on Thursday amid a great deal of uncertainty over whether policymakers will deliver their first rate cut since 2020.\n\nLast month, the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to keep rates on hold, but this decision is expected to be more finely balanced with policymakers having to judge between higher-than-expected service price inflation and weak growth.\n\n2. Futures rise ahead of Fed meeting, earnings\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Monday at the start of a week dominated by a Federal Reserve meeting as well as a number of key corporate earnings.\n\nBy 04:05 ET (08:05 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 60 points, or 0.2%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 12 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 70 points, or 0.4%.\n\nThe major indices slipped lower last week, with the Nasdaq Composite hit hard, in particular, by the cooling off of the tech trade.\n\nBig Tech earnings are set to continue in the coming days, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday, followed by Facebook-parent Meta (NASDAQ:META) on Wednesday and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as well as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday.\n\nDisappointing numbers could reignite the worries that caused a bruising selloff last week, with the Nasdaq suffering its worst day since late 2022 on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Apple’s AI plans take time\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking longer than expected including its recently unveiled artificial intelligence features, known as Apple Intelligence, into its flagship iPhone and iPad devices, and they will not be included in an initial software update, according to a report by Bloomberg.\n\nApple’s AI plans will miss the initial September releases of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, the Bloomberg report showed, but should be included with the October updates.\n\nThe company had in June unveiled a slew of new AI-powered features for its flagship devices, hoping the seemingly insatiable demand for all things AI would help the firm offset steadily slowing sales of its flagship iPhone.\n\nApple is set to report its June quarter earnings later this week, and is expected to log a sustained decline in device sales amid increased competition and saturation in the smartphone market.\n\n4. Heineken writes down Chinese investment’s value\n\nThere are also earnings in Europe to digest, as the second-quarter results season continues.\n\nHeineken (AS:HEIN) shares slumped 7% after the world’s second-largest brewer missed half-year estimates and announced a hefty impairment, as it wrote down the value of its 40% stake in China Resources Beer.\n\nThat said, Heineken also raised its full-year profit guidance, expecting to deliver organic operating profit growth of between 4% and 8% in 2024, compared to its previous guidance of between low and high single-digit growth.\n\nPhilips (AS:PHG) stock rose 10% after the Dutch medical device maker reported second-quarter results that beat expectations, boosted by higher earnings, the implementation of its restructuring program and insurance income linked to its Respironics product liability claims.\n\nPearson (LON:PSON) stock fell 3.5% after the educational publisher posted a drop in pretax profit compared with a year earlier, even as the company said it is on track to meet full-year expectations.\n\n5. Crude gains on raised Middle East tensions\n\nCrude prices rose Monday on concerns of a widening conflict in the Middle East, potentially impacting global supply, after a deadly rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.\n\nBy 04:05 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.1% to $77.20 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $80.38 a barrel.\n\nThe weekend’s strike reportedly killed at least 12 people, and has been blamed by both Israel and the U.S. on Iran-backed Hezbollah, who have denied responsibility for the attack.\n\nIsrael has vowed retaliation against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Israeli jets hit targets in southern Lebanon on Sunday.\n\nThese increasing tensions are also seen diminishing the prospect of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, as hopes of a ceasefire in Gaza had been gaining momentum.\n\nStill, gains are limited as the outlook for crude demand remains bleak.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCentral bank meetings, Apple, corporate earnings - what's moving markets\n\nTake Five: Scores on the doors for Big Tech\n\nJapan to achieve primary budget surplus next year, govt estimate shows\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Sunday as focus turned to an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting for more cues on interest rate cuts.\n\nFocus was also squarely on a string of June-quarter earnings from Wall Street’s biggest companies, such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which are due in the coming days.\n\nWall Street indexes had rebounded sharply on Friday after PCE price index data- which is the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge- read mostly within expectations for June, driving up optimism that the central bank will begin cutting rates in September.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.2% to 5,512.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.4% to 19,244.50 points by 19:40 ET (00:40 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 40,931.0 points.\n\nFed meeting set to provide rate cut clarity\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nBut any signals from the central bank on when it plans to begin cutting interest rates will be closely watched, amid increasing signs that inflation had cooled in recent months.\n\nA slew of Fed officials also said in recent addresses that the central bank was gaining more confidence in its battle against inflation, and that it did not need to see inflation reaching its 2% annual target to begin cutting rates.\n\nGeneral consensus is that the Fed will keep rates steady this week, but potentially offer signals on a September rate cut. Traders were seen pricing in a 25 basis point cut by the Fed in September, CME Fedwatch showed.\n\nApple, Microsoft set to report earnings\n\nEarnings reports from some of Wall Street’s biggest companies are on tap this week, with Microsoft and Apple set to report on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nOther tech majors including Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) are also set to report earnings through the week.\n\nThe results come in the wake of an extended rout in technology stocks, as the sector was walloped by profit-taking and as expectations of rate cuts saw investors pivot into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nUnderwhelming earnings from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) last week also sparked increased caution ahead of the tech earnings, with investors waiting to see whether increased investment in artificial intelligence was bearing fruit.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.1% to 5,459.10 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 1% to 17,357.88 points on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1.6% to 40,589.34 points.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise with Fed, big tech earnings in focus\n\nAppleâ€™s AI features will not be included in initial launch of iOS 18- Bloomberg\n\nApple's artificial intelligence features to be delayed, Bloomberg News reports\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The tech rout is far from over.\n\nThat’s the warning from strategists this week as investors dump big tech stocks in favor of previously unloved areas of the market. The Nasdaq 100 closed the week down 2.7%, marking the third week in a row of declines, with the technology sector suffering its largest single-day percentage drop since October 2022.\n\nThe culprits: bets on Fed rate cuts, Tesla’s (TSLA) lackluster earnings, and fears about Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) AI spending ramp.\n\n“Valuations were priced to perfection from an earnings standpoint and from an interest rate standpoint, that eventually we would see some sort of a valuation correction,” Verdence Capital Advisors chief investment officer Megan Horneman told me.\n\nHorneman, who warned the AI trade is “hitting a wall,” added that this week’s rotation out of big tech is only the start of a “valuation correction.”\n\nThe significant shift under way has pushed small caps to the top of investors' buying lists. The Russell 2000 (RUT) recorded weekly gains for the third week in a row, marking its best three week stretch since 2022. Data compiled by Bespoke found that the outperformance spread between the Russell 2000 and the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) over the last 12 trading days, in favor of the small-cap index, is the second most extreme in the history of the two indices.\n\n“With multiples as high as they are for the Mag seven, they're building in earnings growth. And if you don't see that earnings growth, that means that valuations come into question,” Commonwealth Financial Network’s Brad McMillan explained to me.\n\n“There’s a threat of more pressure ahead,” McMillan said.\n\nAnd that risk of slower profit growth, coupled with increased spending on AI, could signal that the “epic momentum reversal” will persist, unless big tech raises forward revenue guidance, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn a note to clients, Goldman Sachs’ David Kostin wrote investors are starting to worry about the prospect of “overinvestment” in AI without timely proven returns, noting that Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet are driving the bulk of the spending.\n\n“Consensus estimates of 2024 and 2025 capex and R&D spending by the hyperscalers have increased by $65 billion compared with expectations at the start of the year. However, analysts have lifted their sales forecasts for 2025 and 2026 by only $36 billion — a gap of nearly $30 billion,” Kostin wrote.\n\n“These firms during the past six months have dramatically increased their planned spending on AI initiatives but it is not apparent when the return will come — in 2027, 2028, 2029, or perhaps not at all,” he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs our markets reporter Josh Schafer noted, two charts in Yahoo Finance’s Chartbook suggest further selling ahead. Analysis by Truist’s Keith Lerner found that the S&P 500 sees an average correction of about 9% in the second half of the year, after the index rallies more than 10% in the first six months.\n\nMeanwhile, BMO Capital Markets chief investment officer Brian Belski’s review of past performance found that stocks usually drop an average of 9.4% in the second year of a cyclical bull market, which started in October 2022.\n\n“This market has become quite frothy with everybody looking to big cap tech stocks and chasing the market,” Belski told me. “It's really difficult to be overweight Apple or overweight Nvidia … especially given how much they've rallied.”\n\nSafe to say, earnings results this coming week from Meta, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft will be a crucial measuring stick. Any sort of disappointment, similar to what we saw from Alphabet and Tesla this week, could trigger more carnage for the tech market.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

However, analysts have lifted their sales forecasts for 2025 and 2026 by only $36 billion — a gap of nearly $30 billion,” Kostin wrote.\n\n“These firms during the past six months have dramatically increased their planned spending on AI initiatives but it is not apparent when the return will come — in 2027, 2028, 2029, or perhaps not at all,” he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs our markets reporter Josh Schafer noted, two charts in Yahoo Finance’s Chartbook suggest further selling ahead. Analysis by Truist’s Keith Lerner found that the S&P 500 sees an average correction of about 9% in the second half of the year when the index rallies more than 10% in the first six months.\n\nMeanwhile, BMO Capital Markets chief investment officer Brian Belski’s review of past performance found that stocks usually drop an average of 9.4% in the second year of a cyclical bull market, which started in October 2022.\n\n“This market has become quite frothy with everybody looking to big-cap tech stocks and chasing the market,” Belski told me. “It's really difficult to be overweight Apple or overweight Nvidia … especially given how much they've rallied.”\n\nSafe to say, earnings results this coming week from Meta, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft will be a crucial measuring stick. Any sort of disappointment, similar to what we saw from Alphabet and Tesla, could trigger more carnage for the tech market.

        "title": "Big Tech earnings, a Fed meeting, and the July jobs report: What to know this week",
        "content": "The stock market rally is in its most fragile state in months ahead of Wall Street's busiest week of the summer.\n\nThe S&P 500 (GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) recently had their worst single-day drops since 2022 as the indexes struggled to recover losses during a Friday rally. All three major averages closed the final full week of July lower. The S&P 500 was down more than 1%, while the Nasdaq fell over 2.3%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose about 0.6%.\n\nIn the week ahead, a Federal Reserve meeting, the July jobs report, and earnings from Big Tech stalwarts Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) will drive the direction of markets to kick off August.\n\nUpdates on job openings, activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, and consumer confidence are also on the calendar.\n\nA busy week of corporate earnings awaits, with 171 members of the S&P 500 expected to report quarterly results. AMD (AMD), Arm (ARM), Boeing (BA), McDonald's (MCD), and Starbucks (SBUX) will be among the companies highlighting the schedule.\n\nA September 'signal'\n\nThe Fed will announce its latest monetary policy decision next Wednesday. Markets largely expect the central bank to hold rates steady at its July meeting.\n\nRecent updates in the economy have investors eyeing when the Fed's first cut will come though. In June, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out the cost of food and energy and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 2.6% over the prior year, its lowest annual increase in more than three years. Separate data for the month showed a significant decrease in another inflation metric, the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market has shown signs of cooling. The ratio of job openings to unemployed workers is back at pre-pandemic levels, and last month, the unemployment rate hit its highest level since November 2021.\n\nThis has prompted markets to price in the Fed's first cut in September, and investors will be keenly listening to Jerome Powell's press conference on Wednesday for any confirmation.\n\n\"The overall tone from the meeting, including from Chair Powell's press conference, should signal that a rate cut in September is a reasonable baseline without pre-committing to this action,\" Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti wrote in a note to clients. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell departs after holding a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on interest rate policy in Washington, U.S., May 1, 2024. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nLabor market look\n\nFriday will bring a fresh look at monthly job additions as economists continue to debate whether recent cooling in the labor market represents normalization or more significant deterioration.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe July jobs report is expected to show 175,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy, with unemployment holding steady at 4.1%, according to data from Bloomberg. In June, the US economy added 206,000 jobs while the unemployment rate rose to 4.1%.\n\n\"The 180K increase to payrolls we expect in July would still be a respectable gain, but would underscore that, directionally, the jobs market is deteriorating,\" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients. \"By a range of measures, including the unemployment rate, quit rate, level of temporary help workers and small business hiring plans, the labor market is not only softer than a year or two ago, but weaker compared to its pre-pandemic state.\"\n\nGiven this backdrop, whether unemployment holds steady or ticks up as it has for the past three months will be in particular focus.\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nThe stock market's recent slump has included a big sell-off in tech.\n\nSince July 10, Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) — which tracks Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — has dropped about 12%.\n\nTruist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner recently told Yahoo Finance the pullback has made sense given the runup in Big Tech stocks over the past year and how overstretched positioning in many of the large tech stocks had become. This, combined with investors rotating into less-loved areas of the market rally that could benefit from the Fed cutting interest rates, has become the hallmark of the market action over the past two weeks.\n\nEarnings from four of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple — could change that. But as the sell-off after Alphabet and Tesla earnings showed in the prior week, it's been a tough season to impress investors with earnings.\n\n\"When we look at the earnings that we've seen over the last week, I don't think the earnings are bad,\" Lerner said. \"I don't think the businesses, the fundamental business trends, are bad, but I just think that they were not good enough relative to these really high [expectations].\"\n\nAnd, to Lerner's point, stocks that miss on Wall Street estimates for earnings, revenue, or both are seeing significantly worse price reactions in the next trading day than typically seen over the past five years, according to research from Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel.\n\nFor now, Emanuel wrote in a note to clients, \"earnings remain a catalyst for volatility, not higher S&P 500 prices.\"\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, July (-14.2 expected, -15.1 prior)\n\nEarnings: McDonald's (MCD), Philips (PHG), Tilray (TLRY)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P CoreLogic 20-city year-over-year NSA, May (7.2% prior); Conference Board consumer confidence, July (99.7 expected, 100.4 prior) JOLTS job openings, June (8.14 million prior); Dallas Fed services activity, (-4.1 prior)\n\nEarnings: Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), BP (BP), Caesars Entertainment (CZR), Electronic Arts (EA), First Solar (FSLR), JetBlue (JBLU), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), Merck (MRK), Pinterest (PINS), Pfizer (PFE), Procter & Gamble (PG), Starbucks (SBUX), SoFi (SOFI)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended July 26 (-2.2% prior); ADP private payrolls, July (+168,000 expected, +150,000 prior); Minnesota Chicago PMI, July (44.0 expected, 47.4 prior); Employment cost index, second quarter (1.0% expected, 1.2% prior); Federal Reserve monetary policy decision (no interest rate change expected)\n\nEarnings: Meta (META), Altria (MO), Arm (ARM), Boeing (BA), Carvana (CVNA), Generac (GNRC), Humana (HUM), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC), Mastercard (MA), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), Paycom (PAYC), Qualcomm (QCOM)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, July, (+19.8% prior); Unit labor costs, second quarter (+4% prior); Nonfarm productivity, fourth quarter (+1.6% expected, +5.2% prior); Initial jobless claims, week ending July 27 (235,000 prior); S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, July final (49.5 prior); Construction spending, month-over-month, July (+0.2% expected, -0.1% prior); ISM manufacturing, July (49 expected, 48.5 prior); ISM prices paid, July (52.1 prior)\n\nEarnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Block (SQ), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Canada Goose (GOOS), Coinbase (COIN), ConocoPhillips (COP), Crocs (CROX), DraftKings (DKNG), Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Mobileye (MBLY), Moderna (MRNA), Roku (ROKU) SiriusXM (SIRI), Wayfair (W)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, July (+175,000 expected, +206,000 prior); Unemployment rate, January (4.1% expected, 4.1% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, July (+0.3% expected, +0.3% prior); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, July (+3.7% expected, +3.9% prior); Average weekly hours worked, July (34.4 expected, 34.3 prior); Labor force participation rate, July (62.6% previously); Factory orders, June (+0.5% expected, -0.5% prior); Durable goods orders, June final (-6.6% prior)\n\nEarnings: Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks to Buy on the Dip: July 2024",
        "content": "The rout in technology stocks continues with the Nasdaq Composite index recently falling 3% in a single trading session and experiencing its worst selloff in nearly two years. With interest rates expected to be lowered starting this September, investors are shifting capital into small-cap stocks and value names that are likely to benefit from a reduction in borrowing costs.\n\nWhile the decline in tech stocks is jarring, it’s important to remember that it is opening up opportunities for investors to buy shares of great companies at discounted prices. Some leading tech stocks have fallen 20% or more since the start of July, making now a great time to take a position. Some of the largest technology stocks are also attractively valued, trading at 20 times future earnings estimates or less, which is historically low.\n\nHere are three tech stocks to buy on the dip: July 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is down 10% in the last month, making now an opportune time to buy shares. While the company’s stock has been hurt by the rotation out of mega-cap tech names, it has also declined after launching a new version of its Llama artificial intelligence (AI) model that’s being made available free of charge. Called “Llama 3.1,” the new technology is the largest and most advanced AI model yet from Meta Platforms.\n\nAs was the case with all previous versions of Llama, the newest model is “open source,” which means it can be accessed by people around the world for free. While that might sound good, analysts and many investors had wanted Meta to take the same approach as its competitors and charge money for access to its AI. META stock fell more than 5% on news that Llama 3.1 is being released in an open source version.\n\nHowever, in the grand scheme of things, the free version of the newest AI model is a minor controversy. Like the rotation into small-cap stocks, it will pass in due course. In the meantime, investors might want to buy-the-dip in Meta stock before the company reports its second-quarter financial results on July 31.\n\nSpotify Technology (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nAudio streaming giant Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) got a big bounce after its recent second-quarter financial results blew past Wall Street forecasts. However, the share price has pulled back after hitting a 52-week high of $346.23 per share. This presents an opportunity for investors to take a position before the stock recovers and continues its march higher. Analysts have been upgrading the stock since its Q2 print.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently raised its rating on SPOT stock to “buy” from “neutral” and lifted its 12-month price target on the shares to $425 from $320. The new price target implies 27% upside from current levels. Many other analysts lifted their ratings and price targets on Spotify stock after the audio streamer announced a record profit for this year’s second quarter.\n\nAnalysts note that Spotify is succeeding with its cost-cutting initiatives and new pricing model. The stock of Spotify has risen 78% so far this year.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) stock has fallen nearly 20% in the last month, making both the share price and valuation extremely attractive. Currently, DELL stock is trading at 23 times future earnings estimates, which is reasonable for a tech concern of its size. The stock also pays a quarterly dividend of 45 cents per share, giving it a yield of 1.57%. The decline in the company’s share price is due to two issues.\n\nThe first is the rotation out of tech stocks. The second is concerns about the profitability of the company’s high-efficiency servers that run AI models. Both these issues are small potatoes though when it comes to the growth catalysts that are swirling around Dell stock. The company has a huge opportunity with AI. It should also benefit from a global refresh cycle of personal computers (PCs), which remains the company’s bread and butter.\n\nThere are also rumors that Dell Technologies’ stock will be added to the S&P 500 index, which could provide another tailwind for the share price. Over the last 12 months, DELL stock has gained 109%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Daniel Loeb Owns $2.2 Billion Worth of These 3 Brilliant Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "There's no getting around it: The oncoming storm of artificial intelligence (AI) is only just beginning, and the flag-bearer for this shifting paradigm is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company has become virtually unforgettable as a key player in the AI revolution thanks to its gold-standard graphics processing units (GPUs), which provide the computational horsepower that underpins AI.\n\nIf you have any doubts, consider this: For the company's fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), record revenue of $26 billion soared 262% year over year, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.98 surged 629%.\n\nYet, as the AI revolution gains steam, some investors are questioning Nvidia's staying power, concerned with the onset of competition and a rich valuation. As a result, some investors have already moved on from the chipmaker in search of the \"next big thing\" in AI. Perusing the holdings of a highly successful hedge fund manager might provide food for thought.\n\nBillionaire Daniel Loeb is one such money manager, having made a name for himself as the CEO of Third Point, which he founded in 1995. From humble beginnings and starting capital of just $3.4 million, Loeb parlayed his seed money into assets under management of nearly $7.8 billion.\n\nHe's been crystal clear regarding his opinion on the potential of AI. He believes it will be \"transformational,\" providing the catalyst for a \"profound economic upheaval.\" Loeb believes so strongly in AI that it's the \"key element\" in the thesis of nearly half the fund's stock holdings.\n\nThree are by far his largest AI holdings. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 1: Amazon -- 11.8% of holdings\n\nThird Point is heavily invested in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), having held a stake in the e-commerce and cloud kingpin for years. Loebe waxed poetic about the vast potential of Amazon in an interview in 2022. While the company was then valued at roughly $1.6 trillion, Loeb believed Amazon possessed $1 trillion in \"untapped value.\" He argued that the online retail segment alone was worth more than $1 trillion, while its cloud infrastructure segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), was worth $1.5 trillion.\n\nLoeb recently suggested that the \"most direct consequence\" of the rapid adoption of AI is \"an acceleration in cloud usage\" for businesses looking to leverage the large language models that form the foundation of generative AI. This includes the big three cloud providers -- Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. He further believes these cloud services are the \"'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush and should benefit regardless of which products ultimately 'strike gold.'\"\n\nStory continues\n\nLoeb increased his Amazon holdings by roughly 21% in the first quarter, bringing his total stake to 5.1 million shares worth about $930 million and nearly 12% of Third Point's portfolio. Furthermore, at roughly 3 times forward sales, Amazon is still attractively priced.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 2: Microsoft -- 9.5% of holdings\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is widely credited with helping to kick off the mad dash to AI adoption, as the company was quick off the mark to integrate AI across a broad cross-section of its products and services.\n\nThe poster child for those efforts is Microsoft Copilot, the company's AI-fueled digital assistant. Copilot offers a suite of functionality that helps to streamline and automate time-consuming chores, boosting productivity in the process. Not only is demand for Copilot robust, but AI is also helping increase market share for Microsoft's Azure cloud.\n\nWhile the company has thus far been mum about how much incremental revenue Copilot has generated, Loeb estimates that \"Copilot software ... could increase [Microsoft's] revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.\"\n\nThird Point trimmed its Microsoft position by about 12% in the first quarter, even as the total value of its position increased -- thanks to a dividend payment and the stock's 12% move higher in Q1.\n\nMicrosoft stock was currently selling for a premium at 36 times earnings. That said, the company is already one of the early beneficiaries of the AI revolution and has positioned itself for further gains.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 3: Meta Platforms -- 7.7% of holdings\n\nThe ongoing recovery of the digital advertising market likely factored into Loeb's considerable position in Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), but the company has also established itself as a dark horse candidate in AI.\n\nMeta has a distinguished history of using AI to surface relevant content to users on its various social media platforms and target the advertising that generates 98% of the company's revenue.\n\nMeta's current efforts are focused firmly on the future. The company recently debuted the latest version of its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which is available on each major cloud infrastructure platform, paying Meta a fee to carry it.\n\nWith billions of daily users on its social media platforms, the company boasts a treasure trove of data to train its AI systems, which have been gaining popularity. Furthermore, this is an entirely new revenue stream for Meta, though the impact on its financial results isn't yet clear.\n\nThird Point initiated a position in Meta during the third quarter of 2023 and has increased his holdings each quarter since that time, recently boosting his position by 7%. That brings Third Point's stake to 1.24 million shares worth $577 million and nearly 8% of the hedge fund's holdings.\n\nLoeb hasn't said much about his Meta position except to point out that it was the fund's biggest winner in the first quarter. That said, Loeb focuses on \"high-quality companies trading at reasonable valuations,\" and Meta certainly qualifies using those criteria. The stock currently sells for less than 27 times earnings, a discount compared to a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- It’s set to be a big week for markets with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan all set to hold policy meetings. Also in the spotlight will be Friday’s U.S. jobs report and more big tech earnings results. Here's your look at what's happening in markets for the week ahead.\n\nFed decision\n\nWith markets currently pricing in an 88% chance of a September rate cut amid signs of cooling inflation and an uptick in the unemployment rate this week’s policy statement by Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be firmly in the spotlight.\n\nThe Fed, which concludes its July policy meeting on Wednesday, has said it wants to be confident inflation is moving sustainably towards its 2% target before cutting interest rates.\n\nInflation data on Friday underscored expectations for the U.S. central bank to set the stage for a September rate cut this week.\n\nThe Fed has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range since last July. It has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points since 2022.\n\nNonfarm payrolls\n\nWednesday’s Fed statement will put the already closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, due out on Friday, under heightened scrutiny as investors try to gauge whether recent signs of cooling in the labor market continued in July.\n\nEconomists are expecting the U.S. economy to have created 177,000 jobs in July, moderating from 206,000 in the prior month.\n\nThe unemployment rate, which has ticked higher in each of the past three months, is expected to hold steady at 4.1%.\n\nAhead of Friday’s report the U.S. will release data on JOLTS job openings on Tuesday.\n\nBig tech earnings continue\n\nBig Tech earnings are set to continue in the coming days and any disappointments could potentially further roil markets already on edge amid worries over stretched stock valuations.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday, followed by Facebook-parent Meta (NASDAQ:META) on Wednesday and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday.\n\nDisappointing numbers could re-ignite the worries that caused a bruising selloff in U.S. stocks on Wednesday, when both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their worst day since late 2022.\n\nThe huge run-up in tech stocks may have set a high bar for their results. Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) whose earnings were one of the triggers for the selloff, actually reported better-than-expected revenue, but investors grew wary that rising spending on AI infrastructure could squeeze margins, sending shares 5% lower.\n\nBank of England meeting\n\nThe BoE meets on Thursday with investors divided over whether policymakers will deliver their first rate cut since 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe level of uncertainty is higher than usual in the run-up to the meeting as key central bank officials have not spoken publicly for over two months due to rules in the lead up to Britain’s July 4's general election.\n\nInvestors have been left guessing whether recent higher-than-expected service price inflation is enough to prevent the BoE cutting rates from their 16-year high of 5.25%.\n\nLast month, the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to keep rates on hold, but minutes of the decision recorded that it had been a \"finely balanced\" decision for some of the policymakers who had not voted for a cut.\n\nBank of Japan decision\n\nThe BOJ concludes its latest policy setting meeting on Wednesday and speculation over the prospect of a rate hike is mounting after high-profile politicians, including the prime minister, hinted at the need for near-term policy normalisation.\n\nThe impact of the weak yen on household and business spending appears to be turning the exchange rate into a central issue for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's leadership convention in September.\n\nThe fact that the currency has rebounded by a staggering 10 yen per dollar from three-decade lows at the start of the month hasn't deterred some from predicting a July hike.\n\nThey argue the BOJ can get the most bang for its buck by hiking into a rallying yen. Others worry a fragile economy and weak consumer sentiment couldn't weather higher borrowing costs, with slowing U.S. growth set to have a knock-on effect already.\n\n--Reuters contributed to this report\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTop 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead\n\nAustralia signs $1.4 billion deal to upgrade navy submarines\n\nBeing boring key to central bank success says SNB's Jordan\n\nView comments",

        "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: PT hikes for Nvidia, Apple; Tesla downside risk flagged",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nAnalysts lift Nvidia PTs ahead of Blackwell launch\n\nPiper Sandler analysts on Monday reaffirmed an Overweight rating for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and raised their target price from $120 to $140 in a move driven by strong expectations ahead of the company's earnings report for the July quarter and guidance for the October quarter.\n\n\"We see the strong business trends exhibited over the prior year by NVDA set to continue aided by the official launch of the Blackwell architecture in the October quarter,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThe investment bank views the launch of the Blackwell architecture as a catalyst for a new phase of growth, anticipating continued strong demand from cloud service providers (CSPs), enterprises, and sovereign entities. Analysts believe that demand for NVIDIA's upcoming B100/B200 products will significantly outpace supply.\n\nIn its bullish scenario, Piper Sandler says NVDA could exceed expectations by more than $2 billion in reported revenue for the July quarter, thanks to a recovery in networking supply.\n\n\"In our view, NVDA continues to be a premier player in the accelerated compute and gen AI end market,\" the analysts added.\n\nSimilarly, Loop Capital analysts increased their price target for Nvidia stock from $120 to $175, citing the company's potential to significantly exceed consensus revenue and earnings estimates for fiscal 2026.\n\nAmazon ‘most favored among mega-caps’ - Wells Fargo\n\nWells Fargo analysts have identified Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as the \"most favored long among mega-caps\" as the tech giant approaches its second-quarter earnings report.\n\nDespite mixed hedge fund positioning for competitors like Meta (NASDAQ:META), Wells Fargo believes Amazon stands out due to strong performance expectations and positive forward commentary.\n\nThe bank's analysts predict an 18% increase in Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue for the second quarter, with a sufficient operating income (OI) guidance of $16 billion for the third quarter.\n\nWells Fargo also plans to closely monitor Amazon's air freight commentary, estimating its impact on third-quarter operating income to be in the $200-$400 million range.\n\n\"See AMZN as the most favored long among mega-caps vs. META with more mixed HF positioning,\" the analysts stated, highlighting strong investor sentiment towards Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey note that the upcoming second-quarter earnings reports will be critical for understanding CapEx allocation and return time frames, especially given potential changes in AI strategy at AWS following the recent CEO change.\n\nApple seen as ‘more stable AI play for volatile times’, PT hiked\n\nRaymond James analysts have raised their stock price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $250 from $200, describing the company as \"a more stable AI play for volatile times.\" The firm maintained an Outperform rating on the stock, expecting a slight beat in F3Q24 results and an outlook in line with previous expectations.\n\nThis optimism is based on recent conversations in the Asia supply chain, TSM results, and China CAICT data, all indicating positive near-term trends for iPhone and Mac sales.\n\n\"We expect a slight beat and largely in-line outlook,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nWhile near-term results may not significantly impact the AI narrative, Raymond James remains \"optimistic that upcoming AI features will drive a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle.\"\n\nThe firm pointed to upward revisions in iPhone 16 builds for the second half of 2024, based on supply chain conversations, and mentioned significant changes to the internals of the iPhone 17, indicating Apple's increased focus on enhancing on-device AI capabilities.\n\n\"Supply chain data also points to material changes to iPhone 17 internals, suggesting that Apple is looking to do more AI on the device,\" analysts noted.\n\nApple's unique position in offering on-device AI features stems from its strong ecosystem, advanced hardware capabilities, and a focus on privacy.\n\n\"We believe Apple is in a unique position to offer on-device AI features given its ecosystem strength, hardware capabilities, and privacy focus,\" the note added.\n\nBaird: Buy QCOM after recent pullback\n\nEarlier in the week, Baird analysts added Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock as a “Bullish Fresh Pick” and increased their target price on the stock to $250.\n\nThis revision follows Baird’s initial channel feedback, which revealed a procurement units estimate of over 90 million for the upcoming iPhone 16, a significant rise from the low 80 million units of previous iPhone launches.\n\n“Similar to the Galaxy S24 launch earlier this year, AI is the driver,” analysts noted.\n\nThey expect strengthening demand trends in Qualcomm's handset business in the third quarter of the calendar year, following a seasonal trough in the second quarter and a year-over-year comparison trough in the first quarter.\n\nBaird’s team believes that AI will drive double-digit increases in Qualcomm's average selling prices (ASPs) for various components, starting with the iPhone 16 in the second half of this year. Moreover, initial AI content in high-end phones from Chinese smartphone OEMs will contribute, followed by the next-generation Galaxy platform in the first half of 2025.\n\nRadio Frequency (RF) ASP and content are also expected to benefit from AI beginning in the second half, driven by higher performance, faster uplinks, and greater integration.\n\nAdditionally, the investment firm pointed out a strong initial response for Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite processor in South Korea, as the chipmaker is the first to market in the initial wave of AI in PCs.\n\nSamsung (KS:005930) has launched Copilot+ PCs based on the X Elite, with demand surpassing initial channel expectations. Besides Samsung, the X Elite is also currently being shipped by HP (NYSE:HPQ), Dell (NYSE:DELL), Acer, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Lenovo.\n\n“We would be buyers of QCOM shares on recent share pullback,” the analysts concluded.\n\nUBS says AI optionality already priced in Tesla stock, sees downside risk\n\nUBS analysts have reiterated their Sell rating on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), citing substantial downside risk due to overvaluation and challenges in the automotive business highlighted in its latest quarterly report.\n\nThey believe Tesla's stock, which is currently trading at over 100 times its run-rate EPS of approximately $2.25, has a considerable amount of AI optionality already priced in, resulting in an inflated valuation.\n\n\"TSLA 2Q24 results showed the stress on the automotive business, just to keep vehicle deliveries ~1.78mm annualized units (which would be -2% y/y),\" analysts noted.\n\nThe bank pointed out that Tesla's aggressive pricing and promotional strategies to stimulate demand have caused its auto gross margin, excluding credits, to drop to 14.6%, the lowest since the first quarter of 2019.\n\nAdjusting for higher-than-normal credits and restructuring charges, UBS estimates Tesla's run-rate EPS to be around $0.56, which still includes a strong but potentially volatile quarter for its Energy business.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are skeptical about the near-term drivers for Tesla's earnings. While the introduction of a new lower-cost model and increased Full Self-Driving (FSD) take rates could provide some support, the analysts argue that even an improvement of $1 per share in earnings would still leave the stock trading at over 75 times its price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nThe analysts assert that Tesla's current stock price heavily relies on future AI initiatives such as robo-taxis and Optimus humanoid robots.\n\nThey believe Tesla's stock faces more downside risk if confidence in these AI initiatives wavers. Upcoming events like Robo-taxi day on October 10 could trigger a \"sell-the-news\" reaction, emphasizing the overvaluation of the stock based on uncertain future opportunities, analysts explained.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: PT hikes for Nvidia, Apple; Tesla downside risk flagged\n\nWhat are the best trades to position for a red wave in the US election?\n\nWould the US outperform if Trump wins a clean sweep?\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The 2024 Q2 earnings season continues to roll on, with next week’s reporting docket stacked with many notable names. The period has remained positive so far, with the big banks’ results not causing any spooks.\n\nConcerning next week’s docket, several Mag 7 members, including Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, and Apple AAPL, all report. All three stocks have been big-time performers in 2024, with many wondering if their momentum can continue.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at how they stack up heading into the releases.\n\nApple’s China Sales in Focus\n\nApple shares were scrutinized for their slow start to 2024 but have picked up considerable steam lately, up 14% overall YTD. Worries surrounding China and falling behind in AI weighed on performance, though these concerns seem to have temporarily subsided.\n\nThe stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with earnings expectations for the period to be reported ticking higher over the last several months. The $1.34 expected suggests a 6% climb from the year-ago period, with sales also expected to be up 2.7% Y/Y. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company experienced woes in China throughout its latest period, but overall, sales came in much closer to expectations relative to other periods, missing our consensus estimate by $220 million vs. a $2.5 billion miss in the previous period.\n\nIn addition, favorable news surrounding iPhone shipments in China has been announced over recent weeks, further easing fears. Investors will also be focused on the company’s Services portfolio, which has been a solid growth driver over recent periods and has helped ease reliance on iPhone results.\n\nAs shown below, Services results have beat our expectations regularly as of late outside of one instance. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon’s AWS in the Spotlight\n\nAMZN was firing on all cylinders throughout its latest period, with operating income of $15.3 billion 220% higher year-over-year. Most importantly, AWS delivered great results, with net sales of $25 billion showing 17% year-over-year growth and snapping a recent streak of negative surprises on the metric.\n\nMany had feared a cloud slowdown, which was present for a few periods, but the recent results overall paint a picture of positivity heading into the upcoming release. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings and revenue expectations for the upcoming release have primarily been muted, but big growth is expected, with EPS expected to be up 63% on 10% higher sales. Easing costs and operational efficiencies have aided profitability in a big way, leading to meaningful margin expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that the chart below is on a trailing twelve-month basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms CapEx Under Scrutiny\n\nMETA’s improved operational efficiencies have boosted its profitability significantly, leading to robust EPS growth over recent quarters.\n\nInvestors will be looking for color on CapEx trends surrounding AI, which was also a focal point in Alphabet’s quarterly release. Earnings expectations for the release have ticked higher over recent months, with the $4.69 per share expected reflecting 45% Y/Y growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning key metrics, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Advertising revenue stands at $37.5 billion, 20% higher than the year-ago period. It’s worth noting here that Alphabet’s Advertising business showed great results, with sales of $64.6 billion climbing 12% year-over-year.\n\nMETA shares plunged following its latest set of quarterly results, with the negativity attributed to a higher CapEx guide for its current fiscal year. As mentioned above, the development will certainly be monitored closely among investors, with peer Alphabet spooking some with its higher than expected CapEx.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe 2024 Q2 earnings season continues to chug along, with a notably stacked reporting docket this week. Another period of positivity is expected, underpinned by another strong showing from Tech.\n\nSeveral Mag 7 members report this week, a list that includes Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, and Apple AAPL. Their results will undoubtedly be scrutinized given the momentum they’ve enjoyed in 2024, perhaps reflecting the most important week of the Q2 cycle overall.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With a $4.8 million ad campaign, a full-court press on Capitol Hill and the US Constitution, TikTok is in a multifront fight for its survival.\n\n“They’re out in full force,” said Joel Thayer, a Republican lawyer who helped push the legislation, arguing the company’s data collection and ties to the Chinese government make it a national security threat. “It’s end-of-life for them. It’s a very well-orchestrated play.”\n\nTikTok’s fate rests in part with US courts after it sued to overturn the law signed by President Joe Biden forcing ByteDance to sell the app by Jan. 19 or be barred from operating in the US. The government’s response is due Friday ahead of oral arguments in September, and the company is prepared to take its case to the Supreme Court.\n\nWith more than 170 million monthly US users, TikTok has a lot at stake. A ban would exclude ByteDance from the world’s most lucrative advertising market and give an immediate boost to rivals like Meta Platforms Inc.’s Reels or YouTube’s Shorts.\n\nIn court filings, TikTok called the law “fundamentally at odds with the Constitution’s commitment to both free speech and individual liberty.” It also insisted that China’s government cannot access US users’ data and said Congress has not substantiated its claims of a national security threat.\n\n“We remain convinced the law is on our side and the courts will overturn this unconstitutional ban,” said Alex Haurek, a TikTok spokesperson.\n\nOutside Washington, the video-sharing platform is waging a parallel battle for public opinion.\n\nSince 2023, TikTok has shelled out over $4.8 million for ads promoting stories about how the app improved users’ lives, according to ad analytics company AdImpact. It’s also helping fund a lawsuit against the US from content creators who were approached by Davis Wright Tremaine, a law firm that’s defended big tech companies including Meta and Amazon.com Inc.\n\nEight TikTok creators — including a Texas rancher, a college football coach and a Maryland book lover who promotes Black authors — appeared as plaintiffs, arguing that a ban would trample their First Amendment rights.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I definitely couldn’t afford this,” said Paul Tran, one of the plaintiffs and a skincare line co-founder. “They are helping us to fight this.”\n\nSupreme Court Specialists\n\nTikTok laid the groundwork for its defense long before the divest-or-ban law passed in April. In 2020, then-President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning the app on national security grounds, but it was rescinded under Biden amid a series of court challenges.\n\nBack in 2020, TikTok was represented by a handful of attorneys from white-shoe law firm Covington & Burling, and since then the platform has added lawyers from Chicago-based law firm Mayer Brown.\n\nAnticipating a Supreme Court review, TikTok brought on Mayer Brown’s Andrew Pincus, a former assistant to the US solicitor general who has argued 30 cases before the justices and represented other big tech companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Spotify Technology SA.\n\nThe creators are also getting help from Supreme Court heavyweights, including O’Melveny’s Jeffrey Fisher, who has argued four dozen cases in the country’s highest court and Joshua Revesz, who once clerked for Justice Elena Kagan.\n\n“The creators have distinct and important First Amendment rights in this case and we’re proud to be challenging the government’s unconstitutional ban on their behalf,” said Ambika Kumar, a lawyer from Davis Wright Tremaine who’s the lead attorney for the creators.\n\nAttorneys with Supreme Court expertise typically charge hundreds to thousands of dollars an hour. In 2020, Fisher billed $1,555 an hour to fight an anti-abortion law in Louisiana that the Supreme Court struck down, according to court records.\n\nThose hires could give TikTok an edge at the Supreme Court, according to Adam Feldman, creator of the Empirical SCOTUS blog. Pincus and Fisher know the justices and how to frame their arguments, said Feldman.\n\n“There is the ability for the interaction to be a lot more conversational than adversarial,” Feldman said.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts now give TikTok a 60% chance of prevailing in court, up from 30% when the lawsuit was first filed. That could change if the Justice Department offers evidence of a national security threat that US intelligence officials presented to Congress in closed-door sessions.\n\nLobbying Blitz\n\nTikTok shelled out millions in the months before the law was signed, and its lobbyists have continued to blanket Capitol Hill as the court case plays out. ByteDance spent nearly $6 million on lobbying during the first half of 2024, up from $3.5 million during the first half of 2023.\n\nTikTok said part of the latest quarter’s spending rise was due to employees’ stock vesting, which counted as salary increases. But the company has also expanded its presence with new hires and forceful messaging against the potential ban.\n\nTikTok’s roster of 47 outside lobbyists features several former lawmakers, including New York Democrat Joe Crowley, who was defeated by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after nearly 20 years in office; California Republican Jeff Denham; and Illinois Republican Rodney Davis.\n\nA congressional aide familiar with TikTok’s lobbying said Davis, Crowley, Denham and former Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott have been pivotal, thanks to their longterm relationships in Congress.\n\nTikTok also has built a team of 15 in-house lobbyists, including Alex Harman, who previously focused on regulating big tech companies, and Elizabeth Oblinger, a one-time eBay Inc. lobbyist and staffer to former Ohio Republican Senator Rob Portman.\n\nThe company’s representatives have lambasted lawmakers for passing an unconstitutional bill and argued that a TikTok ban will only benefit Meta, said two congressional staffers who requested anonymity to divulge private conversations. Several TikTok lobbyists have expressed confidence that the law will be overturned, framing it as a legislative failure by Congress.\n\n“With Republicans, they are really trying to pitch themselves as the alternative to Instagram and Meta,” Thayer said.\n\nThat argument echoes Trump’s own turnabout on TikTok — and his criticism of Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg over Facebook’s decision to boot Trump from the platform after the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, US Capitol riot.\n\nIn a recent Bloomberg Businessweek interview, the Republican presidential nominee reversed his prior support for a ban, saying “I’m for TikTok because you need competition. If you don’t have TikTok, you have Facebook and Instagram — and that’s, you know, that’s Zuckerberg.”\n\nTikTok responded by saying Meta had orchestrated an anti-TikTok campaign, citing earlier reporting by The Washington Post. Meta declined to comment.\n\nAs part of its campaign in Washington, TikTok has also assembled a group of hard-nosed communications staffers led by former Walt Disney Co. executive Zenia Mucha. Several spokespeople for TikTok and ByteDance previously worked at big tech companies, such as Jodi Seth, a veteran of both Meta and Amazon.\n\nFive-Star Stay\n\nTikTok has also enlisted the help of its content creators, who filmed commercials and visited the nation’s capital this spring to make their case. In August, the company also plans to send some of them to the National Conference of State Legislatures in Kentucky to tell their stories.\n\n“We are proud so many members of our creator community could take time from their personal lives, their families, and their small businesses to explain how the unconstitutional TikTok ban would impact them,” Haurek said.\n\nTrevor Boffone, a teacher from Texas, said he participated in an ad filmed in Washington before the House voted on an earlier version of the bill in March. It opens with a rancher holding a sign at the US Capitol that reads “TikTok changed my life for the better.” That rancher, also known as “Cattle Guy,” is one of the lawsuit’s lead plaintiffs.\n\nBoffone was among more than 50 content creators, spouses and TikTok staff to meet with lawmakers and staff, according to him and several other participants. The company funded the trip, hiring Los Angeles-based Innovate Marketing Group to help with logistics, which included a stay at the five-star Salamander Hotel and two dinners at Michelin-rated chef Johnny Spero’s Bar Spero and Jose Andres’ Bazaar in the Waldorf Astoria.\n\nAmanda Ma, chief executive officer of Innovate Marketing Group, declined to comment. TikTok encouraged creators to send media requests through the company’s public relations staff and prohibited them from keeping or sharing an information package that was distributed at the start of the gathering.\n\nUltimately, the creators’ efforts fell short. At the end of their visit, the bill passed the House on a vote of 352 to 65, and the divest-or-ban language was included a month later in must-pass foreign aid legislation that Biden signed at the end of April.\n\nTikTok’s efforts have come under fire by some lawmakers.\n\n“Big Tech, including TikTok, and its army of high-powered lawyers and lobbyists continue to put profits over people — fighting meaningful reforms that safeguard users for their own benefit,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, in a statement. “It’s time we protect consumers, competition, and privacy and stamp out special interests’ influence for good,” he said.\n\nBoffone and other creators dismissed criticism that TikTok was using them for its own benefit.\n\n“I love TikTok,” he said. “It is an important part of my life. It is an important part of my livelihood.”\n\n--With assistance from Jamie Tarabay and Kurt Wagner.\n\n(Updates with comment from Senator Blumenthal in third from last paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Miseducation of America’s Nurse Practitioners Joe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy’s New Kingmaker The $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Disney Bets on Deadpool, Wolverine and Dirty Jokes to Save Marvel The US Economy Is Slowing, Which Is Just Fine With the Fed\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Tantalizing Tech Stocks to Buy on the Dip",
        "content": "Tech stocks comprise many of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. This sector features many high-growth companies that can scale their revenue and profits over time. Many corporations within the industry have annual recurring revenue models.\n\nHowever, a major weakness of most tech stocks is that they amass high valuations. Many investors get excited about a tech stock’s long-term potential, and they pile into the stock. That results in astronomical P/E ratios. Those elevated valuations require impressive financial growth to maintain. When growth stocks in the tech sector disappoint, their shares can plummet.\n\nWhile some investors may panic about sharp dips, savvy investors view some of those dips as long-term buying opportunities. Dips present great potential for long-term returns, but having a few good stocks on your radar is a good idea. These are some of the tech stocks that investors may want to consider on dips.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) became a household name in one of the worst ways possible. Issues with a few lines of code in an update caused a global IT outage that affected many industries and consumers. The cybersecurity giant is in a PR crisis, prompting some bulls to express caution.\n\nShares have lost almost 30% of their value in a matter of days and are up by 9% year-to-date. It starkly contrasts Crowdstrike’s 55% year-to-date gain at the end of June. While Crowdstrike is currently dealing with a black eye, investors and business owners will likely forget about this episode within a few years.\n\nRemember Cambridge Analytica? The scandal was a nightmare for investors of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). The stock dropped by more than 40% from its peak within a few months as people lost trust in the company. Some people panicked and sold their shares during that tumultuous time. It may have looked like a smart move then, but Meta Platforms’ stock has more than tripled from its 2018 lows. When people talk about Meta Platforms today, no one mentions Cambridge Analytica.\n\nCrowdstrike is likely to face a similar journey. While this year may be brutal, Crowdstrike will probably reclaim its all-time high and reward patient investors. The company has a strong lead in the industry, impressive growth rates and $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue.\n\nCommVault Systems (CVLT)\n\nSource: sdecoret / Shutterstock.com\n\nCommVault Systems (NASDAQ:CVLT) is another cybersecurity company opposite Crowdstrike. While Crowdstrike is a big-name stock enduring a fallout, CommVault Systems is a more obscure cybersecurity stock gaining momentum.\n\nStory continues\n\nA 63% year-to-date gain should draw some attention, as that’s much higher than the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite’s year-to-date returns. The $5.5 billion company also only has a 33 P/E ratio. That’s a lower valuation than what you’ll find for most cybersecurity stocks.\n\nCommVault Systems also delivers solid financial growth. Q4 FY24 revenue increased by 10% year over year to reach $223.3 million. The fast-growing subscription revenue segment increased by 27% year over year and made up more than half of the company’s revenue. CommVault Systems now generates $770 million in annual recurring revenue. The firm even had leftover capital to initiate a $184.0 million stock buyback throughout fiscal 2024. Revenue and profits are rising for the undervalued cybersecurity stock.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has established itself as the online advertising leader. Google and YouTube are two of the most visited websites, and they have garnered billions of dollars in quarterly revenue. The company continued to grow in both segments with its Q2 2024 results. Revenue increased by 14% YOY, while net income was up by 28.6% YOY.\n\nYouTube ad revenue increased by 13% YOY, while Google Cloud revenue was up by 28.8% YOY. Google Cloud should continue to benefit from AI tailwinds. More companies are hosting AI apps using Google Cloud and other cloud platforms. Switching from Google Cloud once a company sets up its digital infrastructure is also very difficult.\n\nAlphabet has outperformed the stock market for many years, and a newly issued dividend only improves the stock’s prospects. Shares are up by 32% year-to-date and have almost tripled over the past five years. The stock has a reasonable 28.5 P/E ratio, which offers a decent margin of safety. The stock is down from its all-time high, but Alphabet should reclaim that level for long-term investors.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CRWD, CVLT, and GOOG.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Buy as Trump-Vance Ticket Promises an Innovation Ramp",
        "content": "While many have stated that former President Donald Trump’s vice presidential pick in JD Vance was him doubling down to appeal to Rust Belt voters, there might be a different angle as to why Trump selected Vance. That’s because, for around five years, Vance was a venture capitalist, meaning his role as vice president could also result in pro-business and low regulation for tech companies. This means that artificial intelligence companies on the leading edge of the tech sector could see their AI innovation stocks soar following a win in November from Trump and Vance.\n\nMoreover, Trump likely picked Vance to signal to the big investors in Silicon Valley that helping him get elected would lead to a technology and business boom. As such, both retail investors and institutional investors have a lot to gain in the case of the Trump-Vance ticket victory. Thus, here are three AI innovation stocks that will likely see a boost following a Republican win of the presidency.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen looking at Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) predicted total business expense range of $94-99 billion for 2024, the concept of innovation and research comes straight to the forefront. Unsurprisingly, a significant portion of these expenses come from its commitment to computing expansion as Meta begins to transition toward extensive AI investment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMore specifically, Meta is one of the leading companies that is researching and attempting to achieve artificial general intelligence. The reason for this innovation stems from the fact that this type of AI exceeds many of the functions of regular AI, which eats up far more computer processing. That processing eats up significant energy, which a Trump-Vance administration would aim to keep cheap.\n\nShould the duo win the White House, they would also likely loosen data usage regulations or prevent them from going forward. Meta stock could see generous increases in the next four years.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPeter Thiel, Trump and Vance all have an interconnected relationship of funding, financial support and potentially even friendship. As such, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) sits poised for AI innovation perfection. This comes even despite the current analyst concerns that it may have hit a ceiling.\n\nConsidering the company was able to grow its customer base by 79% in just two years, a four-year period of gentle corporate taxes and limited regulation could send PLTR stock even higher. Moreover, the company was able to add over 220 new revenue sources at the same time. This commitment to growth could drive investor excitement as the company continues to become more relevant through increased contracts and revenue streams.\n\nStory continues\n\nUltimately, PLTR presents an attractive opportunity for investors, with its current price being quite accessible. I recommend considering PLTR as one of the top stocks to buy right now, primarily due to the significant data processing demands driven by the rapidly growing AI industry.\n\nFastly (FSLY) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Fastly (FSLY) website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast but not least among AI innovation stocks that could benefit from Trump is Fastly (NYSE:FSLY). The company focuses on edge computing for AI and other data processing applications. Its main product line is known as the Edge Cloud Platform which functions through a developed global server network strategically positioned closer to users than traditional data centers.\n\nThis proximity allows Fastly to offer reduced latency as data travels shorter distances, resulting in faster loading times and improved responsiveness. Consequently, the company’s primary customers include providers in entertainment, e-commerce, and fintech. Fastly’s edge computing can process substantial data at high speeds, supporting everything from financial calculations to high-definition streaming.\n\nHowever, all of this innovation comes at a research and development cost as well as expensive energy expenditures. Thus, although Fastly has not consistently reported net income yet, its potential is strong. That’s because if the Trump-Vance ticket wins, the company will likely face lower corporate taxes and lower energy costs, freeing up cash flow and improving its margins.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "title": "Meta's AI Revolution Begins",
        "content": "Meta Platforms Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) rapid expansion, the fastest since 2021, has been driven by aggressive monetization and deep artificial intelligence integration into its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram.\n\nIts AI-powered recommendations have significantly increased user engagement, with 30% of Facebook posts and 50% of Instagram stories utilizing these systems. This surge in AI use has also boosted ad revenue.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with META.\n\nDespite the premium valuation, the company's strong performance underscores its position as an AI leader, signaling additional upside for the stock.\n\nHow AI-driven monetization doubles Meta's profitability\n\nMeta, which owns some of the most popular social networking apps, recorded year-over-year top-line growth of 27% for the first quarter, coming in at $36.46 billion and topping the Street's estimates of $36.14 billion.\n\nThe company achieved its fastest period of expansion since 2021 on the back of aggressive monetization in its suite of applications and deep integration of AI features into its leading platforms. For example, Facebook reported that 30% of the posts used a certain kind of AI-powered recommendation system. Similarly, AI ensures it keeps 50% of stories on Instagram parallel to users' requirements, enhancing engagement and promoting more advertising campaigns.\n\nThe overall revenue increase was less spectacular. Still, Meta's bottom line effectively doubled, with net income hitting $12.37 billion, or $4.71 a share, versus $5.71 billion, or $2.20 a share, in the prior period. This leap was driven by a 16% reduction in sales and marketing costs, lower restructuring expenses and decreased professional services and marketing use.\n\nAlthough Meta does not report daily and monthly active users for its individual platforms, the company had more than 3.24 billion daily active people across its family of apps, creating strong momentum in which it offers one of the few brand-safe environments where advertisers can spend money to effectively reach this massive user base. Meta's AI Revolution Begins\n\nConsequently, the family average revenue per person declined by 9% quarter over quarter to $36.46 billion; still, the number suggests growth of 18% from the prior year. This describes how Meta monetizes its consumer base and generates revenue.\n\nAdditionally, the 20% increase in ad impressions was primarily driven by Asia-Pacific and the Rest of the World. However, most of this came from Asia-Pacific, where ad impressions grew 28% compared with 16% growth in North America and 20% growth globally. However, this marked a deceleration from the growth of 34% recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, the company witnessed a 6% rise in the average price of ads.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, major Chinese e-tailersfor example, Temu and Sheinimmensely helped to accelerate ad impression in the Asia-Pacific region on Facebook for selling inexpensive products to American and European clients, accounting for approximately 10% of the company's total profit.\n\nMeta Projects strong revenue amid rising costs and AI investments\n\nFor the second quarter, Meta expects revenue in the range of $36.50 billion to $39 billion, offset by a 1% currency headwind. The company expects expenses between $96 billion and $99 billion, up slightly from the impacts of infrastructure and higher legal charges vis-a-vis prior guidance. Operating losses by Reality Labs are expected to balloon because of investments in the development of products and their scale.\n\nThe full-year 2024 capital expenditures guidance has been raised to $35 billion to $40 billion.\n\nThe company also remains vigilant regarding regulatory headwinds in the European Union and the U.S. It was a solid start for the year, with momentum through the Family of Apps and significant progress on AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to change the way people interact for years to come.\n\nAdditionally, generative AI is an inherent part of Meta's investment to create value in the long run. At least one significant player includes Meta, which boasts a vast AI team and robust computing infrastructure. The company has introduced a new model of generative AI technologies called Llama 3, which makes it an active assistant to create means for building new models. Therefore, such integrations of AI enhance targeted advertising, Meta's primary revenue source. AI will make the Facebook, Instagram and Reels interface very engaging to the user by basing personal content around user preferences.\n\nAccording to AI and tech expert Puneet Gogia, AI chat tools for businesses on WhatsApp saw a 40% increase in paid messaging, with potential for ad integration. Enhanced tracking tools like Event Measurement improved ad performance, increasing sales by 9.50% and trackable sales by 20%. Lastly, efficient investments in AI systems, public code sharing and AI chip development strengthened the company's financial stability, positioning it as an AI leader.\n\nAd competition amid AI investments and economic risks\n\nCompetition in digital advertising has to be one of the most significant risks standing in the way of Meta Platforms achieving its desired growth rates. The company does not operate a monopoly in the lucrative field. Still, it faces stiff competition from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which invests heavily in artificial intelligence to strengthen targeted advertising on search and YouTube.\n\nAdditionally, deterioration in the growth prospects of the U.S. economy could also pose significant risks to Meta Platforms' lucrative advertising business. Given that the company generates 98% of its sales from advertising, any economic downturn could be followed by significant cuts in ad spending, which could spell trouble for the company's revenue base. Thus, the company has also warned that it continues to watch the EU and U.S. regulatory landscape, which could impact its business and financial results.\n\nAn over 41% rally year to date has left Meta Platforms trading at a forward price-earnings multiple of 25. Nevertheless, compared to its peers, the stock appears to be trading at a discount, going by the average price-earnings ratio of 31 for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100. Given the double-digit percentage growth in revenue and earnings, it is justifiable for the company to trade at a premium given the solid underlying fundamentals.\n\nThe company is also sitting on a boatload of cash. It ended the first quarter with $12.5 billion in free cash flow, allowing it to aggressively invest in high-growth initiatives, such as augmented and virtual reality devices, the metaverse and AI.\n\nBacked by a solid balance sheet, Meta Platforms has returned value to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. For starters, it repurchased $14.64 billion in shares in the first quarter, reducing its shares in circulation, which is expected to bolster earnings per share in the long run. The company also paid $1.27 billion in dividends for a dividend yield of 0.41%.\n\nBottom line\n\nMeta's direction has been explosive, rallying more than 58% over the past 12 months. The rally was backed by solid underlying fundamentals, including substantial user growth numbers in its family of apps, which drove revenue up 27% in the first quarter. The company is also seeing a better balance between ad impressions and price, which allows it to generate more revenue.\n\nThe company is becoming more efficient and attractive to advertisers by integrating AI tools to enhance advertising campaigns, which affirms its long-term growth prospects. Given the stock is trading at a discount, it remains a solid long-term play amid the AI frenzy, having reiterated its commitment to returning cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Meta Platforms, Amazon and Alphabet",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – July 26, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nBuy Big Tech/AI Stocks Ahead of Earnings, or Wait?\n\nToday's episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks dives into the wave of selling that sent the Nasdaq tumbling to start the heart of big tech earnings season on Wednesday. The episode then explores Meta Platforms and Amazon stock before their upcoming earnings releases to see if investors should buy the top tech stocks before earnings or wait for more selling.\n\nTechnology stocks and other first-half standouts tanked on Wednesday, sending the Nasdaq below its 50-day moving average for only the second time in 2024.\n\nThe selling came as the busy stretch of technology earnings kicked off after the closing bell on Tuesday, with Alphabet and Tesla.\n\nTech stocks and the market could experience more selling and volatility throughout earnings season, especially since big tech set the bar very high.\n\nThankfully, the tailwinds that sent the stock market soaring in the first half remain in place. Any near-term selling represents a healthy recalibration and an opportunity for investors to buy their favorite stocks at discounts.\n\nThe two stocks we explore today are tech giants and AI investments.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. – Q2 Earnings Wednesday, July 31\n\nMeta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, grew its daily active users by 7% in Q1 to 3.24 billion. Meta grew its ad impressions delivered across its family of apps by 20%.\n\nMeta stands to thrive in a world full of smartphone addicts. Meta is also investing heavily in its AI future. Mark Zuckerberg's goal is for Meta to win the AI race by rolling out open source artificial intelligence.\n\nMeta shares have soared roughly 400% off the market's 2022 lows to blow away Alphabet and plenty of tech giants. The stock has also climbed 520% in the past 10 years vs. the Zacks Tech sector's 310%.\n\nThis context helps Meta's valuation look all the more impressive, with Meta trading at a 63% discount to its highs and 20% below the Zacks Tech sector at 22.4X forward 12-month earnings.\n\nMeta stock has fallen 14% from its early July highs heading into its quarterly earnings release. Meta stock is trading below its 50-day and 21-week moving averages. Meta trades at roughly neutral RSI levels on a 10-year timeframe after hitting its most overbought levels of the last decade earlier this year.\n\nMeta's recent cooldown makes the stock a potentially more appealing long-term buy-and-hold candidate for investors who can weather near-term volatility. It is worth remembering that Meta has a robust balance sheet and began paying a dividend earlier this year as it focuses on efficiency and profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon – Q2 Earnings Thursday, August 1\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy took over roughly three years ago with a mission to boost the bottom line while honing in on expansion in key growth areas.\n\nAmazon remains the king of e-commerce and its advertising unit is booming. AMZN also runs the world's largest cloud-computing business, topping rivals Microsoft and Alphabet, helping it thrive throughout the AI supercycle.\n\nAmazon is also diving headfirst into its AI efforts, with plans to devote more capex on its cloud computing and AI infrastructure than e-commerce going forward.\n\nAmazon's steady cloud computing and AI growth, coupled with its focus on boosting earnings is a winning pitch to Wall Street. Amazon's earnings outlook has soared over the last year for FY24 and FY25 to help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nAmazon stock has skyrocketed 1,000% in the last 10 years vs. Tech's 300%, Apple's 800%, and Alphabet's 480%. Yet Amazon stock is down around 1% in the last three years compared to Tech's 25% run.\n\nAMZN failed to break out meaningfully above its 2021 highs. Amazon is currently trading 10% below its highs and 22% below its average Zacks price target.\n\nAmazon trades around its 21-week moving average and near neutral RSI levels on a 10-year timeframe. On the valuation front, Amazon trades 95% below its highs and at a 50% discount to its 10-year median at 35.1X forward 12-month earnings.\n\nOn top of that, Amazon trades near its lowest forward earnings multiple since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Countdown to Meta Platforms (META) Q2 Earnings: A Look at Estimates Beyond Revenue and EPS",
        "content": "Analysts on Wall Street project that Meta Platforms (META) will announce quarterly earnings of $4.69 per share in its forthcoming report, representing an increase of 45.2% year over year. Revenues are projected to reach $38.27 billion, increasing 19.6% from the same quarter last year.\n\nOver the last 30 days, there has been an upward revision of 0.6% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter, leading to its current level. This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe.\n\nPrior to a company's earnings announcement, it is crucial to consider revisions to earnings estimates. This serves as a significant indicator for predicting potential investor actions regarding the stock. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights.\n\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Meta Platforms metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Revenue- Reality Labs' will likely reach $411.04 million. The estimate points to a change of +48.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Revenue- Family of Apps (FoA)' will reach $37.83 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +19.3% year over year.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Revenue- Advertising' will reach $37.51 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +19.1% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- Other' should arrive at $332.31 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +47.7%.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Advertising Revenue- US & Canada' will reach $16.89 billion. The estimate points to a change of +19.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Advertising Revenue- Asia-Pacific' at $7.55 billion. The estimate points to a change of +17.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Advertising Revenue- Rest of the World' reaching $4.52 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +23.5%.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Advertising Revenue- Europe' to come in at $8.78 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +20.8% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Geographical Revenue by User- Rest of World' to reach $4.71 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +26%.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Headcount' should come in at 70,803. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 71,469 in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Family daily active people (DAP)' of $3.26 billion. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $3.07 billion.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)' stands at $11.61. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $8.32 in the same quarter last year.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Meta Platforms here>>>\r\n\r\nOver the past month, shares of Meta Platforms have returned -12.7% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.2% change.

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Meta, Apple, Amazon and also UK interest rates",
        "content": "With earnings season in full swing, key companies worldwide will provide insights into sector performance. Investors will be particularly focused on updates from some of the 'Magnificent Seven', which will reveal whether the artificial intelligence (AI) trend continues.\n\nThe Mag 7 stocks have endured a challenging period, with the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) major players – Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Amazon (AMZN) – experiencing a dramatic decline in market capitalisations. Amid a tech rout, these tech giants have collectively shed $1.128tn in market value, marking the largest such loss since May 2022.\n\nWith Tesla failing to impress, will the next earnings reports show strong performance or a lack of momentum? Here’s what to watch for:\n\nMeta (META) – Reports second-quarter results on Wednesday 31 July\n\nMeta Platforms is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, with significant investor attention on advertising revenue performance and updates regarding its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives following the announcement of its latest AI model.\n\nThe parent company of Facebook and Instagram is expected to report revenue of $38.35bn, reflecting a 20% increase compared to the same period last year, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Net income is projected to reach $12.31bn, or $4.71 per share, marking a substantial 58% year-over-year rise.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnalyst estimates for Q2 2024:\n\nRevenue: $38.35bn (Q1 2024: $36.46bn, Q2 2023: $32bn) Diluted Earnings Per Share: $4.71 (Q1 2024: $4.71, Q2 2023: $2.98) Net Income: $12.31bn (Q1 2024: $12.37bn, Q2 2023: $7.79bn)\n\nMeta's second-quarter ad revenue is a critical metric, with Citi analysts predicting a 20.5% growth from the previous year, reaching $37.95bn. This growth is attributed to a stronger advertising environment, increased adoption of Instagram Reels, and new advertising products.\n\nStory continues\n\nA survey conducted by Wedbush analysts revealed that most advertisers plan to either increase or maintain their spending on Meta platforms. This trend is expected to contribute to robust second-quarter results and set a positive trajectory for the company in the latter half of the year.\n\nEarlier this month, Meta introduced its Llama 3.1 open-source AI model. JP Morgan analysts believe this launch could position Meta AI as the leading AI assistant by the end of the year. The upcoming earnings report will provide Meta an opportunity to reassure investors that its increased investments in AI are yielding significant growth opportunities.\n\n“Mark Zuckerberg’s commentary is just as important as the numbers themselves. In today's landscape, throwing cash at AI is the aim of the game, but Meta needs to convince investors there’ll be a worthy return at the end of the road,” Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\nApple (AAPL) — Reports third-quarter results on Thursday 1 August\n\nApple has seen adjustments in stock price targets from several firms ahead of its upcoming fiscal third-quarter earnings report.\n\nJPMorgan has raised its stock price target for Apple to $265 from $245, maintaining an overweight rating on the shares. The firm has set a new year-end 2025 price target, moving away from its prior December 2024 target, as it anticipates investors will begin focusing beyond 2024. JPMorgan expects Apple to instil higher confidence with its forthcoming earnings report.\n\nIts analysts believe that Apple will reassure investors about the upcoming AI replacement cycle, set to commence significantly in fiscal 2025 and intensify into fiscal 2026. They note that Apple is leveraging a stronger launchpad in fiscal 2024, bolstered by better-than-expected revenue drivers from the iPhone and the company as a whole.\n\nThe investment bank has placed Apple shares on \"positive catalyst watch\" ahead of the earnings report, with a favourable outlook on share price performance.\n\nBarclays has also revised its stock price target for Apple, increasing it to $187 from $164, while maintaining an underweight rating on the shares. The firm has raised its forecasts for the September quarter, citing better performance in iPhone, Mac and Services, a trend not seen in several quarters. Barclays now projects a 9% revenue growth for Apple in 2025, following two years of relatively flat performance.\n\nDespite the improved numbers and the potential positive impact of an artificial intelligence-enhanced iPhone on investor sentiment, Barclays remains cautious. The bank points out that Apple's stock is trading at a 30-times price-to-earnings multiple, indicating less upside potential compared to other firms' projections.\n\nApple's AI services will be available starting this fall, but only for the current iPhone 15 Pro model, fuelling hopes for a new iPhone upgrade cycle.\n\nApple is expected to return to top-line growth for the June-ended quarter. The FactSet consensus is for revenue of $84.2bn, up 3% vs. the year-ago quarter. Adjusted profit is expected to rise 6% to $1.34 a share.\n\n“A note of caution stems from competition in China after back-to-back quarters of revenue declines. Investors will be watching closely for how the demand picture is evolving. Despite an overall decline in sales in the region, the flagship iPhone saw growth last quarter. News that the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max were the best-selling smartphones in urban China suggests that Apple's allure remains intact,” Britzman said.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) — Reports second-quarter results on Thursday 1 August\n\nAmazon is under the spotlight as Morgan Stanley projects the e-commerce titan to deliver robust Q2 earnings and provide optimistic guidance for Q3. Analysts at Morgan Stanley forecast that Amazon will exceed consensus estimates for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by 17% for Q2 and 10% for Q3, driven by improved profitability in North American retail and accelerated growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"North America retail profitability and the accelerating growth of AWS are key factors behind our projections,\" Morgan Stanley analysts noted.\n\nAs Amazon leverages its strong retail operations and expands its dominance in cloud computing, investors are optimistic about its financial performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth has also highlighted Amazon as a top pick for both the near and long term. Anmuth forecasts a near-term acceleration in AWS, predicting 20% growth in Q4 2024. This growth is expected to be fuelled by easing optimisations, new workload migrations, and the ramping up of GenAI monetization.\n\nAnmuth also anticipates a 190 basis point expansion in Amazon's North America operating income (OI) margin in 2024, supported by improvements in shipping and inventory placement, increased automation, and stronger advertising revenue. Amazon's free cash flow is expected to reach $66bn in 2024 and $86bn in 2025.\n\nFor Q2, investors are eyeing net sales between $148bn and $150bn, with operating income ranging from $14bn to $15bn or more.\n\n\"There was also a strong showing from both the e-commerce and advertising segments over the first quarter, something investors will be keen to see continue. But markets were a little unhappy with the second quarter profit guidance of $10bn-14bn, anything toward the top end of that range will likely be met with a positive reaction,\" noted Britzman.\n\nBank of England’s interest rate decision – Thursday 1 August\n\nObviously not a stock but one of the biggest market moving decisions in the UK. Traders are increasingly betting on the Bank of England (BoE) cutting interest rates this summer, driven by optimism that the US Federal Reserve is set to reduce borrowing costs.\n\nMoney markets now indicate more than a 50% chance that Bank of England policymakers will lower rates next week, with a 92% likelihood of a cut by September.\n\n“While softer labour market data support the rates market pricing in 12.5 bp (50%) of a 25 bp rate hike at its meeting next week, sticky inflation suggests that rates need to stay higher for longer. However, the case for a rate cut is building and is expected to be a line-ball decision,” analysts at IG said.\n\nEconomists are also confident that the first interest rate cut in over four years will occur next week, according to a Reuters poll. The survey revealed that the vast majority of economists expect the BoE to reduce interest rates at their August meeting.\n\nIf the forecast is accurate, borrowing costs will decrease as the central bank-controlled interest rate drops to 5%. The current rate stands at a 16-year high of 5.25% after 14 consecutive hikes. The Reuters poll, conducted between July 18 and 24, showed that over 80% of economists (49 out of 60) anticipate the BoE will implement the rate cut.\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Growth stocks give long-term investors the opportunity to outperform benchmarks like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. While some investors believe you have to search for obscure companies to outperform the indices, you can look within any index to find outperforming stocks.\n\nThat’s because indices like the S&P 500 have numerous companies that are generating steady losses. You can find hundreds of S&P 500 holdings in a given year that have lost value for investors. By definition, the top-performing holdings within an index outperform the index.\n\nHowever, past results isn’t enough to gauge if a stock will continue to outperform the broader market. It’s important to look at a company’s financials to determine if revenue and profit margins are expanding. Also, investors should consider each company’s catalysts and risks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTherefore, patient investors should consider monitoring some of these growth stocks that look ready to beat the market.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background.

The eyewear giant's CEO, Francesco Milleri, confirmed Meta's interest in becoming a shareholder, potentially deepening their long-standing collaboration on smart glasses technology.\n\n“We are proud that a company that knows us very well, after years of partnership, is convinced that our company can grow and make much better in the future,” he said.\n\nAnalysts from RBC Capital Markets, in a note, said that recent acquisitions like Heidelberg Engineering and Supreme are expected to broaden EssilorLuxottica's product offering, technological base, and customer reach.\n\nHowever, the analysts flagged potential concerns, including weaker-than-expected performance in North America and the possibility that cost pressures may outweigh the benefits of price and mix improvements.\n\nThe company's two key growth drivers were EMEA and Asia-Pacific, with both regions seeing double-digit growth. EssilorLuxottica's Stellest myopia management portfolio and Ray-Ban Meta wearables continued to grow exponentially.\n\nRBC rates EssilorLuxottica as “Sector Perform” with a price target of €200. The analysts view the stock as a high-quality company with a defensive business model but believe the stock is fairly valued at this time.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nRay-Ban parent EssilorLuxottica shares rise on strong H1 results\n\nLuxury giant HermÃ¨s delivers strong H1, shares climb\n\nWoes at Qoo10's South Korean e-commerce units intensify as companies cut ties\n\nView comments",

Milleri said the maker of Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses isn’t planning a capital increase dedicated to Meta and the US firm would buy shares on the market if it wants to become a shareholder.\n\nHe didn’t elaborate on the size of the stake Meta may buy and on the timing of the purchase.\n\nThe world’s biggest manufacturer and retailer of eyewear posted adjusted net income of €1.75 billion ($1.9 billion) in the first half, 10.6% higher compared to the same period last year at constant exchange rates and higher than consensus. Revenues were in line with analysts’ forecasts at €13.3 billion.\n\nPerformance in Europe, Middle East and Africa, where revenue jumped 7.9% in the second quarter compared to the same period a year prior, offset lower growth in North America, held back by a decline in comparable-store sales at Sunglass Hut, the company said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nEssilorLuxottica and Meta have been cooperating on smart glasses for a few years. In 2021, Meta unveiled its first Ray-Ban smart glasses set on the Wayfarer frame to let users take photos and videos, listen to music and answer calls. Newer glasses incorporate MetaAI, an artificial intelligence assistant based on its Llama AI model.\n\n“We spend a lot of time together,” Milleri said. We have “a strong relationship with Mark Zuckerberg and the top management of Meta.”\n\n(Retops story with Meta interest in stake, rewrites throughout.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Miseducation of America’s Nurse Practitioners The $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into The US Economy Is Slowing, Which Is Just Fine With the Fed Elon Musk Goes All In for Trump The Real Reason Erewhon Is a Cult Brand\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

The Fed Needs to Cut Rates Now. Wall Street Goes Risk-On After US Economic Data: Markets Wrap Markets Tear Up Popular Trades That Reached ‘Stupid Levels’\n\nMeta acquired WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion, and while the app has amassed billions of users worldwide and become a staple in countries such as Brazil and India, its presence in the US has lagged behind. Meta has recently promoted WhatsApp as a bridge between “blue and green bubble” users in the US, referring to the different displays for messages on iPhone and Android phones. Meta recently ran a television commercial with the cast of ABC’s Modern Family, showing the family combining their mix of phones in a single group chat on WhatsApp.\n\nMore US users would improve Meta’s effort to build out WhatsApp’s business, which has been slower to materialize than some expected. The US market is typically the most lucrative for advertising, and Meta says click-to-message ads that send a user from their Facebook or Instagram feeds to a direct message conversation with a business are already a multibillion-dollar business.\n\nMeta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg announced the new milestone on his WhatsApp channel Thursday. The company also said the total number of messages sent by US users is growing double digits compared with a year earlier.\n\nMeta is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on July 31 with analysts’ projecting a 20% sales increase.

        "title": "The fight against nonconsensual sexual deepfakes is slowly getting somewhere",
        "content": "People worry a lot about the various flavors of havoc that AI might wreak in the future, but one of the technology’s here-and-now problems is that of deepfakes, in particular those that depict actual women and girls in sexualized ways without their consent.\n\nPublic concern over the issue exploded earlier this year when people used generative AI tools to create explicit content featuring Taylor Swift. This kind of thing wasn’t really new—faked pornographic images have been a problem ever since Photoshop became a thing—but AI apps can make it particularly easy to do, and Swift’s unusually high profile ensured widespread consciousness.\n\nToday, Meta’s independent (but Meta-funded) Oversight Board announced its findings on two deepfake cases that it took on in April. One was about an image on Facebook depicting a female American public figure in the nude, being groped—it is not clear if this figure was Swift, as the board didn’t name the people concerned. The other image, on Instagram, showed a female Indian public figure in the nude, depicted from behind.\n\nThe Board, which is sometimes referred to as Meta’s “Supreme Court,” gets the final say when it comes to specific cases such as these. It said today that Meta had done the right thing by taking down the picture of the American figure, despite the protestations of the poster. However, Meta had initially ignored users’ complaints about the image of the Indian figure, only taking it down when the Board took on the case. Here, the Board decided Meta had been in the wrong.\n\nBeyond specific cases, the Board can only make non-binding recommendations to Meta about its future content moderation. So, Meta will now have to make up its own mind about the Board’s deepfake recommendations, which mostly center on the company’s policy banning “derogatory sexualized photoshop.” The Board reckons the word “derogatory” should be replaced by “non-consensual”, and the work “photoshop” by something that reflects the changing nature of the tech that people are using to make these images. The Board also wants Meta to start using the fact that content is AI-generated or AI-manipulated as a signal for lack of consent in its \"Adult Sexual Exploitation\" policy.\n\nMeta said it would review the recommendations.\n\nOf course, a social media company can’t do much more to those creating or sharing such content other than to ban them. So it’s also notable that, yesterday, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a bill that would let people portrayed in sexually explicit deepfakes sue the creators.\n\nThe Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits Act (DEFIANCE) Act would give victims the ability to claim up to $150,000 in damages, plus an extra $100,000 if the deepfake was connected to “actual or attempted sexual assault, stalking, or harassment.” It has a companion bill waiting in the House, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged his counterparts there to take it up. “By passing this bill, we are telling victims of explicit nonconsensual deepfakes that we hear them and we are taking action,” he said. But the House doesn’t have much time, as the August recess is just over a week away.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver in the U.K., the sharing of such content was already criminalized in last year’s Online Safety Act. The former Conservative government was set to make creation a crime too, but all new bills were dropped when the Conservatives called the election that led to their ouster at the start of this month. Nonetheless, the new Labour government has also said it wants to criminalize the making of nonconsensual sexualized deepfakes—Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has herself been a victim. Labour’s advisers have also recommended banning apps that are dedicated to making such imagery.\n\nIt's unclear how easy these laws will be to enforce, especially as the proliferation of open-source AI models makes it easy for people to set up “nudification” tools without the guardrails that AI providers like OpenAI put in place. But the threat of severe consequences, and action by social media companies, will at the very least make it clearer to people that this kind of behavior is socially unacceptable.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Meta Platforms is set to be hit in a few weeks with its first EU antitrust fine for tying classified advertisements service Marketplace with its Facebook social network, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n\nThe move by the European Commission will come more than a year and a half after it accused the U.S. tech giant of giving its classified ads service Facebook Marketplace an unfair advantage by bundling the two services together.\n\nThe EU competition watchdog also said Meta abused its dominance by unilaterally imposing unfair trading conditions on competing online classified ads services that advertise on Facebook or Instagram.\n\nMeta could face a fine of as much as $13.4 billion - or 10% of its 2023 global revenue - although EU sanctions are usually much lower than that cap.\n\nThe Commission will likely issue its decision in September or October before EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager leaves office in November, although the timing could still slip, the people said.\n\nThe Commission declined to comment.\n\nMeta reiterated comments made previously.\n\n\"The claims made by the European Commission are without foundation. We continue to work constructively with regulatory authorities to demonstrate that our product innovation is pro-consumer and pro-competitive,\" Meta spokesperson Matt Pollard said.\n\nThe company last year sought to settle the EU investigation by curbing the use of competitors' advertising data for Facebook Marketplace but this concession was rejected by the EU enforcer, other sources told Reuters. A similar offer was accepted by the UK competition regulator.\n\nSeparately, Meta was charged by the Commission this month of failing to comply with landmark tech rules because of its newly introduced pay or consent advertising model launched in November.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Susan Fenton and Mark Potter)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential",
        "content": "Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) still has some scenarios where an attractive upside is possible, even after its shares rose more than 160% year to date. However, this scenario is only possible if optimistic assumptions come true, since in more reasonable scenarios, it is possible to find a fair price close to the current one or even a downside.\n\nCombining the possibility of a more modest scenario materializing at some point in the future (even if the next few quarters remain strong and above expectations), with the fact earnings should be cyclical, I believe the stock currently has a narrow margin of safety.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nIf we consider the company will continue to benefit from this secular trend, there is an upside of just over 20% (bullish scenario). On the other hand, the downside could be of the same intensity (or even worse) if the growth discount rate is slightly reduced and the discount rate increases.\n\nNvidia has great prospects, but should be cyclical\n\nIt is very easy to find studies that show the bullish prospects for Nvidia. The company itself provides a vision of the $1 trillion long-term available market opportunity, divided between $300 billion in data center systems, $300 billion in autonomous machines and the remainder in other complementary lines such as omniverse, artificial intelligence enterprise and gaming. Just considering this total addressable market, where Nvidia is the leader and has competitive advantages and technological barriers, we would already have justification for drawing up a bullish scenario. Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential\n\nSource: Nvidia Investor Presentation\n\nBut we do not need to consider only this information. According to P&S Intelligence, the data center market size by 2030 should reach $622.40 billion, with a compound annual growth rate of 10.10%. Grand View Research believes the U.S. Data Center Market should reach a CAGR of 10.70%, while the global market size will grow at a rate of 10.90% per year over the same period. The Autonomous Robots Market, according to Fact.MR, should have a CAGR of 9.20% by 2033. An even more bullish view is that of Skyquestt, which projects the GPU Market size should reach a CAGR of 33% in the period from 2024 to 2031 due to its diverse application possibilities in a range of sectors, including automotive, aerospace and cryptocurrency, among others.\n\nIn short, the increased need for GPUs has become a secular trend. But at the same time, these massive purchases should be cyclical, and this needs to be reflected in the company's projections. In recent years, companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have substantially increased their capital expenditures. Because they are developing artificial intelligence technology and have relevant cloud infrastructure, they end up being a big part of Nvidia's revenue. In the earnings call, it was mentioned that \"public-cloud hyperscalers\" still represented close to 50% of all data center revenue.\n\nStory continues Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential\n\nSource: Koyfin\n\nTo illustrate this further, Meta continues to invest billions to buy Nvidia's GPUs and develop its generative AI initiatives. Even if this continues in the short and medium term, at some point the company will have had enough and will want to reduce this capex to increase its free cash flow. In my opinion, this is where Nvidia's main point of doubt lies: after the bulk of capex from the big companies, will occasional technology updates (during card swaps) and penetration into new industries be enough to sustain this level of multibillion-dollar revenue and sustainable growth?\n\nBullish scenario - 20% upside\n\nFor the bullish scenario, let's consider a high but still feasible growth rate for Nvidia. For example, in revenue for this year, there is similar growth to that seen in previous quarters, and that is indicated in next quarter's guidance. This higher pace starts in 2025 (calendar year) at 20% and gradually declines to 10% in 2030. We might think this revenue CAGR, although high, is achievable, but it would be necessary for the Data Center segment to remain strong for a few more years, capturing new industries and with Nvidia unlocking new revenue lines to sustain this growth.\n\nIn this scenario, we also consider margins to be high, with a slight normalization of the gross margin, which falls to 76%, a level that is still very robust. This correction in the gross margin is more than offset by possible (even greater) gains in scale and efficiency, with selling, general and administrative as well as research and development costs gradually reducing compared to revenue, so that the Ebitda margin continues to expand. With this, we have the following projected income statement for the coming years: Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential\n\nSource: Nvidia and Author's projections\n\nIn addition, the cash flow assumptions considered a capex of -2% of revenue, decreasing to -1.50% in 2027 and a variation in working capital that reduces cash generation by about $800 million per year. Assuming a growth rate of 5% in the terminal stage of this cash flow, we have a fair price of $156 for Nvidia. But note this fair price, in addition to all these optimistic assumptions, still depends on a discount rate of 8.41%, implying an equity risk premium of 2.50%. Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential\n\nSource: Nvidia and Author's projections\n\nBase scenario - 24% downside\n\nSlightly modifying the assumptions to make the scenario more reasonable, revenue growth from 2026 onwards was slightly reduced, with the company achieving 8% growth per year from 2030 onwards. The other margin assumptions with gradual progress were maintained. As a result, 2030 Ebitda falls from $184 billion to $168 billion. Based on this, we have the following projected income statement for the coming years: Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential\n\nSource: Nvidia and Author's projections\n\nMaintaining the other cash flow assumptions, but reducing terminal stage growth from 5% to 4.50% and increasing the equity risk premium from 2.50% to 3.50%, we have a discount rate of 9.40% and a fair price of $98 for Nvidia, which would imply a downside of 24%.\n\nIn my opinion, a 24% downside seems very pessimistic, but the assumptions that justify this fair price are not so bad since, in reality, a relevant growth in revenue has been maintained, the high margins have been maintained, a certain perpetuation of growth has been maintained and a discount rate consistent with the reality of the market has been applied.\n\nOf course, being a premium company and one that the market rewards a lot, a lower discount rate may make more sense given the possibility of positive surprises in conjunction with Nvidia's relevance to today's technology segment. But the opposite is also true since the current valuation leaves little room for negative surprises.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAs shown above, in a DCF model with optimistic assumptions, it is still possible to find an interesting upside for Nvidia. This, coupled with the quality and competitive advantages, can serve as a bullish argument to justify exposure to the stock.\n\nI believe the company deserves a premium valuation, rewarding not only its recent high growth and competitive advantages, but also its very interesting prospects, which are one of the most robust trends today.\n\nBut this also comes at a price: Nvidia should be able to continue surfing the growth of its markets, but this does not leave it immune from a cyclicality that may eventually arise, especially if the big tech and cloud companies reduce their capex without compensation from new industries.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia's shares are currently at a level where there is a strong dependence on this momentum continuing to justify the rich valuation since a good part of the thesis' value lies in the growth it will have over the years.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta's Oversight Board says deepfake policies need update and response to explicit image fell short",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Meta's policies on non-consensual deepfake images need updating, including wording that’s “not sufficiently clear,\" the company's oversight panel said Thursday in a decision on cases involving AI-generated explicit depictions of two famous women.\n\nThe quasi-independent Oversight Board said in one of the cases, the social media giant failed to take down the deepfake intimate image of a famous Indian woman, whom it didn't identify, until the company's review board got involved.\n\nDeepake nude images of women and celebrities including Taylor Swift have proliferated on social media because the technology used to make them has become more accessible and easier to use. Online platforms have been facing pressure to do more to tackle the problem.\n\nThe board, which Meta set up in 2020 to serve as a referee for content on its platforms including Facebook and Instagram, has spent months reviewing the two cases involving AI-generated images depicting famous women, one Indian and one American. The board did not identify either woman, describing each only as a “female public figure.”\n\nMeta said it welcomed the board's recommendations and is reviewing them.\n\nOne case involved an \"AI-manipulated image\" posted on Instagram depicting a nude Indian woman shown from the back with her face visible, resembling a “female public figure.” The board said a user reported the image as pornography but the report wasn't reviewed within a 48 hour deadline so it was automatically closed. The user filed an appeal to Meta, but that was also automatically closed.\n\nIt wasn't until the user appealed to the Oversight Board that Meta decided that its original decision not to take the post down was made in error.\n\nMeta also disabled the account that posted the images and added them to a database used to automatically detect and remove images that violate its rules.\n\nIn the second case, an AI-generated image depicting the American women nude and being groped were posted to a Facebook group. They were automatically removed because they were already in the database. A user appealed the takedown to the board, but it upheld Meta's decision.\n\nThe board said both images violated Meta’s ban on “derogatory sexualized photoshop” under its bullying and harassment policy.\n\nHowever it added that its policy wording wasn't clear to users and recommended replacing the word “derogatory” with a different term like “non-consensual” and specifying that the rule covers a broad range of editing and media manipulation techniques that go beyond “photoshop.”\n\nStory continues\n\nDeepfake nude images should also fall under community standards on “adult sexual exploitation” instead of “bullying and harassment,” it said.\n\nWhen the board questioned Meta about why the Indian woman was not already in its image database, it was alarmed by the company's response that it relied on media reports.\n\n“This is worrying because many victims of deepfake intimate images are not in the public eye and are forced to either accept the spread of their non-consensual depictions or search for and report every instance,\" the board said.\n\nThe board also said it was concerned about Meta's \"auto-closing\" of appeals image-based sexual abuse after 48 hours, saying it “could have a significant human rights impact.”\n\nMeta, then called Facebook, launched the Oversight Board in 2020 in response to criticism that it wasn’t moving fast enough to remove misinformation, hate speech and influence campaigns from its platforms. The board has 21 members, a multinational group that includes legal scholars, human rights experts and journalists.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta Platforms and Walmart: 2 Blue-Chip Stocks Hitting a ‘Perfect 10’ Score",
        "content": "There are as many paths to market success as there are market investors, but one that stands out is following the blue-chip stocks. These market stalwarts, well-known companies with long records of profitable success and stability, let investors tap into the advantages of the ‘known knowns,’ the reliability that gives us confidence in strong future performance.\n\nBut even knowing what we know, it’s still good to find confirmation from the data. The Smart Score tool, an AI-based, natural language algorithm, gathers, collates, and analyzes the reams of raw information put up by millions of daily stock transactions – and distills it down to a single-digit score that’s easy to understand and use.\n\nThe Smart Score is given on a simple scale of 1 to 10, with a ‘Perfect 10’ being a stock that measures up according to a set of factors known to predict future outperformance. These are the stocks that are worth some extra attention – and when those stocks are also blue-chip leaders like Meta Platforms or Walmart, companies that have brought long-term gains and profits, it’s a clear and bullish signal for investors to follow.\n\nSo let’s do that. Using the TipRanks platform, we’ve pulled up the latest data on those two blue-chip ‘Perfect 10s,’ Meta and Walmart. Here they are, along with comments from the Street’s analysts\n\nMeta Platforms (META)\n\nUp first is Meta Platforms, originally founded as Facebook – the company that set off the social media storm in the early 2000s. In its current incarnation, Mark Zuckerberg’s creation has become a holding company, operating in the social media realm through its subsidiaries: Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta operates globally, reaching out across linguistic and geographic barriers. The company has a total user base, across all of its platforms, well in excess of 3 billion people.\n\nMeta’s core business is social media, monetized through digital advertising. This business model depends on reach, and the company’s unmatched success in that metric – its platforms connect with some 40% of the world’s total population – provides a solid base for profitable operations. In 1Q24, the last reported, Meta saw a top line of $36.46 billion, a figure that was up 27% year-over-year and beat the forecast by $240 million. At its bottom line, Meta generated earnings of $4.71 per share, 39 cents per share better than had been anticipated.\n\nIt’s important to note that Meta finished Q1 with those successes even as it paid out capital expenditures of $6.72 billion. The company reported a free cash flow in the quarter of $12.53 billion, and had $58.12 billion in cash and other liquid assets on hand.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike all successful companies, Meta has been adapting itself to changing conditions. The company’s Meta AI research lab is working on several AI applications simultaneously, including apps for creative and connection AIs – and most importantly, a generative AI user interface. The company is working to develop a seamless transition from the real-life and AI universes, with scalable AI systems operable at any level the user chooses.\n\nTurning to the analysts, we find that Deepak Mathivanan, from Wolfe Research, is staking out a strongly upbeat position in his initiation of coverage. He notes the company’s increasing capital expenditure, particularly on AI, and explains that it has potential to pay back for investors, writing, “We believe that META’s expected uptick in OpEx and CapEx is warranted to solidify a leading position in the Gen AI arms race vs. other Mega cap names and that the company should see benefits to top-line growth from Gen AI product flow-through as well as the ability to exercise cost discipline in order to continue expanding margins over the next two years.”\n\nLooking ahead, Mathivanan adds, “We agree with the Bulls that META can continue to grow top-line (although not accelerate through the year) and gain share, supported by Gen AI initiatives, Reels monetization, and rising contribution of click-to-messaging. We see upward estimates revision to be more likely of a driver than multiple expansion for the stock to work near-to-mid-term.”\n\nThese comments, taken together, back up the analyst’s Outperform (Buy) rating on META shares, while his $620 price target points toward a one-year upside potential of 34.5%. (To watch Mathivanan’s track record, click here.)\n\nOverall, this Magnificent 7 mega-cap stock has earned a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 44 reviews that include 39 Buys, 3 Holds, and 2 Sells. The shares are trading for $461.27 and their $539.59 average target price implies an upside of 17% on the one-year horizon. (See Meta’s stock forecast.)\n\nWalmart, Inc. (WMT)\n\nNext on our list here is Walmart, known as the world’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer – and the second largest of all types, after Amazon. Walmart company has long billed itself as an American success story, growing from its roots as a Mom-and-Pop store in Arkansas to become a global giant with a $568 billion market cap and $648 billion in total revenues for its fiscal year 2024, which ended this past January 31. Walmart employs over 2 million people worldwide and is the clear leader in the discount retail segment in the US.\n\nIn addition to its eponymous stores – focusing on the discount department store and grocery niches, Walmart also owns and operates the Sam’s Club chain of warehouse membership stores. The company operates more than 10,500 locations in 19 countries, including 4,609 Walmart superstores and 599 Sam’s Club stores in the US and another 5,399 Walmart locations internationally.\n\nIn addition to its brick-and-mortar presence, the company has a strong global eCommerce component, that showed 21% year-over-year growth in the last quarter reported, fiscal 1Q25. Walmart has pursued an interesting variation on eCommerce, leveraging its brick-and-mortar network: customers can pay and order online, and pick up their merchandise at the nearest Walmart store.\n\nDuring that quarter, Walmart registered $161.5 billion in consolidated revenues, for year-over-year growth of 6% and beating the estimates by $3.36 billion. The company’s earnings, reported as a non-GAAP EPS of $0.60, were 8 cents per share better than the forecast. We should note here that shares in WMT are up 35% for the year-to-date, strongly outpacing the ~14% gain on the S&P 500.\n\nAnalyst Peter Keith, of Piper Sandler, agrees with the upbeat sentiment towards Walmart. He points out the stock’s strong year so far, as well as the company’s potential to continue bringing in solid returns: “While WMT shares have had a terrific run YTD, we believe the company is in the early stages of an unprecedented profit growth acceleration for a large and mature retailer. By leveraging its massive omni-channel model, WMT is driving significant valuation creation in the form of new and high-margin revenue streams (e.g., Supplier Advertising, E-com Marketplace, etc.) that should not only accelerate EBIT growth in the years to come, but will also create a steadier and more sustainable growth model, in our view.”\n\nThis position leads the 5-star analyst to rate WMT shares as Overweight (Buy) and to set an $81 price target that suggests an upside of almost 15% for the coming year. (To watch Keith’s track record, click here.)\n\nThere are 30 recent analyst reviews of Walmart’s stock, and the 27 to 3 breakdown, favoring Buy over Hold, gives the shares a Strong Buy consensus rating. WMT shares are selling for $70.6, and the $74.11 average target price implies they will gain 5% over the next 12 months. (See Walmart’s stock forecast.)\n\nTo find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’Best Stocks to Buy, a tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

        "title": "7 Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Now: July 2024",
        "content": "Investing in the stock market results in solid long-term gains for many investors. While it’s easy to panic during economic downturns, people who held onto their shares usually benefit. The S&P 500 generated an annualized return of 11.6% over the past 40 years. Investors had to endure several corrections and crashes during that stretch, but the index has proven to be a good long-term investment.\n\nMany dividend growth stocks present a similar proposal. These companies have rising revenue and profits. Economic news, industry-specific, and company-specific news will impact the stock price. While short-term news can create some concerns, it’s possible to find dividend growth stocks that tend to increase in the long run.\n\nDiversifying your portfolio into this asset class can result in steady gains and dividend payouts. These are some of the top dividend stocks to consider if you want to reach new highs for your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) A photo of someone typing on a computer whose browser is open to Alphabet's Google search page.\n\nSource: Castleski / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently issued its first dividend to investors. While the dividends are new, Alphabet has a lengthy history of outperforming the stock market. Shares have almost tripled over the past five years.\n\nAlphabet recently reported second-quarter earnings, which featured 14% year-over-year revenue growth while net income jumped by 28.6%. Google Cloud eclipsed $10 billion in revenue, while YouTube ads also logged impressive gains.\n\nThe company is the leading online advertiser, and many companies try to create content to land a coveted spot at the top of Google search. The amount of popularity the search engine attracted should make it a long-term winner for many years to come. Wall Street seems to agree with that assertion based on its consensus “strong buy” rating for the stock. The average price target implies a 12% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $240 per share suggests the stock can rally by an additional 32%.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has delivered long-term gains while raising its dividend for 22 consecutive years. Although the yield is only 0.6%, Microsoft maintained an annualized dividend growth rate of 10.6% over the past decade. Shares are also up by 20% year-to-date and more than tripled over the past five years.\n\nDue to the company’s large market cap, it makes up a large portion of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. The company regularly reports net profit margins above 30% while generating higher revenue and profits. Microsoft followed that playbook in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 with 17% year-over-year revenue growth and 20% net income growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft Cloud was the biggest winner among the company’s business segments. Cloud revenue came to $35.1 billion, a 23% year-over-year improvement. Microsoft also offers exposure to advertising, business software, social media, gaming, and other verticals. The company is also a leader in the rapidly growing artificial intelligence industry.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nPeople need to eat regularly, and many turn to restaurant chains to get the meals they need. Texas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) is a steakhouse chain that’s gaining momentum. The $11.5 billion restaurant chain gained 35% year-to-date while more than tripling over the past five years.\n\nTexas Roadhouse has attractive momentum on its side, but the company also has an appealing 1.3% yield. The company has maintained an annualized dividend growth rate of 16.05% over the past decade. It has 12 years of consecutive dividend growth and pays out its dividend every quarter.\n\nThe company reported 12.5% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter along with 31.9% net income growth. Comparable restaurant sales increased by 8.4%, demonstrating that Texas Roadhouse is becoming a fixture within its communities. Texas Roadhouse opened nine company restaurants and three franchises this quarter, bringing the total number of restaurants to 753.\n\nTexas Roadhouse is rated as a “moderate buy.” The highest price target of $193 per share suggests that shares can gain an additional 12%.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has been a mainstay in the construction industry for almost 100 years. The company has delivered solid gains for long-term investors. Shares are up by 18% year-to-date and soared by 159% over the past five years. Caterpillar trades at a price-to-earings ratio of 15.5x and has a 1.6% yield. An 8.04% annualized dividend growth rate over the past decade further cements Caterpillar as a top dividend growth stock to consider.\n\nA respectable yield and long-term dividend growth rate aren’t the only catalysts for the construction equipment company. Net income in the first quarter was up 47% from a year ago, while revenue was roughly flat. Rising profits should help the company initiate stock buybacks and raise its dividend. Caterpillar deployed $5.1 billion toward share repurchases and dividend distributions in the first quarter.\n\nWall Street analysts are mixed on the stock but have rated it as a “moderate buy.” The average price target implies a 6% gain from current levels. However, the highest price target of $440 per share suggests that Caterpillar stock can rally by an additional 28%.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another new dividend stock on this list that looks primed to maintain a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years. The social media giant has 3.24 billion daily active users and has been expanding its profit margins. Meta Platforms’ focus on efficiency resulted in 117% year-over-year net income growth in the first quarter. Revenue soared by 27% as well.\n\nMany businesses run advertisements to appear in front of potential customers, but few advertising platforms offer the targeting capabilities that Meta Platforms’ family of apps provides. Soaring profits contributed to the firm’s buying back $14.64 billion of shares in the first quarter. Those buybacks helped the company’s stock rise by 30% year-to-date. Shares are also up by 145% over the past five years.\n\nMeta Platforms has $58.12 billion in cash that it can reinvest into the business or use to fuel dividend growth. The company is making strides in artificial intelligence, which can help diversify its revenue beyond online advertising.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is a top-performing credit and debit card issuer with an P/E of 18.5x. The company offers a 1.1% dividend yield and regularly hikes its dividend. Earlier this year, American Express announced a 17% increase to its quarterly dividend payouts. Investors now receive an annual dividend of $2.80 per share, paid out in quarterly distributions of 70 cents per share.\n\nThe credit card company’s Q2 2024 results suggest that the rally will continue. American Express delivered 8% year-over-year revenue growth and increased its net income by 39% year over year. These growth rates are respectable for most companies, but they’re even better for American Express due to its low P/E ratio. Consumers acquired 3.3 million new cards in the quarter, contributing to the company’s 24th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth from credit card fees.\n\nAmerican Express attracts people with excellent credit. This distinction reduces the likelihood of people defaulting on their credit card debt.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Harun Ozmen / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is the largest grocery and a retail giant that attracts customers who want to save money on everyday items. While the company touts a line-up of affordable prices that help people save, it’s also been delivering solid gains for investors. Shares are up by 34% year-to-date and have gained 88% over the past five years. The stock trades at a P/E of 30x and has a 1.2% dividend yield.\n\nWhile Walmart slowed down its dividend growth rate in recent years, the company broke from that trend with a 9% dividend hike earlier this year. That’s the highest dividend hike in more than a decade.\n\nThat’s not the only good news for the stock. Walmart recently reported 6% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Adjusted earnings per share jumped by 22.4%. Wall Street analysts believe that the gains can continue. The stock is rated as a “strong buy” with a projected 5% upside from current levels.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in GOOG, MSFT and TXRH.

        "title": "Amazon and Meta: Buy Big Tech Stocks and AI Plays Before Earnings or Wait?",
        "content": "Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks dives into the wave of selling that sent the Nasdaq tumbling to start the heart of big tech earnings season on Wednesday. The episode then explores Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) stock before their upcoming earnings releases to see if investors should buy the top tech stocks before earnings or wait for more selling.\n\nTechnology stocks and other first-half standouts tanked on Wednesday, sending the Nasdaq below its 50-day moving average for only the second time in 2024.\n\nThe selling came as the busy stretch of technology earnings kicked off after the closing bell on Tuesday, with Alphabet and Tesla. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTech stocks and the market could experience more selling and volatility throughout earnings season, especially since big tech set the bar very high.\n\nThankfully, the tailwinds that sent the stock market soaring in the first half remain in place. Any near-term selling represents a healthy recalibration and an opportunity for investors to buy their favorite stocks at discounts.\n\nThe two stocks we explore today are tech giants and AI investments.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (META) Stock – Q2 Earnings Wednesday, July 31\n\nMeta (META), the owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, grew its daily active users by 7% in Q1 to 3.24 billion. Meta grew its ad impressions delivered across its family of apps by 20%.\n\nMeta stands to thrive in a world full of smartphone addicts. Meta is also investing heavily in its AI future. Mark Zuckerberg’s goal is for Meta to win the AI race by rolling out open source artificial intelligence. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta shares have soared roughly 400% off the market’s 2022 lows to blow away Alphabet (GOOGL) and plenty of tech giants. The stock has also climbed 520% in the past 10 years vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s 310%.\n\nThis context helps Meta’s valuation look all the more impressive, with Meta trading at a 63% discount to its highs and 20% below the Zacks Tech sector at 22.4X forward 12-month earnings. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta stock has fallen 14% from its early July highs heading into its quarterly earnings release. Meta stock is trading below its 50-day and 21-week moving averages. Meta trades at roughly neutral RSI levels on a 10-year timeframe after hitting its most overbought levels of the last decade earlier this year.\n\nMeta’s recent cooldown makes the stock a potentially more appealing long-term buy-and-hold candidate for investors who can weather near-term volatility. It is worth remembering that Meta has a robust balance sheet and began paying a dividend earlier this year as it focuses on efficiency and profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Stock – Q2 Earnings Thursday, August 1\n\nAmazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy took over roughly three years ago with a mission to boost the bottom line while honing in on expansion in key growth areas.\n\nAmazon remains the king of e-commerce and its advertising unit is booming. AMZN also runs the world’s largest cloud-computing business, topping rivals Microsoft and Alphabet, helping it thrive throughout the AI supercycle. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon is also diving headfirst into its AI efforts, with plans to devote more capex on its cloud computing and AI infrastructure than e-commerce going forward.\n\nAmazon’s steady cloud computing and AI growth, coupled with its focus on boosting earnings is a winning pitch to Wall Street. Amazon’s earnings outlook has soared over the last year for FY24 and FY25 to help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nAmazon stock has skyrocketed 1,000% in the last 10 years vs. Tech’s 300%, Apple’s 800%, and Alphabet’s 480%. Yet Amazon stock is down around 1% in the last three years compared to Tech’s 25% run.\n\nAMZN failed to break out meaningfully above its 2021 highs. Amazon is currently trading 10% below its highs and 22% below its average Zacks price target. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon trades around its 21-week moving average and near neutral RSI levels on a 10-year timeframe. On the valuation front, Amazon trades 95% below its highs and at a 50% discount to its 10-year median at 35.1X forward 12-month earnings.\n\nOn top of that, Amazon trades near its lowest forward earnings multiple since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Katie Paul\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Meta's Oversight Board on Thursday said the company's rules were \"not sufficiently clear\" in barring sexually explicit AI-generated depictions of real people and called for changes to stop such imagery from circulating on its platforms.\n\nThe board, which is funded by the social media giant but operates independently, issued its ruling after reviewing two pornographic fakes of famous women created using artificial intelligence and posted on Meta's Facebook and Instagram.\n\nMeta said it would review the board's recommendations and provide an update on any changes adopted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn its report, the board identified the two women only as female public figures from India and the United States, citing privacy concerns.\n\nThe board found both images violated Meta's rule barring \"derogatory sexualized photoshop,\" which the company classifies as a form of bullying and harassment, and said Meta should have removed them promptly.\n\nIn the case involving the Indian woman, Meta failed to review a user report of the image within 48 hours, prompting the ticket to be closed automatically with no action taken.\n\nThe user appealed, but the company again declined to act, and only reversed course after the board took up the case, it said.\n\nIn the American celebrity's case, Meta's systems automatically removed the image.\n\n\"Restrictions on this content are legitimate,\" the board said. \"Given the severity of harms, removing the content is the only effective way to protect the people impacted.\"\n\nThe board recommended Meta update its rule to clarify its scope, saying, for example, that use of the word \"photoshop\" is \"too narrow\" and the prohibition should cover a broad range of editing techniques, including generative AI.\n\nThe board also slammed Meta for declining to add the Indian woman's image to a database that enables automatic removals like the one that occurred in the American woman's case.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to the report, Meta told the board it relies on media coverage to determine when to add images to the database, a practice the board called \"worrying.\"\n\n\"Many victims of deepfake intimate images are not in the public eye and are forced to either accept the spread of their non-consensual depictions or search for and report every instance,\" the board said.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Chris Reese)",

        "content": "Chinese technology giants Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings have rushed to offer the latest artificial intelligence (AI) model from Facebook owner Meta Platforms into their cloud services, as the debut of Llama 3.1 drew widespread attention this week.\n\nAlibaba Cloud, the e-commerce giant's online computing platform, was among the first to include the latest open-source Llama family of large language models (LLMs) - the technology underpinning generative AI products such as ChatGPT - by integrating it into its Bailian model training platform, the company said on Tuesday in a post published to its official WeChat account. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nAlibaba said it is offering one month of free compute resources that can be used for training and inferencing tasks with Llama 3.1, which launched on Monday.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nMeta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg discusses his company's powerful new AI model, Llama 3.1, with Bloomberg. Photo: Bloomberg alt=Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg discusses his company's powerful new AI model, Llama 3.1, with Bloomberg. Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nShenzhen-based video gaming giant Tencent quickly followed with its own announcement the same day, saying Llama 3.1 is now available on its cloud platform. It includes a number of fine-tuning and inferencing tweaks to ensure Meta's open source models are usable in a range of areas, from intelligent conversation, text generation and writing tasks, according to the company.\n\nMeta is offering the latest version of Llama in three different sizes - 8B, 70B and 450B - that are named after the billions of parameters they include. The number of parameters generally corresponds with an LLM's level of sophistication.\n\nIn its unveiling, Meta hailed Llama 3.1 as \"the first frontier-level open-source AI model\". Early tests have compared it favourably with leading closed-source models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o.\n\nWidely considered the best-performing open-source LLM family, Llama models have become a default foundation model that many Chinese start-ups use to build their own generative AI products, typically with custom tweaks to change or improve performance.\n\nChinese industry insiders have cautioned against an over-reliance on Meta's models among domestic generative AI initiatives. Last year, Chinese AI unicorn 01.AI, founded by venture capitalist Lee Kai-fu, generated some controversy when it was found to be building on top of Llama models without being transparent about it.\n\nStory continues\n\nResponding to criticism that advanced open-source models benefit China, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement announcing the new models on Monday that \"decentralised and open innovation\" advantages the US.\n\n\"Our adversaries are great at espionage, stealing models that fit on a thumb drive is relatively easy, and most tech companies are far from operating in a way that would make this more difficult,\" he said.\n\nWhile open-source models have typically lagged behind the most advanced in the industry, Zuckerberg said he expects to close that gap soon. \"Starting next year, we expect future Llama models to become the most advanced in the industry,\" he wrote in his statement posted to Facebook.\n\nLMSYS, an AI model research organisation supported by the University of California, Berkeley, currently ranks closed-source models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google as the top as the best performing. OpenAI's GPT-4o ranks No 1, with the three companies' other models filling out most of the other top 10 spots.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe Meta chief's comments come amid a fierce AI race between China and the US. Driven by national security concerns, Washington has intensified measures preventing China's access to advanced chips and curbing American investment in Chinese AI projects. In response, Beijing has urged domestic firms to build the country's own models independent of foreign technology.\n\nMany Chinese developers still rely on Meta's Llama models.

Photo: Shutterstock Images>\n\nMany Chinese tech firms still rely on US AI models, including closed versions such as OpenAI's suite of GPT models, and Meta's open source Llama.\n\nOpenAI, which sparked the generative AI craze with the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, last month said it would take additional measures to block access to its AI models via application programming interfaces (APIs) from unsupported regions, including mainland China and Hong Kong.\n\nSome Chinese developers have scrambled to keep access to OpenAI models, by using virtual private networks and third-party services.\n\nMany Chinese developers have also been relying on Meta's Llama models, an indication of the hurdles local companies face in trying to reach self-sufficiency, according to the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, Zuckerberg argues that open sourcing AI models will help the US maintain its advantage.\n\n\"There's one strain of thought, which is like, we need to lock it all down, and I just happen to think that's really wrong because the US thrives on open and decentralised innovation,\" Zuckerberg said in a video interview with Bloomberg published on Thursday. \"That's the way our economy works. That's how we build awesome stuff.\"\n\nBut to preserve its lead, Washington should still work with leading American companies to make sure that the US has a \"perpetual first mover advantage\" on leading technologies for the purpose of national defence, Zuckerberg said in the interview.\n\nThe US should aim to maintain a six-to-eight-month lead over China, he added, arguing that it is an unreasonable goal to try and be five to 10 years ahead of its main rival.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "The recent tech sell-off, sparked by results from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), has caused significant anxiety on Wall Street. However, Wedbush analysts are confident this downturn will be brief and see it as the beginning of a significant tech bull run driven by a massive AI capital expenditure cycle.\n\nAccording to Wedbush, \"We believe this tech sell-off will be short-lived as the Street better digests results and commentary from the broader tech sector over the coming weeks during earnings season.\"\n\n\"This is the start....not the end of this tech bull run in our view fueled by this AI tidal wave of spending on the doorstep,\" they argue.\n\nThe firm highlights that the sell-off, although unsettling, confirms the robust cloud and AI build-outs fueling what they describe as the \"4th Industrial Revolution.\"\n\nWedbush estimates that over $1 trillion will be spent on AI capex in the coming years by companies, utilities, and governments, which will drive this AI Revolution.\n\nAlphabet's increased spending on AI, highlighted in their recent earnings, is seen as a precursor to similar announcements from other major tech players. This substantial investment wave is not viewed as a risk but as a necessary step in building the AI ecosystem globally.\n\nDespite investor concerns about the delayed materialization of top-line growth and margins from these investments, Wedbush strongly disagrees, asserting that this confirms the AI Revolution.\n\n\"This is not Meta/Zuckerberg head scratching spending on metaverse from 2 years ago, instead this is an AI arms race taking place in the US, China, and around the globe,\" the analysts emphasize.\n\nWedbush remains optimistic about a multi-year tech bull run, especially with a potential Fed rate cut creating a favorable risk-on environment.\n\nThey foresee tech stocks rising another 15%-20% this year, driven by strong 2Q earnings expected from companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), and Meta (NASDAQ:META), as well as key cybersecurity firms such as Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS), Palo Alto, CyberArk, Checkpoint, and Tenable.\n\nIn conclusion, Wedbush says that massive sell-offs like yesterday spark Street nervousness, but the pullbacks have previously \"created the golden opportunities time and time again to own Big Tech and the winners.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech sell-off to be short lived; this is start of tech bull run: Wedbush\n\nBofA payments app for businesses handled record $500 billion by mid-year\n\nFutures pare losses after GDP, durable goods data\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The creation of social media has completely changed the way people live. People can text, call, and even Facetime friends and families from the other side of the world within a second. The power of social media apps is growing by the day. As a result, social media stocks are now some of the best stocks you can buy.\n\nThe world is growing interconnected rapidly as internet and social media technology advances, and social media has made it much more convenient to explore traditional in-person things like making new friends and dating.\n\nHowever, experts are cautioning people on how dangerous it is to be so connected to social media. Specifically, a lot of new social media applications are targeted toward the younger generation, and some even find ways to manipulate their search engine and their algorithm to keep their users lured in by providing excessive amounts of dopamine. Thus, it is extremely important for users to study and understand the risks associated with each online social media platform. Below are the three worst social media stocks, and investors should get their money from these by 2025.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWeibo (WB) social media stocks weibo.com sign on window\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nWeibo (NASDAQ:WB) is one of the largest social media companies in China. With a microblogging platform, it allows users to make posts, tag, or interact with other users through the comment section. It is often compared to X due to similar features. As of the first quarter of 2024, Weibo has around 255 million active daily users.\n\nYear over year, the stock fell 45.63%. For the past seven consecutive quarters, Weibo delivered negative top-line growth. Despite a continuous increase in monthly users, Weibo has not been successful in translating its large user base into a profitable business for a prolonged period. This should be a serious red flag for investors as it reveals Weibo’s incapability to deliver solid financial returns.\n\nTo make things worse, Weibo has been seeing declining ad revenues, which indicates that its growing user base might hit a plateau soon. Before it is too late and Weibo stock goes down even more, investors should sell their positions quickly. If you are looking for the top social media stocks, start here.\n\nMatch Group (MTCH) mobile phone screen displaying match group's (MTCH stock) logo\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMatch Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) owns major dating applications such as Tinder, Hinge, Plenty of Fish, Match.com, and many others. While it has gained popularity and recognition as the world’s first online dating app, as the competition in the dating app market gets fierce, the company will face challenges.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the major challenges is increasing free online dating applications, which weakens the competitiveness of traditional powerhouses like Tinder and Hinge. Additionally, the dating app world is getting more niche by the day. There are dating apps that are targeted towards specific groups of people such as Coffee Meets Bagel.\n\nFurthermore, the overall demand for paid online dating apps and services is declining due to people’s changing preferences. In fact, the average revenue per user has been declining since 2017 as the number of non-paying users has been increasing. Before this continuing trend worsens Match Group’s financial returns, investors should sell the stock.\n\nSnap (SNAP) Snapchat (SNAP) logo on phone screen in jean pocket\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP) is an American social media company that provides an interactive platform that allows users to interact with each other by using its signature camera feature.\n\nCompared to its peak in 2021, the stock is down 80% at $14.33, and even since the beginning of the year, it is down more than 10%. Yet, there are still red flags that signal a steeper decline.\n\nAt the surface value, Snap might appear like a good investment opportunity. In the first quarter of 2024, Snap reported a revenue of 1.195 billion, an increase of 21% year over year. Yet, this was a heavy miss compared to $1.36 billion that Wall Street was expecting. Furthermore, Snap experienced a marginal 5% growth in digital ad revenue when its competitors like Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) recorded a double-digit growth. The success story of Snap during COVID-19 is in the past, and investors should get rid of their hopes. This is easily one of the top social media stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andy Kim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Alphabet’s earnings set the stage for tech’s AI question",
        "content": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) kicked off Big Tech’s earnings season on Tuesday, giving Wall Street its first look at digital ad and cloud spending in the quarter. The company reported better than expected earnings and revenue, on the strength of Search ads and continued cloud growth, but fell short on YouTube ad sales.\n\nAlphabet also continues to spend billions building out its AI infrastructure. CFO Ruth Porat, who is transitioning to a new role as CIO, told analysts during the company’s earnings call that capital expenditures in the second quarter topped out at $13 billion, up from $12 billion in Q1. And the vast majority of that is going toward servers and data centers for AI capabilities.\n\nThe report sets the tone for the rest of the tech industry, as it prepares to provide Wall Street with the latest on not just AI spending, but also how much that spending is paying off in actual revenue.\n\nSo far, Alphabet says it’s seeing an uptick in cloud revenue with some of that coming from interest in AI products. But CEO Sundar Pichai sidestepped a more direct question about when analysts can expect to start seeing a return on capital investments related to AI, saying that the spending is necessary for a long-term bet like AI, adding that in situations like this it’s better to overinvest rather than underinvest and fall behind.\n\nUBS Global Research’s Stephen Ju wrote in an investor note following Google’s earnings call that it still isn’t entirely clear when Google will start to reap the benefits of its AI investments. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., May 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“The benefits [Google] is seeing in [Google Cloud Platform] on AI productization still seems difficult to discern, as is the full payoff that Google should see (we do not think potential revenue benefits will arrive until [the first half of 2025] at the earliest),” Ju wrote.\n\n“So as far as we are concerned, the [return on invested capital] debate remains only partially resolved, especially as we are now contemplating what is a higher [capital expenditure] estimate for 2025 and 2026,” he added.\n\nOther analysts were more upbeat on Google’s AI efforts, with William Blair’s Ralph Schackart pointing to Pichai’s comment that some 2 billion users are accessing its Gemini AI model and that the company is building the model into its own products.\n\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt, meanwhile, pointed to Google’s AI Overview for search helping to drive better customer engagement and creating more monetization opportunities as a positive in the company’s report.\n\nStill, the one thing missing from all of this is a definitive number pointing to how much Google’s AI investments are actually helping its bottom line. Pichai says investments will make a difference, but when exactly is still rather vague.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet is just the first of the Big Tech names set to report their earnings this quarter, and you can all but guarantee investors will be searching for clues as to how those other companies’ AI moves are paying off as well.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) are slapping AI features onto their various products and services. Now we just have to see if they’ll give any more insight than Alphabet had to offer. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Broadcom Stock Alert: Is Now the Best Time to Buy AVGO Shares?",
        "content": "Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is well-known as a leader in 5G semiconductors, but it’s also a chip stock that lags behind many of the top names in this sector — most notably Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe company powers the sort of data throughput and connectivity we all rely on with its advanced chips and RF solutions. In 2023, the company’s 5G and AI revenues hit $5.9 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, out of $28.2 billion total income.\n\nNotably, Broadcom stock has been on a tear of late, nearly doubling over the past year on strong investor demand. Some of this is due to the company’s recent 10-for-1 stock split on July 15, which reduced its share price from $1,600 to $170. Market analysts like those at JPMorgan believe Broadcom has strong growth potential in the semiconductor space due to AI. Aside from that, its cybersecurity capabilities are also strong due to the merger with Symantec and Carbon Black. Of 46 analysts, 83% rate Broadcom stock a buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe question is whether now is the right time to build a position in this chip name, particularly after its recent run. Let’s dive into what to make of this move, and where AVGO stock could be headed from here.\n\nTalks with OpenAI\n\nOpenAI has explored developing its own AI chip, discussing plans with chip designers like Broadcom. The aim of this strategic review is to integrate hardware and software efficiently and address AI chip shortages. The company is recruiting former Google employees for their expertise in Tensor processors. However, the report notes that matching Nvidia’s AI server chips would require years of R&D.\n\nOpenAI aims to expedite AI chip development by leveraging former Google experts. CEO Sam Altman wants to raise as much as $7 trillion to transform the semiconductor industry and advance AI, boosting global services and value.\n\nIf this deal does go through, and Broadcom does play a pivotal role in driving chip design for various AI players, the narrative could completely shift in this sector. That’s more of an outsized probability but it’s one I think investors are starting to at least price in right now.\n\nBroadcom Has Strong Growth Potential\n\nBroadcom excels in data-center networking chips, with an 80% market share, leading in providing high-end ASICs for AI players. The company co-designs custom machine learning chips with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and could add Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a third major client.\n\nBroadcom’s Q2 revenue surged 43% to $12.5 billion, driven by record AI sales, with net income rising 20% to $5.4 billion. Analysts view Broadcom, alongside Nvidia, as essential to AI infrastructure, expecting 21% annual earnings growth through 2026. Despite a valuation of 36 times adjusted earnings, long-term investors might find it worthwhile to consider this chip name, particularly if its growth rate remains high or accelerates further from here.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Broadcom’s ASICs rival Nvidia’s GPUs in AI data centers. Analysts view this as a matchup of different strengths, with Broadcom’s open standards competing against Nvidia’s mixed approach. Broadcom’s strategy is favored by hyperscaler cloud firms, network equipment makers and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThe 10-for-1 Stock Split Difference\n\nGood investments often feature competitive advantages and growth potential, leading to significant share-price gains and stock splits. Research from Bank of America shows that stocks typically outperform the S&P 500 by 13% in the year after a split announcement. Broadcom’s stock price did drop following its 10-for-1 stock split briefly but certainly could have more upside if these trends hold.\n\nI’m of the view that as Broadcom’s investor base widens and more institutional investors add to their positions, this is a stock that could ride its tailwinds higher through the end of the year. While a stock split does nothing to affect a company’s underlying fundamentals, it is something long-term investors should pay close attention to over the near term.\n\nAs a trade, I think Broadcom stock is well-positioned for more upside from here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "title": "3 Dividend Stocks That Could Easily Double From Here",
        "content": "When it comes to finding stocks for substantial gains, dividend stocks do not often disappoint. Various dividend stocks vary by total yield, the overall growth profile of the underlying business, and other fundamentals. But if a company is paying out a dividend, it generally means it’s a stock that’s generating sufficient cash flow to power future growth while returning capital to shareholders.\n\nParticular focus will be paid in this article to companies with the potential to increase dividends over time and provide capital appreciation to investors as well. Let’s dive into three top dividend stocks that are likely to provide strong total returns over the long term.\n\nRestaurant Brands (QSR) A photo of a Burger King light-up sign outside a Burger King restaurant representing QSR stock.\n\nSource: Savvapanf Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top defensive stocks in the market I’ve been pounding the table on for some time, Restaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR) is a defensive dividend stock worth considering. The fast food giant operates under four key banners: Tim Horton’s, Burger King, Popeye’s and Firehouse Subs. These underlying businesses have grown well, with Restaurant Brands aiming to have 40,000 restaurant locations and potentially reach $60 billion in revenue and $3.2 billion in operating income in the coming years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNotably, Tim Horton’s is one segment that is seeing significant attention from the company’s management team, with a menu shift focusing on enhancing existing offerings during the day and adding cold beverages to the menu. Additionally, Burger King is expected to modernize 90% of its locations through marketing.\n\nAside from Burger King and Tim Hortons, Popeye’s and Firehouse Subs are seeing strong growth. Focusing on expanding into new markets in Latin America and Asia, Restaurant Brands’ total return over the long haul should be impressive. With a current dividend yield of 3.3%, there’s a lot to like about how this company is positioned right now.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nWith brands like Lay’s, Doritos, and various popular beverages, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) has seen revenue surge to $91.5 billion over the past year. The snack giant saw earnings surge to $9.1 billion, allowing Pepsi to pay out a quarterly dividend of $1.355, translating to a yield of 3.3%.\n\nThat’s the kind of yield many investors can get out of bed in the morning for, particularly when one considers the company’s long-term growth rate. Generating strong free cash flow from its core beverage and snack businesses, there’s a lot to like about how Pepsi is positioned to continue to grow its offerings and market share domestically and around the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, concerns remain around the potential for spending to drop off as a result of GLP-1 drugs and the potential for folks to cut back on discretionary purchases if a recession hits. I’m of the view that this company’s core brands and offerings remain an inexpensive luxury for most. So, if there is a slowdown, it won’t likely translate into massive losses over most time frames. Overall, the trend has been up and to the right for Pepsi, for good reason.\n\nNotably, Pepsi has also become a strong dividend growth play for many investors. Paying out a growing dividend for 52 years gives this company Dividend King status, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nOutpacing most Nasdaq companies, social media behemoth Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) saw an impressive 57% surge in 2023. Its AI investments, now integrated across its apps, are enhancing ad performance and user experience. A revenue boost of 27% and net income growth of 117% seen this past quarter clearly were enough to convince many investors to invest their hard-earned capital into META stock.\n\nWith more than 3.2 billion daily users, Meta’s core loyal customer base is impressive. The company continues to monetizewell on its current offerings, with plenty of verticals to improve monetization, from AI integrations to its metaverse ambitions. Now trading at a reasonable price-earnings multiple of just 28 times, META stock offers incredible value. And a dividend yield (small, albeit) of 0.4% is simply the cherry on top.\n\nI expect Meta to continue to grow its distributions to shareholders over time, particularly as the company’s cash hoard grows. Reinvesting in its core business is great. But adding a dividend means META stock is bound to appeal to a much wider swath of investors. That’s great for current investors, as well as future capital inflows into this stock relative to the overall indexes.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Tesla TSLA and Alphabet GOOGL, two of the magnificent 7 stocks, recently reported their quarterly results. While TSLA’s second-quarter 2024 earnings of 52 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.13%, GOOGL reported second-quarter earnings of $1.89 per share, beating the consensus mark by 2.16%.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the magnificent 7 stocks — Meta Platforms META, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon.com AMZN, Apple AAPL and NVIDIA NVDA — are set to report their quarterly results in a few days.\r\n\r\nFollowing the unimpressive second-quarter results, TSLA shares were down roughly 7% in pre-market trading. Alphabet shares are down 2% pre-market. However, GOOGL shares have returned 30.2% year to date.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, META, MSFT, AMZN, AAPL and NVDA have returned 38.1%, 18.3%, 22.7%, 16.9% and 148.6%, respectively, over the same timeframe.\n\nYTD Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI Proliferation Aiding Magnificient 7\n\nThe magnificent 7 has been benefiting from the massive proliferation of AI. Demand for AI is escalating, and that has increased the need for data center capacity expansion. The advent of generative AI has further attracted investments. \r\n\r\nGartner estimates spending on AI software to witness a CAGR of 19.1% between 2022 and 2027 to hit $297 billion in 2027. GenAI software spending is expected to surge from 8% in 2023 to 35% by 2027. Deloitte expects enterprise spending on GenAI to increase 30% in 2024 from $16 billion in 2023.\r\n\r\nLet’s delve deep and find out what the rest of the magnificent 7 stocks are expected to report this earnings season.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has benefited most from the rapid deployment of generative AI (GenAI) thanks to its collaboration with OpenAI. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from its strategic focus on cloud services, particularly Azure and the Office 365 suite. \r\n\r\nStrength in Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes, driven by growth in Azure, Office 365 suite and other cloud services, is expected to have aided top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Microsoft is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jul 30.\r\n\r\nMSFT beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.38%.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-eps-surprise | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nMeta Platforms is set to report its second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 31. META is riding on strong advertising revenue growth prospects. \r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ offerings — WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Facebook — currently reach more than three billion people daily. Its staggering reach and increasing ad impressions (up 20% year over year in first-quarter 2024) make META one of the most important players in the digital ad sales market apart from Google and Alphabet.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ advertising revenues are expected to benefit from strong spending by advertisers as they leverage META’s growing AI prowess. It has been leveraging AI and machine learning to boost the potency of its social-media offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Threads.\r\n\r\nEffective usage of AI has been helping this Zacks Rank #3 company keep its users engaged. AI-driven feed recommendations have been a key catalyst. \r\n\r\nMETA beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 13.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Meta Platforms, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\n\nAmazon is set to report second-quarter 2024 earnings on Aug 1. The e-commerce giant is benefiting from solid Prime momentum, owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive.\r\n\r\nThe strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings are tailwinds. The robust advertising business is also contributing well. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain a plus.

Price and EPS Surprise Amazon.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nMeanwhile, Apple is expected to report a sluggish third quarter of fiscal 2024 due to weak iPhone sales. Lackluster China sales due to stiff competition are expected to have hurt AAPL’s results, which are scheduled to be reported on Aug 1. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, an expanding user base of more than 2 billion active devices makes Apple’s investment profile attractive. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s Mac sales are expected to have jumped 20.8% year over year in the second quarter of 2024, per the latest data from market research firm IDC. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 5.7 million Macs, thereby grabbing a market share of 8.8% compared with 7.5% in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nMoreover, AAPL shares have been gaining attention from investors thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, at WWDC.\r\n\r\nAAPL beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 4.14%.\n\nApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nLastly, NVIDIA is likely to report its second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug 28. It has been benefiting from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s GPUs are rapidly benefiting from the proliferation of AI. By applying its GPUs in AI models, the Zacks Rank #3 is expanding its base in other untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing, which will support its earnings and revenues. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVIDIA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space, thereby driving top-line growth. \r\n\r\nNVDA beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 18.43%.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Millionaire-Maker Growth Stocks to Consider Adding This Summer",
        "content": "Investors should define their goals before entering the market. For low-risk inflation-beating investments, focus on undervalued blue chips. For regular cash flows, high-dividend stocks are ideal. To build significant wealth, invest in high-growth stocks. The companies I’m going to highlight below are among the groups I’d qualify as millionaire-maker growth stocks, for those looking to generate outsized gains from the higher-risk portion of their portfolios.\n\nThe thing is, these stocks aren’t as risky as many think, with valuation multiples that have come down and cash flow generation profiles that are world-class. Without further ado, let’s dive in and discuss these three names.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most underrated semiconductor companies in the market (in my view) is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). The company’s VMWare acquisition boosted its software capabilities and stock performance, driving strong financial results.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Broadcom’s AI-related revenues are expected to constitute over a third of Broadcom’s total revenues, highlighting its market influence in the world of AI. Collaborations with industry giants like ByteDance and upgrades to VMWare Cloud Foundation for AI workloads underscore Broadcom’s commitment to cutting-edge technology.\n\nThe AI surge has certainly benefited Broadcom in a significant way. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Harlan Sur noted Broadcom holds the second-largest AI chip market share after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and leads in ASIC chip designs. Sur estimated the ASIC chip market at $20 to $30 billion, with Broadcom controlling 55% to 60% of it. Broadcom secured AI ASIC chip deals with major tech companies, further solidifying its market position.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported earnings after the bell on Tuesday, which were a mixed bag. The company brought in 14% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by its search and cloud segments, which beat expectations. However, YouTube advertising revenue did miss the mark, leading to some choppy price action in the after-market session.\n\nAt the time of writing, GOOG stock is down roughly 2% after reporting its earnings. That makes sense, given that Alphabet didn’t necessarily outperform in a meaningful way. However, the company did report relatively strong earnings from its cloud division, which is central to the long-term thesis behind this stock.\n\nIn my view, so long as Alphabet continues to meet expectations moving forward, it’s a stock that can hold its current valuation. That’s partly because, at 25 times earnings, it’s relatively cheap compared to other mega-cap tech names.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the long term, I think Alphabet’s dominant position in search and online advertising positions the company well for cash flow growth, leading to fundamental-led stock price appreciation that may be more stable than other Magnificent 7 names.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeading social media, AI and metaverse sectors, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is truly exceeding expectations through its virtual and augmented reality headsets. The Quest headset, starting at $499.99, became the market leader, praised by critics and consumers, especially kids. It boasted a longer battery life and more applications than competitors like Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro. Rebranded to emphasize its metaverse focus, Meta continued advancing virtual technology.\n\nMETA stock has risen more than 65% over the past year, largely due to the success of its core social media business, but with some investors increasingly focused on the company’s AI and metaverse ambitions.\n\nMeta’s share gains were driven by a 27% revenue rise to $36.5 billion and free cash flow doubling to $12.5 billion. Cost cuts and strong advertising revenue boosted net income by 117% and EPS by 114%. Meta’s dominance in digital ads positions it well for future growth. Upcoming earnings are expected to show similar growth rates, but we’ll have to see how the numbers come in.\n\nMeta Platforms, with over 3.24 billion users, had a strong advantage in product launches. The company also initiated a dividend recently, which I think is likely to grow at a double-digit rate for years. Meta’s rising revenue and net income solidify its position as a leading choice for those looking to bet on the continued growth in online advertising.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor held a long position in GOOG.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "title": "Meta Platforms (META) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Meta Platforms (META) reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 31, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis social media company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +45.2%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $38.27 billion, up 19.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Meta Platforms?\n\nFor Meta Platforms, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.45%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Meta Platforms will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Meta Platforms would post earnings of $4.32 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.71, delivering a surprise of +9.03%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nMeta Platforms doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Internet - Software industry, DoubleVerify Holdings (DV) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.04 per share for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -42.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $153.62 million, up 14.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for DoubleVerify has been revised 10.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.76%.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that DoubleVerify will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. removed 63,000 Instagram accounts in Nigeria linked to scammers who were using its social media services to blackmail targets after soliciting intimate photos, the company said Wednesday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Initial Polling Data Show About the Trump-Harris Matchup I Changed My Mind.

The crime involves scammers posing as teenage girls on Instagram or Snap Inc.’s Snapchat to coerce their targets into sending nude photos. Those explicit images are then used to blackmail the targets, with the perpetrators threatening to forward the images to friends and family.\n\nThe US Federal Bureau of Investigation says sextortion is one of the fastest-growing crimes targeting children in the US. More than two dozen minors, mainly teen boys, have killed themselves after falling victim to it since late 2021. Businessweek’s April cover story focused on the self-inflicted death of Jordan DeMay, a 17-year-old football and basketball star from Marquette, Michigan. After DeMay was goaded to suicide over Instagram, local police and the FBI tracked his blackmailers to Lagos, Nigeria, and extradited two young men to the US to face wrongful death charges. They pleaded guilty in April.\n\nThe explosion of financial sextortion in recent years has been linked to the Yahoo Boys, a loosely affiliated group of digitally savvy con men who design scams en masse. Meta said many of the Facebook pages and groups that it removed were affiliated with members of the Yahoo Boys, who were attempting to “organize, recruit and train new scammers.”\n\nThe groups were selling blackmail scripts and scam guides. They were also sharing links to photos that could be used to legitimize fake accounts. One network of 20 individuals was running 2,500 “fake accounts to mask their identities” that were mainly targeting men in the US, according to Meta.\n\n“Financial sextortion is a horrific crime that can have devastating consequences,” Meta said in the statement. Its investigation found the majority of the scammers’ attempts failed. In cases where blackmailers targeted minors, Meta said it reported them to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. “This is an adversarial space where criminals evolve to evade our ever-improving defenses,” the company said. “We will continue to focus on understanding how they operate so we can stay one step ahead.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta has taken additional measures to better protect users against sextortion scams, including setting stricter message settings on teen accounts, sending sextortion-focused safety notices, and initially blurring nude photos sent or received by minors.\n\nRead this next: Inside Roblox’s Pedophile Problem\n\n(Adds details in the first two paragraphs on how many of the removed accounts were from Instagram and Facebook.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Airbnb Hosts Want Guests to Come to Them Directly The Real Reason Erewhon Is a Cult Brand Elon Musk Goes All In for Trump Why Is the US Deficit So Big?

        "content": "Meta says it has taken down about 63,000 Facebook accounts in Nigeria that were engaging in financial sextortion scams — along with groups and pages that were trying to organize, recruit and train new scammers.\n\nSexual extortion, or sextortion, involves persuading a person to send explicit photos online and then threatening to make the images public unless the victim pays money or engages in sexual favors. Recent high-profile cases include two Nigerian brothers who pleaded guilty to sexually extorting teen boys and young men in Michigan, including one who took his own life, and a Virginia sheriff’s deputy who sexually extorted and kidnapped a 15-year-old girl.\n\nThere has been a marked rise in sextortion cases in recent years, fueled in part by a loosely organized group called the Yahoo Boys, operating mainly out of Nigeria, Meta said, adding that it removed Facebook accounts and groups run by the group under its “dangerous organizations and individuals” policy.\n\nIn January, the FBI warned of a “huge increase” in sextortion cases targeting children. The targeted victims are primarily boys between the ages of 14 to 17, but the FBI said any child can become a victim.\n\nMeta said its investigation found that the majority of the scammers' attempts did not succeed and mostly targeted adult men in the U.S., but added that it did see “some” try to target minors, which Meta says it reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\n\nThe removed accounts included a “coordinated network” of about 2,500 accounts linked to a group of about 20 people who were running them, Meta said.\n\nIn April, Meta announced it was deploying new tools in Instagram to protect young people and combat sexual extortion, including a feature that will automatically blur nudity in direct messages. Meta is still testing out the features as part of its campaign to fight sexual scams and other forms of “image abuse,” and to make it tougher for criminals to contact teens.\n\nView comments()",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – July 24, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nShould You Buy Mag 7 Weakness?\n\nSeveral Mag 7 stocks, namely Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Nvidia, have faced pressure over recent weeks, temporarily halting their remarkable runs.\n\nInterestingly enough, the recent negative price action has coincided with a strong move from small-caps, perhaps reflecting a bit of rotation. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each since July 11, which was the day small-caps began to roar thanks to a favorable CPI print.\n\nIt raises a valid question: Are these beloved stocks' runs over, or should investors stay exposed? Let's take a closer look.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud Reaccelerates\n\nRecent cloud strength has analysts optimistic for Microsoft, with the company expected to benefit nicely from AI. Cloud revenue popped 23% year-over-year throughout its latest period, reflecting a reacceleration and positively shocking investors.\n\nMany had feared a cloud slowdown, which did occur for a few periods, but the recent results paint a picture of positivity moving forward. The company's cloud results have remained positive overall, consistently exceeding our consensus estimates as of late.\n\nIn addition, earnings expectations for its current fiscal year have remained bullish, with the $11.77 per share expected suggesting 20% year-over-year growth. The favorable earnings picture will support near-term share performance, with the recent weakness likely reflecting profit-taking.\n\nMeta Platforms Enjoys Profitability Boost\n\nMETA shares have benefited nicely from improved operational efficiencies that have significantly boosted profitability. The company remains firmly in growth mode, with earnings and revenue climbing 80% and 30% throughout its latest period.\n\nLike MSFT, the outlook for its current fiscal year remains bullish, with the $20.21 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 24% over the last year and suggesting a 36% year-over-year jump.\n\nThe company has been performing nicely, with its advertising revenue positively surprising in six consecutive quarters. It's worth noting that advertising represents the bulk of META's revenue.\n\nIn addition, META shares aren't expensive, with the current 23.6X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 37.0X. The current PEG ratio also works out to 1.2X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth.\n\nWhile shares have faced pressure, the company's outlook remains notably bright, and investors should block out the noise.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia Outlook Remains Robust\n\nBeloved Nvidia has faced some pressure recently amid a broader cooldown in the semiconductor trade. Nonetheless, shares are still up a staggering 150% year-to-date, and its earnings outlook fully supports further near-term gains.\n\nThe stock maintains the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to its above-mentioned earnings outlook, which has shifted bullishly across the board. The $2.69 per share expected for its current year suggests a 100% year-over-year pop in earnings, with sales also expected to see a 90% increase.\n\nThe stock has been at the heart of the AI trade, with its Data Center results consistently blowing away expectations as of late.\n\nBreakneck growth has kept valuation multiples at historically sound levels, with the current 39.1X forward 12-month earnings multiple below the 50.7X five-year median and five-year highs of 106.3X.\n\nKeep in mind that shares traded well above current valuation levels in 2020 and 2021, a time when the AI theme had yet to emerge fully.\n\nPutting Everything Together\n\nWhile several Mag 7 stocks have faced pressure over recent weeks, their outlooks and fundamentals underneath the hood remain more than sound.\n\nTheir recent weakness has coincided with a strong move from small-cap stocks, perhaps a reflection of rotation and profit-taking after remarkable starts to 2024.\n\nNonetheless, these stocks' runs certainly aren't over, and they remain prime selections for portfolios.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nTesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) kicked off Big Tech earnings on Tuesday with mixed results. Each fell in after-hours trading.\n\nBut for all the hand-wringing about the concentration of outsized gains in the hands of a magnificent few, stock bulls have two reasons to cheer as earnings season intensifies.\n\nFirst, markets just completed a violent rotation that shifted winnings from the seven largest US stocks — Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla, and Alphabet — to small-cap stocks and interest rate-sensitive names.\n\nSectors like real estate, homebuilders, and regional banks are among those now leading the way.\n\nThe severity of the move — which accelerated with the latest weak inflation numbers — shouldn't be discounted.\n\nLiz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, wrote that June was the Russell 2000's worst month versus the Nasdaq in over a year. Yet, she notes that July is already tracking the best since 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, in the land of giants, the Magnificent Seven lost $1.25 trillion in market cap value over seven sessions recently — just as the small-cap stocks started asserting strength.\n\nThe trillion-plus drop in valuation by the Mag Seven represented an 8% fall in price — yet the overall market (the S&P 500) was off only 2% over the same time. Timing is everything.\n\nThe other tailwind favoring bulls is a game of earnings catch-up.\n\nThe S&P 493 (the S&P 500 minus the Mag Seven) is finally climbing out of an earnings recession, as noted by the BofA US Equity & Quant Strategy team. S&P 493 EARNINGS GROWTH TURNING POSITIVE\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) for the S&P 493 have been \"flat to down for the past five quarters,\" wrote BofA, even as EPS growth for all 500 names turned positive three quarters ago.\n\nThis newfound strength for the rest of the market comes just as earnings growth is \"expected to slow for the Magnificent Seven for the second straight quarter and again in the [third quarter].\"\n\nIt appears that even earnings growth is rotating on a higher time frame.\n\nThe very fact that overall market volatility remains subdued despite these tectonic shifts taking place under the market's hood is a testament to the resilience of the bull market itself.\n\nAnd BofA expects the rally to continue through breadth expansion.\n\n\"Given the high correlation between Tech's outperformance in stocks vs. earnings,\" the bank wrote, \"we expect the narrowing growth differential to be the catalyst for the market to broaden out.\"\n\nStory continues morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments()",

        "content": "Facebook parent Meta (META) said on Wednesday that it has removed thousands of Instagram accounts linked to so-called sextortion scams.\n\nIn a blog post, the company detailed how it pulled 63,000 accounts, including a network of 2,500 accounts run by some 20 individuals, attempting to commit the financially motivated scams.\n\nAccording to Meta the accounts are affiliated with a group known as Yahoo Boys — no affiliation with this website — a loose collection of cybercriminals that largely operate out of Nigeria focusing on financial scams.\n\nThese scammers mostly targeted adult men in the US. But Meta said they also tried to target minors, leading the company to report the matter to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\n\nIn sextortion scams, the bad actors generally reach out to a massive number of users across social networks in the hopes of getting victims to respond — and strike up phony romantic relationships.\n\nOver the course of their correspondences, the scammers will request nude photos or videos of the victims, which they then say they will release to friends and family or the broader internet if the victim doesn’t pay what can be hundreds of dollars in ransom.\n\nWhile Meta said its automated systems detected the majority of the scam accounts before they could do any damage, it used other investigative methods to find the remaining accounts and take them offline as well. Facebook parent Meta says it's taken down thousands of accounts linked to sextortion schemes. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAccording to Meta’s global head of safety, Antigone Davis, the company is going public to help drive awareness of these types of scams. What’s more, she said, Meta also wants criminals to know that they’re picking up on these crimes and actively taking steps to block them.\n\nSextortion has become a growing threat in recent years, with the FBI warning about the crime in 2023 and again this year. In 2023, two Nigerian men suspected of running sextortion schemes that led to the suicide of a 17-year-old from Michigan were extradited to the US to face charges for the alleged crimes.\n\nIn March 2024, a third person was ordered to be extradited to the US by a Nigerian court, though he is challenging the move. The original suspects pleaded guilty in April.\n\nIn addition to the 63,000 Instagram accounts, Meta said it also took down 7,200 assets from Facebook, including 1,300 accounts, 200 pages, and 5,700 groups based in Nigeria dedicated to providing tips on scamming people — plus scripts to use on victims and photos to create fake accounts.\n\nBeyond removing the accounts, Meta says it is also providing features to help prevent users from falling for sextortion scams, including on-device nudity protection, which automatically blurs images containing nudity in Instagram direct messages.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are a few ways users can recognize some of the signs of potential sextortion scammers. The most obvious is getting a message from someone you’ve never spoken to before who seems to be trying to connect with you via direct messages without any prompting. Another sign is a message from someone including an image and asking for one in return.\n\nMeta says it also has technology that can determine if an account is exhibiting scammy or suspicious behavior and will notify users who interact with it that it may be a scam account.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF.Since Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nOver the past few months the market has seen a massive influx of AI-related ETFs as investors look to ride the bandwagon of AI investing. A report from Wall Street Journal in June said that all ten AI ETFs tracked by website ETF.com saw inflows this year. One major AI ETF, launched by Roundhill, saw its assets grow to $35 million from under $1 million in just two weeks.\n\nAmid the craze of AI ETFs, does it make sense to start investing in every new ETF? Analysts offer some guidance. A Wall Street Journal report quoted Morningstar analyst Kenneth Lamont, who said that we should look for “thematic purity” while investing in AI ETFs. The ETF you choose, according to the analyst, must be investing in “bellwether” stocks positioned to benefit from the AI industry trends.\n\nThere is a new AI ETF in town. KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), launched earlier this month, tracks the Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index, which captures the performance of AI tech companies. The index seeks exposure to three main AI categories: hardware, infrastructure, and applications. The index picks companies by assigning  AI Exposure Score, which assesses each company’s relevance to AI tech. You can get exposure to AI companies focusing on data centers, LLMs, AI tech to reduce costs and improve customer experience.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the top 10 holdings of this new AI ETF and see whether they have the potential to rise in the coming months and weeks. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Best AI Stock to Buy Based on New AI ETF?\n\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) accounts for about 4.2% of the net assets of KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX).\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill chose Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) as one of his top AI picks in the consumer AI space.\n\nThe social media giant is using AI for optimizing ad targeting and recommendation systems to boost engagement and ads revenue. In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.  However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it’ll bode well for the stock down the road.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta’s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world’s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users across its platform. The company generates revenue predominantly from advertising. which accounts for over 95% of its total revenue, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal fourth quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings surpassing analyst estimates. The better-than- expected revenues were attributed to strong advertiser demand and Al-driven ad improvements. Moreover, the company materially raised its fiscal first quarter sales and earnings guidance above analysts’ estimates, buoyed by continued strong advertiser demand trends and enhancements to Reels. Advantage+. Click-to-message, and Shop Ads. Further, management noted that ongoing investment in Al is enhancing user engagement and advertiser returns through improved targeting and measurement. Separately, Meta authorized a new share repurchase plan representing approximately 5% of its market capitalization and announced the initiation of its first dividend, implying an approximate 0.4% yield.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) reported its fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, beating analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines, as its cloud businesses continue to pick up steam, topping the $1 billion mark for operating profit for the first time.\n\nFor the quarter, the company saw earnings per share of $1.89 on revenue of $84.7 billion. Analysts were anticipating earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue of $84.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That's a jump from the same period last year of 31% and 14%, respectively, when the company reported earnings per share of $1.44 on revenue of $74.6 billion.\n\nAdvertising revenue topped $64.6 billion versus analysts' expectations of $64.5 billion, and up from $58.1 billion last year. YouTube ad revenue, however, fell short, with the segment bringing in $8.66 billion versus expectations of $8.95 billion.\n\nShares of Alphabet were flat immediately following the announcement.\n\nGoogle saw cloud revenue of $10.35 billion and operating income of $1.17 billion. That's better than analyst expectations of $10.1 billion and operating income of $982.2 million, and higher than the $8 billion in revenue and $395 million in operating income the company reported in Q2 2023.\n\nAlphabet shares are up 30% year to date. Shares of rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are up 18% and 22% year to date, respectively. All three companies are pouring money into building out their generative AI capabilities, spending lavishly on data centers capable of powering the AI models they offer via their cloud service platforms.\n\nIn the second quarter, Alphabet reported spending $2.2 billion building AI models across its DeepMind and Google Research organizations. That's up from $1.1 billion in Q2 2023. When exactly AI starts to generate revenue for Google’s Cloud business, let alone its ad segment, is still up in the air.\n\n“It is still too early to count on AI benefits as most [companies] remain in pilot mode, and material AI [revenue] is more likely a 2025-26 event,” Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a recent client note ahead of Alphabet's earnings announcement.\n\nGoogle is still trying to find its footing with AI Overview, the generative AI feature that shows up at the top of Google Search results pages. In May, the company rolled out the search function, only for users to quickly discover that its answers weren’t always accurate, with now famous responses telling users to put glue in their pizza or to eat a rock every day. Google responded by pulling back some of the gen AI features.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it spends on AI, Alphabet has been cutting in other areas including headcount. In Q2, the company reported having 179,582 employees, down from 181,798 in the same period last year. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Put on the Chopping Block if Trump Wins the Election",
        "content": "As of July, political analysts are forecasting a red wave in November and Donald Trump’s return to the Oval Office. If you remember, from his first stint as President, Trump implemented several different economic policies. Much of his focus is on returning employment and manufacturing to the United States.\n\nSo, as investors, which companies can we target if Trump wins in November? That will depend on which policies Trump and his administration can implement. From the platform he is campaigning on, we know that Trump wants to reduce President Biden’s focus on clean energy and electric vehicles. Let’s look at three stocks to avoid if Trump wins the election in November.\n\nRivian (RIVN) The front of a Rivian (RIVN) storefront is seen lined up with Rivian R1T and R1S model trucks out in front.\n\nSource: Michael Berlfein / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) has often been seen as one of the true challengers to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). One positive for Rivian is that it manufactures its vehicles in America at its factory in Georgia. However, Trump has repeatedly stated that he is pulling EV tax credits and incentives, which will be a major blow to an unprofitable startup like Rivian.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTrump has been notably anti-EV, recently calling it a green scam. Any reduction in EV funding and consumer subsidies would be detrimental to U.S.-based companies like Rivian. Tesla would suffer, too, but Musk’s announcement that he will be donating $45 million per month to Trump’s campaign seemingly has the EV maker in Trump’s good books.\n\nRivian is far from profitable even after major investments from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Volkswagen. Shares of RIVN have gained nearly 60% over the past month but are still down by 18% in 2024. The stock is trading at 3.2x sales and has an Enterprise Value/Revenue (EV/Revenue) of 2.8, which is a fraction of the valuation of Tesla. Still, with Trump’s negative sentiment surrounding EVs, I’d steer clear of Rivian until there is more regulatory clarity.\n\nEnphase (ENPH) mobile phone screen with Enphase Energy (ENPH) logo on it to represent renewable energy stocks\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) is an American solar equipment and infrastructure company. It has been a popular stock among clean energy investors and has provided stellar returns in recent years. Although it was down by about 20% in 2024, it has returned more than 400% over the past five years.\n\nThe solar industry faces problems similar to those of EV-makers like Rivian. Trump and Biden have polarizing opinions on clean energy. If Trump is victorious, he will likely reduce government funding for clean energy infrastructure. In the past, he has also imposed tariffs on some of the components and parts of solar equipment made outside the United States.\n\nStory continues\n\nRepealing Biden’s clean energy bills will be an uphill battle for Trump. He will need the support of both the Senate and the House before anything is significantly changed. Trump has threatened to cancel the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and to eliminate the Solar Tax Credit (ITC) for businesses and consumers. Trump’s support of the fossil fuel industry, particularly coal and oil, leaves little room for companies like Enphase to flourish under his watch.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) The META backed Threads app as a compelling alternative to Twitter. Social media application technology concept.\n\nSource: Cat Box / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is one of the most successful companies in history and the seventh largest in the world by market cap. However, Trump’s disdain for Meta and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been well documented and could again rear its ugly head if he wins the Presidency again.\n\nOne of the bullish arguments for Meta is that TikTok’s days as a competitor are numbered in the United States. Trump himself has tried to ban TikTok on multiple occasions. It’s also no secret that Trump is vehemently against China’s government and its documentation of American user data. Recently, Trump has changed his tune on TikTok. He said he favors TikTok staying in America because otherwise, it is just Facebook and Instagram.\n\nPerhaps as a peace offering, Zuckerberg and Meta have reinstated Trump on their platforms. It hasn’t done much to convince Trump or Biden to be a fan of Zuckerberg. Trump has been known to get personal, and being on his hit list as the sitting President might not fare well for Meta. Still, some might argue that Meta is relatively cheap at just 24x forward earnings and 9x sales.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Meta CEO Zuckerberg calls on industry to adopt open-source AI, debuts high-powered Llama AI model",
        "content": "Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to Instagram on Tuesday to call out the tech industry, saying it should focus its generative AI efforts on open models rather than closed ones like those developed by OpenAI, Google, and others.\n\nIn a blog post on the topic, Zuckerberg said open-source AI models would ultimately prove more secure and efficient as developers and researchers around the world fine-tuned them over time.\n\nTech giants are currently in a battle over whether closed-source or open-source AI models should be the path forward for AI. Closed-source models are, generally, those that are only available to a company's customers and limit how much they can be manipulated at a base level, if at all.\n\nOpen-source AI models are available to any interested researchers or developers who can manipulate the models' code. Think something like the difference between Apple's (AAPL) iOS operating system, which is closed, and Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Android, which is open.\n\n\"Open source will ensure that more people around the world have access to the benefits and opportunities of AI, that power isn’t concentrated in the hands of a small number of companies, and that the technology can be deployed more evenly and safely across society,\" Zuckerberg wrote in his post.\n\nIn calling for the industry to rally around open-source AI, Zuckerberg is also rolling out the latest version of Meta's open-source Llama AI model, Llama 3.1, which the CEO says is among the most advanced in the industry. What's more, he says he anticipates the model will become the most advanced beginning next year. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers a speech during the Meta Connect event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., Sept. 27, 2023. (REUTERS/Carlos Barria) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nZuckerberg's Meta is going up against some of the biggest names in AI, including OpenAI and Google. Both companies offer their flagship AI models as closed-source software options, though they provide open-source models as well.\n\nZuckerberg says that making flagship AI models open source will improve security and overall capabilities, since a larger number of researchers and developers will be able to examine them from a base level, allowing them to catch flaws over time.\n\nThere are also concerns that open-source models will give the US's rivals, including China, easy access to high-powered AI technologies. But Zuckerberg claims that the US's adversaries could simply steal the code related to closed models and gain access to them that way. Closed models, he says, would also limit availability of AI technology to a small group of powerful companies.\n\nZuckerberg writes that leading companies should work with the government to help ensure they can take advantage of open-source AI models, ensuring they have a lead over other countries' governments.\n\nStory continues\n\nPart of Zuckerberg's emphasis on open-source technology has to do with his distaste for Apple's iOS and the iPhone maker's ability to control how Meta updates its apps. Meta also offers its own open-source programming languages that have proven popular across the web, including React.\n\nIt's difficult to tell whether open-source or closed-source AI models will win out at the moment. In reality, it's unlikely either will dominate the market in the long run. Ultimately, we'll likely see a split between closed-source and open-source models, just as we've seen with enterprise and consumer-level software programs throughout the years.

        "title": "Meta unveils biggest Llama 3 AI model, touting language and math gains",
        "content": "By Katie Paul\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Meta Platforms released the biggest version of its mostly free Llama 3 artificial intelligence models on Tuesday, boasting multilingual skills and general performance metrics that nip at the heels of paid models from rivals like OpenAI.\n\nThe new Llama 3 model can converse in eight languages, write higher-quality computer code and solve more complex math problems than previous versions, the Facebook parent company said in blog posts and a research paper announcing the release.\n\nIts 405 billion parameters, or variables that the algorithm takes into account to generate responses to user queries, dwarfs the previous version released last year though is still smaller than leading models offered by competitors.\n\nOpenAI's GPT-4 model, by contrast, is reported to have one trillion parameters and Amazon is investing in a model with 2 trillion parameters.\n\nThe release comes as tech companies are racing to show that their growing portfolios of resource-hungry large language models can deliver significant enough gains in known problem areas such as advanced reasoning to justify the gargantuan sums that have been invested in them.\n\nIn addition to its flagship 405 billion parameter model, Meta is also releasing updated versions of its lighter-weight 8 billion and 70 billion parameter Llama 3 models initially introduced in the spring, the company said.\n\nAll three new models are multilingual and can handle larger user requests via an expanded \"context window,\" which Meta's head of generative AI, Ahmad Al-Dahle, said would improve the experience of generating computer code in particular.\n\n\"That was the number one feedback we got from the community,\" Al-Dahle told Reuters in an interview, noting that bigger context windows give the models something akin to a longer memory that aids in processing multi-step requests.\n\nMeta releases its Llama models largely free-of-charge for use by developers, a strategy Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg says will pay off in the form of innovative products and greater engagement on the company's core social networks. Some investors have raised their eyebrows at the costs entailed, however.\n\nThe company also stands to gain if developers opt to use its free models over paid ones, which would undercut the business models of its rivals. With its announcement, Meta touted gains on key math and knowledge tests that may make that prospect more appealing.\n\nAlthough progress on AI development is notoriously difficult to measure, test results provided by Meta appeared to suggest that its largest Llama 3 model was nearly matching and in some cases besting Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI's GPT-4o, which are widely regarded as the two most powerful frontier models on the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the MATH benchmark of competition level math word problems, for example, Meta's model posted a score of 73.8, compared to GPT-4o's 76.6 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet's 71.1.\n\nThe model scored 88.6 on MMLU, a benchmark that covers dozens of subjects across math, science and the humanities, while GPT-4o scored 88.7 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored 88.3.\n\nIn their paper, Meta researchers also teased upcoming \"multimodal\" versions of the models due out later this year that layer image, video and speech capabilities on top of the core Llama 3 text model.\n\nEarly experiments indicate those models can perform \"competitively\" with other multimodal models such as Google's Gemini 1.5 and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, they said.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul, Editing by Louise Heavens)",

        "title": "Zuckerberg Aims to Rival OpenAI, Google With New Llama AI Model",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. debuted a new and powerful AI model that Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg called “state of the art” and said will rival similar offerings from competitors like OpenAI and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Initial Polling Data Show About the Trump-Harris Matchup A Six-Second Decision Shows How Harris Snapped Up Delegates Harris Has Enough Delegates to Clinch Nomination for President Wiz Rejects Google’s $23 Billion Offer, Seeks IPO Instead Trump Floated Jamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary, Then Denies It\n\nThe new model released Tuesday, called Llama 3.1, took several months to train and hundreds of millions of dollars of computing power. The company said it represents a major update from Llama 3, which came out in April.\n\n“I think the most important product for an AI assistant is going to be how smart it is,” Zuckerberg said during an interview on the Bloomberg Originals series The Circuit with Emily Chang. “The Llama models that we’re building are some of the most advanced in the world.” Meta is already working on Llama 4, Zuckerberg added.\n\nMeta executives say that the model, which is primarily used to power chatbots both within Meta and by outside developers, has a wide range of new capabilities, including improved reasoning to help solve complex math problems or instantly synthesize an entire book of text. It also has generative AI features that can create images on demand through text prompts. A feature called “Imagine Yourself” lets users upload an image of their face, which can then be used to create depictions of them in different scenes and scenarios.\n\nMeta uses its Llama models to power its AI chatbot, called Meta AI, which operates inside its apps, including Instagram and WhatsApp, and also as a separate web product. Zuckerberg said that Meta has “hundreds of millions” of users for its chatbot, and expects it will be the most widely used chatbot in the world by the end of the year. He expects that others outside of Meta will use Llama to train their own AI models.\n\n“It’s just gonna be this teacher that allows so many different organizations to create their own models rather than having to rely on the kind of off-the-shelf ones that the other guys are selling,” he said.\n\nMeta’s investments in AI have been steep. Zuckerberg said that Meta’s Llama 3 models cost “hundreds of millions of dollars” in computing power to train, but that he expects future models will cost even more. “Going forward it’s going to be billions and many billions of dollars of compute” power, he said. Meta in 2023 tried to reign in some of its spending on futuristic technologies and management layers, cutting thousands of jobs in what Zuckerberg dubbed the “year of efficiency.” But Zuckerberg is still willing to spend on the AI arms race.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I think that there’s a meaningful chance that a lot of the companies are over-building now, and that you’ll look back and you’re like, ‘oh, we maybe all spent some number of billions of dollars more than we had to,’” Zuckerberg said. “On the flip side, I actually think all the companies that are investing are making a rational decision, because the downside of being behind is that you’re out of position for like the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years.”\n\nAfter all the investment, Meta makes the technology behind Llama available for the public to use for free, so long as they adhere to the company’s “acceptable use policy.” Zuckerberg hopes the open-access strategy will help make the company’s work the foundation of other successful startups and products, giving Meta greater sway in how the industry moves forward.\n\n“If AI is going to be as important in the future as mobile platforms are, then I just don’t want to be in the position where we’re accessing AI through” a competitor, said Zuckerberg, who has long been frustrated with Meta’s reliance on distributing its social media apps on phones and operating systems from Google and Apple Inc. “We’re a technology company and we need to be able to kind of build stuff not just at the app layer but all the way down. And it’s worth it to us to make these massive investments to do that.”\n\nDespite the pledge to make Llama open, Zuckerberg and other top company executives are keeping the data sets used for training Llama 3.1 a secret. “Even though it’s open we are designing this also for ourselves,” he explained. Meta is using publicly available user posts from Facebook and Instagram, as well as other “proprietary” data sets that the company has licensed from others, Zuckerberg said, without sharing specifics.\n\nHe also dismissed the idea that training Llama on data from Facebook and Instagram posts is a key advantage. “A lot of the public data on those services we allow to be indexed in search engines, so I think Google and others actually have the ability to use a lot of that data, too,” he said.\n\nMeta told investors in April that it was planning to spend billions of dollars more than initially expected this year, with investments in AI being a core reason why. The company is expected to have some 350,000 Nvidia Corp. H100 GPUs by the end of the year, according to a company blog post. The H100 chips have become the foundational technology used to train large language models like Llama and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and can cost upwards of tens of thousands of dollars apiece.\n\nCritics of Meta’s open source approach to AI point to the potential for abuse — or the fear that tech companies from geopolitical rivals like China will piggyback off Meta’s technology to keep pace with their American counterparts.\n\nZuckerberg is more concerned that closing off the tech from other parts of the world would ultimately be a detriment.\n\n“There’s one string of thought which is like, ‘Ok well we need to lock it all down,’” he said. “I just happen to think that that’s really wrong because the US thrives on open and decentralized innovation. I mean that’s the way our economy works, that’s how we build awesome stuff. So I think that locking everything down would hamstring us and make us more likely to not be the leaders.”\n\nIt's also unrealistic to think that the US will ever be years ahead of China when it comes to AI advancements, he added, but pointed out that even a small, multi-month lead can “compound” over time to give the US a clear advantage.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Airbnb Hosts Want Guests to Come to Them Directly The Real Reason Erewhon Is a Cult Brand Why Is the US Deficit So Big?

        "content": "Several Mag 7 stocks, namely Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, and Nvidia NVDA, have faced pressure over recent weeks, temporarily halting their remarkable runs.\n\nInterestingly enough, the recent negative price action has coincided with a strong move from small-caps, perhaps reflecting a bit of rotation. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each since July 11, which was the day small-caps began to roar thanks to a favorable CPI print. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt raises a valid question: Are these beloved stocks’ runs over, or should investors stay exposed? Let’s take a closer look.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud Reaccelerates\n\nRecent cloud strength has analysts optimistic for Microsoft, with the company expected to benefit nicely from AI. Cloud revenue popped 23% year-over-year throughout its latest period, reflecting a reacceleration and positively shocking investors.\n\nMany had feared a cloud slowdown, which did occur for a few periods, but the recent results paint a picture of positivity moving forward. The company’s cloud results have remained positive overall, consistently exceeding our consensus estimates as of late. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn addition, earnings expectations for its current fiscal year have remained bullish, with the $11.77 per share expected suggesting 20% year-over-year growth. The favorable earnings picture will support near-term share performance, with the recent weakness likely reflecting profit-taking. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms Enjoys Profitability Boost\n\nMETA shares have benefited nicely from improved operational efficiencies that have significantly boosted profitability. The company remains firmly in growth mode, with earnings and revenue climbing 80% and 30% throughout its latest period.\n\nLike MSFT, the outlook for its current fiscal year remains bullish, with the $20.21 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 24% over the last year and suggesting a 36% year-over-year jump. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company has been performing nicely, with its advertising revenue positively surprising in six consecutive quarters. It’s worth noting that advertising represents the bulk of META’s revenue.\n\nIn addition, META shares aren’t expensive, with the current 23.6X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 37.0X. The current PEG ratio also works out to 1.2X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile shares have faced pressure, the company’s outlook remains notably bright, and investors should block out the noise.\n\nNvidia Outlook Remains Robust\n\nBeloved Nvidia has faced some pressure recently amid a broader cooldown in the semiconductor trade. Nonetheless, shares are still up a staggering 150% year-to-date, and its earnings outlook fully supports further near-term gains.\n\nThe stock maintains the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to its above-mentioned earnings outlook, which has shifted bullishly across the board. The $2.69 per share expected for its current year suggests a 100% year-over-year pop in earnings, with sales also expected to see a 90% increase. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe stock has been at the heart of the AI trade, with its Data Center results consistently blowing away expectations as of late.\n\nBreakneck growth has kept valuation multiples at historically sound levels, with the current 39.1X forward 12-month earnings multiple below the 50.7X five-year median and five-year highs of 106.3X.\n\nKeep in mind that shares traded well above current valuation levels in 2020 and 2021, a time when the AI theme had yet to emerge fully. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPutting Everything Together\n\nWhile several Mag 7 stocks – Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, and Nvidia NVDA – have faced pressure over recent weeks, their outlooks and fundamentals underneath the hood remain more than sound.\n\nTheir recent weakness has coincided with a strong move from small-cap stocks, perhaps a reflection of rotation and profit-taking after remarkable starts to 2024.\n\nNonetheless, these stocks’ runs certainly aren’t over, and they remain prime selections for portfolios.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

His most recent position, before founding AI powered education platform Sizzle AI, was as VP of AI for Meta (META), where he worked extensively on developing the Llama model.\n\nSays Pesenti on fears of a robot-run society, \"The real world is very complicated, and very unpredictable,\" adding one need not look any further than the autonomous driving industry to see the difficulties in bringing AI to life. SHANGHAI, CHINA - JULY 05 2024: Visitors check out Tesla's second-generation Optimus humanoid robot exhibited at the World AI Conference in Shanghai. (Photo credit should read / Feature China/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (Feature China via Getty Images)\n\nContrast Pesanti’s sentiment with that of Musk, who introduced the first Optimus bots at an AI Day on August 19, 2021.\n\nThe prototype soon followed, complete with the ability to walk on two legs, use its hands and arms, and perform a range of complex tasks. The Tesla CEO has ceremoniously declared that robotics would take over cars as the main money driver at the company over time.\n\nThe current iteration of Optimus, says Musk, is able to perform \"simple\" factory tasks.\n\n\"As I've said before, I think Optimus will be more valuable than everything else combined. Because if you've got a sentient humanoid robots that is able to navigate reality and do tasks at request, there is no meaningful limit to the size of the economy,\" Musk told investors on his late April earnings call.\n\nOn Monday, Musk wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \"Tesla will have genuinely useful humanoid robots in low production for Tesla internal use next year and, hopefully, high production for other companies in 2026.\"\n\nThe billionaire has a track record of not meeting his deadlines.\n\nPesanti noted that humanoids “work well in factories when they have a small set of actions. They don’t wash our clothes. They don’t empty our dishwasher. They don’t fold the stuff,” he said.\n\nThere is a business case for them though, reasons Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe total addressable market for humanoid robots is projected to reach $38 billion by 2035, up more than sixfold from a previous projection of $6 billion, according to recent research from Goldman Sachs analyst Jacqueline Du.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs says that there’s been significant progress in end-to-end AI, through which models can train themselves, removing the need for a human engineer to code everything by hand.\n\nAs a result, that's speeding up robot development, allowing the machines to perform more tasks and adapt to new situations (such as working outside of factories) more quickly.\n\nRather than channeling Musk with AI robots, Pesenti is sticking with his software roots.\n\nPesanti created Sizzle after tutoring his children during COVID-19 lockdowns. An aha moment led him to create a free, accessible AI tutoring service.\n\nHe told Yahoo Finance the company has 12 employees and has raised millions in capital, and is focused on bringing new features to market.\n\nPesanti has plenty of optimism, even as AI has a long way to go. “The funny thing about AI is the more progress we make, the more we realize the goal is further away,” he said.\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled, market-focused conversations and chats with the biggest names in business on Opening Bid.

        "title": "This Undervalued Stock Could Join Amazon in the $2 Trillion Club",
        "content": "\"I believe in buying great companies -- especially companies that are undervalued, and/or underappreciated.\"\n\n-- Peter Lynch\n\nIt doesn't matter what you're buying -- clothes, groceries, a home -- everyone wants a good deal. And the same is true with stocks. No one wants to overpay for an investment.\n\nYet, identifying whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued is more complex than it may seem. Granted, every stock has a price, but that isn't enough to determine value.\n\nFor example, MetaPlatforms(NASDAQ: META) has a price -- a market cap, that is -- of about $1.2 trillion at the moment. But it appears undervalued, and its market cap could surge to more than $2 trillion soon. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms' valuation hints at opportunity\n\nTo understand why Meta Platform's stock is undervalued, you must first understand the company's business model: It is one of two companies that between them control the lion's share of the digital advertising market (Alphabet, the parent company of Google, being the other).\n\nIn fact, in the first quarter, Meta reported over 3 billion daily active users -- roughly 38% of the global population. This massive user base allows it to place countless ads across its platforms, most notably on Facebook and Instagram. Meta generated $35.6 billion of ad revenue in the first quarter alone.\n\nBest of all for the company and its shareholders, much of that revenue is converted into profits. Meta's net income rose to $12.4 billion in Q1 -- up 117% from a year earlier.\n\nSimilarly, Meta's free cash flow is growing, too. Over the last 12 months, the company has reported nearly $50 billion in free cash flow. On a per-share basis, Meta now delivers $18.82 in free cash flow, up from $6.60 less than two years ago. META Free Cash Flow Per Share Chart\n\nUltimately, it's Meta's free cash flow that makes the company's stock a bargain right now.\n\nMeta's free cash flow per share and how it stacks up\n\nIn the final analysis, all common stocks offer investors the same value proposition. When investors buy a stock, they gain an ownership stake in a portion of the company's future profits and cash flows.\n\nThat's why understanding valuation metrics is so important when investing in individual stocks -- investors have to know how to make apples-to-apples comparisons.\n\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the valuation metric that stands out is its price-to-free-cash-flow ratio, which gauges its ability to generate cash for shareholders. Here's how Meta's ratio stacks up against a couple of its megacap peers. META Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nAs you can see, Meta has remained cheaper than Alphabet over the last six months and is well below Amazon's ratio. This all matters because, as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has noted, rising free cash flow per share is crucial to the long-term success of any business. Often, the faster a company grows its free cash flow, the faster its stock price will rise. Based on its free cash flow growth, Meta's stock price should be higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd you can see this when it comes to Meta's recent stock performance. Year to date, Meta is up 35%, Alphabet is up 27%, and Amazon is up 21%. META Chart\n\nCould Meta Platforms reach the $2 trillion club?\n\nFor Meta to reach a $2 trillion market cap, its stock would need to rise by about 67%. Not only do I think that's possible, I believe it is likely.\n\nMeta went public in 2012. Over the last 12 years, its stock price has grown by 1,150% -- a compound annual rate of 23%. If its growth from here matches that average rate, Meta's market cap will hit $2 trillion in early 2027.\n\nThat timeline may be a bit too ambitious, as Meta has suffered some setbacks over the last few years, including a 77% share price plunge back in 2022. Nevertheless, the company has more than recovered from that bear market and remains one of the world's premier digital advertising companies. In addition, it is investing tens of billions into innovative technologies like artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and the metaverse.\n\nIn summary, Meta Platforms may take longer than three years to reach the $2 trillion club, but it's still likely to get there one day.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "People spend a lot of time on their devices, but the actual number may surprise you. The average American spends 4.5 hours on their smartphone each day, and that’s not even including laptops and tablets.\n\nOur digital devices give us access to many perks that are more difficult to obtain in the real world. The digital world makes it easy for people to buy any product, access various entertainment options, and communicate with people from anywhere.\n\nInvestors can generate sizable returns by observing others. People spend a lot of time on their phones but also a lot of money. Some leaders in the digital world generate billions of dollars in quarterly revenue. These same businesses have delivered impressive long-term returns for their shareholders.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAre you wondering which companies make sense for capitalizing on the digital world? These digital stocks offer plenty of potential for patient investors with lengthy time horizons.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) someone using the Facebook (FB stock) app on their phone in front of a laptop that also has the Facebook webpage on it\n\nSource: Chinnapong / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s no secret that most people spend hours online and use the web to make purchasing decisions. They read online reviews, look at advertisements, and read detailed articles to determine which products to buy.\n\nMany businesses want to show up in front of the right people more often, and they turn to companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to make it happen. Facebook’s parent company has 3.24 billion daily active users across its social networks, offering plenty of prospects for advertisers.\n\nThe company is still growing at a torrid pace despite being well-known. Revenue increased by 27% year-over-year in the first quarter while net income was up by 115%. Meta Platforms has been boosting its profits during its year of efficiency, which led to meaningful returns. Shares are up by 38% year-to-date and have gained 140% over the past five years. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.5x and offers a 0.4% dividend yield.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon building at night time with logo light up on building\n\nSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s hard to think of a company that has done better in the digital world than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The tech giant released its online marketplace more than 30 years ago, and it’s still bringing in billions of dollars every quarter. Amazon redefined how people shop for products and services and expanded into high-growth industries like cloud computing, advertising, gaming, groceries, and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe tech conglomerate reported 13% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter, demonstrating that growth is still strong after so many years. Net income more than tripled as well. Amazon enjoyed a 22% year-to-date gain and is up 86% over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile those gains are good, Wall Street believes the stock has more to give. The stock is rated as a “strong buy”, and the average price target implies a 22% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $250 per share suggests the stock can gain an additional 37%.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Meta Platforms is an advertising leader in its own right, one tech giant surpasses it. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) makes billions each quarter from ad placements on Google, YouTube, and websites that use Google AdSense. The tech giant surpassed a $2 trillion market cap earlier this year and logged a 29% year-to-date gain. Shares are also up by 217% over the past five years.\n\nAlphabet presents a healthy mix of growth and value. On one hand, the stock has a 28x P/E ratio and a 0.4% yield. On the other hand, Alphabet delivered 15% year-over-year revenue growth and 57% net income growth in the first quarter. Alphabet is also looking at cost-cutting measures that can increase value for long-term investors. The company’s recently announced dividend further highlights leadership’s commitment to shareholders.\n\nWall Street analysts like what they see and have rated the stock as a “strong buy.” The average price target suggests the stock can gain an extra 14%.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe digital world has enabled many possibilities but has also created many risks. One key concern is how much data hackers can access if they infiltrate a company’s database. Cyberattacks can cost millions of dollars and hurt brand loyalty.\n\nCorporations and small businesses turn to cybersecurity giants like Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) to keep their data safe. Cybersecurity stocks also generated impressive long-term returns for investors. For instance, Fortinet has more than tripled over the past five years.\n\nWhile any investor would be happy with those five-year gains, Fortinet had a rough 2023. Revenue and net income growth decelerated, slamming the brakes on stock gains. However, the tide appears to be changing. Fortinet reported 7.2% year-over-year revenue growth and 20.8% net income growth in the first quarter. Service revenue was a big highlight that jumped by 24.8%. Fortinet is currently rated as a “hold” with a projected 18% upside.\n\nUpwork (UPWK) The logo for Upwork (UPWK) is displayed on a cellphone.\n\nSource: Funstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe internet doesn’t only offer ways for people to find entertainment and buy products from anywhere in the world. It has created many career opportunities and made it easier for people to work remotely. Investors hoping to capitalize on this trend may consider Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK).\n\nThe online freelance marketplace hasn’t had the best year as a stock. It’s down by 20% year-to-date, but that dip has resulted in a P/E of 34x. Furthermore, revenue and net income are both on the upswing. Upwork reported 18.7% year-over-year revenue growth and 7.4% net income growth in the first quarter. The freelance marketplace’s advertising revenue continued to soar and recorded a 93% gain from a year ago. Revenue from Freelancer Plus subscriptions increased by 76% as the platform surpassed 100,000 active members.\n\nUpwork is also making investments into artificial intelligence that enhance the user experience. Uma, Upwork’s Mindful AI, helps match employers and freelancers for optimal positions.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Close up hand holding mobile with Digital Advertising and icons, Digital Marketing concept. digital ad stocks\n\nSource: weedezign via Shutterstock\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) serves business owners and influencers who want more people to know about their businesses. Instead of offering ad placements, Semrush offers tools that help people with keyword research and ad campaign optimization. The company has attracted nearly 112,000 paying customers to several subscription plans. Semrush also has 1.12 million registered free customers on its email list.\n\nThe company successfully raised the average revenue per customer while attracting more customers. This dynamic should help Semrush deliver enticing long-term returns for its investors. Shares are up by 5% year-to-date and gained 38% over the past year. The firm delivered 21% year-over-year revenue growth and 122% net income growth in the first quarter.\n\nWall Street analysts are confident that the company will continue to gain market share and reward patient investors. It’s rated as a “moderate buy” among five analysts and has an average price target that suggests a 15% upside. The highest price target of $18 per share implies that Semrush can gain an additional 30% from current levels.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) The Duolingo (DUOL) logo on a smartphone screen with a map in the background.\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock.com\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is a leading educational app that helps people learn new languages. The company has also expanded to offer verbal and written lessons for math, music, and other subjects. Although it looks attractive in the long run, it has endured an 18% year-to-date loss.\n\nThe company’s substantial net income growth is a key reason for confidence. Duolingo reported $27 million in profits in the first quarter, compared to a $2.6 million net loss in the same period last year. Duolingo also reported 45% year-over-year revenue growth to reach $167.6 million in sales.\n\nDuolingo’s financials weren’t the only positive development. The firm is rapidly expanding its user base. About 31.4 million people use the app daily, a 54% improvement from a year ago. Meanwhile, monthly active users totaled 97.6 million people, marking a 35% improvement. A soaring user base that’s very active should pave the way for more gains. Recent stock price movements don’t align with the company’s long-term potential.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AMZN and GOOG.

        "title": "Meta's reality check: Inside the $45 billion cash burn at Reality Labs",
        "content": "Nearly $50 billion.\n\nIn just over four years, Meta (META)’s Reality Labs division — focused mainly on its products in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the metaverse — has lost as much money as the market caps of Snap (SNAP) and Pinterest (PINS) combined.\n\nInsiders tell Yahoo Finance that the staggering cash burn is not the price of innovation, but rather the result of a “chaotic” culture that features frequent reorganizations and installation of top leaders without AR or VR expertise.\n\nWith Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg warning that operating losses in Reality Labs will only continue to “increase meaningfully,” Yahoo Finance spoke to a dozen former high-level employees (mostly executives or managers across multiple segments including engineering, research, product management, hardware, content, and operating systems) who say the lack of a clear vision and mismanagement are largely to blame for Reality Labs' financial pitfalls.\n\nThe former employees Yahoo Finance spoke with left within the last three years, with the earliest departing in February of 2021 and the most recent ones this year. The majority left on their own because of what they called discord within Reality Labs, but some left due to structural layoffs.\n\nThey asked not to be named because of nondisclosure agreements and a fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities.\n\nMeta did not respond to Yahoo Finance’s multiple requests for comment on this story.\n\nThe question for investors is how to reconcile Reality Labs' multibillion-dollar expenses within the context of Zuckerberg’s “year of efficiency” promise for Meta. Despite implementing cost-cutting measures and scaling back spending in Q1 of 2023, Meta saw its shares tank 20% after its most recent earnings report, thanks to a significant increase in AI investment.\n\nWith Zuckerberg back to breaking open the checkbook, is there enough room on the balance sheet for his AI pivot and Reality Labs' steep losses? Although analysts and investors have remained patient on the long-term potential of AR and VR, how long is that leash more than 10 years on?\n\nBack in 2014, Meta (then Facebook) made its two largest acquisitions ever in just over a month. The first was its $16 billion purchase of WhatsApp. The second was of a smaller outfit out of Irvine, Calif., that had only developed a prototype of its revolutionary VR headset. The company’s name was Oculus and the promise of its technology was enough for Mark Zuckerberg to shell out $2 billion — only a fraction of what he’d spend on its development over the next decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn its first few years under the Facebook umbrella, Oculus's financials were grouped in with every other product in the business. But during the COVID-19 pandemic, Zuckerberg became enamored with the potential of the Metaverse — so much so that he changed the name of his company from Facebook to Meta.\n\nMeta also began breaking out its revenue and expenses into two separate divisions: “Family of Apps” (which included Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp), and “Reality Labs” (a combination of Oculus and its other mixed-reality investments). In 2020, the former reported a profit of more than $39 billion, while Reality Labs lost just over $6 billion.\n\nThe numbers only became worse for Meta over the ensuing years: a $10 billion loss in 2021, $13 billion in 2022, and $16 billion in 2023. Furthermore, slumping sales and poor mainstream adoption caused Reality Labs’ revenue to decrease annually. Since 2021, Reality Labs' annual revenue has been falling despite significant increases in spend.\n\nIn just the first quarter of 2024, Meta has reported a loss of $3.8 billion, about equal to its total revenues in the last two years combined. Analysts Yahoo Finance surveyed projected Q2 losses for the division would be closer to $5 billion. The lowest forecast we received was $4.6 billion.\n\n'Employee Bingo'\n\nSeveral of the people interviewed blamed the dysfunction and cash burn at Reality Labs on chain of command reorganizations they say took place every three to six months. This included the promotion of “local heroes” — or individuals that had succeeded elsewhere within Meta, such as Instagram or Facebook — who were then asked to replicate those results inside of Reality Labs. The lack of understanding of the technology often led to tension between new managers and the existing staff.\n\n“It was pretty chaotic,” said a former employee who worked on the research team and said leaders were often pulled from the apps division with little VR experience. \"In software you can get away with that because you make mistakes and change things all the time. In hardware, you’re stuck with your mistakes for a long time.”\n\n“If you’re a senior director, they forklift you into any position,” said a former executive in engineering. “You can lead an organization, set priorities, take on anything from Instagram ads to AR software design. It creates this really weird dynamic where the people in the trenches doing the work don’t have respect for the senior leaders and the senior leaders don’t really speak the language of the technology they’re building.”\n\n“They play employee bingo,” said another employee responsible for AR/VR content. “They move people into AR that don’t really understand it. It’s hardware and experience, not a news feed in your hand.”\n\nOne former executive in product management told us, “There's an arrogance there that says, ‘Look how much money I was accountable for making because of this role I played in Facebook’s Family of Apps — therefore I can obviously be successful at this new thing.’\"\n\n\"I think that’s probably the real story as to why there’s been so much money thrown at this thing with such limited success today,” they said.\n\nJust last month, several senior managers and vice presidents were quietly let go from the company, according to two people familiar with the matter. Their positions at Reality Labs included head of AR glasses hardware, head of hardware partnerships, vice president of supply chain organization, vice president of technology engineering, and head of silicon partnerships.\n\nAnother challenge is the lack of traction AR and VR products have had in gaining a wider audience. Meta also competes in the segment with Snap, Tik Tok parent Bytedance, and now Apple (AAPL).\n\nCircana Research analyst Ben Arnold says total AR and VR device sales in the US were just over $1 billion last year — a year in which Meta’s Reality Labs expenses alone topped $18 billion. According to IDC's analysis, global shipments of AR and VR headsets dropped 67.4% year over year in 2024 Q1.\n\nMeta’s current product lineup includes two VR headsets (the Quest 3 and Quest Vision Pro) and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. But Arnold says software gains will be critical to the industry, specifically “in content and applications that appeal to people beyond gamer.\"\n\n\"That’s always been the challenge for this category,” he said.\n\nA former employee said that at one point, there were 24 hardware products on an 18-month roadmap. \"You might be able to do that if you’re shipping software experiences, but highly unlikely for an organization that has never really shipped outside of the Oculus space.\"\n\nThe source said management did not realize until too late that shipping \"a wrist [watch], sunglasses, new controller models, new VR experiences, new mixed-reality experiences\" was unrealistic, leading to low morale among the workforce.\n\n“I had severe doubts about leadership,” they said.\n\nEmblematic of that lack of direction was the scrapped development of Meta’s in-house chips for its Ray-Ban smart glasses and other devices. In 2021, after over a year of design and build, Meta’s vice president of AR Alex Himel abruptly canceled the project, instead returning to using an external Qualcomm (QCOM) chip.\n\nThe team was incensed. “All of us in the room that were software and chip people were like, ‘You’re insane,’” said a former executive who was directly involved in the project. “People were livid over this. People left the company. This guy basically flushed millions of dollars down the toilet.”\n\nThe cost of the internal chip was cheaper than Qualcomm's chip, according to another executive involved. \"It's illustrative of this mindset of not really taking the innovation piece seriously and not wanting to invest in long-term deep technology on the hardware side,\" they said. Himel did not respond to Yahoo Finance’s request for comment.\n\nAnother executive put Meta’s spontaneous decision making more succinctly: “I had anti-confidence in the roadmap. Zuck gets excited. Everyone rallies around what Zuck gets excited about. Boz [Reality Labs head Andrew Bosworth] gets a budget based on Zuck’s excitement, and then we go off and try to figure out what the product looks like. Over and over and over again.” Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth did not respond to a request for an interview.

(Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nAs for Zuckerberg's vision for his multibillion-dollar bet, sources say he sees the metaverse as another community he can own, similar to how he revolutionized social media with Facebook. \"He's really big on the notion of an immersive presence across boundaries,\" a former executive who worked closely with Zuckerberg said.\n\n\"When we were working on the Orion [AR] glasses, the top Zuck scenario was always immersive video calls. We did all the modeling on the heat and battery performance and we told him, 'Dude, we can do a call like this for five minutes and then the person's head catches on fire.' It's a power-hungry thing, but it's one of those goals he's chasing.\"\n\nAnother former executive said Zuckerberg is at the mercy of Apple — due to its anti-data-tracking efforts and Vision Pro development — so he's playing \"a big chess game.\"\n\n\"His bet is that the next thing after phones will be augmented reality glasses. Apple is making moves and he's trying to protect by investing in the future and hoping to own the next platform.\"\n\nWall Street, meanwhile, has its own mixed reality on the stock. Gene Munster, co-founder of Deepwater Asset Management, called Reality Labs “a disaster from a financial perspective.” Munster told Yahoo Finance that the stock would be higher if not for the significant cash burn inside the division.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives agreed, referring to Reality Labs as the “black eye of spending at Meta.” Yet, both remain bullish on the stock, despite Munster believing that Reality Labs won’t play a real role in Meta’s future for at least a decade.\n\nMeta investor Dan Niles of Niles Investment Management called Reality Labs “a giant insurance policy,” saying Meta could always cut spending in the division if its other businesses falter.\n\nFor those insiders with “Reality Labs” on their resumes, it’s a different conclusion. “It just doesn’t seem responsible,” said a former executive. “If I was a shareholder, I would rather see Zuckerberg putting all their metaverse infrastructure on top of somebody else burning at those rates. Let Samsung or Apple build that hardware.”\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X @YasminKhorram and on LinkedIn.

        "title": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Looks To Prolong Its Impressive Returns",
        "content": "What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Meta Platforms, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.29 = US$56b ÷ (US$223b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThus, Meta Platforms has an ROCE of 29%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 6.4%.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Meta Platforms  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Meta Platforms compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Meta Platforms .\n\nThe Trend Of ROCE\n\nIn terms of Meta Platforms' history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. The company has consistently earned 29% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 96% in that time. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Meta Platforms' ROCE\n\nIn summary, we're delighted to see that Meta Platforms has been compounding returns by reinvesting at consistently high rates of return, as these are common traits of a multi-bagger. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 149% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\n\nOn a separate note, we've found  1 warning sign for Meta Platforms  you'll probably want to know about.\n\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our freelist of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.\n\nStory continues\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "If you want to invest smartly, look no further than dividend stocks.\n\nThese powerful investments offer the best of both worlds, combining steady income with the potential for superb capital gains. Hence, they are ideal for those looking for financial stability, delivering regular dividends while promising long-term wealth creation.\r\nOver the past few years, the focus has been mostly on high-growth tech stocks. AI has effectively spearheaded the equity market, with a narrow range of stocks dominating the proceedings. Nonetheless, building a well-rounded portfolio is paramount, which makes it imperative to consider reliable dividend stocks.\n\nWith that in mind, these dividend stocks effectively capture the essence of the earlier discussion, offering superb upside with growing dividend payouts. They are excellent bets for those looking to diversify their investment strategies while ensuring a steady flow of income.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)made a surprising entry into the dividend stock arena this year.\n\nFollowing the monstrous success of its ‘Year of Efficiency’ in 2023 and AI advancements, Meta is eager to distribute some of its profits to its shareholders. The inaugural 50-cent quarterly dividend signals confidence in its ability to generate sustained cash flows and appeal to a wider investor base.\n\nFinancially, Meta continues to impress. It surpassed estimates across both lines in each of the past four quarters. Moreover, Meta has consistently impressed over the past 12 quarters, with about 67% of its earnings reports either meeting or exceeding expectations. The integration of AI across its enormous’ Family of Apps’ ecosystem has been the primary driver behind these lofty numbers.\n\nFurthermore, despite the superb run-up in value over the past year, Meta still has gas left in the tank. Analysts forecast a double-digit jump in META stock from its current levels, and the upcoming second-quarter (Q2) earnings beat could be just the boost needed.\n\nClorox (CLX) Clorox bleach bottles lined up on a store shelf.\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nClorox (NYSE:CLX) stands out as an attractive risk backed by an evergreen business of essential, everyday products with stable demand. Known for its bleach and cleaning supplies, Clorox operates a recession-resistant business with stable growth across both lines. Moreover, its investors value the firm for its consistent dividend payments. It has paid a growing dividend for the past 46 years, yielding an excellent 3.55%, and could soon become a ‘Dividend King.’\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the past year, Clorox has navigated market headwinds with considerable aplomb. Its strategic pricing and cost efficiencies have effectively enabled the firm to maintain its margins near its lofty averages. Clorox’s superb fallout management from its 2023 cyberattack underscores its resiliency. It’s now back posting, encouraging organic sales growth while growing its margins in tandem.\n\nCLX stock has been a laggard over the past 12 months, shedding north of 13%. Nevertheless, its attractive dividend profile is enough to sway any investor who’s on the fence.\n\nVici Properties (VICI) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American real estate company Vici Properties Inc. on screen in front of web page. VICI stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nVici Properties (NYSE:VICI) is a high-yielding real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on gaming, hospitality and entertainment. Though it’s one of the riskier plays in its niche, it boasts a massive portfolio of 29 gaming facilities and 19,200 hotel rooms, underscoring its formidable position. Nevertheless, investing in VICI stock comes with greater exposure to economic swings, making it a compelling pick for adventurous investors. It currently yields more than 5.4% and has grown its payouts for the past five years.\n\nRecent financials have been encouraging, with it comfortably beating top-line estimates while posting healthy growth in its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO). Revenues climbed 8.4% year-over-year (YOY) in Q1 to $951.5 million, while its AFFO shot up by 10.3% to $583.2 million. Moreover, operational expenses growth during Q1 was flat at $150.4 million.\n\nAlso, the REIT recently announced a massive $700 million investment in The Venetian Resort Las Vegas. The investment will significantly improve guest experiences following a major revamping of afternoon, entertainment and convention spaces.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Google parent Alphabet to report Q2 earnings Tuesday with AI, ad spending front and center",
        "content": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) will report its fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, giving Wall Street a closer look at the state of the digital advertising market and whether generative AI hype is translating to revenue growth. The tech giant is coming off of an impressive first quarter during which it announced it initiated its first dividend of $0.20 per share and authorized stock repurchases of $70 billion.\n\nAlphabet shares are up 30% year to date. Shares of rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are up 18% and 22% year to date, respectively. All three companies are pouring money into building out their generative AI capabilities, spending lavishly on data centers capable of powering the AI models they offer via their cloud service platforms.\n\nFor the quarter, analysts are anticipating earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue of $84.35 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would be a major jump from the same period last year when the company reported earnings per share of $1.44 on revenue of $74.6 billion.\n\nWall Street expects advertising revenue to top $64.5 billion, up from $58.1 billion last year. That includes year-over-year increases in Google Search & other, YouTube ads, and Google Network revenue, pointing to a positive advertising environment. A beat by Alphabet could also buoy shares of ad business rival Meta (META).\n\nIn an investor note, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said he expects advertising spending to be similar to or better than Q1, with Google paid search growth in the mid-teens.\n\n“Fundamentals remain healthy, with solid ad spend, potential benefits from Olympics and elections,” Thill wrote.\n\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt struck a similarly upbeat tone in his investor note. “We think the setup remains positive heading into 2Q results with our ad survey and agency commentary pointing to continued strength for Google Search,” he wrote. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai speaks during the tech titan's annual I/O developers conference on May 14 in Mountain View, Calif. (Photo by GLENN CHAPMAN/AFP via Getty Images) (GLENN CHAPMAN via Getty Images)\n\nOn the cloud front, Wall Street is anticipating Google Cloud revenue of $10.1 billion and operating income of $982.2 million. That would mark an increase from the $8 billion in revenue and $395 million in operating income the company reported in Q2 2023.\n\nGoogle still trails both Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud space, with its rivals capturing the number one and two spots, respectively. However, the segment continues to grow, and Alphabet is banking on its investments in generative AI to help power stronger revenue and customer acquisition in the future.\n\nBut when exactly AI starts to generate revenue for Google’s Cloud business, let alone its ad segment, is still up in the air.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It is still too early to count on AI benefits as most [companies] remain in pilot mode, and material AI [revenue] is more likely a 2025-26 event,” Thill wrote.\n\nAs for Google’s search business, Devitt says AI search overviews could create “incremental engagement and may become a tailwind for Search monetization over time.”\n\nGoogle is still trying to find its footing with AI Overview, the generative AI feature that shows up at the top of Google Search results pages. In May, the company rolled out the search function, only for users to quickly discover that its answers weren’t always accurate, with now famous responses telling users to put glue in their pizza or to eat a rock every day. Google responded by pulling back some of the gen AI features.\n\nWhile generative AI is sure to be a major theme this earnings season, it’s still unclear how much it will boost companies' bottom lines. But with Google the first among Big Tech companies to report earnings, it should give us some indication of whether the technology is generating meaningful revenue or not.

        "title": "Trump continues to gain in Silicon Valley, Zuckerberg calls him 'Badass'",
        "content": "According to Bloomberg, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently praised former President Donald Trump, calling his reaction after being shot “badass” and “inspiring.”\n\nIn an interview at Meta’s headquarters, Bloomberg said Zuckerberg expressed admiration for Trump's resilience, noting, “Seeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life.”\n\nHe is said to have suggested that this display of spirit contributes to Trump’s strong appeal among voters.\n\nDespite his remarks, the publication said Zuckerberg stopped short of endorsing Trump or his rival, President Joe Biden, and stated that he does not plan to be involved in the upcoming election.\n\nBloomberg notes that Zuckerberg's comments reflect a broader trend in Silicon Valley, where figures like Elon Musk and venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz have also shown increasing support for Trump, with some even contributing to his campaign.\n\nBloomberg also reported that Zuckerberg discussed Meta’s efforts to reduce the political content on its platforms, emphasizing a desire for Facebook to be less of a flashpoint in elections. “The main thing that I hear from people is that they actually want to see less political content on our services,” Zuckerberg said, adding that Meta is working to recommend less political content to users.\n\nThe relationship between Zuckerberg and Trump has been strained, particularly after Trump was suspended from Facebook and Instagram following the January 6 Capitol riots.\n\nAlthough Trump’s accounts have been reinstated, he has expressed animosity towards Meta, recently warning Zuckerberg on Truth Social to “be careful” and criticizing the company as the “enemy of the people.”\n\nIn a final note, the publication said Zuckerberg commented on competition from TikTok, saying, “I think we’re doing pretty well here. We’re gaining market share,” but chose not to take a stance on whether the app should be banned, stating, “That’s above my pay grade,” as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTrump continues to gain in Silicon Valley, Zuckerberg calls him 'Badass'\n\nHarris calls Biden's record 'unmatched' as she launches her presidential campaign\n\nFactbox-Beshear, Shapiro among possible picks to become Harris' running mate",

        "title": "3 Social Media Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "As of July 2024, over 60% of the human population uses social media. This number will continue rising as global economies improve. Developing countries where social media may not be prevalent show signs of significantly growing GDP.  As disposable incomes rise, this usage percent will only keep growing. The social media industry is a relatively safe bet for investors, but finding the right companies is difficult.\n\nAs someone who’s spent multiple hours scrolling reels, I can confirm the active user acquisition percentage is high, which has significantly contributed to this industry’s explosive growth. Social media isn’t affected by the high cost of capital market conditions, such as current inflation within the economy. With social media being a lower-risk investment, here are three social media stocks to buy now.\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpotify (NYSE:SPOT) is a digital streaming service that provides music, podcasts and other audio content to over 600 million users worldwide. Recently, Spotify declared 2024 to be the “Year of Monetization”,  emphasizing their goals of increasing profitability.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSpotify surprised analysts with an impressive Q1 2024 earnings call of $3.89 billion, exceeding expectations by $1.19 billion. Additionally, Spotify’s gross profit margin improved to 27.6% in the first quarter, with analysts projecting a continuous increase to 28.9% by the fourth quarter. This performance receives further support from the company’s subscriber surge by 14% in Q1.\n\nSpotify’s focus on improving content quality and monetization is resulting in significant growth. Nevertheless, the company continues to innovate with new features. For instance, Spotify is beta testing a generative AI playlists feature from users’ prompts. Likewise, Spotify anticipates adding 16 million new monthly users and 6 million more premium subscribers, aiming for a total of almost 631 million users by the end of the year. Therefore, investors should consider Spotify as one of the social media stocks to buy now, especially given its strategic efforts aimed at expanding its user base and enhancing engagement.\n\nMeta (META) A woman holds Apple iPhone X with Instagram application on the screen at cafe.

META stock, Instagram layoffs\n\nSource: wichayada suwanachun / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) is a global technology industry leader that owns and operates social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp, among other products and services. The company is a notable force in the modern tech world.\n\nIn the Q1 earnings call, Meta surprised with a $36.46 billion revenue, surpassing expectations by $231.89 million. Additionally, Meta has recently reached an impressive 3.24 billion daily active users across all of its platforms, demonstrating a 7% YOY increase. This highlights the company’s sustained relevance, user loyalty and continuous growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2024, Meta began heavily investing in the development of the metaverse and virtual reality, which have potential to significantly boost revenue. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg envisions a future where AI bots create and post content across the company’s various apps, creating novel content. Additionally, Instagram Reels continue to capture user engagement, particularly among younger demographics, boosting advertising revenue. The stock prediction for 2025 is currently $654.97, representing a potential 30.93% increase in the META stock price. Therefore, Meta’s strong financial performance and technological investments depict it as one of the social media stocks to buy now.\n\nPinterest (PINS) the pinterest (PINS stock) logo on a mobile phone held by a woman\n\nSource: Nopparat Khokthong / Shutterstock.com\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) is a leading social media platform that allows users to search for ideas and inspiration visually. PINS has seen strong revenue growth for the past four fiscal years, with a key concern being profitability. However, the company is undervalued, with analysts setting an average growth estimate at $46.30, representing a growth potential of 13.59%.\n\nDespite increasing revenue, the company still posted losses in fiscal year 2023. Profitability is sitting at 4.64%, but an operating margin of -7.35% makes it such that PINS continues to loose money. However, year-on-year revenue growth is pretty good– with PINS showing a quarterly revenue growth rate of 22.8%, representing rapid growth.\n\nThe company is investing heavily in AI at the moment, with it recently unveiling “Canvas AI” at a conference. This model is trained to enhance images that are already on Pinterest. Additionally, according to TechCrunch, Pinterest’s AI-powered collages carry more user engagement than Pins (posts on Pinterest). Higher engagement directly correlates to higher revenue, solidifying the growth trajectory the company has been on. These reasons make PINS one of the social media stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Rodrigues did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

In the second quarter, the fund returned -0.11% (gross) and -0.31% (net) compared to 8.33% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and 4.28% for the S&P 500 Index. Generative AI (GenAI) remains the dominant market narrative in the second quarter. The portfolio does not own NVIDIA or other Semiconductor companies that are presently benefitting from the demand for AI hardware. However, with the portfolio’s extensive investment in software and IT services, the firm anticipates that GenAI's long-term economic gains will go to these industries. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy highlighted stocks like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a technology company that develops products to connect people. The one-month return of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was -4.43%, and its shares gained 63.50% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On July 3, 2024, Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"In the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio's performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company's \"year of efficiency,\" where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\"\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is in third position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 246 hedge fund portfolios held Meta Platforms, Inc.

While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms, Inc.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 11 Biggest AI and Tech Stock Analyst Upgrades and Downgrades in July So Far. Since Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nAs soon as the latest softer-than-expected inflation data numbers were out, investors began to take profits from major tech stocks and pour money into small-cap companies amid hopes of rate cuts. However, some were quick to call the latest decline in tech stocks the end of the AI-fueled rally that has pushed stock valuations to eye-popping levels. But there are some Wall Street analysts who believe this is just a short-term trend and large tech and AI stocks have a lot of room to grow. Samantha McLemore, CIO of Patient Capital, said while talking to CNBC that the “bull market continues and the path of least resistance is higher.”\n\nThe analyst said that she has been in the market for a long time and investors have been worrying about the end of the bull market since 2009, while the S&P 500 has grown over 1000% (17% per year) since then.\n\n“We don’t see any end to the bull market. We do think there’s a good chance we see a rotation and small caps, the laggards, do much better in the second half of the year as the Fed starts to cut rates.”\n\nSome analysts believe the latest decline in tech stocks is yet another opportunity for long-term investors to pile into AI stocks for gains. In this backdrop, we decided to take a look at the top AI stock upgrades and downgrades this month. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.  However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it’ll bode well for the stock down the road.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta’s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc.

The company generates revenue predominantly from advertising. which accounts for over 95% of its total revenue, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal fourth quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings surpassing analyst estimates. The better-than- expected revenues were attributed to strong advertiser demand and Al-driven ad improvements.

        "content": "Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has, despite a few missteps, been a roaring success as a company over the years. It continues to be quite the juggernaut on the stock market, too. It might be hard to believe now, but the company's IPO price was set at $38 per share when it went public in 2012; it now trades for nearly $480.\n\nEven across a 12-year stretch, that's quite the return. Yet there are more gains to be had in the proximate future, at least if we can believe one analyst's recent bullish take on the company.\n\n15% upside potential, analyst believes\n\nIn mid-July, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) Securities' Justin Post reiterated his buy recommendation on Meta stock. He also maintained his $550 per-share price target, implying 15% potential upside on the current level.\n\nPost felt compelled to write a fresh note on the company because of some scuttlebutt about one of its business units, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) division Reality Labs. According to a recent report in tech industry tracker The Information, Meta aims to reduce its spending on Reality Labs' hardware products by roughly 20%.\n\nOf this, the analyst wrote that given the \"somewhat limited industry traction for VR devices (balanced by new optimism on AR glasses), Meta's unprecedented investment in a new consumer platform that is still very early, and a shifting company focus toward artificial intelligence (AI), these potential cost cuts seem very logical to us.\"\n\nThere's nothing like a flexible management team\n\nWhile it's never encouraging to hear whispers of reduced spending on a hot product or service, I feel Post is right -- VR/AR is pretty lukewarm these days.\n\nI think Meta management doesn't get enough credit for being as nimble and as adaptable as it's been over the years. It's admirable the company doesn't get stuck on any one technology. That goes double these days, as AI in particular can become quite the sticky offering for Meta's immense user base.

        "content": "The metaverse, a virtual world where people can interact with one another using headsets and avatars, has been eclipsed by all the hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). However, the metaverse has not gone away. A number of leading metaverse stocks continue to work diligently on its development.\n\nWhile it doesn’t get as much media attention as a few years ago, the metaverse continues to be one of the fastest-growing areas of technology. The metaverse’s market size is forecast to grow from $86.31 billion in 2023 to $803.29 billion by 2031. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 40%. The technology underpinning the metaverse is only improving, as are the products related to the virtual realm.\n\nHere are three metaverse stocks that could grow your wealth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) entered the metaverse at the start of this year with the launch of its Vision Pro augmented reality headset, the company’s first new product since the introduction of the Apple Watch in 2015. At the beginning of July, Apple expanded the Vision Pros availability to Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. While the headset has won technical praise from critics, its price has been an issue.\n\nThe headset allows users to play video games, view photographs, and watch movies in a virtual setting. It is priced at $3,499 in the U.S. market. Analysts say the hefty price tag puts the Vision Pro out of reach for most consumers. Apple looks to be rectifying the situation by developing a cheaper model. Media reports say Apple is focused on entering the lower end of the augmented reality headset market in 2025.\n\nApple’s stock has increased 20% so far this year. All in all, this is one of the top metaverse stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) remains a top metaverse stock and the industry leader when it comes to virtual reality or augmented reality headsets. Meta’s Quest device has a starting price of $499.99. It has become the market leader, having won praise from critics and consumers alike. The latest Quest 3 device continues to sell extremely well and has proven to be popular with kids.\n\nBeyond its lower price, other advantages to the Quest include a longer battery life and more applications than competing devices, including Apple’s Vision Pro headset. Meta Platforms rebranded itself a few years ago to reflect its focus on the metaverse. It also continues to lead the development of the technology that underpins virtual realms and products. META stock has increased 52% in the last 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s had a rough go of it lately, but video game developer Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) is still a metaverse stock worth considering. The company runs the Roblox online video game platform. Roblox is a virtual world in which users can program and play games they create themselves or with other users. While Roblox remains extremely popular with kids and teens, the stock has struggled with mixed earnings and guidance.\n\nMost recently, Roblox posted a Q1 loss of 43 cents per share. This was much better than a loss of 53 cents expected on Wall Street. Bookings totaled $923.8 million in Q1, up 19% from a year earlier and above analyst estimates of $919 million. While the financial results were positive, the company delivered forward guidance that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. This sent the stock lower.\n\nManagement said they expect bookings (revenue) of $870 million to $900 million for the year’s second quarter, below analysts’ calls for $929 million. For all of 2024, bookings are expected to be between $4 billion and $4.1 billion, down from an earlier forecast of $4.14 billion to $4.28 billion. RBLX stock is down 7% so far in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite lists thousands of publicly-traded stocks in various industries. The index has more than doubled over the past five years and looks like it will continue to march higher. Many Nasdaq stocks have outperformed inflation and savings accounts, but some of them have stood out against promising investment opportunities like real estate.\n\nBuying the best Nasdaq stocks allows investors to generate solid returns without much effort. You don’t have to manage properties or look at the stock market every day. It only takes a few hours each week to monitor your investments to ensure the growth catalysts are still in place.\n\nHowever, past returns do not guarantee future successes. While momentum indicates how investors feel about a stock, it’s important to look at a company’s financials before committing to an investment. Revenue, profits and growth rates are key factors to consider. Investors can choose from many stocks, but these three Nasdaq stocks show a lot of promise for long-term investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nRobinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) has become the preferred trading app for millions of consumers. The fintech firm forced many changes in the industry with zero-fee trades, forcing other brokerage firms to trim their fees. Robinhood is innovating in another way that can lead to more changes within the industry.\n\nRobinhood Gold memberships offer incentives that are hard to match. Members receive 1% deposit boosts, 3% IRA matches, 5% APY on their idle cash, a credit card with unlimited 3% cashback across the board and other perks. Robinhood closed out the first quarter with 1.7 million members, which is a 42% year-over-year increase.\n\nThis membership program was one of the catalysts for Robinhood’s successful quarter. Revenue increased by 40% year-over-year with a 59% year-over-year increase in transaction-based revenue leading the way. Cryptocurrency revenue was a key highlight that grew by 232% compared to the same quarter last year. As Robinhood continues to attract more users and offer innovative products, shares should continue to rally. They have almost doubled year-to-date.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Exterior view of Nvidia's global headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Since its founding in 1993, NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has led the AI charge. It’s also one of the main reasons the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 set several all-time highs in 2024. The company has numerous partnerships with tech giants that should help it maintain a big lead in the AI industry. Shares have more than doubled year-to-date while logging otherworldly gains over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe semiconductor giant continues to report exceptional earnings as its AI chips remain the preferred choice. Revenue reached a record $26 billion in Q1 FY25, representing 262% year-over-year growth. Net income sprang up by 629% year-over-year.\n\nAI chips for data centers are the key growth driver, but Nvidia is also generating revenue from other segments. Gaming revenue increased by 18% year-over-year while Professional Visualization revenue increased by 45% year-over-year. Even the Automotive and Robotics segment reported a solid 11% year-over-year growth rate in the quarter. Nvidia looks poised to generate long-term returns for investors as AI chip demand remains strong.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline platforms that grab people’s attention and keep them around for several hours each day can make a lot of money from advertisements. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is one of the leaders in the industry thanks to its social media platforms. The company has 3.24 billion daily active users across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and its other platforms. That figure represents a 7% year-over-year improvement compared to the same quarter last year.\n\nUser growth isn’t the only catalyst that’s excited Wall Street analysts. Meta Platforms reported 27% year-over-year revenue growth and 117% year-over-year net income growth in the first quarter. Profit margins soared to 33.9% as the company continues to cut costs and grow its top line.\n\nMeta Platforms is currently rated as a “Strong Buy” with a projected 13% upside. The highest price target of $630 per share suggests that the stock can gain an additional 34% from current levels.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "Better AI Stock: Meta Platforms or Palantir",
        "content": "If there is one major trend that's revolutionizing the world today, it's artificial intelligence (AI). With its ability to analyze vast amounts of data and help its users make intelligent decisions, AI is disrupting almost every industry, from finance to education, healthcare, energy, and more.\n\nThis revolution will lead to winners and losers as the former openly embrace these new technologies while the latter shun them. Palantir(NYSE: PLTR) and MetaPlatforms(NASDAQ: META). are both well-positioned to be among the winners, but which would be a better bet for your portfolio now? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPalantir\n\nFounded in 2003, Palantir's original core business was helping the U.S. government analyze mountains of complex and unstructured data it possessed across a host of databases. With the help of Palantir's early AI software, intelligence agencies gained insights that helped them make critical decisions in their counter-terrorism operations.\n\nThat initial success helped the company expand its clientele to other government agencies domestically and abroad. In recent years, the tech company has leveraged the experience it gained in the public sector to help private corporations with complex tasks like fraud detection, risk management, etc. All these problems require robust software platforms that can consume vast amounts of internal and external data, analyze it, and provide useful insights to clients.\n\nPalantir's software platforms -- Gotham for government agencies, Foundry for private-sector clients -- can handle vast amounts of data. For example, clients can leverage their existing data infrastructures when implementing Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) solutions such as machine learning, generative AI, etc.\n\nPotential clients can also leverage Palantir's AIP \"boot camps\" to experiment with its software. These events allow organizations to rapidly see how the company's services could be applied directly to addressing one of their specific needs. Giving potential clients the chance to experience how its AI can help them in their existing operations puts Palantir ahead of most of its competitors, especially those still in earlier stages of developing their software solutions.\n\nPalantir's early-mover advantage positions it well to capture a share of the vast and growing AI market. According to forecasts from Statista, the AI market is set to reach $184 billion in 2024 and could grow to $827 billion in 2030. Palantir's revenue was $2.2 billion in 2023, so its prospects for benefiting from that market growth look bright.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nLike Palantir, Meta Platforms has the potential to be a massive beneficiary of the AI boom, though its opportunities are vastly different. Meta is predominantly a social media networking and metaverse company, so it's employing AI technologies to improve its product offerings for both users and advertisers.\n\nFor example, Meta is integrating AI across its apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, to enhance its personalized content feeds and recommendation systems. Better content recommendation systems help increase user engagement and promote user loyalty. Another example is to use AI to automatically translate content languages, giving users easier access to foreign content.\n\nSimilarly, Meta employs AI to help advertisers get better returns on their marketing spending. For example, AI can help advertisers analyze massive amounts of data, gain insights on trends, and offer recommendations on strategy. While Meta doesn't charge its advertisers for the use of these AI tools, it benefits indirectly from advertisers' success -- since advertisers whose Meta campaigns are successful will be more likely to spend more on its platforms.\n\nThis is another significant difference from Palantir since Palantir generates revenue directly from clients using its AI platforms, while at Meta, AI's contributions are indirect. As such, it will be difficult for investors to ascertain how AI is impacting Meta's overall financial performance.\n\nOn the positive end, Meta is a well-established tech giant with solid earnings and a strong balance sheet, making it a potentially less risky investment than the smaller Palantir.\n\nA quick word on valuation\n\nNeither of these companies appears to be cheap, especially when measured using traditional metrics like the price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. Palantir has a P/S multiple of 29 and a P/E of 243, while Meta's P/S multiple is 9 and its P/E is 29.\n\nComparatively, Palantir's valuations are significantly higher than Meta's, indicating that investors have higher growth expectations for the former. This makes sense since Palantir has a market capitalization of $64 billion and revenue of $2.2 billion, while Meta is a $1.28 trillion giant with a top line of $134.9 billion. The smaller company would appear to have far more runway for long-term expansion.\n\nStill, it's worth reiterating that these companies have very different business models, so one can't make an apples-to-apples comparison.\n\nWhich is the better AI stock to buy now?\n\nThe quick answer is that there's no obvious winner. Meta Platforms is an established and wildly profitable tech giant that's actively embracing AI technologies to strengthen its business, but it does not directly make money from those AI tools. On the other hand, Palantir provides investors with direct exposure to AI since it makes money from its AI software and tools. Yet the stock is much more expensive.\n\nInvestors should, therefore, focus on the company they are more comfortable with -- and usually, that means the one whose business model is within their circle of competence.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Right Now",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market has grown rapidly over the past few years as companies developed new algorithms to analyze data more efficiently. The rise of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT has also been driving companies to explore new ways to create content, automate tasks, and replace human workers.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global AI market could still expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6% from 2024 to 2030. That's why many AI-driven stocks -- including Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) -- rallied over the past year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut in the first quarter of 2024, some closely followed billionaire hedge fund managers sold those three high-flying AI stocks. Let's see how many shares they sold -- and whether it makes sense for long-term investors to follow that lead.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia, the leading producer of high-end data center GPUs for processing complex AI tasks, is still one of the market's hottest tech stocks. However, several prominent billionaire investors -- including Philippe Laffont, Ken Griffin, and Israel Englander -- significantly reduced their positions in Nvidia in the first quarter of 2024. Laffont and Griffin both sold 68% of their shares, while Englander reduced his fund's stake by 35%.\n\nThose sales seem premature considering the market's demand for Nvidia's data center GPUs is still outstripping its available supply and giving it tremendous pricing power. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027), analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to rise at a CAGR of 46% as its earnings per share (EPS) increases at a CAGR of 53%. Those are impressive growth rates for a stock that still trades at less than 50 times forward earnings.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nBillionaires are also taking profits in Super Micro Computer, a leading maker of dedicated AI servers. Richard Driehaus, Ken Griffin, and Cliff Asness reduced their stakes in Supermicro by 41%, 8%, and 73%, respectively, in the first quarter.\n\nThat profit-taking is a bit surprising because Supermicro is still firing on all cylinders. It already generates over half of its revenue from dedicated AI servers, and analysts at Bank of America expect its share of that market to grow from 10% to 17% over the next three years. According to Research and Markets, the global AI server market could continue to expand at a CAGR of 26.5% from 2024 to 2029.\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026 (which ends in June 2026), analysts expect Supermicro's revenue and EPS to increase at CAGRs of 58% and 52%, respectively. At 27 times next year's earnings, it still looks like an undervalued growth stock.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, rallied over the past year as its core advertising business recovered. But in the first quarter, several big billionaire investors backed away. Lee Ainslie and Ken Griffin reduced their positions by 51% and 47%, respectively.\n\nBack in 2022, Meta's ad sales were throttled by Apple's privacy-oriented iOS changes, competition from ByteDance's TikTok, and other macro headwinds. But in 2023, its ad sales accelerated as it rolled out new AI algorithms to counter Apple's changes, expanded its Reels short video platform to widen its moat against TikTok, and attracted more spending from Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies that wanted to target overseas consumers.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Meta's revenue and EPS to increase at CAGRs of 14% and 21%, respectively. That outlook is bright and its stock seems reasonably valued at 24 times forward earnings, but its big investors might be worried about a slowdown in spending from its Chinese advertisers and tougher competitive headwinds in the advertising market.\n\nShould investors follow suit?\n\nHedge fund managers have different priorities than retail investors. Instead of focusing on long-term multibagger gains over the course of several decades, hedge fund managers tend to focus on generating stable annual returns to satisfy their wealthy clients. To do so, they'll likely trim their winning positions more prudently than growth-oriented retail investors.\n\nSince the end of the first calendar quarter of March 31, Nvidia's stock has rallied 40%. However, Meta's stock has risen less than 1% while Supermicro's stock has declined 13%. So for the short-term investors chasing billionaire trades, selling Nvidia seemed like a mistake but it was smart to follow their lead and take some profits in Meta and Supermicro.\n\nBut if you're a patient long-term investor who plans to hold these AI stocks for at least a few more years, I don't think there's any reason to follow those short-term trades. Nvidia will continue to sell the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, Supermicro's share of the AI server market will keep growing, and Meta will continue to use its AI algorithms to craft more effective targeted ads across its social media platforms. Therefore, all three stocks could still generate big multibagger gains for investors who don't get too distracted by the near-term noise and the periodic institutional selling.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By Katie Paul\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Some external vendors that police content on Facebook owner Meta's platforms were affected by the global tech outage that crippled airports, banks and hospitals on Friday, a Meta spokesperson said in response to a Reuters query.\n\nThe social media giant experienced a SEV1 as a result of the disruptions, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, using Meta's term for a \"code red\"-style alert involving high-stakes problems with its systems that require urgent attention.\n\nIn a statement, the Meta spokesperson acknowledged the issues and said they had been resolved earlier in the day.\n\n\"The global CrowdStrike outage earlier today temporarily impacted several of the tools used by some of our vendors. While this caused a small impact to some of our support operations, there was minimal to no impact on our content moderation efforts,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nLike most social media companies, Meta relies on a mix of artificial intelligence and human review to moderate the billions of posts made to its platforms, which also include Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.\n\nSome of that human review is performed by Meta staffers, but most is outsourced to business services vendors employing armies of low-paid workers who assess whether the posts contain hate speech, violence and other violations of the company's rules.\n\nFriday's alert involved vendor access to two of the systems Meta uses to route content flagged for review to moderators, called SRT and HumanOps, the source told Reuters.\n\nKey vendors affected were Teleperformance and Concentrix, the person said.\n\nTeleperformance did not respond to a request for comment and Concentrix said it had been monitoring and addressing impacts from the outage and that operations were continuing at expected levels.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Peter Henderson and Diane Craft)",

        "content": "ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigeria's government on Friday announced a fine of $220 million on Meta, saying its investigations found “multiple and repeated” violations of the country's data protection and consumer rights laws on Facebook and WhatsApp.\n\nA statement from Nigeria’s Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, or FCCPC, listed five ways that Meta violated data laws in the West African country, including by sharing the data of Nigerians without authorization, denying consumers the right to self-determine the use of their data, discriminatory practices as well as abuse of market dominance.\n\n“Being satisfied with the significant evidence on the record, and that Meta Parties have been provided every opportunity to articulate any position ... the Commission has now entered a Final Order, and issued a penalty against Meta Parties,” FCCPC chief executive Adamu Abdullahi said in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNigeria, which is Africa’s most populous country, also has one of the world's highest number of internet users with 154 million active subscribers in 2022, according to the country’s statistics agency.\n\nDespite the high number of internet users in the country, Meta has failed to comply with the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation, has failed to engage a Data Protection Compliance Organization and hasn't filed the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation audit report for two years, the consumer protection agency said.\n\nIn addition to the $220 million fine, the agency’s order mandated Meta to comply with local laws and cease the “exploitation” of Nigerian consumers.\n\nThe investigation into the reported abuses first commenced in May 2021 when the agency opened an inquiry into WhatsApp’s updated privacy policy. It later informed Meta of its findings, after which the company proposed a “remedy package” that failed to address initial concerns, the statement said.",

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon",
        "content": "As the second-quarter earnings season approaches, key companies worldwide will provide insights into sector performance. Investors will be particularly focused on updates from some of the 'Magnificent Seven', which will reveal whether the artificial intelligence (AI) trend continues.\n\nThe Mag 7 stocks have endured a challenging period, with the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) major players—Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and AmazonAJa (AMZN)—experiencing a dramatic decline in market capitalisation. Over recent sessions, these tech giants have collectively shed $1.128tn in market value, marking the largest such loss since May 2022.\n\nWill the upcoming earnings reports show strong performance or a lack of momentum? Here’s what to watch for:\n\nTesla (TSLA) — Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nTesla shares have experienced a dramatic surge this month, with the company's stock price surging by 33%. This increase has propelled Tesla's market valuation by $209bn in the first eight trading days of the month alone, surpassing the combined market value of European automotive giants Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Stellantis, which stands at $198bn.\n\nThis surge cannot be attributed to Tesla’s first-quarter financial results, which revealed the lowest quarterly profits since Q2 2021, diminishing cash flow, and rising inventory levels. The second-quarter production and delivery figures, released earlier this month, indicated a 14% year-on-year decline in vehicle production and a 5% drop in unit sales, although this may have contributed to reducing some of the inventory backlog.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“Quite what inspired this romp is hard to divine, barring ongoing investor enthusiasm for companies that are perceived as AI (and autonomous driving) plays, Elon Musk’s courtroom victories at Tesla and X and ongoing hopes surrounding the Cybertruck, the supercharger network and the ride-hailing app,” Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: How to invest in AI as the rally continues\n\nFor the third quarter, the current consensus is sales of $25.7bn and that would signify a return to growth in the top line of some 10% year-on-year.\n\nAnalysts and investors are also paying close attention to Tesla’s revenue composition. In the first quarter of 2024, energy storage, energy generation, and other business lines contributed 19% to total revenues, up from 10% in the same period in 2022.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) fell to $0.37 in Q1, but analysts expect a rebound to $0.62 in Q2, though this still marks a one-third decrease compared to the same period last year. The consensus EPS forecast for Q3 stands at $0.63.\n\nAJ Bell also highlighted Tesla's strong financial position, with a net cash reserve of $21.5bn. Although a few quarters of weak cash flow are not overly concerning, shareholders will be looking for improvements in this area as an indicator of higher profitability and a more streamlined balance sheet through inventory reduction.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) — Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July*\n\nMicrosoft Corp is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, July 30, with analysts from Bank of America (BofA) forecasting potential revenue upside for the period.\n\nWall Street's consensus projects Microsoft to announce revenue of $64.2bn and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.90 for Q4. However, BofA analysts anticipate a 1% increase from their estimate of $64bn, indicating a 14% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by the robust performance of Azure, a premium mix in Office E3/E5, Copilot’s initial success, and a stabilising PC/Windows market.\n\nAzure’s growth is expected to remain balanced across sustained AI and core workloads, translating into a projected growth rate of 31.5%, slightly above the base expectation of 30.5%. The early traction of Copilot is also anticipated to bolster Office growth, maintaining its current valuation multiple.\n\nIn the more personal computing (MPC) segment, analysts foresee a $50m increase over the $15.5bn estimate, attributed to stronger-than-expected PC shipments.\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, BofA analysts predict continued double-digit revenue growth fuelled by ongoing strength in Azure and Office. However, they anticipate a 100 basis point decrease in margins due to increased capital expenditures driving higher cost of sales.\n\n“In an upside scenario, we believe the Office business could achieve 20% growth by Q1 fiscal 2026,” the analysts noted.\n\nBofA has reiterated its ‘buy’ rating for Microsoft and raised the price target to $510 from $480, citing the potential for higher Office growth in fiscal 2025. They acknowledge that the current share price reflects a considerable amount of near-term upside.\n\n\"Microsoft is set to deliver fourth quarter results at some point next week. Investors will be hoping to see another strong showing from the cloud business, Azure. Analysts are looking for top line growth of 19.5% from Azure, which looks very achievable. Back in April, management said cloud-AI demand was outstripping supply. Despite a mammoth effort to build out compute, that supply/demand imbalance is likely to help underpin Azure growth for some time yet,\" Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\n*Date not confirmed\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) — Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nThe parent company of Google (GOOGL), is set to announce its second-quarter earnings, with analysts predicting robust performance driven by its Android platform and continued momentum in its search and cloud businesses. The company's expanding generative AI capabilities are also anticipated to have significantly contributed to its positive results.\n\nFor Q2, the Zacks Consensus Estimate places Alphabet's revenues at $70.55bn, reflecting a 13.7% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at $1.85 per share, marking a 28.5% rise from the previous year's reported figures. This estimate has seen a slight upward revision of 0.5% over the past week.\n\nHowever, rising litigation issues and associated expenses remain areas of concern for the tech giant.\n\nOne key risk is the US Department of Justice's so-called adtech trial, in which the government charges that Google monopolises key digital advertising technologies, collectively referred to as the adtech stack. Website publishers depend on that stack to sell ads and advertisers rely on it to buy ads.\n\n\"As Alphabet’s second quarter earnings approach, the M&A rumour mill is swirling. If reports are true and Alphabet is in talks to buy cybersecurity firm Wizz for $23bn, it would mark a major move to beef up its security offering. Wizz has successfully taken on the likes of Microsoft and Palo Alto in the cyber space, taking market share over the past couple of years. Perhaps the biggest hurdle could be a regulator that’s been a blocker for many large-scale deals – though a new team in the White House later this year could help things in that regard,\" Britzman said.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\nBank of America Securities analyst Justin Post remains bullish on the integration of Google’s AI chatbot.\n\n“We remain positive on growing Gemini integration across [the] Google ecosystem and think [the] broader rollout of AI overviews will likely help drive higher usage, while AI integration can increase monetisation across Google,” Post said. “Moreover, with a focus on expense management, we think year-over-year margin growth in 2024 will be a bright spot and potential EPS upside driver.”\n\nPost affirmed a buy rating and $200 price target for Alphabet.\n\nBMO Capital Markets raised its their price target from $215 to $222, driven by potential gains in YouTube revenue.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) — Reports second-quarter results on Thursday 25 July*\n\nAmazon is in the spotlight with a \"positive\" near-term view, as Morgan Stanley anticipates the e-commerce giant to significantly outperform in its Q2 earnings and provide optimistic guidance for Q3.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts project that Amazon will exceed consensus estimates for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by 17% for Q2 and 10% for Q3. This optimistic forecast is driven by enhanced profitability in North America tetail and accelerating growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"North America retail profitability and the accelerating growth of AWS are key factors behind our projections,\" the analysts noted.\n\nAs Amazon continues to leverage its robust retail operations and expand its cloud computing dominance, investors are looking forward to a strong financial performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIt is also a top pick for JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth both in the near and long term.\n\nHe anticipates a near-term acceleration in AWS, forecasting a 20% growth in Q4 2024. This growth is expected to be driven by easing optimisations, new workload migrations, and the ramping up of GenAI monetisation.\n\nRead more: UK to lose half a million millionaires by 2028\n\nAnmuth also projects a 190 basis point expansion in Amazon's North America operating income (OI) margin in 2024, supported by enhancements in shipping and inventory placement, increased automation, and stronger advertising revenue. Amazon's free cash flow is expected to reach $66bn in 2024 and $86bn in 2025.\n\nFor Q2, investors are looking for net sales to fall between $148bn and $150bn, with operating income ranging from $14bn to $15bn or more.\n\n\"There was also a strong showing from both the e-commerce and advertising segments over the first quarter, something investors will be keen to see continue. But markets were a little unhappy with the second quarter profit guidance of $10-14bn, anything toward the top end of that range will likely be met with a positive reaction,\" Britzman said.\n\n* Date not confirmed as the company might decide to announce results on 1 August.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 22 July\n\nMONY (MONY.L)\n\nAscential (ASCL.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nNXP Semiconductor (NXPI)\n\nTuesday 23 July\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nCompass (CPG.L)\n\nMitie (MTO.L)\n\nSK Hynix (HY9H.MU)\n\nLVMH (MC.PA)\n\nASM International (ASM.AS)\n\nThales (HO.PA)\n\nLindt (LISN.SW)\n\nAlfa Laval (ALFA.L)\n\nLogitech (LOGNE.SW)\n\nNorsk Hydro (NHY.OL)\n\nAkzo Nobel (AKZOY)\n\nRandstad (RSH.DU)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nCoca-Cola (KO)\n\nSpotify (SPOT)\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\n\nGE Aerospace (GE)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nMondelez (MDLZ)\n\n3M (MMM)\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\nMattel (MAT)\n\nWednesday 24 July\n\nReckitt Benckiser (RKT.L)\n\nUNITE (UTG.L)\n\nRHI Magnesita (RHIM.L)\n\nBreedon (BREE.L)\n\nAston Martin Lagonda (AML.L)\n\nPrimary Health Properties (PHP.L)\n\nFresnillo (FRES.L)\n\nEasyJet (EZJ.L)\n\nOxford Nanopore (ONT.L)\n\nIberdrola (IBE.MC)\n\nBNP Paribas (BNP.PA)\n\nEquinor (EQNR)\n\nBanco Santander (BNC.L)\n\nUniCredit (UCG.MI)\n\nKering (KER.PA)\n\nDeutsche Boerse (DB1.DE)\n\nOrange (ORA.PA)\n\nMichelin (ML.PA)\n\nRepsol (REP.MC)\n\nMoncler (MOV.F)\n\nJerónimo Martins (JMT.LS)\n\nCarrefour (CA.PA)\n\nSSAB (SSAB-A.ST)\n\nKindred (UNBA.MU)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nFord (F)\n\nNewmont (NEM)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nInternational Paper (IP)\n\nThursday 25 July\n\nRELX (REL.L)\n\nLloyds (LLOY.L)\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nRentokil Initial (RTO.L)\n\nInforma (INF.L)\n\nCentrica (CNA.L)\n\nCentamin (CEY.L)\n\nHowden Joinery (HWDN.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nITV (ITV.L)\n\nHammerson (HMSO.L)\n\nVodafone (VOD.L)\n\nBT (BT-A.L)\n\nBritvic (BVIC.L)\n\nWorkspace (WKP.L)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nNestlé (NESNE.SW)\n\nHermès (RMS.PA)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nChristian Dior (CDI.PA)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nEssilorLuxxotica (EL.PA)\n\nStellantis (STLA)\n\nENI (ENI.F)\n\nSt. Gobain (GOB.MU)\n\nRenault (RNO.PA)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nLinde (LIN)\n\nHoneywell (HON)\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC)\n\nKeurig-Dr Pepper (KDP)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV)\n\nBaxter (BAX)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nLiberty Global (LBTYK)\n\nHarley-Davidson (HOG)\n\nFriday 26 July\n\nSEGRO (SGRO.L)\n\nIMI (IMI.L)\n\nRightmove (RMV.L)\n\nDrax (DRX.L)\n\nNEC (6701.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nAir Liquide (AI.PA)\n\nMercedes Benz (MBG.HA)\n\nHolcim (HOLN.SW)\n\nBASF (BASA.BE)\n\nCapGemini (CGM.HM)\n\nAlstom (ALO.PA)\n\nVallourec (VK.PA)\n\nKone Cranes (KNCRY)\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nBristol Meyers Squibb (BMY)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "3 Future Dividend Aristocrats to Buy Now: July 2024",
        "content": "Dividend aristocrats attract many income investors who want to receive steady cash flow from their investments. High yields and consistent dividend hikes allow investors to cash in on their investments without selling shares. Some people build up large enough dividend portfolios to the point where dividends cover their living expenses.\n\nWhile it’s possible to generate high yields with current dividend aristocrats, investors may realize higher long-term returns by prioritizing future dividend aristocrats. Before we identify future dividend aristocrats, it’s important to determine what qualifies as a dividend aristocrat. These aristocrats are publicly traded corporations that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.\n\nIf a company halts or reduces its quarterly dividend payouts, it’s no longer a dividend aristocrat. Furthermore, a company that doesn’t raise its dividend over the past year loses its status. These three corporations look likely to becoming future dividend aristocrats and can reward long-term investors with capital gains and cash flow.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a newcomer in the dividend space. The company issued its first dividend in Q4 2023, so it’s going to take multiple decades for the company to become a dividend aristocrat. The advertising giant has what it takes to raise its dividend each year for the next 25 years and beyond.\n\nMore than 3.24 billion people use Meta Platforms. That type of attention will give the company a massive head start with any new product launches and offerings. The company’s also doing fine with profitability, as net income surged by 117% year-over-year in the first quarter to reach $12.4 billion. While cost-cutting measures helped, the company’s 27% YOY revenue growth also contributed to excellent net income growth.\n\nMeta Platforms is in the early innings of its dividend payouts. The company is likely to maintain a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years. Revenue and net income continue to rise as the social media giant continues to establish itself as one of the top choices for online advertising.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is another stock that’s poised to become a dividend aristocrat. The company has a solid business model that revolves around credit and debit card transactions. These plastic cards are more convenient than cash. They are also more secure and allow you to receive cash, points, miles, and other rewards for every purchase.\n\nStory continues\n\nVisa has raised its dividend for 16 consecutive years. It’s less than a decade removed from officially become a dividend aristocrat. While some companies have decelerating dividend growth rates as they reach aristocrat status, Visa continues to maintain a double-digit growth rate. The fintech firm raised its dividend by 16% last year amid strong financial results.\n\nStrong financial results carried over into fiscal 2024. The firm reported 10% YOY revenue and net income growth in Q2 FY24. Cross-border transactions were a key driver that exhibited 16% YOY growth. Visa regularly reports net profit margins above 50% which will help it reach dividend aristocrat status.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) is a steakhouse chain that has outperformed the stock market for several years. Shares are up by 40% year-to-date and have more than tripled over the past five years. The company operates 753 restaurants. Most of Texas Roadhouse’s restaurants are company-owned while some of them are franchises.\n\nTexas Roadhouse has raised its dividend for 12 consecutive years, so it’s almost halfway toward dividend aristocrat status. The steakhouse chain has also maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate during that span. The high growth rate has helped Texas Roadhouse maintain a respectable 1.46% yield despite impressive long-term returns.\n\nDividend hikes should continue for the company. Revenue increased by 12.5% YOY in the first quarter while net income jumped by 31.9% YOY. Texas Roadhouse closed out the quarter with an 8.6% net profit margin. More restaurant openings should give both of those numbers a boost, but 8.4% YOY comparable sales growth suggests the restaurant is winning over local communities.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in TXRH.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Mark Zuckerberg said that former President Donald Trump’s immediate reaction after being shot was “badass” and inspiring, and helps explain his appeal to voters.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUnprecedented IT Outage Cripples Businesses Around the Globe Airlines Start Digging Themselves Out of Epic Flight Disruptions Zuckerberg Calls Trump’s Response to Shooting ‘Badass’ Canada’s Immigration Minister Has a Message for Foreign Students: You Can’t All Stay Brookfield Lines Up a 36-Year-Old Rising Star as Next Billionaire CEO\n\n“Seeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life,” the Meta Platforms Inc. chief executive officer said Thursday during an interview at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California. “On some level as an American, it’s like hard to not get kind of emotional about that spirit and that fight, and I think that that’s why a lot of people like the guy.”\n\nZuckerberg, 40, declined to endorse Trump or his presumed opponent, President Joe Biden, adding that he’s “not planning” to be involved in the election in any way. Still, his comments add to a growing chorus of Silicon Valley leaders, including Tesla Inc. billionaire Elon Musk and venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who are warming to the former president, some pledging donations to his campaign. Zuckerberg made the comments during a wide-ranging discussion about the future of AI, social media and more for The Circuit with Emily Chang. The full episode is set to air on Tuesday.\n\nZuckerberg said Meta is making changes that he hopes will mean Facebook is not as much of a flashpoint in elections going forward. “The main thing that I hear from people is that they actually want to see less political content on our services because they come to our services to connect with people.” Meta is already recommending less political content to its users, he added. “I think you’re going to see our services play less of a role in this election than they have in the past.”\n\nZuckerberg’s relationship with Trump has been complicated by Trump’s use of Meta’s products to reach his followers. The former president’s posts have routinely contained misinformation or challenged Meta’s rules. The company suspended Trump from both Facebook and Instagram for two years in the wake of the January 6, 2021, Capitol riots. At the time, Zuckerberg posted that Trump was using his account to “undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor.”\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the accounts have since been reinstated, Trump indicated he hasn’t forgiven Meta or Zuckerberg, and recently suggested that he plans to retaliate. He called Facebook the “enemy of the people” in March. Earlier this month, Trump also appeared to warn Zuckerberg. “All I can say is that if I’m elected President, we will pursue Election Fraudsters at levels never seen before, and they will be sent to prison for long periods of time,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “We already know who you are. DON’T DO IT! ZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!”\n\nTrump has reversed policy positions in the name of punishing Meta. While he was president, Trump pushed for a ban of the Chinese-owned video app, TikTok. Trump has since changed his stance, arguing in Businessweek that a ban would be too beneficial to Meta’s business.\n\nZuckerberg said he welcomes competition. “It’s good,” he said on The Circuit. “I think we’re doing pretty well here. We’re gaining market share. So I don’t know. They’ll go do what they need to do but I think we’re gonna be fine and we’re gonna continue doing well in this space either way.”\n\nWhen asked if he thought TikTok should be banned, Zuckerberg demurred. “That’s above my pay grade,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Zombie Mall King Doesn’t Want to Be a Bottom-Feeder Forever Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail Five Questions With Apollo Global Co-Founder Josh Harris Top Takeaways From Businessweek’s Donald Trump Interview How Trader Joe’s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Looking for Dividends and Growth? You Won't Regret Buying These 2 Top Stocks",
        "content": "A one-size-fits-all investment strategy doesn't exist, and this is wonderful because it means investing allows for plenty of flexibility. Some investors will win with an aggressive growth portfolio, while others may reach success with a focus on safe stocks that generate passive income. But there is one investment that could find its spot in any portfolio -- and during any market environment.\n\nI'm talking about stocks that bring you both dividends and growth. In a bull market, they may excel and offer your portfolio a boost, and investors appreciate their dividend payments any time. This passive income adds to gains during good times and limits losses during tough markets.\n\nWhere do you find these players? Though the technology industry generally isn't known for its dividends, you actually should look here for the valuable combination of passive income and growth. Many growth companies that have developed into market giants today have the financial strength to continue funding their growth -- and reward shareholders through dividend payments. Let's check out two of these top stocks that you won't regret buying. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) earnings have climbed over time thanks to its hardware, a selection of popular products -- from the iPhone to the Mac -- that have kept customers coming back for the latest versions year after year. This brand strength offers Apple a solid moat that's proven itself over time. Last year, Apple garnered the top-7 positions in Counterpoint Research's list of the 10 best-selling smartphones. This was a first for Apple, showing this well-established company still is generating growth.\n\nOn top of this, two other elements should add to Apple's growth in the coming months and years. The company's services businesses -- including subscriptions such as cloud storage or digital content -- have been generating record revenue levels. And, even better, services are higher margin than hardware, so they can be highly profitable for Apple. The second growth driver ahead should be Apple's new focus on artificial intelligence (AI). The company is set to release a suite of AI tools, known as Apple Intelligence, later this year throughout its devices.\n\nAll of this confirms Apple's reputation as a growth company. But what about dividends? Apple pays an annual dividend of $1 per share, which using the July 16 closing price of about $234, results in a dividend yield of 0.4%. Though this is lower than the S&P 500 dividend yield of 1.3%, that's OK. Many higher-yield stocks aren't delivering the growth you'll get with Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, you'll pay 35 times forward-earnings estimates for Apple, a reasonable price for this solid, long-term player.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is new to the world of dividends. The social media powerhouse announced its first-ever payment earlier this year, making now a great time to get in on the action.\n\nOf course, like with Apple, you won't be getting a high-yield investment with Meta. The company pays an annual dividend of $2 per share, and using the July 16 closing price of about $489, this gives a dividend yield of 0.4%. But this passive income, along with Meta's growth prospects, makes it an investment that could significantly boost your portfolio over time.\n\nSpeaking of growth, Meta is a company that's demonstrated its earnings capabilities year after year. The company generates most of its revenue through advertisers across its range of social media apps -- from Facebook and Messenger to Instagram and WhatsApp. This has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue and net income in recent years.\n\nAlso like Apple, Meta has built a solid moat. Users won't easily switch to other social media platforms because they know it will be difficult to maintain all of their contacts if they do so. After all, more than 3.2 billion people worldwide use at least one of Meta's social media apps every day.\n\nMeta isn't standing still and admiring its leadership though. Instead, this company is investing in AI to make its social media platforms even better. If Meta wins this bet, users may spend even more time on its apps -- and that could prompt advertisers to spend even more on Meta to reach their target audiences.\n\nRight now, you can pick up shares of Meta for only 24 times forward-earnings estimates -- a steal considering the company's growth prospects and the passive income you can pick up along the way.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the Q2 earnings season, the July Economic Outlook monthly and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp., Meta Platforms, Inc. and Amgen Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock Galaxy Gaming, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\n\nThe July Economic Outlook\n\nJohn Blank, our Chief Economist, discusses the evolving economic landscape and what that means for Fed policy in the July Economic Outlook report. You can see John's report here >>>To Cut, or Not to Cut - That is the Question\n\nQ2 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding this morning's releases from the likes of D.R. Horton, Abott, Keycorp and others, we now have Q2 results from 61 S&P 500 members or 12.2% of the index's total membership.\n\nTotal earnings for these 61 index members are up +7.5% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues, with 82% beating EPS estimates and 55.7% beating revenue estimates. The 82% EPS beats percentage for this group of 61 index members compared to 77% in 2024 Q1, 80.3% in 2023 Q4 and the average for the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) of 79.6%.\n\nThe 55.7% revenue beats percentage for this group of companies compares to 63.9% in the preceding period and 20-quarter low of 60.7%.\n\nIn other words, companies appear to be struggling to beat consensus revenue estimates at this stage in the Q2 reporting cycle.\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 61 companies with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are on track to be up +8.8% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues.\n\nFor a more detailed look at the Q2 earnings season and evolving expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>Q2 Earnings Season Starts Positively\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+157.4% vs. +115.3%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+48.5% vs. +14.0%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nIt is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram.\r\n\r\nThreads have more than 175 million monthly actives. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nAmgen shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+45.4% vs. -4.4%). The company expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to offset declining revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in 2024.\r\n\r\nThe addition of Horizon’s rare disease drugs should further boost revenue growth. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity. Several key pipeline data readouts are expected in 2024, including from the obesity program, MariTide.\r\n\r\nHowever, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds. Estimates have gone down ahead of Q2 earnings releases.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amgen here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Galaxy Gaming have underperformed the Zacks Gaming industry over the past year (-46.1% vs. +5.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $35.69 million is witnessing high debt levels, reliance on key customers, regulatory risks, intense competition, economic cycle vulnerability and integration risks as well as challenges posing from new acquisitions.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Galaxy Gaming's revenues for first-quarter 2024 grew 7.8% year over year to $8 million, driven by the success of EZ Baccarat and GOS product installations. EBITDA of $3 million, with a margin of 37.5%, highlights strong operational efficiency. The 10-year extension with Evolution Gaming and EZ Baccarat expansion solidifies the market position.\r\n\r\nInnovations like GOS 2.0 and global expansion, with operations in 30 countries and 5,146 table installations, enhance growth prospects. Financial stability is demonstrated with a 4.8% cash increase to $17.5 million and a net leverage ratio of 3.8x. High customer satisfaction and a 91.7% recurring revenue model reduce financial risk.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Galaxy Gaming here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Oppenheimer raised its price target for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares to $525 from $500 in a note Friday, citing robust digital ad market conditions and sustained demand from Chinese advertisers.\n\nDespite recent underperformance, the stock is now considered \"derisked for print,\" with high investor expectations balanced by potential risks related to Trump and Vance.\n\nSince the presidential debate, the firm notes that Meta's stock has lagged behind NASDAQ by 850 basis points.\n\nThis underperformance is attributed to \"possible repeal of TikTok ban, tariff risk for China advertisers, and long-running feud with Trump&Vance views on regulating Big Tech,\" according to Oppenheimer.\n\nHowever, the analysts remain optimistic about Meta's second-half prospects, bolstered by a strong digital ad market and continued demand from China.\n\nOppenheimer's revised 3Q estimates reflect ongoing demand from Chinese advertisers, with \"US import volumes and shipping prices from East Asia to the US showing strong demand for China products,\" suggesting a favorable ad demand environment.\n\nThe firm also highlights the need for significant revenue acceleration in EMEA and China to meet Street expectations of +13% revenue growth for the second half.\n\nThe note points out that Meta's stock price underperformance is likely due to concerns about a Trump/Vance victory, which could negatively impact Meta by \"allowing TikTok to continue operating in the US, tariff impact on China advertisers, and long-running feud between Trump/META and Vance views on regulating Big Tech/Section 230.\"\n\nDespite these risks, Oppenheimer sees AI and ML improvements sustaining advertiser demand, leading to an increase in 2H revenue growth estimates to +11%.\n\nValuation adjustments are based on \"23x 2025E GAAP EPS.\"\n\nOppenheimer concludes by increasing its revenue and GAAP EPS estimates for 2024 and 2025 by 1% and 2%, respectively, reflecting confidence in Meta's ability to navigate the current political and economic landscape.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMeta stock: Oppenheimer discusses Trump/Vance risk, earnings, high expectations\n\nMicrosoft says cause of outage fixed\n\nUbisoft tumbles despite positive net bookings as company pushes back two key titles",

        "content": "Tursday, July 18, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the Q2 earnings season, the July Economic Outlook monthly and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Amgen Inc. (AMGN), as well as a micro-cap stock Galaxy Gaming, Inc. (GLXZ). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\n\nThe July Economic Outlook\n\nJohn Blank, our Chief Economist, discusses the evolving economic landscape and what that means for Fed policy in the July Economic Outlook report. You can see John's report here >>>To Cut, or Not to Cut - That is the Question\n\nQ2 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding this morning's releases from the likes of D.R. Horton, Abott, Keycorp and others, we now have Q2 results from 61 S&P 500 members or 12.2% of the index's total membership.\n\nTotal earnings for these 61 index members are up +7.5% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues, with 82% beating EPS estimates and 55.7% beating revenue estimates. The 82% EPS beats percentage for this group of 61 index members compares to 77% in 2024 Q1, 80.3% in 2023 Q4 and the average for the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) of 79.6%.\n\nThe 55.7% revenue beats percentage for this group of companies compares to 63.9% in the preceding period and 20-quarter low of 60.7%.\n\nIn other words, companies appear to be struggling to beat consensus revenue estimates at this stage in the Q2 reporting cycle.\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 61 companies with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are on track to be up +8.8% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues.\n\nFor a more detailed look at the Q2 earnings season and evolving expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>Q2 Earnings Season Starts Positively\n\nNVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+157.4% vs. +115.3%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. \r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. \r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+48.5% vs. +14.0%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. \r\n\r\nIt is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. \r\n\r\nThreads have more than 175 million monthly actives. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nAmgen shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+45.4% vs. -4.4%). The company expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to offset declining revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in 2024. \r\n\r\nThe addition of Horizon’s rare disease drugs should further boost revenue growth. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity. Several key pipeline data readouts are expected in 2024, including from the obesity program, MariTide. \r\n\r\nHowever, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds. Estimates have gone down ahead of Q2 earnings releases.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amgen here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Galaxy Gaming have underperformed the Zacks Gaming industry over the past year (-46.1% vs. +5.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $35.69 million is witnessing high debt levels, reliance on key customers, regulatory risks, intense competition, economic cycle vulnerability and integration risks as well as challenges posing from new acquisitions.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Galaxy Gaming's revenues for first-quarter 2024 grew 7.8% year over year to $8 million, driven by the success of EZ Baccarat and GOS product installations. EBITDA of $3 million, with a margin of 37.5%, highlights strong operational efficiency. The 10-year extension with Evolution Gaming and EZ Baccarat expansion solidifies the market position. \r\n\r\nInnovations like GOS 2.0 and global expansion, with operations in 30 countries and 5,146 table installations, enhance growth prospects. Financial stability is demonstrated with a 4.8% cash increase to $17.5 million and a net leverage ratio of 3.8x. High customer satisfaction and a 91.7% recurring revenue model reduce financial risk. \r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Galaxy Gaming here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH), GE Aerospace (GE) and BHP Group Limited (BHP).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

However, high debt does not bode well for its bottom line.\n\nProgressive's (PGR) Solid Policies in Force Aid, Cat Loss Ail\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Progressive is set to grow on, solid policies in force, competitive rates and leadership position.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is in talks to take a minority stake in the maker of Ray-Ban sunglasses, as the Facebook owner intensifies its push to develop smart glasses.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCanada’s Immigration Minister Has a Message for Foreign Students: You Can’t All Stay Brookfield Lines Up a 36-Year-Old Rising Star as Next Billionaire CEO Biden Faces Intensified Calls to Step Aside While Ill With Covid US Floats Tougher Trade Rules to Rein In China Chip Industry High-Flying Chipmakers See Worst Plunge Since 2020: Markets Wrap\n\nMeta, which has collaborated with EssilorLuxottica SA on Ray Ban-Meta smart eyewear, is considering a stake of as much as 5% of the luxury eyewear group, which would be valued at about €4.5 billion ($4.9 billion) at current prices, according to people familiar with the discussions, who asked not to be identified because the information is not public. There is no guarantee that any investment will take place, they said.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for EssilorLuxottica declined to comment. The Financial Times reported the talks earlier.\n\nBy taking a stake in EssilorLuxottica, the social media giant would seek to strengthen its partnership with the world’s biggest eyewear company. Meta, along with other major technology companies, is exploring using virtual and augmented reality to keep users loyal and engaged. Snap Inc. has been experimenting with mixed-reality spectacles for years, while Apple Inc. released the Vision Pro headset earlier this year. As yet, users have not adopted these technologies en masse.\n\nEssilorLuxottica shares rose 4.6% to €198.65 at 3:15 p.m. in Paris.\n\nMeta has invested heavily into the metaverse — a future version of the internet made up of immersive worlds accessible via headsets — which Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has hailed as the next major computing revolution after mobile phones. The company changed its name from Facebook to Meta years ago to underscore the dedication to the concept.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n\nMeta is likely doubling down on its AR and smart-glasses bet with its new new stake in EssilorLuxottica, given it doesn’t own the hardware platform as is the case with Oculus VR. We believe AR units, about 10-15x smaller than VR in terms of units shipped, could grow at a much faster rate than VR given the potential to have smart glasses as an inference device for gen-AI and virtual-assistant functionality.\n\n— Mandeep Singh and Nishant Chintala, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Tech Analysts\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta unveiled its first Ray-Ban smart glasses in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, in 2021. Those glasses were set on the Wayfarer frame to let users take photos and videos, listen to music and answer calls. Newer glasses incorporate MetaAI, an AI assistant based on its Llama artificial intelligence model.\n\nEssilorLuxottica on Wednesday announced an agreement to buy streetwear label Supreme from VF Corp. for $1.5 billion in cash, adding another lifestyle brand to a stable that also includes Oakley sunglasses.\n\n--With assistance from Shona Ghosh, Daniel Zuidijk and Antonio Vanuzzo.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek’s Donald Trump Interview Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail How Trader Joe’s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit Interviewing Trump on His Plans for the US Economy What Americans Invest In Now\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "MSCI Scheduled to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?",
        "content": "MSCI MSCI is set to report its second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 23.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $3.56 per share, up by a penny in the past 30 days and suggesting 9.2% year-over-year growth.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $697.24 million, indicating an increase of 12.25% year over year.\r\n\r\nMSCI’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 5.57%.\n\nMSCI Inc Price and EPS Surprise MSCI Inc Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMSCI Inc price-eps-surprise | MSCI Inc Quote\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\n\nFactors Likely to Have Influenced Q2 Performance\n\nMSCI’s second-quarter 2024 performance is expected to have benefited from its growing recurring revenues and global client base. Increasing integration of Climate and ESG solutions in the investment process is expected to have expanded clientele in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nExpanding custom index capabilities bode well for MSCI’s prospects. Top-line growth in the quarter to be reported is expected to have benefited from strong demand for client-designed indexing tools on MSCI ONE.\r\n\r\nRecent acquisitions like Foxberry are expected to have enhanced MSCI’s ability to offer customized index solutions and expand its client-centric interactive capabilities. This acquisition is aimed at accelerating custom index production and providing simulation and back-testing capabilities, which are crucial for institutional investors.\r\n\r\nMSCI has been expanding its footprint among wealth managers thanks to its specialized analytics tool designed to address the needs of portfolio customization. This is likely to have acted as a tailwind for the company.\r\n\r\nMSCI’s acquisition of Burgiss and Trove Research are expected to have enhanced its investment solutions to cater to diverse asset classes and align with market demands. Fabric acquisition is likely to have expanded its footprint in the wealth management industry.\r\n\r\nThe Burgiss acquisition enhanced MSCI’s private asset capabilities, while Trove’s integration made it a leading provider of global intelligence on carbon credit.\r\n\r\nHowever, ongoing market volatility, lower spending by clients, persistent inflation and challenging global macroeconomic conditions are expected to have hurt top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the exact case here.\r\n\r\nMSCI has an Earnings ESP of -0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "The term metaverse, once mentioned in a science fiction novel, has undoubtedly become one of the most talked about concepts in recent years. The metaverse, often likened to a virtual world, is an umbrella term for a range of technological innovations. These include immersive 3D worlds, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) technology and NFTs.\n\nThe rise in popularity of the metaverse has led several companies to invest in this futuristic concept. For businesses, a 3D world provides access to new audiences and markets, resulting in new digital revenue streams. And while the technology is still very much in its early days, the metaverse shows promise of significant long-term returns.\n\nAs more companies join the metaverse, investing in the digital realm has become a whole lot more accessible. But given its novelty, it could be years before the metaverse becomes a mainstream concept. Hence, investors willing to bet on its long-term potential are likely to get rewarded in the long run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst up on the list is Roblox (NYSE:RBLX), a gaming platform that enables users to play user-generated games or create their own games. The company’s unique offering has propelled it to the forefront of the gaming space. And with the gaming industry expected to grow to $312 billion by 2027, Roblox’s strong market position makes it a compelling investment opportunity.\n\nLooking at the financials, Roblox reported revenue at $801 million, up 22 % from the prior year. This was fueled by bookings that rose 19% year-over-year (YoY). However, significant investments in its technological advancements resulted in a net loss of $271.9 million. Nevertheless, the company’s guidance for Q2 remains strong. Roblox anticipates revenue between $855 million to $880 million and bookings between $870 million and $900 million. This suggests the company will sustain its strong momentum well into Q2.\n\nWhile its fundamentals remain strong, the company continues to battle short-term headwinds. Rising investment and infrastructure costs coupled with heated competition in the space have prevented the company from achieving profitability. However, investments in its future growth through technology innovations and expansions across markets could lead the stock higher. Investors willing to invest in its long-term potential will find RBLX one of the best metaverse stocks to buy now.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf its new name is any indication, Meta (NASDAQ:META) has not shied away from its bullish sentiments towards the metaverse. In the last few years, the company has made significant investments in its virtual technology including VR headsets and smart glasses. However, with its metaverse goals still in R&D mode, the company Reality Labs business that houses its 3D technology continues to lose money. The business segment posted a $3.85 billion loss in the first quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut looking at the broader picture, the metaverse business remains a small piece of the Meta pie. As the company continues to invest in the technology, it could generate billions in the future and become a major revenue generator. However, execs at the company believe it will take a decade for its metaverse investment to be fully realized. Until then, Meta’s advertising segment will serve as its major source of revenue.\n\nWhile the returns of the metaverse may not come to fruition in the near term, META remains one of the top metaverse stocks to buy now for its long-term potential. As the metaverse gains mainstream traction, Meta’s technology is likely to play an important role in its adoption.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt its core, the metaverse involves creating digital 3-D worlds and this is where Autodesk’s (NASDAQ: ADSK) offering plays a role. The company’s Revit tool allows engineers to visualize buildings and structures in a 3-dimensional world. Much like those we would see in a virtual ecosystem. This offering has propelled Autodesk to the forefront of the metaverse, making ADSK a compelling play for those looking to invest in the space.\n\nComing to the financials, Autodesk reported impressive numbers in its first quarter. Revenue was up 12% at $1.42 billion with revenue increments across all business segments. Operating margins also grew by 21%, signaling solid business performance. Looking ahead, the company expects full-year revenue to rise by 12% to 15%.\n\nWith a strong core business, Autodesk is focused on expanding its offering to create more value for its customers. In May 2024, the company acquired Wonder Dynamics — a 3D cloud animation tool. The partnership will help Autodesk users create AI-powered live-action and 3-D graphics.\n\nAutodesk’s strong financials and growing product offerings make it one of the best metaverse stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDivya has a background in finance and accounting and has worked in FP&A roles at Fortune 500 companies.

        "title": "7 Top-Rated Blue-Chip Stocks to Green Up Your Portfolio",
        "content": "I’ll always advocate for blue-chip stocks as an ideal holding to anchor an investment portfolio. Blue chips provide many benefits that you won’t find elsewhere in the market. But when you’re looking for some names to fit the bill, it’s important to focus on top-rated blue-chip stocks that will give you a better chance for success.\n\nBlue-chip stocks represent companies that are well-established, financially sound, and at the top of their respective industries. When you’re investing in blue-chip stocks, you can usually rely on the companies to provide consistent earnings and a solid financial base. Many blue-chip stocks also pay a reliable dividend as well.\n\nI also like the growth potential offered by top-rated blue-chip stocks. While it’s more difficult to substantially grow a business that’s already sporting a large market cap and is at the top of the field, it’s certainly possible.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTop-rated blue-chip stocks can sometimes offer the same dynamic growth that you can find in smaller companies that are favored by investors seeking growth.\n\nWe’re using the Portfolio Grader to screen for and identify the best top-rated blue-chip stocks in the market.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader evaluates stocks based on a variety of factors such as earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment and momentum to calculate an “A” through “F” grade. All the names on this list score a coveted “A” rating, meaning that they are the best of the best when it comes to blue-chip names.\n\nAdding one or more of these top-rated blue-chip stocks will give you a solid foundation for your portfolio that balances risk and reward to help you achieve your financial goals.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Exterior view of Nvidia's global headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Since its founding in 1993, NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) breaks all the rules – despite a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, Nvidia still shows all the characteristics of a dynamic growth stock, thanks to its industry-leading position with generative artificial intelligence.\n\nEstimates are that Nvidia provides anywhere from 80% to 90% of the high-powered graphics processing units needed to run the most advanced generative AI programs.\n\nAs these GPUs cost tens of thousands of dollars apiece, Nvidia’s profits have been soaring ever since companies realized that AI offerings are a must-have for any tech company.\n\nThat’s how the company was able to show year-over-year revenue growth of 262% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, coming in at $26.04 billion. Operating income was $16.9 billion, up 690% from a year ago, and earnings per share of $5.98 was up 629% from the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock Investment Institute strategist Wei Li believes that investments in AI data centers to increase 60% to 100% in the coming years, giving Nvidia plenty of room for continued growth. While there may be some short-sellers who believe Nvidia’s runway is short, I’m betting on NVDA to continue to expand.\n\nNVDA stock is up 155% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has a dynamic growth story of its own. The company’s Google search engine has a near monopoly on global search traffic with an estimated 91%, giving it unmatched potential to capture the lucrative online advertising market.\n\nGoogle search brought in $46.1 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up from $40.3 billion a year ago. Alphabet also saw strong growth in YouTube advertising ($8.09 billion, up from $6.63 billion a year ago). For the quarter, Google advertising accounted for $61.6 billion of the company’s $80.5 billion in revenue.\n\nTake note, however, that Alphabet has pulled out of its discussed acquisition of HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) – a deal that, had it been complete, would have helped Alphabet increase its business software revenue and cloud revenue. But notably investors haven’t punished GOOG stock for the failure of that venture.\n\nConsidering that Alphabet has more than $108 billion in cash on hand, it shouldn’t have any trouble finding another partner should it want to grow the business through an acquisition. It just needs to find the right deal that makes sense for shareholders – obviously, the HubSpot deal wasn’t it.\n\nGOOG stock is up 31% this year. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another Big Tech company that is using its advertising power to bring in billions in revenue each quarter. While Alphabet has a near-monopoly with internet search, Meta Platforms has a dominant social media presence and reams of information about its users that lets advertisers target messages to specific audiences.\n\nMeta reported that 3.24 billion people on average used its products in the first quarter, up 7% from a year ago. As advertising impressions increased by 20% from a year ago and the average price per ad was up 6%, Meta Platforms saw a huge 27% increase in revenue, bringing in $36.4 billion versus $28.6 billion a year ago.\n\nMeta also offers Meta AI, its generative AI-powered assistant, which can help people create and modify projects and images on the company’s Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger platforms.\n\nMETA stock is up 39% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been called Big Blue since the 1980s, a tribute to its blue color scheme on signs and on the company’s displays and cases in the 20th century. But I think it could better be called “Big Blue Chip” based on its track record of being one of the best blue-chip stocks you can buy for generations.\n\nIBM traces its history back for generations, all the way to punch-card based data processing machines in the 1880s. It was responsible for the first electronic computer, launched in 1943, and the first personal computer in 1981.\n\nToday, Big Blue offers the Watson AI engine and the Watsonx generative AI platform to its enterprise customers. It’s one of the top cloud infrastructure providers in the world.\n\nEarnings in the first quarter earnings included revenue of $14.5 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Net income was $1.6 billion, up 69%. And earnings per share of $1.69 was up 66% from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIBM stock is up 13% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is another legacy tech company that is finding new ways to compete in the 21st century. Dell is best known as a manufacturer of computers, laptops and mobile devices, but the company is also working in AI by operating a large server business that allows companies to upgrade their hardware to run AI applications.\n\nDell is expected to be a major player in the AI space for years to come. It’s building and selling servers that include Nvidia’s highly prized H100 GPU and Blackwell-generation chips. Dell’s backlog of orders for its AI servers increased 30% during the first quarter to $3.8 billion. AI server sales rose 42% to $5.5 billion.\n\nDell is also working with Nvidia and Elon Musk’s xAI artificial intelligence company to build xAI’s supercomputer and power the Grok chatbot.\n\nDell’s AI offerings will be a catalyst for many quarters to come. The stock is up 75% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is perhaps the best streaming service on the planet. Only Alphabet’s YouTube, which offers free streaming, has a greater reach than Netflix.\n\n“We have built a hard to replicate combination of a strong slate, superior recommendations, broad reach and intense fandom, which drives healthy engagement on Netflix,” the company said in its first-quarter earnings report. “Improvement in these key areas is the best way to delight our members and continue to grow our business.”\n\nNetflix is reporting Q2 earnings after the closing bell on July 18. Investors should be looking for revenue growth (up 15.9% in the first quarter from a year ago), global streaming paid memberships (up 16% in Q1) and global streaming paid net additions (up 9.3%).\n\nIf Netflix can continue to show improvement on those numbers, thanks to its relatively new strategy to end password sharing, then Netflix stock will continue its ascent.\n\nNFLX stock is up 34% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Harun Ozmen / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is the biggest retailer on the planet, boasting more than 10,800 locations that includes every U.S. state and two dozen countries.\n\nI also appreciate that Walmart is aggressively growing its e-commerce business. Considering its footprint, why pay another company to ship and deliver its goods to customers who want to order online when there’s business there ripe for the taking? It’s better for Walmart to do it itself.\n\nWalmart also is investing heavily in drone delivery. Since launching drone delivery in 2021, the company has completed more than 30,000 unmanned deliveries.\n\nWalmart is also working on bridging the drone service, where available, with the Walmart app – customers who order online will be notified if they are eligible for drone delivery. While there are still regulatory hurdles to clear, I appreciate that Walmart is looking for avenues forward to make the company more profitable.\n\nWMT stock is up 33% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a LONG position in NVDA. Louis Navellier did not have (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had a LONG position in NVDA.

        "content": "The metaverse market is one that’s hard to digest.\n\nOn the one hand, this space was supposed to be a fast-growing market with diverse platforms providing varying new innovative capabilities. Major metaverse platforms have attracted vast consumer bases and cater to industrial-specific needs. Gaming benefits from virtual worlds and immersive experiences. And even media and marketing utilize the metaverse for personalized advertising and content creation.\n\nHowever, the metaverse sector is one that’s really fallen off since its post-pandemic boom. Companies looking to engage in this space remain bullish on the long-term prospects the metaverse provides. Yet the term “metaverse” is such a nebulous word, it’s really hard to define.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut for companies clearly making waves in this space, three top picks stand out. These are for long-term investors bullish on the growth prospects of the metaverse.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been among the biggest beneficiaries of a tech-led market rally last year and throughout 2024.\n\nThe stock is now up more than 55% this year alone, suggesting investors remain bullish on the company’s long-term prospects. This move isn’t surprising when one looks at the company’s fundamentals. Profitability is surging 27% as the company dials in spending and focuses on efficiency.\n\nHowever, not all metaverse spending is going away. The company is still pouring billions of dollars to work in this high-growth area. Nevertheless, META’s focus on its core three social media platforms WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram is notable. Meta Platforms impressively serves nearly 40% of the global population. Thus, from a stability standpoint, there’s a lot to like about Meta’s deep pockets. Its pursuit is clear in such investments of more speculative, higher-growth areas of the market.\n\nWe’ll have to see how the metaverse ultimately turns out. But for investors looking for a high-upside and relatively low-risk pick in this space, META stock certainly looks attractive.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most popular games that emerged during the pandemic is Roblox (NASDAQ:RBLX). Currently, Xbox, PCs, tablets and smartphones worldwide support it. Roblox provides a creator-driven ecosystem that has offered millions of experiences, fostering user engagement in an increasingly online world.\n\nIn 2024, management expects revenues to surge 47%, with sales expected to double two years from now. Although the company has continued to post losses, Roblox’s growth has untapped potential. Thus, long-term investors should watch this company as a key potential metaverse winner.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn recent news, Transcosmos launched metaverse services on Roblox with EbuAction, enhancing content production and marketing strategies. This collaboration targets younger audiences across Roblox, Fortnite and ZEPETO, utilizing user interactions and tailored solutions for clients.\n\nMoreover, the company will announce its Q2 of 2024 earnings report on August 1. Recently, Roblox faced a security breach affecting over 10,300 creators’ personal information due to a vendor, FNTech. While internal systems remained secure, this incident followed a similar breach in 2020. Additionally, Roblox aimed to enhance voice safety using its Real-Time Safety system to analyze communications and enforce policy compliance effectively.\n\nSo, be sure to consider these clearly headwinds. But overall, RBLX stock remains a top consideration for investors interested in the metaverse trade.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) continues it expansion, so does Qualcomm’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock price. Known more as an AI beneficiary due to the company’s core semiconductor business, Qualcomm benefits from growth of other sectors, including the metaverse. Whoever needs chips to power their devices or applications will need to go to one of the major players. And Qualcomm is certainly a key beneficiary of a number of long-term secular growth catalysts.\n\nSo, it should be no surprise that QCOM stock has surged more than 43% in 2024. The company has shifted its focus from mobile chips to AI-compatible chips for PCs, driving demand as major manufacturers adopt its Snapdragon AI-PC chips. This strategic pivot positions Qualcomm for continued gains in the future.\n\nSoon, Qualcomm will reveal its new generation AI advancements on Snapdragon for India event on July 30 in New Delhi. Announcements regarding gen AI is expected by analysts, with the company set to reveal a new Snapdragon chip. This makes 5G accessible for budget smartphones. The innovation could enhance online gaming, video streaming and cloud applications across the country.\n\nFor those looking to benefit from the long-term growth potential of AI, the metaverse and other trends, QCOM stock appears to be a decent bet right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Stocks That Can Still Double Your Money by 2026",
        "content": "The stock market makes it easier to achieve long-term financial goals. While any asset can get you closer to your milestones, few opportunities offer the same liquidity and choices as stocks. You can start buying stocks with as little as a dollar and build your portfolio with every paycheck.\n\nNaturally, some stocks do better than others, and it’s possible to double your money within a few years if you pick the right stocks. Investors should look for companies with rising revenue and profit margins. Growth in those metrics can elevate the stock price and give investors more reasons to stick around. A company’s industry, long-term catalysts and valuation also help investors to paint a better picture about a stock’s potential.\n\nThe following seven growth stocks show plenty of potential to possibly double your money by 2026. These are the stocks to monitor in the second half of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is an educational app that helps people learn new languages through guided verbal and written lessons. The app has also expanded to cover additional subjects like music and math. Although Duolingo stock is down by 10% year-to-date (YTD), it looks like a good candidate to double your money in a few years. That’s because financial growth is booming, and users continue to flock to the platform.\n\nRevenue increased by 45% year-over-year (YOY) in the first quarter. That’s always been a bright spot for the company, but profits are also expanding at a quick rate. Net income came to $27.0 million this quarter compared to a net loss of $2.6 million in the same quarter last year. Rising profits will support a lower P/E ratio which can make the stock more attractive for long-term investors. And, Wall Street analysts are on board with Duolingo’s catalysts. The stock is rated as a moderate buy with a projected 3% upside.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) continues to soar as profit margins improve. The stock has more than doubled over the past five years, but it’s still possible for the stock to double again within a few years. Meta Platforms only trades at a 28 P/E ratio while delivering exceptional financials.\n\nRevenue increased by 27% YOY in the first quarter while net income soared by more than 117% YOY. These strong numbers won’t stick around forever. So, if Meta Platforms continues to post impressive numbers for several quarters, it’s possible for the stock to double quickly.\n\nStory continues\n\nMark Zuckerberg has emphasized the company’s commitment to efficiency. Workforce has been downsized by 10% YOY to 69,329 employees. The company has grown across all metrics, including daily active users. More than 3.24 billion people use Meta Platforms’ family of apps each day. That’s a 7% YOYO increase for the company’s social media platforms. Meta Platforms remains a leader in the social media industry and should continue to generate billions of dollars from ads every quarter.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leader in the cybersecurity industry that generates recurring revenue from its subscription model. Corporations and small businesses invest in Crowdstrike’s software to protect themselves from digital attacks. Companies can lose millions of dollars from hacks due to legal costs, lost customer trust and other factors.\n\nAlthough other cybersecurity stocks have reported decelerating revenue growth, Crowdstrike continues to charge forward. Revenue increased by 33% YOY to reach $921.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Net income came to $42.8 million compared to $0.5 million in the same quarter last year. Also, CRWD’s annual recurring revenue jumped by 33% YOY to reach $3.65 billion.\n\nCurrently, Crowdstrike is rated as a strong buy among 31 Wall Street analysts. The average price target suggests an 8% upside from current levels. However, some analysts are more bullish. The highest price target of $440 per share implies that shares can gain an additional 18% from current levels.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) Nubank mobile app on white cell phone and credit card on black surface. NU stock.\n\nSource: Lais Monteiro / Shutterstock\n\nNu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is another Wall Street favorite that has a 4% upside at the average price target and is rated as a strong buy. Analysts have several reasons to like the digital bank’s prospects. First, the bank recently reached 100 million customers, and most of them are active. The stock also has momentum on its side, based on a 67% YTD gain.\n\nThe stock’s momentum is justified based on first quarter results. During that quarter, revenue increased by 69% YOY. Net income jumped from $141.8 million in Q1 of 2023 to $378.8 million in this quarter. That’s a 167% YOY improvement.\n\nNu Holdings offers customers access to several financial products. It offers loans, credit cards, bank accounts and brokerage accounts. The digital bank primarily serves customers in the growing Latin America region. Rising revenue and profit margins suggest that the stock can outperform the stock market and double in a few years. The Q1 of 2024 net profit margin came in at 29.7%.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is a cosmetics company that is a big hit among Gen Z consumers. The company uses cruelty-free ingredients in its products and offers various choices. The formula has worked well for investors, as shares are up by 37% YTD. Further, the stock is up by more than a whopping 1,000% over the past five years.\n\nShares have soared thanks to a series of superb earnings reports, including Q4 FY24 results. The company reported a 71% YOY increase in net sales during that quarter. That growth rate helped Elf Beauty exceed $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. Also, the company provided upbeat guidance for fiscal 2025 that suggests high growth rates will remain.\n\nTherefore, Elf Beauty should continue to gain market share based on guidance, and it shouldn’t surprise long-term investors. The cosmetics firm gained market share for the 5th consecutive year and delivered its 21st consecutive quarter of net sales and market share growth.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nRobinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) shares have almost doubled YTD. It’s a big turnaround for the company that still remains well removed from its all-time high and IPO price. The fintech firm offers a range of innovative financial products that helped it deliver 40% YOY revenue growth in the first quarter.\n\nTransaction-based revenue is the largest and fastest growing segment. This component of Robinhood’s business grew by 59% YOY to reach $329 million. The significant growth rate is largely attributed to crypto revenue jumping by 232% YOY to reach $126 million. Although Robinhood has more going for its business than crypto, anyone who is bullish on the digital tokens may want to give Robinhood a closer look.\n\nNet income jumped from a net loss of $511 million to a net profit of $157 million YOY. Robinhood Gold subscriptions are also picking up and were a part of the company’s “Other revenues” segment. This part of Robinhood’s business increased by 35% YOY to reach $35 million in revenue.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Close up hand holding mobile with Digital Advertising and icons, Digital Marketing concept. digital ad stocks\n\nSource: weedezign via Shutterstock\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is on the upswing after a few flat years and an IPO gone bust. Shares are up by 9% YTD, and the search engine marketing tool’s prospects are looking bright. While corporations, small businesses and solopreneurs have regularly used Semrush’s products, it’s becoming a more attractive investment.\n\nRevenue increased by 21% YOY in the first quarter to reach $85.8 million. Two key catalysts drove Semrush’s top-line success. The first catalyst was a 10% YOY increase in the number of paying customers. Semrush has roughly 112,000 paying customers on its platform and an additional 1,125,000 registered free active customers. The latter figure is up by 27% YOY.\n\nAnother key component of Semrush’s success is higher prices. SEMR can raise prices on its products and get existing customers to upgrade their accounts. That’s the reason the number of Semrush customers who pay more than $10,000 annually grew by 32% YOY. Also, Semrush is profitable and delivered a $2.1 million net income in the quarter.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CRWD and ELF.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe Biden administration has tried to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries, from healthcare to groceries to tech.\n\nBut a second Trump administration may not be much friendlier, especially with the giants of Silicon Valley.\n\nWhen Trump was president last decade, his administration launched antitrust investigations into Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Alphabet's Google. His administration also filed a lawsuit against Google, targeting its dominance as a search engine.\n\nThat search engine case, which the Biden administration decided to continue, wrapped up earlier this year, and a decision from a judge is expected soon.\n\nTrump suggested in an interview with Bloomberg Tuesday that major tech companies do need some reining in to limit hazards to children, though he added that he didn't want to go after them violently because the approach could destroy them.\n\nAnd Trump’s new vice-presidential candidate, Sen.

Vance, has called for the breakup of Google while also expressing admiration for Lina Khan, the Federal Trade Commission boss who has led the scrutiny of a number of merger attempts in the tech world.\n\n\"I guess I look at Lina Khan as one of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is doing a pretty good job,\" Vance said in February.\n\nA former FTC official who spoke with Yahoo Finance and asked to remain anonymous agreed an Alphabet-Wiz deal would spark a review, no matter who is in the White House. Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, attends a campaign rally in Ohio. (AP Photo/Jeff Dean) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut a Trump-led DOJ or FTC, the former official said, would more likely favor concessions from Alphabet over litigation if a review raised competition concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegulators could even probe for evidence to learn if Google is already engaged in the cloud cybersecurity market in hopes of challenging the company on grounds that the deal poses a potential, rather than existing, competition threat.\n\nThe former FTC official said that evidence might not support the theory, but such an investigation could be worthwhile for regulators to explore because they are interested in further developing the law on potential threats.\n\nThat, too, could take up substantial time.\n\nIf a deal to buy Wiz does in fact move forward, either the DOJ or FTC would lead any ensuing investigation.\n\nAt preliminary stages, merger and acquisition reviews typically span 30 days, with room for extensions. If officials decide to move beyond preliminary review to what’s known as a second request, the additional investigation can take six to 18 months. Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) (Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images)\n\nOnly then, once a second request is completed, could a legal challenge to the transaction happen.\n\n\"So we're talking at a minimum of probably eight months before there's an actual challenge and, more likely, a year or more before there's an actual challenge,\" Kass said.\n\nThe antitrust experts said competition concerns could include fears that an acquisition would give Alphabet’s Google an opportunity to disadvantage rivals or diminish competition in a downstream market.\n\nNew York University professor Lawrence White said an Alphabet-Wiz deal could also receive scrutiny from regulators abroad.\n\nThat would pose additional complications for the companies since the EU keeps turning up the heat on US tech giants.\n\nJust last month European regulators hit Microsoft (MSFT) with an antitrust charge one day after the same regulatory body charged Apple with violating European Union competition law.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Analyst Thinks Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Can Go Higher",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. Since Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nKing Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management’s chief strategist, recently talked to CNBC about the latest decline in tech stocks and market rotation. Lip said that he’s still bullish on tech stocks and a single event does not show a trend. However, the cause of decline in tech stocks last week was the lower-than-expected CPI data which caused investors to do some “profit taking” and invest in names that can benefit “more” from lower interest rates, according to the analyst. Lip noted that small-cap stocks, real estate stocks, among others, gained ground on the back of this trend.\n\nHowever, Lip has high expectations from the upcoming earnings reports from tech companies. He also said that July has been one of the strongest months for tech stocks. Lip, however, said that major tech companies cannot go on to post record gains and their returns are expected to “fall in line with historical returns.”\n\nLip thinks the economy is entering a “Goldilocks scenario” where growth is steady but not “hot enough” to cause inflation. He reiterated his view that he expects strong earnings growth this year and in 2025, which could be a tailwind for stocks.\n\nAsked what would cause earnings growth of tech companies, Lip said a lot of that comes down to efficient management and strong cash piles these companies have. He also said “slightly” lower interest rates could also be a tailwind for the economy.\n\nSince Lip is bullish on tech stocks and believes major AI companies still have upside potential, we decided to take a look at the top names in his portfolio. These are the top holdings of King Lip, according to CNBC. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Analyst Says Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Has More Upside Potential?\n\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\n\nKing Lip’s portfolio also features Meta Platforms.\n\nThe social media giant is using AI for optimizing ad targeting and recommendation systems to boost engagement and ads revenue. In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.  However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it’ll bode well for the stock down the road.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta’s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world’s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users across its platform. The company generates revenue predominantly from advertising. which accounts for over 95% of its total revenue, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal fourth quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings surpassing analyst estimates. The better-than- expected revenues were attributed to strong advertiser demand and Al-driven ad improvements. Moreover, the company materially raised its fiscal first quarter sales and earnings guidance above analysts’ estimates, buoyed by continued strong advertiser demand trends and enhancements to Reels. Advantage+. Click-to-message, and Shop Ads. Further, management noted that ongoing investment in Al is enhancing user engagement and advertiser returns through improved targeting and measurement. Separately, Meta authorized a new share repurchase plan representing approximately 5% of its market capitalization and announced the initiation of its first dividend, implying an approximate 0.4% yield.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Social Media Stocks That Will Have Better Returns Than META",
        "content": "Less than two years ago, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) hit lows of $90 per share. Now, the company is a trillion-dollar titan at nearly $500 a share. Many of us, whether short-term or long-term investors, look forward to the day we can get lucky enough to hit a multi-bagger like META. However, there are plenty of other social media stocks worth your investment. Having said that, how do you find them?\n\nOne of the best ways to do so is through a simple investment strategy known as Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP). With GARP, investors should focus on companies with strong fundamentals, a large moat usually attached to market share, margin expansion, and high revenue growth.\n\nIn this article, I’ll cover stocks that I believe have a setup that META had in 2022. By using the GARP principles, these three stocks could be social media multi-baggers in the making!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeing an AI innovator, search engine giant, and social media superstar, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is truly one-of-a-kind. This unique moat has positioned Alphabet as the fourth-largest company in the world by market cap.\n\nThe company has an 81.95% market share in the search engine industry with its subsidiary, YouTube, holding a market share of 97.67%. Not surprisingly, Alphabet’s financials are stellar with 57.2% year-over-year net income growth and 15.4% year-over-year growth in revenue to $80.54 billion. Its balance sheet holds just $30 billion in total debt compared to $110 billion in cash & equivalents.\n\nSo how is Alphabet continuing to fuel growth as a $2.3 trillion company? First, Alphabet is cost-cutting, having laid off more than 12,000 employees in 2023 alone. This contributed to its operating margin increasing to 32% from 25%. Second, it’s heavily investing in its technical infrastructure to support AI and Cloud growth. In Q1 alone, Alphabet’s CapEx was $12 billion, driven by investments in servers and data centers to develop its Gemini models. Lastly, Google is integrating this AI infrastructure into its current product line. YouTube cycles a host of generative AI tools, which led to 50% more channels uploading YouTube Shorts. This led to a 21% year-over-year rise in ad revenues.\n\nSpotify Technology SA (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a market share of 30.5%, Spotify (NASDAQ:SPOT) is the leader in the music streaming market. It is also second in the podcast market, housing 28.2% of podcast listeners. This only adds to the company’s extensive monthly active user (MAU) count of 615 million with 44% of them using the platform daily. This reinforces Spotify’s networking effect: as more users use the platform, friends and family will join as well. Features like Spotify Wrapped add a true social dimension to the app.\n\nStory continues\n\nMonthly active users reach new all-time highs growing 19% year-over-year leading to quarterly revenues of $3.64 billion up about 20% year-over-year. Starting in July, the company announced price hikes for its individual, duo, and family plans by 9%, 13.3%, and 17.7% respectively.\n\nProvided that the company has had a historical monthly churn rate of just 2% and given that its customer conversion rate is 44%, I do not believe these price hikes will significantly impact the company’s user base. SPOT trades at 3.9x sales and has a 0.8-forward Price to earnings ratio divided by its annual EPS Growth (PEG ratio). This is low relative to other music streamers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) at 1.39 or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 2.8. This is easily one of the best social media stocks on the market.\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent (NASDAQ:TCEHY), is China’s largest company and operates in social media, gaming, and eCommerce. While the company’s revenues have grown by 26% since 2020 the stock is down 50% from its all-time high.\n\nIt has a staggering 47% market share in the global gaming industry. Tencent’s WeChat super-app hosts 1.3 billion monthly active users. This is nearly twice the users of Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) which has 676 million monthly active users. Net margins were up 50% quarter-over-quarter driven by improved digital advertising through its AI-powered ad targeting.\n\nTencent has a stellar lineup of games including Fight of Golden Spatula which broke mobile records in China. Other games under Tencent’s umbrella include Valorant, PUBG Mobile, and League of Legends. With more than 140 games and $135 million in annual gross revenue per game, any new release adds to Tencent’s high-margin top-line growth.\n\nAt first glance, TCEHY trades at more than double the EV/EBITDA of peers like Baidu and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). But stronger growth metrics justify shares trading at 14.62x and 16.4x forward earnings. Quarterly revenue growth grew six times that of Baidu’s while net profit margins are 50% higher than BABA. If you are looking for the top social media stocks, start here.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to significantly impact the global economy and business in the coming years. While some debate sustainability of the current AI-driven growth, investors and traders alike consider AI stocks to buy. With AI technology undoubtedly here to stay, this disruption will reshape the way we work, conduct business and invest.\n\nMultiple stocks have seen dramatic gains in recent years due to AI adoption. However, they may be vulnerable to changes in investor sentiment now. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are getting the lion’s share of headlines and investor interest as they battle it out for the leading edge. Yet, as with the dot-com boom, millionaire-making stocks haven’t grown yet despite witnessing substantial returns.\n\nGenerative AI is expected to add $2.6-4.4 trillion globally in the coming years, allowing ample room for stock growth. As AI applications and technologies become more pervasive, the overall economic benefits are projected to be sizable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile large companies make headlines, smaller players with consistent earnings and projected continued AI-enabled expansion may be worth examining. Let’s explore three stocks to buy for long-term AI-driven returns.\n\nDoubleVerify Holdings (DV) a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer. data infrastructure stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne of the stocks to buy that has the potential to return millions is DoubleVerify Holdings (NYSE:DV). The technology firm provides data analytics and user authentication services for online companies. Its primary focus is helping advertisers reach audiences and achieve effective, quality returns on sales. The company uses AI to increase fraud detection capabilities. It also offers AI as a service to enhance the effectiveness of digital advertising and optimize strategies for individual businesses.\n\nWhat makes DoubleVerify attractive as a growth stock is that it has consistently increased EPS over the last four years. The company is projected to continue doing so this year, delivering a 17% sales growth in 2024. Expanding into new markets like Meta (NASDAQ:META), YouTube and TikTok will probably weigh on its current earnings but is expected to enhance future growth.\n\nThis may explain why analysts are so positive about DV stock. The average price target is currently at $29.12 per share. This represents a potential upside of over 45%, which typically spans for a 1-year period.\n\nZoom (ZM) A woman sitting at a desk waves at a large number of people on the videoconferencing software Zoom (ZM).\n\nSource: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nZoom (NASDAQ:ZM) is an internet communications platform company. It is most known for its shared-screen meetings, which were prevalent during the pandemic. As the end of lockdowns brought a major decline in demand, Zoom now integrates AI into its software. ZM provides a one-stop business solutions platform for arranging communications as companies navigate hybrid work environments.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is trading near pre-pandemic levels after its stock grew approximately ten-fold during the height of the pandemic. This means that ZM stock price is around 90% below its all-time record high. However, the company has since integrated AI and evolved into a tech company trading at a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.3x for a tech. This is well below the S&P 500 average of 29.3.\n\nAnalysts expect continued growth, making Zoom one of the stocks to buy with an average price target signaling over 30% upside. Notably, Zoom has beaten consensus EPS consistently over the prior several earnings reports, with surprises ranging in double-digit territory.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is known for its AutoCAD software, which serves as the backbone of engineering and architectural development.\n\nThe company is positioning itself as the leader in 3D AI evolution through the use of generative AI to produce functional 3D shapes. In addition to AutoCAD, Autodesk offers other products like Fusion 360 and Maya that serve the construction, manufacturing and media industries.\n\nWhile it applies AI to many industries, the company has not seen significant investor interest as its share price is up less than 5% for the year. However, Autodesk is particularly compelling because of its very low expenses due to a subscription-based business model. This results in a gross profit margin of 92%, with the largest cost being sales and marketing to acquire new customers.\n\nAutodesk expects 10% revenue growth in 2024 through consistent growth that is not reliant on short-term AI trends. Also, analysts are optimistic about the ADSK stock, with 19 out of 23 recommending buying Autodesk shares.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) closed at $496.16 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.54% move from the prior day. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.28%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.53%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.4%.\n\nShares of the social media company witnessed a loss of 1.05% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 4.22% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.78%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Meta Platforms in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on July 31, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $4.68, indicating a 44.89% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $38.19 billion, up 19.36% from the year-ago period.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $20.21 per share and revenue of $159.08 billion. These totals would mark changes of +35.91% and +17.92%, respectively, from last year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.25% higher. Meta Platforms is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Meta Platforms is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 24.68. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 29.77.\n\nWe can also see that META currently has a PEG ratio of 1.29. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Internet - Software industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.74 as of yesterday's close.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 89, this industry ranks in the top 36% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Moonshot Stocks That Could Turn $5,000 Into $25,000",
        "content": "This article is an excerpt from the InvestorPlace Digest newsletter. To get news like this delivered straight to your inbox, click here.\n\nIn mid-2013, America moved into a “Goldilocks” economy phase, a time when growth finally became not too hot and not too cold. Unemployment from the 2007-08 financial crisis was receding, and the prior year’s corporate cost cutting was submitting to a more sustainable way forward. Perhaps most importantly, consumers were beginning to regain confidence as the financial crisis faded into the rearview mirror.\n\n“We have all this hot air in Washington,” David Blitzer, S&P Dow Jones Indices chairman, said in a CNBC interview at the time. “But the rest of the economy is growing reasonably well… And that’s probably what’s behind the stock market’s good track record.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn other words, things were good enough.\n\n2024 is quickly becoming another “Goldilocks” period for the economy. On Thursday, CPI data showed that inflation decelerated to 3%, from 3.3% a month earlier. Analysts expect GDP to rise at 2% this year, up from previous estimates of 1.5%. And though industrial output is slightly weaker than expected, it’s easy to argue that we’re finally in another period when the economy is not too hot and not too cold.\n\nThat’s great news because “Goldilocks” moments are phenomenal times for buying moonshot stocks. Shares of fast-growing companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) would more than double in 2013 – the last time we saw this “Goldilocks” phenomenon. Smaller firms like Canadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) rose as much as 750%.\n\nThat’s because most moonshots need strong economies and permissive capital markets to survive. It’s no surprise that the 2012-14 period saw a bump in initial public offerings (IPOs) and a rash of venture capital (VC) activity. When you have big ideas, it helps to have big money to grow them into even bigger businesses. And the best of these startups can make early investors an enormous amount of profit.\n\nThis week, our writers at InvestorPlace.com – our free news and analysis site – examine three of these moonshot stocks that they believe are at the cusp of the sorts of gains that could turn $5,000 into $25,000. Though some of these moonshots naturally might not survive (they are moonshots), the five-baggers that do could more than offset these losses.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) In this photo illustration, the Plug Power logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) has long been a risky bet on the future of the renewable energy source known as green hydrogen. The company is unprofitable; in 2023 it burned through $1.8 billion of cash. It’s also running out of time. Its most recent balance sheet shows just $173 million of cash and short-term investments on its books.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Plug Power also has enormous dreams to become America’s first one-stop shop for green hydrogen… and it now has significant financial backing that extends beyond its balance sheets. In March, it signed an agreement with investment bank B. Riley to raise more equity. And in May, the firm received a $1.66 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy to help build out six “hydrogen hubs” across the country.\n\nThis week at InvestorPlace.com, Larry Ramer writes how these efforts are laying the groundwork to become very profitable in the long term:\n\nDeployments of the company’s electrolyzers are rapidly ramping up. As a result, I believe that this business will generate huge profits over the long-term as its revenue surges and its costs drop.\n\n… Moreover, Plug is likely to benefit from Nikola’s success, since the two firms announced a partnership in December 2022. With Plug becoming a leader in the green hydrogen boom, I believe that it is one of the best hydrogen fuel stocks to buy.\n\nNew InvestorPlace.com contributor Andy Kim also notes that Plug already has a strong first-mover advantage, making it one of the smartest hydrogen stocks to buy with $100:\n\nPlug Power is essentially the pioneer in bringing a commercialized hydrogen market in the country. Furthermore, the company has deployed more than 69,000 fuel cell systems and over 250 fueling stations. This makes Plug Power the company with the largest fuel cell infrastructure while it is also the world’s largest buyer of liquid hydrogen.\n\nThat makes Plug Power either a company that will be worth billions in the future… or $0 if things don’t work out. And our Goldilocks economy now means the prospect of a 5X return… or even 20X… now outweighs the risk of total loss. Plug Power will need a lot of capital to build its green hydrogen infrastructure, and today’s economy is making it far easier to raise the cash.\n\nOppFi (OPFI) Graphic of side view of virtual financial charts with tech aesthetic, symbolizing fintech\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/whiteMocca\n\nOppFi (NYSE:OPFI) is a fintech firm that issues loans to low-credit consumers through community banks.\n\nIt’s a surprisingly profitable business. Since 2018, the firm has faced only one year of operating losses. As Yiannis Zourmpanos writes this week at InvestorPlace.com, numbers are still pointing in the right direction:\n\nThe company demonstrated strong profitability metrics during Q1 2024. OppFi’s Net income increased substantially by 157.8% year-over-year (YoY) to $10.1 million. Similarly, its adjusted net income grew by 127.8% annually to $8.8 million. This significant improvement in profitability points to effective cost management and operational edge despite a slight increase in total expenses. Synergistically, total expenses decreased as a percentage of top-line by 2.7% to 40.6% (excluding one-time expenses and add-backs), contributing to enhanced profitability.\n\nThat stands in stark contrast with other fintech lending firms. LendingClub (NYSE:LC) has lost money in 12 of the past 16 years, while privately held Prosper Marketplace has done the same in nine of the past 11 years.\n\nThat makes OppFi a potential five-bagger hiding in plain sight. The company has managed to learn enough about its customers to consistently write profitable loans, and demand for this service will only grow as rival lenders struggle to make money. Mild economic growth will also keep default rates lower than average, boosting OppFi’s total profitability.\n\nOppFi also trades at a significant discount, giving it a 5x upside. Markets currently value the stock at under 7x earnings, and analysts expect profits to grow 18% this year and 7% the next. This gives shares a 3x-4x upside on re-rating alone. The high likelihood of rising earnings (from low default rates) increases the upside to 5x to 10x.\n\nOf course, as a moonshot, OppFi comes with significant risks.\n\nThe company specializes in high-interest loans, charging 155% APRs on average to low-credit consumers. Net charge-off rates (loans expected to be written off) also sit at 47.9% of revenue – a figure 10 times higher than usually seen at established credit card firms.\n\nStill, alternative lenders have long been a source of strong potential returns. Green Dot (NYSE:GDOT), a firm that issues debit cards for Americans without bank accounts, saw shares rise fivefold in the mid-2010s during the last “Goldilocks” period. And OppFi could do the same this cycle.\n\nOpen Text (OTEX) A colorful heap of software logos sits on top of a laptop keyboard.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIan Bezek writes this week at InvestorPlace.com about how shares of Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) are at shockingly low valuations. The Canadian-based software rollup trades at 7.4 times earnings, even though analysts expect revenues to rise 25% this year and for earnings to surge 27%.\n\nInvestors have assigned OTEX stock a low valuation, with shares currently going for just 8 times forward earnings. Some discount makes sense as Open Text is a complex firm and many of its software tools are legacy rather than cutting-edge products. Regardless, 8 times forward earnings is an awfully low price, and shares seem set for a solid recovery after their recent 30% pullback.\n\nThe company also has a good history of profitable acquisitions. Return on capital invested (ROIC) should hit 17% this year and rise to 25% by 2026, according to analyst estimates. And revenue gains are being driven by significant secular tailwinds in its core markets, which includes cloud services, customer support, and software licensing. As CEO Mark Barrenechea said in his third-quarter earnings call in May:\n\nOur strategy to accelerate cloud growth is working. We’ve increased our R&D investment to an annualized $900 million or 16% of fiscal ’24 revenue. This helped drive Enterprise Cloud bookings growth of 63% in Q2 and 53% in Q3. We’ve increased our F ’24 Enterprise Cloud bookings targets to 33% to 38% and we’re confidently projecting 20% plus cloud bookings growth in both F’25 and beyond.\n\nTogether, that means Open Text could rise threefold on multiples expansion alone. According to a three-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model, shares are worth roughly $100 without additional acquisitions. Additional bolt-ons will increase this value even further to the 5x to 8x return range, especially if mild economic growth continues and keeps capital flowing.\n\nThe AI Moonshot Game\n\nTwo Sundays ago, I wrote here about Stem (NYSE:STEM), a stock that could rise 20x in the next decade. People have begun to worry about the power consumption of AI, and Stem is finding itself at the right place, at the right time. Shares are already up double digits since that note.\n\nThe AI story is also powering other firms to prominence. In a special report for his flagship newsletter, Eric Fry notes how artificial intelligence is creating a new cohort of stocks that could surge 1,000% or more (go here to learn how to get that report). These companies are riding a once-in-a-generation megatrend and are succeeding at changing the world.\n\nThe best part is that we’re still in the early innings of this AI surge. Imagine a world where artificial intelligence can be trusted to drive cars… report the news… or even perform brain surgery. And now think how far current AI models still need to go to create that reality.\n\nThat’s why, in the coming weeks, you can expect to hear more from Eric – together with Louis Navellier and Luke Lango as well – about how AI will create a whole new world of moonshot opportunities. We’re in the perfect “Goldilocks” economy to fund these projects. And now that the technology is starting to become ready for prime time, we can expect some incredible disruptions to come.\n\nWatch for a special announcement on that event soon. In fact, I’ve spent the past couple of months working hard, helping Eric, Luke, and Louis put together that project… and I’ll be taking the next two Sundays off from the Digest to concentrate on finishing that up.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Buy Alert: 7 Growth Stocks That Have Outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 2024",
        "content": "The S&P 500 is the hallmark of portfolio diversification. When most investors aim to “beat the market,” they are talking about this index. It contains 500 profitable publicly traded corporations, with allocations weighted by market cap. For instance, investors will have the most exposure to the largest publicly traded corporation and the least exposure to the 500th largest company on the list.\n\nThis index routinely adds and removes stocks based on financial performance and other factors. Furthermore, it’s not easy to get into the S&P 500. A company must fulfill several requirements, such as having a sufficient market cap and reporting a profitable year.\n\nAlthough many investors use index investing to match the market, it’s possible to outperform the S&P 500. These growth stocks have lived up to the premise and have outpaced the S&P 500 so far. Investors may want to take a closer look at these growth stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalmart (WMT) An image of a Canoo, Inc. (GOEV) Walmart electric delivery vehicle\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is a haven for consumers who want to protect their wallets and buy affordable products. The company can deliver solid earnings during the good times and remain resilient during economic downturns. Walmart has delivered a 30% year-to-date gain, which outpaces the S&P 500’s 18% year-to-date gain.\n\nWalmart also offers a 1.20% yield for its investors. While dividend growth has been an issue in previous years, the company recently announced a 9% dividend hike — the highest dividend increase in more than a decade.\n\nQ1 FY25 financial results suggest that Walmart can continue the rally. Revenue increased by 6.0% year-over-year in that quarter, while adjusted EPS was up by 22.4% year-over-year. Global e-commerce sales were a major highlight, increasing by 21% year-over-year. Store-fulfilled pickups and deliveries continue to pick up momentum. Investors should also monitor the small but growing advertising segment, which reported 24% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s hard to talk about outperforming the S&P 500 without mentioning at least one of the Magnificent Seven stocks. These stocks have carried the index to new heights for several years and heavily influence the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks, delivering a 30% year-to-date return. Online marketplace sales continue to grow and achieve double-digit revenue growth in domestic and international markets. That wasn’t the only highlight from Q1 2024 results. While overall revenue increased by 13% year-over-year, the company also reported 17% revenue growth for Amazon Web Services. That part of Amazon’s business generated $25.0 billion in the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile e-commerce and cloud computing are Amazon’s core specialties, the company is making strides in the advertising market. The tech giant reported $11.8 billion in ad revenue this quarter, a 24% year-over-year increase. Amazon thrives in multiple industries, which should lead to long-term gains for patient investors.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) Graphic of yellow money bag next to green arrow and coins floating in air, symbolizing growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Monster Ztudio\n\nNu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is a Brazilian digital bank that offers a wide range of financial products and services to the Latin American community. Shares have logged a 65% year-to-date return. It helps that the company recently surpassed 100 million users, most of whom are active.\n\nThe digital bank reported an 83% activity rate at the end of the first quarter. This rate demonstrates that 83% of the company’s 100 million customers are active monthly. The bank has more than 83 million monthly active users, and they use multiple financial products. Nu Holdings reported 69% year-over-year revenue growth as customers used the bank’s personal loans, credit cards, bank accounts, brokerage accounts and other resources.\n\nWall Street analysts still believe that the stock can rise. Seven analysts rate it a Strong Buy, with a projected 5% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $15.20 per share suggests the stock can gain an additional 13%.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been outperforming the stock market for several years. It has almost quadrupled over the past five years and is up 28% year-to-date. The Mexican Grill chain recently completed a 50-for-1 stock split and has been under a correction ever since. This correction presents an opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nThe company continues to grow at a robust pace. Revenue increased by 14.1% year-over-year to reach $2.7 billion in the first quarter, and net income rose by 23.2% year-over-year to reach $259.3 million. Chipotle opened 47 new restaurants this quarter and remains on pace to open 285-315 restaurants throughout the year.\n\nRestaurant expansion isn’t the only reason Chipotle’s revenue is still rising. The company reported 7.0% year-over-year growth in comparable restaurant sales. Wall Street analysts are on board and have rated the stock as a Moderate Buy. The average price target suggests a 16% upside, while the highest price target of $80 per share indicates that a 38% gain is possible.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another member of the Magnificent Seven that has outperformed the S&P 500 over a lengthy amount of time, including this year. Facebook’s parent company has logged a 44% year-to-date gain and comes with a 0.40% yield. The stock trades at a 29 P/E ratio and trades at a $1.26 trillion valuation.\n\nThe social media giant closed out the first quarter with 3.24 billion daily active users, 7% higher than the same time last year. Meta Platforms’ large user base allows it to experiment with new products and AI offerings. As it works on new initiatives, the company performs well with its current business model. Revenue increased by 27% year over year, while net income surged by 117% year over year.\n\nMeta Platforms remain a big hit on Wall Street. The stock is rated a Strong Buy with a projected 6% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $625 per share suggests the company can rally by an additional 25%.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) isn’t as big as Chipotle, but the steakhouse chain has momentum and a more reasonable valuation. The stock trades at a 34 P/E ratio and offers a 1.44% yield. Shares are up by 42% year-to-date and have more than tripled over the past five years.\n\nThe steakhouse chain reported 12.5% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. Net income jumped by 31.9% year-over-year, which should help the company maintain a double-digit dividend growth rate. Texas Roadhouse opened 12 restaurants in the quarter, including three franchises. The steakhouse chain’s comparable sales increased by 8.4% year-over-year at company-owned restaurants. The growth rate came in at 7.7% for franchise restaurants. Both growth rates are respectable and demonstrate that Texas Roadhouse is becoming a fixture in numerous communities.\n\nWall Street analysts have rated the stock as a Moderate Buy. The average price target only implies a 3% upside, but the highest price target of $191 per share suggests a potential 13% gain.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been crushing the stock market. The cybersecurity firm is a recent addition to the S&P 500, delivering a 50% year-to-date gain. Shares are up by more than 400% over the past five years.\n\nThe company operates in an industry projected to grow for many years. Cybersecurity is projected to maintain a compounded annual growth rate of 13.8% until 2030. Many companies will benefit from the industry’s success, but few are as well-positioned as Crowdstrike.\n\nWhile other cybersecurity companies have reported decelerating revenue growth, Crowdstrike continues to charge ahead. The company reported 33% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Crowdstrike operates on a subscription business model and currently has $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue. Profits are also surging, going from $0.5 million in the same quarter last year to $42.8 million in this quarter.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AMZN, TXRH, and CRWD.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks That Could Be Multibaggers in the Making: July Edition",
        "content": "The metaverse has already been through quite the boom-and-bust cycle. The concept burst onto the scene a few years ago, reaching its pinnacle when Mark Zuckerberg renamed his company from Facebook to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Zuckerberg felt that the metaverse would be a key growth avenue, and the company made a splashy Super Bowl ad to highlight its new direction.\n\nHowever, growth hasn’t been nearly as easy as anticipated. Meta’s Horizon Worlds has seen sparse usership thus far. And other tech innovations such as AI have sucked up the oxygen from metaverse investments.\n\nBut the concept of an online meeting space where people can work, collaborate, socialize and play games together remains compelling. And rapid technological advances will broaden the possibilities of the range of experiences in an augmented reality setting.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investing in the augmented reality (AR) space, metaverse stocks possibly could be in for another big run. These are three leading candidates that will prosper if the sector takes off.\n\nUnity (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity (NYSE:U) is one of the two primary graphics engines that video game developers use to produce their games.\n\nUnity’s biggest appeal is its interoperability. A developer can build a game in Unity and quickly release it across console, PC, smartphone, AR and virtual reality (VR). In fact, reports suggested that Mark Zuckerberg considered acquiring Unity to make it a core part of the Oculus ecosystem.\n\nHowever, Unity remained independent. And with U stock now down more than 90% from its all-time highs, shares are near their cheapest ever available price. That could make for a remarkable buying opportunity as Unity gains momentum via partnerships such as its development role for the Apple Vision Pro.\n\nUnity has struggled with monetization, and it generated developer pushback with an unpopular planned price hike last year. The company has had its issues. So, it’s understandable that shares have slipped. But the fall has been excessive, particularly as the company swings to profitability going forward. Any improvement in metaverse sentiment will further speed up the ensuing recover in Unity’s stock price.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is one of China’s leading tech companies. Run as a conglomerate, TCEHY owns and operates a broad array of businesses while maintaining ownership stakes in numerous other companies as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s no secret that China’s economy has been in a tailspin recently, and investors have shunned the country’s stocks. That includes TCEHY shares, which are down almost 50 percent from their all-time highs. At just 16 times forward earnings, Tencent Holdings is an excellent way to play the recovery in the Chinese technology space.\n\nAnd it’s a leading metaverse property as well. Tencent Holdings is a leading video game developer, and it also invests in other peers in that space. In particular, its large holding in Epic Games gives it a particular leg up in the metaverse space.\n\nThat’s because Epic runs Fortnite, which is arguably the most successful metaverse property to date. Fortnite has gained incredible mind share with younger players which has allowed it to attract large international brands who have set up digital stores in the Fortnite universe. Additionally, Fortnite hosts concerts and media events which attract players for unique experiences and allow all sorts of branding, product sales and other monetization opportunities.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) sign near Qualcomm Research Silicon Valley office of San Diego based chip and semiconductor company\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a large semiconductor company focused on the mobile communications market.\n\nHistorically, Qualcomm built its business by designing and licensing the 3G and then 4G technologies that underpin modern mobile communications technology. Qualcomm is pivotal in 5G rollouts now. Yet, it has also diversified, such as with its Snapdragon platform for smartphones and tablets.\n\nThat brings us to Qualcomm’s cutting-edge technologies. The company’s stock has soared over the past year thanks to its AI-enabled chips, which can power leading AI applications in a mobile setting.\n\nIn addition, Qualcomm is investing heavily in the metaverse. It has set aside $100 million for its Snapdragon Metaverse Fund to foster innovation in the space. And Qualcomm is positioning its combination of 5G, spatial intelligence, advanced hardware and high-sensitive cameras as key tools to power up future metaverse experiences.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in U, META, and QCOM stock.

        "title": "2 Soaring Stocks I'd Buy With No Hesitation",
        "content": "The U.S. stock market has been quite volatile in the past decade. Many trends, including e-commerce, cannabis, blockchain, cryptocurrency, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI), have shaped the investment landscape in this time frame.\n\nHowever, AI is no passing trend and is rapidly changing the overall face of corporate America. With broad-reaching utility across industries, functions, and various spheres of daily life, this AI revolution's eventual impact is beyond imagination. According to PWC estimates, AI will contribute a mind-boggling $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.\n\nConsidering that AI technologies are very much here to stay, astute investors should consider picking up at least small stakes in these soaring AI-powered growth stocks as a part of their long-term investing strategy. Here's why Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) fit the bill.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first growth stock to buy with no hesitation is social media giant Meta Platforms. With over 3.2 billion people -- nearly 40% of the global population -- using at least one of the company's apps (Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger) daily, the company enjoys exceptional user reach and engagement. Not surprisingly, Meta's social media applications are highly sought after by advertisers.\n\nMeta leverages powerful AI-driven algorithms to recommend relevant content, which in turn helps boost user engagement. The company is currently working on a new unified recommendation system to give more relevant and personalized content recommendations to users across its social media applications and content formats. Meta offers multiple AI-powered tools to advertisers to automate and optimize their advertising campaigns.\n\nIncreasing user engagement and improved ad targeting are now translating into better ranking, performance, and returns for advertisers -- which directly helps boost business for Meta. In the first quarter, Meta saw the total number of ad impressions and average price per ad grow 20% and 6% year over year, respectively.\n\nBesides strengthening its core digital advertising business, Meta also sees huge potential in monetizing its AI technologies by scaling business messaging, introducing advertisements or paid content in AI assistant interactions, and enabling people to pay for accessing larger AI models.\n\nMeta also reported an impressive surge in profitability in the first quarter, generating $13.8 billion in operating income and $12.4 billion in net income, up 91% and 117%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the company continues its heavy investments in AI initiatives and the metaverse, it is also returning significant value to shareholders as dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter, the company paid $1.3 billion in dividends and repurchased $14.6 billion worth of shares. With the share count dropping and profits rising, Meta will generate more earnings per share in the coming quarters.\n\nMeta shares are trading at 30.5 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is higher than its five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 27.4. Despite this, the stock seems a smart long-term pick even at these elevated valuation levels, considering its dominance in the social media and digital advertising industry and its rapidly strengthening position in the AI industry.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe second compelling growth pick for retail investors is e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon.\n\nIts Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business has been the company's key profit engine for the past several quarters. AWS generated revenue of $25 billion in the first quarter, up 17% year over year -- an accelerated rate compared to 13.2% year-over-year revenue growth in the previous quarter. AWS also reported operating income of $9.4 billion, up $4.3 billion year over year.\n\nAWS has already reached a $100 billion annual run rate. However, with more than 85% of the global IT spending still associated with on-premise IT infrastructure, there is still much scope for AWS to grow in the coming years.\n\nWith a major part of cloud spending optimization initiatives completed, enterprises are now focusing on new projects to migrate on-premise infrastructure to the cloud. AWS customers are also increasingly adopting AI-related services such as custom silicon and compute instances to build proprietary models, Amazon Bedrock for customizing existing large language models, and Amazon Q for AI-powered software development and data analysis.\n\nAmazon is also gearing up to increase capital investments in AWS and generative AI capabilities. Hence, considering the increasing dependence of its diversified customer base on AWS for non-generative AI and generative AI workloads, a broad partner ecosystem, and robust security and operational performance, AWS can continue to be a major growth catalyst for Amazon in the coming years.\n\nThe e-commerce giant is focusing on improving profitability in its core retail business by optimizing the U.S. inbound fulfillment network to place inventory closer to customers, consolidating shipments to reduce cost to serve and to improve customer experience, and expanding the network of same-day fulfillment facilities. The company is investing in robotics and automation to streamline and standardize fulfillment processes.\n\nFinally, although a small part of the business, advertising is also emerging as a major profit contributor. The company sees significant scope for growth in areas like sponsored products and streaming TV advertisements.\n\nConsidering the many robust growth catalysts, Amazon can be a smart buy now -- especially when it is trading at only 3.3 times trailing-12-month sales.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Meta Platforms is US$577 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity With US$499 share price, Meta Platforms appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Our fair value estimate is 9.4% higher than Meta Platforms' analyst price target of US$528\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$51.9b US$57.5b US$66.7b US$72.5b US$76.9b US$80.8b US$84.2b US$87.3b US$90.1b US$92.8b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x19 Analyst x9 Analyst x4 Analyst x3 Est @ 6.11% Est @ 4.99% Est @ 4.21% Est @ 3.66% Est @ 3.27% Est @ 3.01% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3%  US$48.3k US$49.9k US$54.0k US$54.7k US$54.1k US$52.9k US$51.4k US$49.7k US$47.8k US$45.9k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$509b\n\nStory continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$93b× (1 + 2.4%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.4%) = US$1.9t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$1.9t÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$955b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$1.5t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$499, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Meta Platforms as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.069. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Meta Platforms (META) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.74 a share, just 16 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 31, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $4.74 Most Accurate Estimate and the $4.68 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Meta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of 1.35%.\n\nMETA is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. Paycom Software (PAYC) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nSlated to report earnings on July 31, 2024, Paycom Software holds a #1 (Strong Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.73 a share 16 days from its next quarterly update.\n\nPaycom Software's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 9.11% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59.\n\nMETA and PAYC's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "2024 Is Halfway Over. Here Are My Top 5 Stock Picks to End the Year",
        "content": "With 2024 halfway done, many investors are assessing their portfolios to see how their picks have performed. While a six-month time span isn't enough to define success or failure in investing, it is a good chance for investors to examine their holdings to see if anything needs to be added.\n\nSo, if you're looking to deploy some cash to increase your exposure in the market, starting with these five is a great idea.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has had a strong year, up 35%. This rise is thanks to its strong advertising performance and the company finally getting its artificial intelligence (AI) product launches right. Alphabet has some serious momentum heading into the second half of the year, yet it doesn't carry a premium price tag.\n\nUnlike other big tech companies that trade for more than 30 times forward earnings, Alphabet commands a 25 times forward earnings premium. While that may not be historically cheap, it is inexpensive in today's market.\n\nWith Alphabet's success and reasonable price tag, I'm confident Alphabet will continue to excel throughout the latter half of 2024.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nSimilarly to Alphabet, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has had tremendous success with its advertising business. Meta is the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, and Messenger, and thrives on advertising.\n\nWhile 2023 wasn't a great year for advertising, 2024 has been phenomenal. In the first quarter, Meta's ad revenue was $35.6 billion, up 27% year over year. That strength is expected to continue throughout this year and bodes well for a company many wrote off a few years ago for shrinking profit margins. META Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nLike Alphabet, Meta isn't historically cheap, but it is less expensive than its peers at 26 times forward earnings. Even though Meta has also had a successful 2024 so far, I think it's poised for more upside to end the year.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is a backdoor way to play AI investing. TSMC is behind many of the chips powering the AI technological wave. It's also a major supplier for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which may see a boost thanks to its new AI technology requiring new-generation phones.\n\nAdditionally, Taiwan Semi's 3 nanometer chip production is ramping up, which will drive increased revenue for the business. Next-generation 2nm chips are slated to start production sometime in 2025, and the hype leading up to the launch could drive TSMC's stock higher.\n\nAlthough the stock is a bit pricey at 29 times forward earnings, I think it could go higher as the demand for AI-related chips picks up.\n\nStory continues\n\n4. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is often called the Amazon of Latin America due to its e-commerce business and logistics network. However, it also has a thriving fintech wing. MercadoLibre's business has been on fire lately, with its Q1 results delivering 94% year-over-year revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis.\n\nMercadoLibre's profit margins have also been ticking up. In Q1 2023, it was 6.3%. In 2024, that figure rose to 7.9%. As MercadoLibre's margins continue to rise, its valuation will start to normalize, but until then, using a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is smarter. MELI PS Ratio Chart\n\nAt 5.5 times sales, MercadoLibre is still well below where it has traded for most of the past decade. If the market wakes up and realizes this, MercadoLibre stock could easily rocket higher to end the year.\n\n5. Salesforce\n\nLastly is Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). Salesforce is the leader in the customer relationship management software space but hit a bump with its earnings report for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2025 (ended April 30). Although it kept its full-year revenue guidance at the same level (8% to 9% growth), its Q2 growth is only expected to be between 7% and 8%.\n\nThat's slower than investors want to see, and the stock got shelled because of it, losing about 20% of its value the following trading day. That's a massive overreaction, considering that the full-year guidance stayed the same. While the stock has partially recovered since that tumble, Salesforce still looks attractive because its profit margins have room for expansion.\n\nThis is reflected in Salesforce's guidance for operating cash flow growth of 21% to 24% for the full year. Although it's not as cheap as it once was, Salesforce still makes for an excellent buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: After Nvidia's Stock Split, These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Companies Could Be Next",
        "content": "Stock splits seem to be all the rage. After years of the step seeing less traction, 2024 already served up a slew of high-profile splits.\n\nThe biggest, no doubt, was Nvidia, the poster child of the current artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Some big names joined the split club, like the rapidly growing Broadcom.\n\nWhy split a stock? It helps open the door for smaller investors who are locked out of buying shares due to a steep price tag. On average, post-split stocks tend to perform well, but it's not a guarantee.   It could just be that splits tend to happen with stocks that already have positive momentum.\n\nYou might be curious, which company is next? I don't have a crystal ball, unfortunately, but here are my three picks for which companies it could be.\n\n1. Meta\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is emerging as one of the strongest AI plays. It has a massive amount of engaged daily users -- 3.2 billion by the company's count. This number is up 7% year over year across its different platforms, which stand to benefit greatly from the tools the company collectively calls Meta AI.\n\nThe company saw its earnings per share (EPS) more than double last quarter, compared to the year before. This came with a nearly 30% jump in revenue and a huge bump in operating margin. The company also cut 10% of its staff this year.\n\nThis success drove its share price up 83% since last year. Now hovering above $500, it's the most expensive stock of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nMeta has never split its stock since it's been on the market. It seems ripe for a split.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) went on a tear this year with a year-to-date gain that would make Nvidia blush. The semiconductor company also designs and manufactures hardware critical for AI but arguably has a more diversified revenue stream than Nvidia.\n\nThe two actually work together. Supermicro uses Nvidia's chips in its data center servers.\n\nSupermicro has a lot of growth ahead. Of course, predicting the future is always difficult, but consensus estimates put the company's 2024 EPS growth at more than 100% from last year.\n\nSupermicro's shares are already expensive, trading near $900. If these estimates hold true, this company could easily be trading at a significantly higher price. It seems likely a split is coming for SMCI, as well.\n\n3. Netflix\n\nCalling Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) an AI company might be a stretch. They do make shows about AI -- if you haven't watched Black Mirror, please do -- but that hardly seems to qualify.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has actually employed AI for a while, or at least machine learning, the technology at the core of AI. Every large language model (LLM) you see on the market, like ChatGPT, is based on machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe algorithms Netflix employs learn what you like and what you don't. Based on this, they provide you recommendations. The more you use it, the better it gets. The company helped pioneer this feature that's now standard across all streaming platforms.\n\nNetflix leads the streaming pack with more than 260 million subscribers. That's a lot of eyeballs that make the service valuable. The company is capitalizing on this, instituting new programs to raise revenue. It seems to be working as consensus estimates put this year's earnings-per-share (EPS) growth at roughly 40% year over year.\n\nNetflix stock is trading at nearly $700. That's already at a level that could benefit from a stock split. That may well be what happens, but only time will tell.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Stocks That Could Join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia in the $3 Trillion Club",
        "content": "The U.S. Senate is sometimes called \"the most exclusive club.\" However, I can think of a club that's much more exclusive than the legislative body, which has 100 members. It's the $3 trillion club.\n\nOnly three companies in the world boast market caps of $3 trillion or more: Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. But this club might be a little less exclusive in the not-too-distant future. Here are three unstoppable stocks that could join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia in the $3 trillion club.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is in the driver's seat to become the next $3 trillion company. The Google parent's market cap currently stands at around $2.3 trillion. At the rate the stock is climbing, it's not out of the question that Alphabet could join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia by early 2025.\n\nMost of Alphabet's revenue and profits continue to be generated by its Google Search business. While some have predicted the rise of generative AI presents an existential threat to search engines, Google has thrived. CEO Sundar Pichai noted in Alphabet's first-quarter earnings call that Google's new AI overviews have increased search usage and user satisfaction with search results.\n\nGoogle Cloud should enjoy a strong tailwind from AI for years to come. The unit's sales jumped 28% year over year in Q1 with operating income soaring 371%. Google Cloud is especially popular with generative AI start-ups, with more than 60% using its cloud service.\n\nYouTube is another key growth driver for the company. It's the leader in U.S. streaming with viewers watching over 1 billion hours of content daily. YouTube now has over 100 million music and premium service subscribers, while YouTube TV claims over 8 million paid subscribers.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't too far behind Alphabet, with a market cap hovering around $2 trillion. I fully expect the e-commerce and cloud services giant will also take a spot in the $3 trillion club within the next two or three years.\n\nLike Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS) should deliver strong growth in the years ahead thanks to the demand for building and deploying AI models. AWS is the leader in the cloud services market. I suspect it will stay on top because of the appeal of new products such as AI-powered software development assistant Q.\n\nAmazon dominates the e-commerce market. Cost improvements in the company's e-commerce platform and distribution network have helped to boost profitability. As Amazon increases delivery speed further, its e-commerce revenue and profits should grow as customers shop online more frequently.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvertising is also an important growth engine for Amazon. In Q1, advertising sales soared 24% year over year on a constant-currency basis. This growth could increase in the future as advertising on Prime Video gains momentum.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has a steeper hill to climb to join the $3 trillion club. The social media leader's market cap of $1.3 trillion is well below the market caps of Alphabet and Amazon. However, I think it's only a matter of time before Meta reaches the $3 trillion threshold.\n\nThe company is an advertising juggernaut. Its apps, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, reach more than 3.2 billion people across the world every day. Advertisers can' ignore such a massive audience.\n\nMeta's efforts to more efficiently monetize its products, especially Reels, are paying off handsomely. Profits more than doubled year over year in Q1. The company continues to get better and better at showing ads to the right person at the right time.\n\nAI presents a major growth opportunity for Meta. In particular, CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that AI-powered business messaging will be the \"next major pillar\" of the company's business.\n\nShould you buy these future members of the $3 trillion club?\n\nYou might think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are no-brainer stocks to buy if they're truly on track to join the $3 trillion club. And you'd be right, in my view.\n\nAll three stocks have tremendous growth prospects. The growth drivers already mentioned don't even tell the full story. For example, robotaxis could be huge opportunities for Alphabet's Waymo and Amazon's Zoox units. Meta could be a bigger winner in virtual reality and the metaverse. I think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are great stocks to buy and hold.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "The Best Stocks to Invest $1,000 In Right Now",
        "content": "The stock market soared in the first half of the year, with the S&P 500 confirming a bull market as it reached a record high -- but the benchmark didn't stop there. Instead, it went on to reach additional highs, and technology stocks led the way. Investors have been feeling optimistic for general reasons, such as the possibility of interest rate cuts ahead. And they've also been getting excited about growth companies, in particular those involved in a potentially game-changing technology: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThough the S&P 500's 14% increase in the first half and the gains by many tech stocks might seem like a lot, this positive momentum could be far from over. History shows us that, for the S&P 500, a solid first half often leads to a solid second half. As for AI, we're in the early days of the growth story, with analysts predicting today's $200 billion market will reach beyond $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nAll of this means today it's a great idea to invest in AI stocks that are just getting geared up for growth. Let's check out the best stocks to invest $1,000 in right now. (And with that amount, you can pick up all three of these potential AI winners.) Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Oracle\n\nOracle(NYSE: ORCL) isn't the biggest cloud services provider today, but it's one of the fastest-growing players. The company, once most known for its database strengths, has transitioned to put its focus on cloud infrastructure and services, and this has shown itself to be a wise move.\n\nOver the past two quarters, Oracle signed its biggest sales contracts ever thanks to demand for large language model (LLM) training. This training is a key step in AI because once an LLM is trained, it then can go on to do the critical job of solving complex problems. The company said in recent quarters that AI infrastructure demand has been exceeding supply even as Oracle opens new data centers and expands existing ones.\n\nAll of this has helped cloud infrastructure revenue take off, soaring 42% in the most recent quarter, and the growth in contracts has boosted remaining performance obligations (RPO), or the revenue to be expected from those contracts, by 44% to $98 billion.\n\nConsidering all of this, Oracle stock looks dirt cheap today, trading at 22x forward earnings estimates.\n\n2. Intel\n\nIntel (NASDAQ: INTC) fell behind in the AI race, but that doesn't mean we should turn our backs on this tech giant. The company, a powerhouse in the world of central processing units (the main processor in a computer), has put a new focus on AI and recently announced some exciting new products.\n\nStory continues\n\nAiming to power the era of the AI personal computer, Intel released the Intel Core Ultra mobile processor family. The AI PC, with the ability to smoothly handle AI tasks brings AI into the hands of the general PC user. It's still too early to say whether the product will take off, but if it does Intel should reap the rewards.\n\nIntel also has released its Gaudi 3 accelerator, a chip that has shown 50% better inference than Nvidia's current top-performing chip, H100, and 40% better power efficiency -- and all this at a lower price. Even though Nvidia continues to release better and better chips and should easily maintain its lead, Intel's latest product clearly could carve out market share -- and generate growth for the company.\n\nIntel shares trade for about 31x forward earnings estimates, a very reasonable entry point for this company that's just getting started along its AI growth path.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nYou probably know Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) best for its social media apps Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. But Meta has put a major focus on AI, and as a matter of fact said the technology will be its biggest investment area this year.\n\nWhat is Meta planning? The company aims to develop AI across its products and services and offer AIs that all of us can use for both leisure and professional tasks. The company started by recently launching Meta AI, a new virtual assistant -- as Meta says, this tool can help you with anything from creating a menu from what's in your fridge to preparing for an exam.\n\nMeta is in the investment phase right now, but eventually these efforts should result in revenue growth. It's important to remember that most of Meta's revenue comes from advertising. If we as users spend more time on Meta thanks to its AI tools, advertisers may spend more and more on the platform to reach us.\n\nEven though Meta shares have climbed about 50% this year, the stock only trades for 26x forward earnings estimates -- a bargain considering the company's profitability now and potential AI growth to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $791,929!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "NYU’s Aswath Damodaran Calls Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) One of the Top AI Value Stocks",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Best AI Value Stocks That are ‘Money Machines’ According to NYU’s Aswath Damodaran. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nAswath Damodaran is a Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. His thoughts on economy and stock valuations are given a lot of weight by analysts. Damodaran in his recent interview with CNBC said that Magnificent Seven stocks have become the “value stocks for investors who care about earnings and cash flows.”\n\n“We look at the last year and a half, they’ve added $8.8 trillion in market cap… just these seven companies. Just to give you perspective, the second-largest market in the world, China, has a market cap of $12.1 trillion. These seven stocks alone have added more in market cap than the entire German market, the French market, the Swiss market.”\n\nDamodaran’s comments are important because he’s been repeatedly saying in the past that major technology companies are fully or overvalued. In September, he said on CNBC that if you go through the list of top tech stocks, “you are more likely to be overvalued than undervalued.”\n\nBut in his latest interview, Damodaran said that before we “dismiss” Mag. 7 stocks as “risky tech companies,” we should keep in mind that “these are the money machines in this market.”\n\nHowever, when asked whether he believes we are not in any kind of “danger zone,” the professor said we are in the danger zone not just in terms of these seven stocks, but the market overall.\n\nIn this article we take a look at the Mag 7. stocks and their AI-related growth catalysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Best AI Value Stock That is ‘Money Machine’ According to NYU’s Aswath Damodaran?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\n\nMETA is one of the top names in the Mag. 7 group of stocks which Aswath Damodoran recently called money machine value stocks.\n\nMETA could offset volatility this summer as investors will flock to Mag. 7 stocks in case market begins to waver, according to a latest report by Wolfe Research.\n\nThe social media giant is using AI for optimizing ad targeting and recommendation systems to boost engagement and ads revenue. In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.  However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it’ll bode well for the stock down the road.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta’s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nRGA Investment Advisors stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We believe this section is crucial for highlighting some of the key lessons we have learned since 2022. At the outset, let us clarify that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) remains one of our three largest positions, fluctuating based on daily market movements. As you read this, it might in fact be our largest holding. In the closing remarks of our Q4 2022 commentary, we noted that we had “made…META substantially larger” during the quarter. Never did we expect the stock to generate such substantial returns in a short period of time. Between Mark Zuckerberg’s “Year of Efficiency,” a recovery in the digital ad market and an improving macro backdrop, META’s key multiples recovered to a comfortable level within their long-term ranges:\n\nAlthough these multiples are now back to “normal” levels, they are hardly expensive for a company whose top line growth re-accelerated into the double digits, with operating leverage and despite ongoing heavy investments in the Reality Labs segment. These are the reasons why we continue to hold a large position in META. As for why we did some selling, we want to emphasize a few key points”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer’s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Investing in tech stocks can be a complex task. This is especially true when identifying which companies have the most potential for considerable returns. In 2024, three companies were marked as highly undervalued yet fundamentally solid. These companies are thriving through strategic innovations and solid financial health. Understanding why these tech giants are undervalued and their potential is required to capitalize on emerging AI market trends.\n\nTo begin with, the first company is making headlines with its aggressive investments in AI tech. These are set to revolutionize user engagement across its platforms. Similarly, the second one continues to innovate with its AI-driven creative tools, maintaining impressive revenue growth and solid profitability. Meanwhile, despite a recent revenue dip, the third company is strategically positioned in the semiconductor industry to leverage growth opportunities.\n\nThese companies hold the characteristics of undervalued tech stocks, offering a unique blend of innovation, financial stability and market potential. Here, the focus is on their fundamentals, revealing why they are poised for remarkable growth in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) leads in social media platforms and focuses on advancements in AI tech. The company’s AI advancements, like Llama 3, mark its focus on leading the AI space. Llama 3 includes models with 8 billion, 70 billion and an upcoming 400+ billion parameters, positioning Meta’s AI as best-in-class for its scale. Tens of millions of users have already tried Meta AI, with positive feedback indicating sharp user acceptance and engagement.\n\nMoreover, AI-driven content recommendations have considerably impacted engagement on Meta’s platforms. For instance, 30% of Facebook feed posts and over 50% of Instagram content are now AI-recommended, indicating the edge of AI in enhancing user experience and engagement. Meta’s CapEx was $6.72 billion in Q1 2024, including principal payments on finance leases. Meta expects to increase its CapEx considerably due to its AI focus. It projects $35 to $40 billion for 2024, up from a previous range of $30 to $37 billion. Hence, this indicates Meta’s edge on the required infrastructure for its AI and technological initiatives.\n\nOverall, Meta’s massive investments in AI infrastructure and massive growth potential make it a high mark on undervalued tech stocks.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) leads in creative software such as Photoshop, Illustrator and Creative Cloud suite. The company’s top-line for Q2 2024 was $5.31 billion, showcasing 11% annual growth. This growth indicates the company’s solid business model and sharp market strategies. Revenue growth reflects the company’s ability to enhance its market share and improve its sales performance. Adobe’s EPS was $4.48, representing a 15% annual increase. That highlights Adobe’s solid bottom line and sharp cost management.\n\nFurther, the company’s Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud have attracted diverse users, from individual creators to large enterprises. The integration of AI across these platforms is a game-changer. For instance, Adobe’s Firefly family of creative, generative AI models has derived over 9 billion images since its launch in March 2023. This points to the considerable impact of AI on creative processes. Such innovations enhance the functionality of Adobe’s products and derive higher user engagement and retention.\n\nTo sum up, Adobe’s integration of AI into its products, high user engagement and revenue growth solidify the company’s presence on the undervalued tech stocks list.\n\nAmkor Technology (AMKR) AI.

Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocks. Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmkor Technology (NASDAQ:AMKR) prevails in advanced packaging and semiconductor offerings, which are industry essentials. The company derived Q1 2024 revenue of $1.37 billion, a 7% year-on-year decline in the top line. Despite this decrease, the revenue aligned with expectations, signaling a stabilization after a challenging period. Meanwhile, the company’s EPS stood at 24 cents. It highlights the company’s ability to maintain profitability even during downturns. Amkor considered the first quarter to be the low point for revenue and utilization. The company is projecting sequential growth of 6% in Q2 2024, and the top line may hit $1.40 to $1.50 billion.\n\nMoreover, this forecasted growth aligns with a broader industry recovery. With that, Amkor’s strategic positioning in advanced packaging and semiconductor services places it in a favorable position to capitalize on this upturn. However, improvements in the Android supply chain and NAND memory demand indicate a rebound. The overall projection for smartphone units to increase by low single digits this year, combined with the introduction of AI in edge devices, points to the demand for Amkor’s advanced packaging solutions.\n\nTo conclude, Amkor Technology’s strategic positioning and forecasted recovery highlight its potency among undervalued tech stocks.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in META.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Buy With $1,000 and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Don't let Nvidia's raging popularity distract you from the fact that there are many sorts of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to choose from. Companies in industries ranging from chips to software are poised to feel the tailwinds of AI growth over the coming years.\n\nInvestors can position themselves for success by gravitating to bona-fide winners, the cream of the crop that are equipped to stay on top as the AI industry grows and inevitably evolves. Three Fool.com contributors did their homework and came up with Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM), and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). These companies have the competitive edge to win over the long haul -- and their stock can be had for just $1,000.\n\n1. Amazon: Modest valuation makes it appealing\n\nJake Lerch (Amazon): My choice is Amazon. If I'm making a choice today about an AI stock to buy and hold forever, I have to consider valuation. Simply put, AI stocks have been on a wild ride, and some of them are now reaching dangerously high valuation levels.\n\nConsider this chart: NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe three largest companies in the world -- Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia -- are at or near 10-year highs when it comes to their price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. This ratio is important because it captures market sentiment, reflecting investors' expectations of future growth, rather than quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in a company's earnings results, which is what price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios tend to do.\n\nThe takeaway is that many AI stocks are rising to new highs on future expectations of growth, rather than on current sales. However, there are AI companies that are bucking this trend, or at least, they are an example where the size of the increase isn't as large.\n\nHere's the same chart, with Amazon's P/S ratio included. NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nWith a current P/S ratio of 3.6x, Amazon's valuation is a fraction of Nvidia's (41.8x); it's also much lower than Microsoft's (14.6x) or Apple's (9.4x). Importantly, Amazon's current P/S ratio is roughly equal to its 10-year average of 3.2x, indicating a stable valuation over time.\n\nIn other words, while some of its major competitors' stocks have gotten ahead of themselves during the AI boom, Amazon stock still looks highly attractive.\n\nOn top of that, the company has numerous AI initiatives ranging from smart speakers to its fleet of nearly 1 million humanoid robots. These initiatives, coupled with Amazon's strong financial position, show it is well-positioned to capitalize on the AI revolution and potentially experience significant growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn summary, investors seeking an AI stock to buy and hold forever should strongly consider Amazon.\n\n2. Qualcomm: Build a connection with this stock\n\nWill Healy(Qualcomm): Over the last year, investors have become focused on AI chips. However, just because Nvidia leads the industry does not mean it is the only player. With an increased focus on AI, investors may have more reasons to consider Qualcomm a forever holding.\n\nQualcomm has long served as the leader in smartphone chipsets, and maintaining that leadership in today's market means proficiency in AI. Fortunately, the company has embraced on-device AI. This works collaboratively with cloud AI and its devices, which reside on the edge. Thus, it can deliver AI capabilities faster and more efficiently.\n\nMoreover, Qualcomm does not limit these capabilities to smartphones. In recent years, the company has worked to deliver its technology to IoT devices, automotive platforms, and PC chips, amounting to a tech ecosystem powered by AI.\n\nAdditionally, after a revenue slump in fiscal 2023, Qualcomm has finally begun to rebound. In the first six months of fiscal 2024 (ended March 24), revenue of $19 billion rose 3% compared with the same period in the previous year.\n\nAlso, total costs and expenses fell 1%, leading to a net income of $5.1 billion in the first half of the fiscal year. That represents a 29% increase from year-ago levels. Also, since Qualcomm forecasts $9.2 billion in revenue at the midpoint in fiscal Q3, its revenue growth rate could reach double digits in the next quarter.\n\nInvestors have paid increased attention, as the semiconductor stock has risen by approximately 80% over the last year. That took its P/E ratio to around 28, its highest level in over three years.\n\nNonetheless, assuming double-digit revenue growth returns, rising profits should reduce the impact of its rising valuation. Ultimately, improving financials, coupled with Qualcomm's increasing importance in the AI space, should solidify its stock as a profitable long-term holding.\n\n3. Meta Platforms: AI is complementary\n\nJustin Pope (Meta Platforms): While searching for the ultimate buy-and-hold AI stock, Meta Platforms kept rising to the top of my list. The pitch for Meta stock is simple but effective. The company is already a clear technology juggernaut today. It makes money on digital ads served to its 3.24 billion daily active users across its social media apps: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads.\n\nIt's a lucrative business; Meta converts a robust 35% of its revenue into free cash flow and earns an impressive 29% return on the capital it invests in the business.\n\nMeta still offers plenty of growth despite its $1.3 trillion market cap. Analysts believe the company will grow earnings by an average of 18% annually over the long term. AI could play a big role in that. Meta has unleashed AI to improve its advertising business and boost profits.\n\nAdditionally, the company has invested heavily in AI infrastructure, spending billions of dollars to develop and run generative AI models.\n\nThe great thing about Meta is that AI won't make or break the stock. AI could unlock the growth needed for Meta to remain a long-term market-beater, but it was already a great business before AI. Meta's CEO and co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, is still in charge, and he's just 40 years old. You can buy and hold Meta, knowing the company is in good hands for the foreseeable future.\n\nLastly, the stock remains attractive at a P/E ratio of 26 times earnings, a very reasonable price for a business growing earnings by 18% annually. Many other AI stocks have gotten too expensive, meaning Meta could perform much better if it realizes its AI potential.\n\nThis ultimately makes Meta a no-brainer AI stock investors should buy and hold tight.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has triggered a multi-year investment cycle across the enterprise. Additionally, generative AI is now permeating various consumer internet applications. These trends bode well for AI wealth-building stocks.\n\nIn Q1 of fiscal year 2024, a huge moment of clarity appeared on AI spending as cloud service providers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) increased their capital expenditure plans. Indeed, it was a stark reminder of the heavy investment needed to make AI applications and products a reality. Bank of America projects capex for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon will increase by $37 billion in 2024 to $145 billion.\n\nMoreover, according to Capital Group, big tech giants are raising their capital expenditure budgets and will spend an estimated $500 billion over the next three years. This spending will go toward chips, particularly graphics processing units (GPUs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Plus, a substantial proportion will cover memory, servers and network equipment. This means more profits will flow to these three AI wealth-building stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nCustom ASICs have emerged as an alternative to Nvidia’s H100 and B200 GPUs. After Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is the second-largest player in this fast-growing high-end market, with a 13-15% share.\n\nJPMorgan analysts are bullish on Marvell Technology as one of the AI wealth-building stocks to buy. They forecast that the high-end ASIC market will grow to between $20 and $30 billion. Additionally, due to demand from generative AI, this market will grow at a 20% compounded annual growth rate.\n\nBuoyed by this growth, the company’s AI revenues could skyrocket. Notably, the chip maker is working with various big tech companies on custom silicon. It has been collaborating with Google on its 5-nanometer Axion ARM CPU chip and Amazon on its 5-nanometer Tranium chip. Additionally, rumors are buzzing that it’s working with Microsoft on its Maia chip and Amazon on its Inferentia chip.\n\nConsidering these tailwinds, JPMorgan analysts think MRVL could generate $1.6 to $1.8 billion in revenues from networking and custom ASICs this year. Moreover, they expect AI revenues to double next year. Additionally, most analysts are extremely bullish, with 28 buy ratings and a median price target of $90, representing over 20% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter a 10% pullback, it is time to buy Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). The memory maker is among the best-positioned AI wealth-building stocks due to its high bandwidth memory (HBM). Importantly, HBM memory reduces bottlenecks, increasing training efficiency for large language models.\n\nAlthough Micron Technology tumbled after Q3 of FY 2024 earnings, the results were stellar. The company blew past estimates, reporting revenues of $6.81 billion for the third quarter against estimates of $6.67 billion. Data center drove the strength as AI demand led to 50% quarter-over-quarter (QOQ) growth in the segment. Furthermore, the company grew its share in high-margin AI products such as data center solid-state drives and HBM.\n\nAnother impressive highlight was the company disclosing that HBM chips were sold out for 2024 and 2025. Due to robust demand, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sanjay Mehrotra noted in Q3 prepared remarks that Micron Technology was on track for record FY 2024 revenues. Besides, he expects this momentum to carry over into FY 2025.\n\nIndeed, MU is set for a banner FY 2025 due to AI demand, making it one of the top AI wealth-building stocks. Moreover, an ongoing shift from commoditized memory to high-margin AI products will boost profitability.\n\nASML Holding N.Y. (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nAs demand for AI accelerates, semiconductor foundries and integrated device manufacturers are scrambling to increase capacity. This ramp-up spells opportunity for ASML Holding N.Y. (NASDAQ:ASML), the maker of EUV machines used to manufacture chips.\n\nSeveral reasons prevail for maintaining a bullish stance on ASML. First, AI-related revenue is soaring due to memory demand driven by advanced memories such as HBM and DDR5. As a result, the semiconductor equipment maker is seeing increasing orders from memory makers like Micron Technology.\n\nSecondly, the firm benefits from increased subsidies and grants to the semiconductor sector. Due to incentives and grants from laws such as the CHIPS and Science Act, chip manufacturers are opening new facilities. For instance, Micron Technology is constructing new fabs in New York and Idaho. In line with this expansion, it will spend $8 billion of capex in 2024 and increase it to a mid-30s percentage of revenue in 2025.\n\nThe outlook for ASML is very positive. Almost every foundry and integrated device maker is constructing new chip manufacturing facilities. Companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Samsung Electronics and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have broken ground on new projects in the U.S. and Europe. These facilities will be filled with ASML equipment, making the stock a top buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Buying stocks and holding onto them in the long run can lead you to financial security. You don’t have to pay special attention to price fluctuations or use technical analysis to find short-term opportunities. Investors who beat the market aren’t necessarily spending more time in their portfolios than day traders. It’s also common for investors to prioritize fundamental analysis for long-term performance. Thus, many investors are seeking compounding stocks to secure their futures.\n\nFundamental analysis focuses on a  company’s earnings, growth opportunities, advantages over competitors, and other components of the underlying company. Stocks can compound if you just hold onto them instead of trying to time the market. Time in the market is often a better strategy than timing the market.\n\nInvestors can choose from many stocks, but some growth stocks are better than others. Knowing your risk tolerance and long-term financial goals can help you make better investments and steer away from speculative picks. Want a head start with some stock ideas to consider? These are some of the top stocks to buy for long-term gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been a top performer for several years. The global advertising leader is up by 34% year-to-date and has gained 231% over the past five years. Alphabet trades at a 29 P/E ratio and offers a 0.43% yield. Although the dividend yield is low, investors should expect Alphabet to maintain a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years.\n\nThe tech giant shook off early AI mishaps with a resounding first quarter. Revenue increased by 15% year-over-year to reach $80.5 billion. Net income jumped by 57% year-over-year and came to $23.7 billion. Alphabet secured a 29.4% net profit margin to close out the quarter.\n\nWhile advertising is still the main revenue driver, Google Cloud is gaining market share. Google Cloud brought up $9.57 billion in revenue and netted $900 million in operating income. Alphabet continues to trim its workforce and seems to be following in Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) footsteps. That’s part of the reason profit margins and net income surged in the first quarter. You can see why this made our list of the top compounding stocks.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) amazon (AMZN) sign with dark background\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has more than doubled over the past five years and is already up by 32% year-to-date. The Magnificent Seven stock offers exposure to numerous verticals. The company’s online marketplace is the biggest draw and contributes to the majority of Amazon’s revenue. Sales from the marketplace helped Amazon report 13% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. The company achieved double-digit growth rates for domestic and international sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is also positioning itself to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom. Rising revenue for Amazon Web Services demonstrates the company is gaining market share. AWS sales jumped by 17% year-over-year. Amazon saw big gains across several segments, such as streaming, groceries, and advertising.\n\nWall STreet analysts are bullish on Amazon stock and have rated it as a Strong Buy. The stock has a projected 12% upside based on the average price target. However, some analysts are more optimistic. The highest price target of $246 per share suggests that Amazon can gain an additional 24% from current levels. This is easily one of the top compounding stocks.\n\nCintas (CTAS) an empty restaurant dining room\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) has more than one million small businesses as its customers. The company offers business supplies and safety equipments which result in steady revenue for the company. Cintas has almost tripled over the past five years and is up by 19% year-to-date.\n\nThe company’s latest earnings report suggests that growth is still strong. Revenue increased by 9.9% year-over-year to reach $2.41 billion. Net income jumped by 22.0% year-over-year to reach $397.6 million. Cintas also offers a 0.77% yield and has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years. The firm recently hiked its dividend by 17.4% last year and will announce another dividend hike shortly.\n\nCintas is currently rated as a Moderate Buy. The highest price target of $765 per share suggests that the stock can gain an additional 9% from current levels. Cintas offers an impressive dividend growth rate and steady gains that have translated into happy long-term investors.

When Meta reinstated him to its network in February 2023, the company also said Trump faced “heightened penalties for repeat offenses,” meaning he could be “suspended for between one month and two years” for any subsequent rules violation. The change announced Friday means that the threat of a harsher penalty has now been removed.\n\n“We believe that the American people should be able to hear from the nominees for president on the same basis,” Meta wrote in an updated blog post on Friday. “As a result, former President Trump, as the nominee of the Republican Party, will no longer be subject to the heightened suspension penalties.” Trump will still be held to Meta’s rules.\n\nTrump is expected to be named the Republican presidential nominee at the party’s convention next week.

        "title": "Amazon Stock (NASDAQ:AMZN): 3 Reasons Why I’m Bullish",
        "content": "Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) went public 30 years ago and is among the largest companies in the world. Valued at $2 trillion by market cap, the e-commerce giant has returned more than 160,000% to shareholders since its IPO (initial public offering) in 1997. Despite its outsized gains, I remain bullish on Amazon due to its expanding addressable market, expanding profit margins, and growing advertising business.\n\nAn Overview of Amazon\n\nToday, Amazon is a household name and has a presence in most global markets. It sells consumer products, online ads, and subscription services through online and physical stores. In the last 12 months, Amazon reported revenue of $590.74 billion, up from $280.52 billion in 2019.\n\nAmazon Is Firing on All Cylinders\n\nAmazon has a sizeable presence in several growth markets that include e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and online streaming. In Q1 of 2024, its Online Store segment increased its revenue by 7% year-over-year to $54.7 billion, accounting for 38% of sales.\n\nAccording to a report from Research and Markets, the global e-commerce market is forecast to expand from $18.98 trillion in 2022 to $47.73 trillion in 2030, indicating an annual growth rate of over 12%.\n\nIts Amazon Web Services business accounts for 17% of sales, and this segment grew by 17% year-over-year in the March quarter. A Statista report forecasts the public cloud market to expand from $631.8 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2029, indicating an annual growth rate of 18.5%.\n\nIn recent years, Amazon’s Advertising Services business has gained significant traction. While it accounts for just 8% of total sales, sales from the segment rose by 24% year-over-year in Q1. A Precedence Research report expects global digital ad spending to rise from $550 billion in 2023 to $1.367 trillion in 2033, indicating annual growth rates of 9.6%.\n\nWe can see that each of Amazon’s business segments is positioned to grow at a steady pace in the upcoming decade, making the tech giant an enticing investment option right now.\n\nAmazon’s Expanding Margins\n\nSimilar to most other companies, Amazon has focused on lowering its cost base to tide over an uncertain and soft macro environment. Since Q4 of 2022, it has eliminated more than 27,000 jobs, allowing it to improve profit margins significantly. In the last 18 months, Amazon has lowered its technology and infrastructure costs as well as sales and marketing expenses, shoring up its bottom line.\n\nIn the last 12 months, Amazon reported free cash flow of $50.15 billion compared to a free cash outflow of $3.31 billion in the year-ago period. Further, it expects profit margins to improve in Q2 of 2024, although at a far more measured pace.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon expects operating income to range between $10 billion and $14 billion in Q2 compared to the year-ago figure of $7.7 billion. Comparatively, it expects revenue between $144 billion and $149 billion, indicating year-over-year growth between 7% and 11%.\n\nHistorically, Amazon has sacrificed profitability for growth. In fact, it reported several quarters of operating losses before reporting consistent profits in the last decade. Currently, Amazon is experiencing strong growth in sales and earnings due to economies of scale, a competitive moat, and its leadership position.\n\nAd Sales Will be a Key Driver\n\nAmazon owns and operates the third-largest digital ad business after Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Due to higher customer purchase intent, Amazon’s ad business should attract a higher share of corporate marketing spend amid sluggish consumer demand.\n\nAmazon attributed its strong digital ad performance to sponsored products, which benefited from improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. It expects sponsored products to drive demand going forward while growing new verticals such as Prime Video ads.\n\nIn the last three years, Amazon’s ad business has grown from $6.4 billion in Q1 of 2021 to $11.8 billion in Q1 of 2024. Its ad business grew at a much higher pace compared to peers Alphabet and Meta. Moreover, this segment is a high-margin one and should be a key driver of revenue and profitability through 2030.\n\nIs Amazon Stock Undervalued?\n\nWall Street expects Amazon to report an adjusted earnings per share of $4.54 in 2024, up from $2.90 per share in 2023. So, AMZN stock is priced at 44x forward earnings, which is steep, given that the sector median multiple is far lower at 15x. Alternatively, Amazon is growing at a far higher pace, so a premium multiple is justified.\n\nIs Amazon Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nEach of the 42 analysts covering Amazon stock has a Buy rating, indicating a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average AMZN stock price target is $222.45, indicating upside potential of 11.5% from current levels.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nTwo years ago, Amazon stock was pummelled due to its slowing growth and unattractive profit margins. Today, it is one of the fastest-growing mega-cap stocks on the planet, driving its share price toward all-time highs. In my view, its expanding addressable market and improving bottom line make it a top investment choice for investors in July 2024.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Shares of This Well-Known Stock",
        "content": "After an ugly performance in 2022, Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) stock has rebounded. It soared by 85% over the past 12 months and is now trading near the all-time high it set this month. But during that period, Meta's insiders sold more shares than they bought.\n\nA growing list of prolific billionaires -- including Steven Cohen, Andreas Halvorsen, Lee Ainslie, Ken Griffin, Jonathan Soros, David Tepper, and Meta's own co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg -- have also been cashing out of the high-flying stock.\n\nBy the end of the first quarter of 2024, when Meta was still trading at an average price of $446.07, Cohen and Soros had sold all of their shares while Halvorsen and Ainslie liquidated more than half of their shares. Does that cooling insider and institutional sentiment suggest it's time for retail investors to back away from Meta? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy did Meta's stock surge to a record high?\n\nMeta's revenue and earnings declined 1% and 38% year over year, respectively, in 2022. That deceleration was caused by three challenges: Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iOS update, which enhanced user privacy and made it harder to target ads based on third-party data; competition from ByteDance's TikTok; and macroeconomic headwinds for the digital advertising market.\n\nAs Meta's ad sales slowed, it ramped up its spending on its unprofitable Reality Labs segment, which houses its virtual reality and augmented reality devices and its metaverse initiatives.\n\nThat mix of slowing sales and rising expenses sent Meta's stock plunging to a seven-year low of $88.09 on Nov. 4, 2022. However, the stock has soared by more than 500% since that day.\n\nThe bulls rushed back as Meta's revenue growth accelerated again. In 2023, its revenue and earnings grew 16% and 73%, respectively. Its advertising business recovered as it countered Apple's changes by mining more first-party data with AI tools, it attracted more spending from Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies that wanted to reach overseas customers, and it expanded its Reels short videos to keep pace with TikTok. Meta remained committed to expanding its Reality Labs unit, but it laid off thousands of employees to expand its operating margins again.\n\nFor 2024, the consensus expectations of analysts are that Meta's revenue will grow by 18% and its earnings will increase by 36% as its core advertising business grows and gains new users. In the first quarter of 2024, 3.24 billion people used at least one of its family of apps (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp) daily -- up 7% from a year earlier. A proposed ban on TikTok in the U.S. -- which is set to take effect next January unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, sells it -- could drive even more users back to its apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy would Meta's big investors take profits?\n\nMeta launched a new $50 billion stock buyback plan and initiated its first dividend this year, and its stock still looks reasonably valued at 27 times forward earnings. Yet, three unpredictable challenges might throttle its near-term growth.\n\nFirst, Chinese advertisers accounted for 10% of its top line in 2023 and drove 5 percentage points of its total revenue growth. During Meta's first-quarter conference call, CFO Susan Li warned investors it would be \"lapping periods of increasingly strong demand\" from those advertisers in 2024.\n\nSecond, Meta stopped disclosing Facebook's total number of monthly and daily active users, as well as the monthly user count for its family of apps. Those changes suggest Facebook's growth is still cooling off as it saturates the global market. Its growth slowdown could worsen if TikTok dodges a U.S. ban.\n\nLastly, Meta slightly raised the outlook for its full-year expenses last quarter to account for \"higher infrastructure and legal costs\" related to the expansion of its AI services, investments in its Reality Labs segment, and tougher \"legal and regulatory headwinds.\"\n\nThose challenges could cause Meta to miss analysts' estimates over the next few quarters. Persistent macroeconomic headwinds could also keep interest rates elevated and compress the valuations of Meta and other tech stocks. In light of these risks, it's understandable that some big investors might think this is the right time to take some profits.\n\nBut should you follow their lead?\n\nIt isn't surprising to see some billionaire investors trim their stake in Meta after its massive gains since late 2022, but I don't think it makes sense for most long-term investors to follow their lead and dump the stock right now. Meta's stock has already rallied about 19% from its average trading price in the first quarter and risen another 9% since the end of March, and I believe its strengths still outweigh its weaknesses.\n\nMeta's apps are already used by 40% of the world's population, and it still has plenty of ways to expand its ecosystem and widen its moat against other advertising platforms. Its stock might waver over the next few quarters, but I'm confident it will head higher over the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "Blue-chip stocks tend to carry less risk than micro-cap stocks. Investing in established corporations with vast moats and plenty of recognition can lead to steady gains in the long run.\n\nSome household names are better than others, and investors can find several opportunities that feature undervalued blue-chip stocks. These stocks offer a higher margin of safety than most publicly traded corporations. Furthermore, each of these companies is still displaying solid growth numbers. These aren’t companies that have high yields and limited upside. Each undervalued blue-chip stock on this list has the potential to outperform the S&P 500.\n\nInvestors should look for companies that deliver rising revenue and solid net profit margins. Dividends are a nice bonus but are not required for good investments. Luckily, each of the undervalued blue-chip stocks on this list has a dividend, so you’ll receive cash flow just for holding onto your shares. Wondering which blue-chip stocks present buying opportunities? These are some of the top picks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been crushing the stock market. Shares are up by 52% year-to-date and have gained 162% over the past five years. Despite the impressive rally, Meta Platforms only trades at a 29 P/E ratio.\n\nThe company has done wonders in improving its profit margins. Net income more than doubled year-over-year (YOY) in the first quarter, but that didn’t come at the cost of revenue growth. Meta Platforms improved its top line by 27% YOY. The social media giant reduced its headcount by 10% YOY while achieving those results.\n\nMeta Platforms makes most of its revenue from ads, and the company demonstrates solid growth in this area. Ad impressions increased by 20% YOY, while the average price per ad jumped by 6% YOY. META also closed the quarter with 3.24 billion daily active users, a 7% YOY increase. More advertisers are using the platform and have more people who can see their ads. That translates into big profits for Meta Platforms and its shareholders.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) trades at an even lower P/E ratio than Meta Platforms. Investors can accumulate AXP stock at a 19 P/E ratio. The fintech firm also offers a 1.17% yield. Shares are up by 28% year-to-date and have gained 86% over the past five years.\n\nThe credit and debit card issuer has double-digit profit margins and is winning over younger generations. Investors saw those catalysts unfold in the latest quarter. American Express reported 11% YOY revenue growth in Q1 2024. Net income jumped by 34% YOY. The company remains on track to achieve 9% to 11% YOY revenue growth and EPS growth in the mid-teens beyond 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmerican Express has maintained a high dividend growth rate for several years, including a 17% dividend hike earlier this year. Wall Street analysts have rated the stock as a Moderate Buy. The highest price target of $285 per share suggests the stock can gain an additional 19% from current levels.\n\nWalmart (WMT) An image of a Canoo, Inc. (GOEV) Walmart electric delivery vehicle\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) has been offering cheaper prices on a wide range of goods and services for more than 60 years. The Arkansas-based company has endured many economic cycles while delivering solid returns for its investors. Shares are up 34% year-to-date and have gained 84% over the past five years. Walmart offers a 1.18% yield, and the company raised its dividend by 9% earlier this year. That’s the highest growth rate in more than a decade.\n\nEarnings continue to look strong as the company posted 6.0% YOY revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Global e-commerce and advertising sales were big winners, up 21% and 24% YOY, respectively. Walmart also reported a 22.4% YOY improvement in its adjusted earnings per share.\n\nThe stock has received an average price target that implies a 5% upside. The highest price target of $81 per share suggests Walmart can rally by an additional 15%. Walmart is currently rated as a Strong Buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 A-Rated Growth Stocks to Grab Now",
        "content": "One of the most important factors for investors to consider is growth. But how does one easily identify which companies are doing the best job growing? My solution is to look to the Portfolio Grader for A-rated growth stocks.\n\nWhile it’s great that a stock is seeing gains over the last few weeks or months, growth is the name of the game, a fundamental aspect of success and sustainability. Companies that are seeing growth are more likely to remain strong and be long-term investments.\n\nCompanies need growth to scale and improve efficiency. If you’re a car manufacturer and selling 30 cars per month, you’re absorbing a lot of overhead to make those vehicles – and you’re likely not turning a profit. But if you’re making 3,000 vehicles, your per-unit costs go way down. That’s how companies become profitable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGrowth enables a company to expand its market share. By increasing sales and acquiring new customers, companies become stronger and eventually, with enough growth, becomes a leader in their industries.\n\nI’ve selected several A-rated growth stocks to review, based on their outstanding overall grades in the Portfolio Grader. The Portfolio Grader considers a variety of factors, including growth, earnings performance, analyst sentiment and momentum. So, A-rated stocks are the strongest overall companies in the market.\n\nBut what makes these A-rated growth stocks stand out today is that all the companies we’re going to consider also get either an “A” or a “B” grade in the Portfolio Grader for growth.\n\nYou can expect each of these A-rated growth stocks to continue to perform, because the companies they represent are successfully expanding – and you can see it in the bottom line.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) may be the most compelling stock in the market. As the maker of powerful graphics processing units that are used to power top-line artificial intelligence programs, Nvidia stock soared to previously unimaginable heights. The stock is up 220% over the last 12 months and 170% so far this year.\n\nBut interestingly, Nvidia seems to be on a bit of a break. Since June 18, the stock is up only 3%, raising concerns from some nervous investors that we may finally be nearing a top.\n\nNonsense.\n\nI think it’s more likely that this is just part of the Wall Street summer doldrums – when the market sees less activity from Memorial Day to Labor day. But remember that Nvidia’s next earnings release is scheduled for Aug. 21, so this hiatus will surely come to an end sooner rather than later.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdjusted earnings for Nvidia were up 461% in the most recently reported quarter. And since earnings are far outpacing the stock’s growth, Nvidia stock is getting cheaper every day on a valuation basis, which makes it among the A-rated growth stocks you need in your portfolio.\n\nNVDA stock gets “A” ratings for both growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) Google headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nSource: achinthamb / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL), is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo. It’s responsible for the Chome search engine and Android smartphones. Alphabet is a powerhouse that’s taken its rightful place, as has Nvidia, as a Magnificent 7 stock.\n\nSo then, why is the CEO selling shares?\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly sold 22,500 Alphabet shares on June 20, raising some investor eyebrows. I wrote about it recently for InvestorPlace, and as I said then, Pichai still has 227,000 shares of GOOG stock, so I’m not concerned at all. In fact, this is more of a position-trimming move than anything else.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to be bullish about Alphabet, including its massive position in internet search and the dominance of the Chrome browser. Alphabet brought in $80.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 15% from a year ago. Its operating income was up 32% to $25.4 billion.\n\nGOOG stock is up 36% in 2024. It gets a “B” rating for growth and an “A” overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis is the third and last Magnificent 7 stock we’ll talk about today. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the operator of the powerful social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Reels.\n\nFamously founded by Mark Zuckerburg and friends at Harvard University, Meta is powerful because it encourages users to connect with friends and family and make new connections.\n\nPeople who use Facebook and Instagram willingly share their likes and dislikes, where they’ve been and what they plan to do – and that’s all information that Meta can use to sell to advertisers.\n\nMeta Platforms’ advertising platforms are powerful, there’s no doubt. With all the personal information in Meta’s databases, advertisers can make extremely targeted advertising campaigns.\n\nThat’s why Meta brought in $36.4 billion in advertising revenue in the first quarter, making up roughly 98% of its total revenue. Advertising dollars were up 23% from a year ago, making this one of the A-rated growth stocks to keep your eyes on.\n\nI’m expecting that trend to continue and META stock to pop again when the company reports earnings on July 31. For now, Meta stock is up 51% in 2024, and its gets “A” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle restaurant store exterior sign and storefront. CMG stock\n\nSource: Robert V Schwemmer / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s not too often you see a company with a 50-to-1 stock split, as Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) executed this summer. But I like it because it’s a sign of management that is very deliberate in its actions.\n\nChipotle stock topped $3,200 per share – an enormous number – before its June 25 split, making it one of the biggest in the history of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe split makes the stock more accessible and attractive to retail investors as well as employees who want to participate in the company’s stock purchase plan – it was a good move all around.\n\nI also see the move as part of the company’s culture. Remember, this is a restaurant stock with more than 3,400 locations, but no franchises. Chipotle maintains ownership of every location because it’s the only way it can ensure company quality and standards.\n\nChipotle also famously doesn’t have any freezers in its locations, which means that the ingredients for its burritos, salads and burrito bowls must always be made fresh.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $2.7 billion, up 14.1% from a year ago. Comparable restaurant sales were up 7% and operating margins rose from 15.5% to 16.3%. The company is reporting second-quarter earnings on July 24.\n\nCMG stock is up 27% in 2024. It gets a “B” rating for growth and an “A” overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) isn’t part of the Magnificent 7. But if the list ever expands to eight or 10 stocks, it might be difficult to keep Supermicro off the list.\n\nSupermicro makes the server infrastructure that is needed by companies that are buying up all the Nvidia GPUs to build large language models and other generative AI products. Supermicro can provide custom server architecture solutions to bundle those GPUs and allow them to work together.\n\nSupermicro is reportedly providing and assembling half of the racks AI-supercomputer racks that xAI, the artificial intelligence startup operated by Elon Musk, is creating to develop an AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\n\nThe company is seeing massive growth, with sales of $3.85 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, up from $1.28 billion a year ago. Net income of $402 million was up from $86 million a year ago.\n\nAnd don’t be surprised if there’s another SMCI catalyst next week. Typically, Supermicro pre-announces between 18 and 24 days after the end of the quarter, so that could be as early as next week. Should the company provide evidence of another blowout quarter and/or dazzling guidance, SMCI stock will surely jump.\n\nSMCI stock is up 216% in 2024. It gets “A” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a computer security company that uses AI and machine learning to stop threats in real time. Its cloud-native platform that provides endpoint protection, cloud workloads, identity and data.\n\nCrowdStrike’s Falcon platform is its primary product, but CrowdStrike also offers modules that companies can use to customize their products.\n\nThe modules, which include things like endpoint security, data security, IT operations, threat intelligence and more, serves as a successful business plan because customers can always start small and add on as they go.\n\nCrowdStrike says 65% of its customers purchase and use at least five modules. Revenue for the company’s first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $921 million, up 33% from a year ago. Subscription revenue was $872.2 million, up 34% from the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nIt also got a boost last month when CWRD stock was added to the S&P 500, which means that exchange-traded funds and other products that track the index are buying CRWD stock.\n\nCrowdStrike stock is up 47% this year. It gets “A” rating for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was famously one of the original FAANG stocks that were considered market darlings before the rise of AI and the Magnificent 7. But Netflix, which is the premiere streaming service, hasn’t really gone away.\n\nIn fact, the stock has only gotten better.\n\nNetflix management made a huge decision when it ended its free password sharing program. Before, the company all but encouraged the practice and password sharing was common between friends, family and partners was common.\n\nBut the company finally acknowledged that it was leaving a lot of money on the table, so the program came to an end. Netflix instituted an $8 monthly charge to any account that was sharing a password with someone outside the physical household. And now paid memberships are up from 232.6 million a year ago to 269.6 million in the last quarter.\n\nRevenue also grew – up 14.8% to $9.3 billion, and the stock returned to levels not seen since 2015.\n\nNFLX stock is up 39% this year, and gets “A” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had LONG position(s) in NVDA, SMCI and CRWD. Louis Navellier did not have (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had LONG positions in NVDA, SMCI and CRWD.

        "content": "The S&P 500 is currently at roughly 5,500. Big tech companies under the Magnificent Seven moniker have been carrying the stock market for several years, and AI tailwinds suggest that the gains can continue.\n\nThe index is up by roughly 800 points year-to-date, which means it can take a few years before it reaches 7,000. Many top corporations have been expanding their revenue and earnings for several years. Slow and steady wins the race in investing, but some stocks continue to outperform the S&P 500. Discovering these stocks and accumulating their positions can result in sizable returns when the S&P 500 exceeds 7,000.\n\nYou don’t even have to look at individual stocks. The Nasdaq has outperformed the S&P 500 for most years, but there’s a reason. The Nasdaq is more heavily concentrated in tech stocksthan the S&P 500. While tech isn’t the only sector delivering high returns, it’s worth exploring that sector for most of these seven picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background.

The stock has roughly tripled over the past five years and offers a 0.76% yield for investors. Cintas hiked its dividend by 17.4% last year and will announce a new dividend hike in a few months.\n\nThe business safety equipment provider has more than one million businesses as its customers.

Cintas ended up recording $397.6 million in net income that quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nFour Wall Street analysts rate Cintas as a moderate buy.

        "title": "Australia to bring anti-scam law targeting internet giants this year, regulator says",
        "content": "By Byron Kaye\n\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia plans to introduce a law by the end of the year forcing internet companies to proactively stop hosting scams or face hefty fines, the top consumer regulator said on Friday, potentially setting up another showdown with Big Tech.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the treasury department are consulting internet, banking and telecommunications firms about creating a mandatory, enforceable anti-scam code which legally requires them take reasonable steps to protect users, including offering an effective complaint service.\n\nIn Australia, cryptocurrency scam advertisements featuring the face of mining billionaire Andrew Forrest have led to Australians losing millions of dollars, according to Forrest. He is suing Facebook owner Meta over the advertisements in California after saying he was unable to force Meta to take action domestically.\n\nCurrently only telecommunications providers face specific anti-scam regulation in Australia, according to the government. But the amount lost by Australians to scams tripled to A$2.7 billion ($1.8 billion) from 2020 to 2023, in line with global trends, as the pandemic sent more people online.\n\nThat prompted the ACCC to push for new laws making all participating industries accountable. Putting legal liability on internet platforms may create a new point of conflict between Australia and an industry that has typically leaned on U.S. laws, which largely exempt them from responsibility.\n\nAlready, a law designed by the ACCC forcing internet companies to pay media companies licensing fees for links to content has resulted in Meta saying it may block media content on Facebook in Australia.\n\n\"We are hoping to see them being rolled out in the course of this period to the end of this year,\" ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said by phone, referring to mandatory anti-scam codes applying to each industry.\n\n\"We do need, we think, very clear and specific enforceable legal obligations.\"\n\nFailure to comply with the codes would subject companies to fines of A$50 million, three times the benefit gained by wrongdoing or 30% of turnover at the time it took place, the treasury department has said.\n\nThe ACCC is separately suing Meta for what it says is a failure to stop the publication of advertisements for cryptocurrency scams featuring faces of prominent Australians, including Forrest.\n\nMeta is defending the case the ACCC filed in March 2022 and which is still at a pre-trial stage. Cass-Gottlieb said a mandatory code would reduce the need for \"backward-looking\" and time-consuming court enforcement that involved investigation, preparation and resolution of a lawsuit, plus appeals.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta declined to comment on the anti-scam code's timing. The company said in a submission in January it wanted a voluntary code and the planned mandatory code might result in companies prioritising compliance over innovation.\n\n($1 = 1.4793 Australian dollars)\n\n(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Jamie Freed)\n\nView comments",

An unlimited digital world that can accommodate millions of people is a goldmine, as it represents a new market with solvent modern participants. Since the metaverse industry is only in the early stages of its development, buying shares in related companies promises early investment benefits. The field requires many components for its sustainable operation, which expands the list of areas that will gain from the introduction of metaverses.\n\nVirtual reality technologies will play a crucial role in this process, as users need VR headsets and haptic devices. However, infrastructure development also involves computing power providers, chip manufacturers, Internet providers, software and cybersecurity specialists. By 2030, the industry is projected to grow by more than 30% per year.

The connection can be diverse: from the production and sale of chips for this area to the full-scale development of the meta-space. The fund offers diversification so that enthusiasts are more likely to benefit from the growth of undervalued metaverse stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn October-November 2022, the asset price did not exceed $20, while now buyers are willing to pay more than $30. The growth is smooth, without sharp jumps and significant plateau zones, anttracting investors with its stability. Over the past 3 months, FMET has added 11.25% to its value and has risen to the current level of $31.94. The inclusion of top-ranked tech stocks in the index, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), has contributed to the current growth, which may continue in the coming months. Experts predict that the stock will reach the $40 mark and have high expectations for the fund’s future.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) is a giant of the tech industry, and therefore has enough resources to reconfigure its activities to meet the trends. One of the latest such changes is the reformatting of the 2022-2024 period. The decline in the share price below $100 was the result of concerns about aggressive investment in metaverse initiatives. However, after breaking out of the low point in October 2022, the company began a steady growth that continues to this day. The implementation of AI technology and related advances have propelled Meta to unprecedented heights. With a price per share of $534.69, the company exceeds its 2022 figures by five times, but the potential is still not fully unlocked so META is still among the undervalued metaverse stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s focus on artificial intelligence is paying off in the form of more accurate targeted advertising and, consequently, higher ad prices. The latest earnings report exceeded market expectations and confirmed the correctness of the diversification approach. The bullish sentiment around META continues to grow, as does the wave of excitement over the positive impact of AI, which means we can expect new rounds of the company’s development shortly.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nArchitecture, engineering, entertainment, and construction are all areas that require a reliable software provider, and Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ: ADSK) meets this demand. The company with a market capitalization of $53.08 billion has gained a foothold in the market and become an integral part of many high-tech metaverse projects. After the downturn of April-May 2024, Autodesk began to gain momentum, as reflected in its indicators such as the 50-day moving average (+29.12) and the 200-day moving average (+42.99). The latter indicator shows an increase of 21.07%, which characterizes the bullish momentum of the stock. ADSK has not yet caught up with the 52-week high ($279.53), so it remains in the group of undervalued metaverse stocks.\n\nAutodesk prove its ability to manage resources with its latest unaudited financial results, which indicate a return on equity (ROE) of 65.46% and a net margin of 17.66%. Based, the company is a well-thought-out manager of shareholder capital and generates significant profit from its revenue streams. Even though the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the current fiscal year is 53.34, the expected value for the next fiscal year is 24.49, which demonstrates Autodesk’s earnings potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Julia Magas did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks Flashing Danger Signs",
        "content": "Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has been the hottest sector in the stock market. Since OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, it has been a race to develop the best and smartest generative AI platforms. Bloomberg Intelligence issued a report that potentially valued the generative AI industry at $1.3 trillion by 2032. The AI hardware sector has exploded in value with every major tech company scrambling to buy high-powered GPUs. Semiconductor stocks have led the massive Nasdaq and S&P 500 rally over the past year. Over the past twelve months, the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) has gained more than 54%. Yet there could now be newly risky AI stocks.\n\nMany of these AI stocks have become overvalued and diverge from their fundamentals. At their current values, it’s hard to justify chasing them after rallying for over a year. These three AI stocks flash danger signs and should be avoided at their current multiples.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nYears ago, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the king of the chip industry. However, a drop in PC demand and being replaced as the chip provider for Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Macbook computers sent Intel into a downward spiral. While other chip stocks have flourished, shares of INTC are down by more than 30% in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSome believed that Intel would be boosted after a deal with the US government. The agreement saw Intel receive $8.5 billion in funding to advance its AI chip technology. Despite this, Intel continues to lose ground in its core CPU business. Chip-rivals AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and ArmHoldings (NASDAQ:ARM) are eating away at Intel’s market share after creating CPUs with superior performance and speed.\n\nAs a result, Intel is showing a negative revenue growth CAGR over the past five years. They are one of the only chip companies with negative growth in recent years. Comparatively, AMD has a five-year revenue CAGR of 30%, and ARM has a three-year CAGR of 17%. Intel is still trading at nearly 30x forward earnings, even with a five-year net income CAGR of -28%. The stock is too richly valued for its declining growth as it continues falling behind its peers and into a category of risky AI stocks.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock. Nvidia stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNo stock has been as front and center for the AI revolution as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). I outlined my views on Nvidia a couple of weeks ago, and thus far, my thesis for calling Nvidia’s peak has been playing out. Shares of NVDA are up by nearly 200% over the past year of trading.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s recent 10-for-one stock split not only continued the stock’s snowball but also made shares more accessible to retail investors. Those left out of the stock’s historic one-year rally FOMO’d into the stock at the top. Nvidia also faces the threat of homegrown GPUs from companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and cheaper domestic offerings in China. Through its Made in 2025 policy, China plans to produce 70% of its chips domestically by the year 2025.\n\nThere is no denying that the company’s recent growth has been impressive. Analysts have a current average price target of $119.32 and the stock even received a downgrade from a rating of Buy to Neutral by New Street Research. Nvidia will not continue to grow its revenue at a five-year CAGR of nearly 50%. With shares trading at 40x sales, any decline in revenue growth will result in the stock becoming increasingly overvalued. Nvidia is not the only way to gain exposure to AI.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nNot many people think of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as an AI company, yet. What was once the most popular stock on the market has struggled in 2024, only recently bringing their year-to-date returns above water. After gaining nearly 30% in the first week of July, the stock has returned 1.2% in 2024 to shareholders.\n\nMuch of Tesla’s long-term potential revolves around AI-based initiatives like their Robotaxi and Optimus robots. Tesla Bulls also believes in the future of their FSD technology as well as public listings of Elon Musk’s other companies like SpaceX. But most, if not all, of these initiatives are a long way off from being a reality and some may never even come to fruition. Tesla vehicles are the best-selling EVs on the planet yet the market is pricing Tesla as more than just an automaker.\n\nEven if Tesla were a full AI company, the stock now trades at a sky-high valuation. At 101x forward earnings, Tesla trades at double Nvidia’s price-to-earnings ratio. There is a future where Tesla is a leader in AI technology and software. Until we see any of these play out and hit the market, Tesla has to be considered an automaker more than an AI leader and thus one of the risky AI stocks on the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que held a LONG position in AMZN.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be the Top Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to End 2024",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is a group of companies that led the market since 2023:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nOther than Tesla, which is basically flat year to date, this group is having a fairly strong 2024. MSFT data by YCharts.\n\nNvidia outshines them all, continuing its unbelievable run after a phenomenal 2023. But investors who didn't buy in earlier can't do anything about that now; they can only look forward. So which Magnificent Seven stock looks likeliest to be the biggest winner for the rest of the year?\n\nMany of the Magnificent Seven trade at sky-high valuations\n\nLet's start with the stocks that likely won't have the best performances in the second half. While Tesla shares underperformed for most of the year, there were good reasons for that. Demand for its electric vehicles declined and its margins have shrunk due to its price cuts. There are no signs those trends will turn around before 2024 is over.\n\nNext, let's consider valuations: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all trade at expensive levels of 34 times forward earnings or more, which is quite a premium over the benchmark S&P 500 index, which currently averages 22.7 times forward earnings. Those premiums will likely inhibit their performance from here.\n\nThat leaves just Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Of the two, I think Alphabet is primed for the best second half of 2024.\n\nAlphabet's investments are starting to pay off\n\nAlphabet has long been a force in artificial intelligence (AI). However, it appeared caught off guard when the generative AI craze took off in late 2022. As a result, it had to scramble to launch competing products that weren't great initially. However, it has largely cleaned up their problems.\n\nNow, Alphabet's generative AI model, Gemini, is recognized as one of the top options available, and has already been integrated into several of its products to perform tasks such as summarizing Google search results.\n\nFurthermore, Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum. Because most companies can't afford to spend millions of dollars to build and operate their own supercomputers to train AI models, renting that processing power from a cloud computing provider is far more economical. Each cloud infrastructure provider has its specialties, and AI appears to be one of Google Cloud's. With 60% of funded generative AI start-ups and 90% of generative AI unicorns (private companies worth at least $1 billion) using its services, it has a strong foothold in this emerging market.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Alphabet's advertising business should continue to perform well this year -- and while AI may be flashy, advertising is what keeps the company's lights on. In Q1, more than three-fourths of its revenue came from advertising-related sources, and that revenue was up 13% year over year. While that's not blazing-fast growth, it is impressive for a fairly mature business. With upcoming catalysts like election-related advertising, we can expect a strong end to 2024 for Alphabet.\n\nAs for its valuation, Alphabet is actually the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven cohort, trading at 25 times forward earnings. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile that's not cheap relative to the broader market, it is when compared to its peers.\n\nBased on the combination of its relatively cheap valuation and its strong business momentum, I have confidence that Alphabet will have a strong close to 2024. Whether it will outperform the rest of the Magnificent Seven is still up in the air -- especially with a wild card like Nvidia in the mix -- but I'm confident that Alphabet will beat the market in the second half.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Many top-performing stocks have come out of the tech sector. Few industries have the same growth and scaling opportunities as tech companies. Every publicly traded trillion-dollar corporation is a tech giant, and the next few trillion-dollar firms will also likely be in the tech industry.\n\nTech also makes up a large concentration of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. If tech stocks fall, the entire market will feel the impact. Luckily, most tech stocks have been gaining value in the long run, including the stocks covered in this article.\n\nIt’s still possible to find undervalued tech stocks, especially if you approach each asset with a long-term perspective. Anything can happen in a year, as macroeconomic factors, earnings reports and other short-term events can impact stock prices. However, these corporations look like they can deliver solid gains and dividends over the next decade. Investors may want to take a closer look at these undervalued tech stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is striving to become one of the world’s leading AI giants. The company has plenty of capital to invest thanks to its healthy cash reserves and strong financials. The advertising giant reported 27% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in the first quarter, and net income more than doubled.\n\nMeta Platforms’ “Year of Efficiency” has done wonders for the stock price. Shares are up by 51% year-to-date and have surged by 159% over the past five years. The company’s 3.24 billion daily active users and millions of advertisers suggest that revenue will continue to pour into the company’s coffers.\n\nThe stock trades at a 30.7 P/E ratio, which seems reasonable given the company’s incredible net income growth. Meta Platforms also offers a 0.38% yield and should maintain a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years. Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock and have given it a Strong Buy consensus rating.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is another Wall Street favorite currently rated as a Moderate Buy. The highest price target of $270 per share implies the stock can gain an additional 30% from current levels.\n\nThe chipmaker is riding AI tailwinds and has logged a 46% year-to-date gain for investors. Shares are also up by 176% over the past five years. Qualcomm also offers a 1.64% yield and trades at a 28 P/E ratio. The tech giant has maintained a high single-digit dividend growth rate for several years, including this year’s 6.3% dividend hike.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm delivered 1% YOY revenue growth in Q2 FY24, which indicates the company’s headwinds are in the rearview mirror. Net income jumped by 37% YOY in the same quarter. The rising demand for artificial intelligence could result in revenue acceleration in the upcoming quarters. Qualcomm is a relatively undervalued AI chip stock that presents more upside for long-term investors.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) generates most of its revenue from online advertisements. Google and YouTube are two of the most popular websites, and they attract a steady amount of visitors and advertisers. However, the company is diversifying its revenue, with Google Cloud now accounting for more than 10% of the company’s revenue.\n\nOverall revenue increased by 15% YOY in the first quarter, while net income was up by 57% YOY. The tech giant has been cutting costs and will likely deliver higher profit margins in the upcoming quarters.\n\nAlphabet stock has delivered solid returns for long-term investors. Shares are up 36% year-to-date and have rallied 232% over the past five years. The stock trades at a 30 P/E ratio and offers a 0.42% yield. Wall Street analysts believe the stock can rally higher and gave it a consensus Strong Buy rating. The highest price target of $225 per share implies the stock can gain an additional 18%.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in GOOG.

        "title": "Possible Bearish Signals With Meta Platforms Insiders Disposing Stock",
        "content": "Many Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.8m worth of shares at a price of US$473 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$535). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 9.3% of Andrew Bosworth's stake.\n\nInsiders in Meta Platforms didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this freelist of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\n\nInsiders At Meta Platforms Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Meta Platforms shares. Specifically, Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth ditched US$2.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Meta Platforms insiders own 14% of the company, worth about US$184b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Meta Platforms Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nAn insider sold Meta Platforms shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But since Meta Platforms is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Meta Platforms. For example - Meta Platforms has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "3 Overvalued Social Media Stock You Shouldn’t Touch With a 10-Foot Pole",
        "content": "Social media has taken the market by surprise. With Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) leading the way but joined by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL), and Snap (NASDAQ:SNAP), the social media industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 26% through 2031.\n\nDespite this, some companies are falling behind on capitalizing on this trend. It can be a mix of slowing user growth, stagnating revenues or blatantly bad financials. My investing methodology revolves around buying high-quality businesses with great growth at fair prices. More importantly, I ensure the companies I invest in are financially stable and will last several decades.\n\nHowever, as you look to the future, it is important to capture great companies in a fast-growing industry. It is equally essential to avoid bad businesses that will struggle to maintain market share as competition fiercens.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEtsy (ETSY) etsy logo on a grey wall\n\nSource: quietbits / Shutterstock.com\n\nEtsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) is an e-commerce platform that is also attracting social media influencers to promote merchandise. During its COVID-19 highs, Etsy stock rallied to almost $300 per share. That is a far cry from its current share price of $50 as the company’s growth increasingly stagnates.\r\n\r\nEven with this significant fall in price, the stock still trades at heavy multiples relative to its growth. It currently has a price-to-earnings ratio of 26.69 and an EV/EBITDA ratio of 20.88.\n\nIn the first quarterEtsy’s top line grew just 0.79% year-over-year (YOY) as net margins crashed by 16%. With a market share of just 0.38%, Etsy is being crushed by competitors like PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD), the proprietor of Temu, which has seen its market share rise from just 7% in 2019 to 19% by mid-2023.\n\nSome investors are optimistic about the company’s initiatives for operational efficiency, such as the outsourcing of its paid search efforts. However, this has been met with less-than-promising active buyer growth, which was just 1.9% YOY during the period.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Vipshop Holdings Limited (NYSE:VIPS), one of Etsy’s key competitors with similar revenue growth, trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 2.64. On the other hand, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 21.60. Slightly more than Etsy, the e-commerce giant’s growth is 15 times higher at 12.5%, showing that Etsy still has more room to fall before it bottoms.\n\nRumble (RUM) Illustrative Editorial of RUMBLE.COM website homepage. RUMBLE (RUM) logo visible on display screen.\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nRumble (NASDAQ:RUM), which some have deem a “YouTube copycat,” prides itself on free speech. However, the company’s core business model falters as the stock trails lower.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has had to confront growing challenges. In Brazil, for example, the government is calling for censorship and removal of certain popular accounts critical of the da Silver regime. Similarly, several Western countries, including France and Australia, also want to censor Rumble content.\n\nRumble’s monthly active users (MAUs) also drastically fell by 25% quarter over quarter. The company’s top line was flat at 0.7% year-over-year growth, and most notably, earnings-per-share (EPS) continues to spiral downward from a 14 cents per share loss last year to a 21 cent loss last quarter.\n\nThis only adds fuel to the fire that lies in its balance sheet as total assets decreased by 20% YOY. While most investors would expect liabilities to subsequently decrease as well, they instead jumped by 60% as Rumbled struggled for profitability. In fact, margins have continued to deteriorate with the video site reporting a profit margin of -250% in Q1 2024, a 50% decrease YOY.\r\n\r\nWith slowing user growth, a struggle for profitability and simply bad financial metrics, Rumble is trading at an EV/EBITDA ratio of -9.97. This is further exacerbated by a price-to-sales ratio of 13.85, nonsensical for a company that is experiencing flat sales growth.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) Truth Social (DJT), Gettr, Rumble (RUM) and Parler app icons are seen on an iPhone. Donald Trump's new social media venture, Truth Social, launched on Feb 20 in Apple's App Store.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter being banned from both Facebook and X (previously known as Twitter), Donald Trump took matters into his own hands and created Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT). It was an attempt to fight back against major tech companies such as Meta, Alphabet, and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).\n\nWith DJT down 63% from all-time highs and Trump leading in presidential political polling, some investors wonder if it’s time to buy. To put it bluntly, the company’s underlying fundamentals are out of whack. Strictly from a financial perspective, DJT has some alarmingly low growth rates, with quarterly revenue decreasing 30% YOY.\n\nTo make matters worse, DJT lost $327.6 million in just the first quarter. To compensate, the company has diluted its common shares outstanding by 37%, which is not a good look. Aside from lacking good financials, the company’s user base is in decline. Truth Social’s average number of monthly visits tumbled 40% over the past year, showing an evident lack of interest from the general populous.\n\nLastly, DJT’s EV/EBITDA ratio of -48.52 falls far behind that of similar free-speech medium Rumble, being over five times lower with far-worse levels of growth and profitability. Simply put, investing in Rumble stock is dead money.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

All in exchange for taking a quick survey and providing a credit card number for the $5 shipping and handling.\n\n“You’ll get two free gifts just by taking this quick poll in support of Trump,” says the ad's narrator.\n\nThe ad — which has appeared on Facebook, YouTube and other platforms — didn't mention the $80 charge that would later appear on credit card statements. Those that clicked were scammed.\n\nPolitical advertisements on social media are one of the best ways for candidates to reach supporters and raise campaign cash. But as a new report from Syracuse University shows, weak regulations governing online ads and haphazard enforcement by tech companies also make ads a prime source for misleading information about elections — and a tantalizingly easy way for con artists to target victims.\n\n“There is very little regulation on the platforms,\" said Jennifer Stromer-Galley, the professor who led the research for the ElectionGraph Project at Syracuse University’s Institute for Democracy, Journalism & Citizenship. “It leaves the American public vulnerable to misinformation, disinformation and propaganda.”\n\nStromer's research examined more than 2,200 groups on Facebook or Instagram that ran ads between September and May mentioning one of the presidential candidates. Combined, the ads cost nearly $19 million and were seen more than 1 billion times.\n\nData connected to the ads (and made public by Meta, Facebook's owner) shows that both right- and left-leaning ads targeted older voters more than younger ones. Right-leaning ads were more likely to target men, progressive ads were more likely to target women.\n\nOverall, conservative-leaning organizations bought more ads than progressive-leaning groups. Immigration was the top issue raised in right-leaning ads while the economy dominated progressive ads.\n\nMany of the ads contained misleading information, or deepfake video and audio of celebrities supposedly crying during a speech by former First Lady Melania Trump. Stromer-Galley noted that falsehoods in ads about urban crime and immigration were especially common.\n\nWhile most of the groups paying for the ads are legitimate, others seemed more interested in getting a user's personal financial data than boosting any particular candidate. Using a partnership with the data science firm Neo4j, Stromer-Galley found that some of the pages shared common creators, or ran virtually identical ads. When one page disappeared — perhaps removed by Facebook moderators — another would pop up quickly to take its place.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany of the pages sold Trump-related merchandise such as flags, hats, banners and coins or advertised fictitious investment schemes. The true motive, apparently, was to get a user's credit card information.\n\nThe ads promising a free Trump flag were placed by a group called Liberty Defender Group. Emails sent to several addresses listed for the company were not returned, and a phone number for a company representative could not be found. One website associated with the group has moved on from politics, and is now selling devices which claim to improve home energy efficiency.\n\nMeta removed most of the network's ads and pages earlier this year after researchers noticed their activity, but the ads are still visible on other platforms. The company says it prohibits scams or content that could interfere with the operation of an election and removes ads that violate the rules. In addition, the company urges its users not to click on suspicious links, or to hand over personal information to untrustworthy sources.\n\n\"Don’t answer messages asking for your password, social security number, or credit card information,\" the company said.\n\nThe Trump campaign, which has no known ties to the network, did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nThe researchers at Syracuse were only able to study ads on Meta platforms because other companies do not make such information public. As a result, Stromer-Galley said the public is in the dark about the true amount of misinformation and scams spreading on social media.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Businesses aim to generate profit, so high cash flow stocks are proof of a company’s success in making profits by generating and holding significant cash reserves.\n\nOrganizations use substantial free cash to reduce debt, withstand downturns, reinvest in growth and reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.\n\nRenowned investor Warren Buffett asserts that a company’s free cash flow is the most important valuation metric. It is unsurprising that Buffett invests in high-yield businesses like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\r\n\r\nWhile maintaining a strong balance sheet is prudent, cash alone does not define the best opportunity. Investors must consider what companies do with their cash.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite several firms excelling at generating cash flow, accumulating reserves amid high inflation represents an underutilization of resources. Though brief market volatility may warrant holding large reserves, shareholders expect ongoing reinvestment or remuneration over the long run to justify investing in high cash flow stocks.\r\n\r\nSo now, let’s examine three companies with impressive cash flows and market performance indicative of future growth.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, generates significant cash flow. Truly, it is worth consideration as one of the high cash flow stocks in which to invest.\n\nIn its latest earnings report, Meta Platforms posted $36.5 billion in revenue with $12.5 billion in free cash flow, yielding a healthy 34% cash flow margin. Also, the company maintains a strong balance sheet with $58.1 billion in total cash. Revenue climbed 27% year-over-year (YOY) as the company capitalized on a 7% increase in monthly active users. Over the past year, META expanded its cash and equivalents by 51% to $85 billion.\n\nIn addition to organic growth, Meta Platforms invests cash flow strategically. The company pays its first-ever dividend while allocating $50 billion to share repurchases. Both initiatives support the META stock price. Besides these moves, it reinvests heavily in artificial intelligence (AI). The company budgeted $40 billion for capital expenditures this year, up from an initial $35 billion target.\n\nVISA (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe world’s largest credit card company, Visa (NYSE:V) doesn’t need to use its own credit, as it has a free cash flow margin of almost 58%. Interestingly, Visa does not have significant exposure to credit card debt. It is typically up to the banks that partner with Visa to issue the cards.\n\nStory continues\n\nVisa’s business model of charging a commission on third-party transactions means it functions more as a data network that doesn’t need large expenditures. The company operates as a payment authorization, clearing and settlement, and doesn’t extend credit to consumers by itself. In fact, it takes in more income from data processing than services ($4.03 billion compared to $4.26 billion in the last quarter).\n\nThe company has increased its EPS by 20%, with payment volume increasing 7% and net revenue at 10%. Notably, Visa engages in stock buybacks, ranging from $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion a quarter, helping boost Visa’s share price. No wonder analysts are bullish on Visa stock, giving it an average price target of $310.11 per share, a potential 16% upside.\n\nAltria Group (MO) Altria Group, Inc. (MO) logo of US producer and marketer of tobacco and cigarettes is seen on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltria Group (NYSE:MO) is one of the largest tobacco companies in the U.S. and the owner of the iconic Marlboro brand. Cigarette popularity is declining, which may negatively impact the company’s future prospects. However, Altria Group is focusing on transforming its product line to smokeless options and enhancing returns for investors.\n\nNotably, Altria Group is one of the high cash flow stocks that generates a lot of cash. The free cash flow margin rose by 60.3% and operating cash flow grew by 12% last year. The company utilizes its significant cash flows to benefit shareholders. It added $2.4 billion to its stock buyback program last quarter.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Altria Group pays a generous dividend with a forward yield of 8.5%, well above the 1.3% average of the S&P 500 index. While MO’s stock price is not expected to increase rapidly and has remained flat for five years, its dividend provides consistent income, which is valuable for investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "A pending or ongoing lawsuit isn’t always a reliable indicator of stocks to sell, but, in many cases, investors should take litigation as a sign to dig beneath the surface.\n\nI’d first caution retail investors not to take pending litigation as a sure sign of failure or risk; tons of legal firms push frivolous lawsuits in a bid to maximize their own income. Even if the litigant’s motives aren’t nefarious, law firms bring suits against companies for other reasons beyond just a payout; for example, last year, a group of nuns suedSmith & Wesson (NASDAQ:SWBI) for “wrongdoing related to the marketing and sale of AR-15-style assault weapons.” Likewise, Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) face near-constant lawsuits from minority shareholders — often with flimsy premises and thin evidence.\n\nStill, these stocks to sell combine the worst of both worlds: They’re facing ongoing lawsuits, and in each of the three cases, the stock itself is a stinker.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGoodRx (GDRX) Magnifying glass looking at the GoodRx logo on the company Website\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoodRx (NASDAQ:GDRX) is facing a fresh lawsuit claiming the company misrepresented Kroger’s (NYSE:KR) total contributions to its revenue. Specifically, the suit claims that GoodRx didn’t inform investors that “Kroger accounted for less than 5% of the pharmacies accepting GoodRx discounts [but] was responsible for nearly 25% of GoodRx’s total prescription transactions revenue.” This misalignment exposes GoodRx to undue risk and, while management can run their operations as they choose, exposing shareholders to this level of systemic risk isn’t good business. In some ways, I’d call this a frivolous lawsuit — with merit, yes, but ultimately not enough to count it among the ranks of stocks to sell.\n\nBut this isn’t the only problem GoodRx faced in recent years.\n\nMore concerning to shareholders and customers alike is GoodRx’s 2023 $1.5 million civil penalty assessed by the Federal Trade Commission for “unauthorized disclosures of consumers’ personal health information to Meta (NASDAQ:META), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and other companies.” Taken in conjunction with the most recent lawsuit, GoodRx seems to consistently pull the wool over shareholders’ eyes, Likewise, its past practice of actively “cash[ing] in on consumers’ extremely sensitive and personally identifiable health information” is a clear violation of consumer trust, ultimately making GoodRx too risky for most portfolios and a strong candidate among stocks to sell.\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\n3M (NYSE:MMM) constantly faces lawsuits, the most well-known of which is the “earplug lawsuit” that found the company liable and compelled to pay a $6 billion personal injury settlement to affected parties. Beyond the pure payout, 3M is facing a $370 million legal defense bill — ultimately operating a money pit that’s going to see shareholder value diverted toward legal costs rather than company growth, dividends, or buybacks.\n\nThat isn’t all, of course. 3M also owes $10 billion to residents affected by the company’s leeching “forever chemicals” in drinking water supplies. Payments toward this massive settlement begin next quarter and, as with the earplug suit, represent a company forced to focus on legal wrangling over operational expansion and dedicate capital toward payouts rather than benefiting shareholders.\n\nSurprisingly, 3M remained largely unaffected by the suits this year as shares have climbed 10% since January. This is due, in part, to an uncertainty principle: ongoing lawsuits have uncertain outcomes and create unknown risks for investors, whereas settlements and adjudicated suits have clearly defined costs that are more easily modeled. Still, with a slew of lawsuits in the rearview but likely more ahead, 3M is certainly a top contender among stocks to sell.\n\nGameStop (GME) The logo for GameStop Corp (GME) is displayed above a retail storefront entrance.\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) isn’t facing a lawsuit itself, but that doesn’t detract from its risk and status among stocks to sell. Last month, investors filed suit against meme stock mega-star Keith Gill, who was originally a face of the movement that propelled GameStop to its massive highs and has recently reemerged as a major player. The litigants dissolved the suit earlier this month. Still, bad news of this type surrounding GameStop doesn’t bode well for its future, particularly as the company itself remains on shaky ground with limited prospects beyond short-term meme stock status.\n\nThe company’s cashing in on its recent bounce with a massively dilutive share offering is just one of many examples of management taking advantage of their unique position in the market; their position is understandable — may as well make hay while the sun shines — but also shows a clear disregard for the legions of current and future bagholders propping up the stock.\n\nI don’t even need to get into GameStop’s imminent operational concerns, which include job cuts amid slackening sales. If you made money on GameStop, congrats — but, if not, consider now the time to cut and run as GameStop sticks out like a sore thumb among stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe S&P 500 is up 17% so far this year.\n\nBut as investors have heard time and again, this performance can be largely attributed to just a handful of stocks tracking one theme — the Magnificent Seven and AI. As of late June, for instance, Nvidia (NVDA) alone had accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500's gains this year.\n\nFor the other 493 stocks in the benchmark index, both earnings growth and shareholder returns have been more measured. In fact, as the team at Bank of America pointed out in a note on Tuesday, these remaining members of the S&P 500 have been in an earnings recession since the beginning of last year.\n\nAccording to data from BofA's US equity strategy team, earnings for the S&P 493 haven't registered year-over-year growth since the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nAfter an annual drop of 2% in the first quarter of '23 and a 7% annual decline in the second quarter of last year, earnings growth has been flat for this group in each of the last three quarters, the firm's work shows.\n\nThe upcoming second quarter earnings period, however, should mark the end of what's been a stealth earnings recession for the vast majority of companies in the S&P 500. For the 493 non-Mag 7 stocks, earnings growth is forecast to clock in at 6%, 7%, and 13% annually over the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2024.\n\nNow, this growth is still expected to lag the index's overall earnings growth, as the lion's share of this profit growth will be generated by the Technology (XLK) and Communications Services (XLC) sectors, which house AI beneficiaries like Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG). (Health Care, notably, is also set to see earnings rise by double digits in each of the next three quarters, though BofA cautions these are driven by one-time items rolling off the books for Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK).) Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang delivers his keystone speech ahead of Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 2, 2024. (SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images) (SAM YEH via Getty Images)\n\nSome on Wall Street have grown dismayed by the bifurcated performance between the haves (AI names) and have-nots (everyone else) in the S&P 500. But we think these numbers help us understand how we got here and where we're headed.\n\nWhen 2024 began, one of the consensus views on Wall Street was that the market rally would broaden out after a 2023 surge defined by the AI theme. To date, this trade has not been a feature of this market. The fundamentals — i.e., earnings growth — help explain why.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn each of the last two quarters, the aforementioned Technology sector has seen earnings growth of 25% and 27%, respectively; for Communications Services, earnings growth has been even more gaudy at 53% and 43% over those periods.\n\nIt's little wonder, then, why these sectors — and the most influential components within them — have been at the center of both the market conversation and most of the returns.\n\nAnd some strategists choosing to move away from talking about the so-called benchmark index as a useful benchmark for most investors is also more than sensible in this environment.\n\nAs Piper Sandler's Michael Kantrowitz told Yahoo Finance on Monday, the correlation between the S&P 500 index and its constituents has moved toward a 25-year low. And if the S&P 500 is to be a stand-in for \"the market\" and most stocks aren't trading in line with this market, then what are we really talking about?\n\nYet, as often happens in the investing world, this peak of frustration with a market environment that has come to resemble celebrity culture, in which just a few stars draw the headlines, appears set to crescendo. At which point stocks that comprise \"anything else\" will meet an investor community eager to think about just that.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The artificial intelligence boom has propped many stocks nicely at all-time highs. Industrial tailwinds can carry these stocks even higher as revenue and net incomes continue to surge. While some stocks have captured public attention for a few years, other AI stocks remain undervalued. Investors can also find stocks in the spotlight that remain surprisingly undervalued based on their growth opportunities, financial performances, and valuations.\n\nArtificial intelligence is still in its early innings based on Statista’s data. The industry is projected to maintain a compounded annual growth rate of 28.46% from now until 2030. The United States is projected to be the largest market during the AI boom. The AI market size is projected to be $184.0 billion this year.\n\nMany investors have been turning to the stock market to get their slices of the pie. As many AI stocks continue to soar, these top picks still present compelling opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been using artificial intelligence for several years to enhance its search engine and cloud platform. The company also recently launched Gemini and got through some hiccups at the start of the year. This AI stock isn’t exactly a secret. It’s one of the Magnificent Seven stocks and commands a valuation above $2 trillion. Shares are up by 38% year-to-date and have more than tripled over the past five years.\n\nDespite the strong momentum, Alphabet still trades at a 30 P/E ratio. That’s reasonable given the company’s financial performance. Net income increased by 57% year-over-year in the first quarter as Alphabet continued to reduce costs. Revenue increased by 15% year-over-year.\n\nAlphabet should continue to benefit from artificial intelligence as more businesses turn to Google Cloud. The company’s cloud computing platform makes it easier to store data and enable AI tools to perform at their best. Wall Street analysts believe this catalyst will drive the stock higher, based on the consensus Strong Buy rating.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on side of headquarters\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is starting to gain momentum after missing out on most of the 2023 rally. Shares of the semiconductor giant are up by 47% year-to-date and have gained 168% over the past five years. Qualcomm offers a 1.65% yield and trades at a 28 P/E ratio. The company has raised its dividend for several years, including a 6.25% dividend hike this year.\n\nAfter posting a few quarters of declining revenue and earnings, Qualcomm flipped the script in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue increased by 1% year-over-year while net income jumped by 37% year-over-year. Qualcomm is enabling leading on-device AI capabilities across multiple product categories, and that should help the company deliver solid financial results for several quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividend distributions. Some Wall Street analysts believe Qualcomm is set to return even more to its investors. The stock is rated as a Moderate Buy, and the highest price target of $270 per shares implies a 31% upside.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) uses artificial intelligence to power its social media platforms. AI allows algorithms to display content that keeps people engaged and clicking on more ads. The company is making big investments into artificial intelligence and virtual reality to diversify its income streams. While advertising is the main revenue driver for now, it’s been delivering good results for many years, including the first quarter.\n\nThe social media giant reported 27% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 2024. Net income grew by 117% year-over-year, resulting in a net profit margin of 33.9%. Meta Platforms has 3.24 billion daily active users on its platform. The company generates plenty of attention and has a vast user base that gives them a head start with any AI initiatives.\n\nMeta Platforms has received praise from several Wall Street analysts and is currently rated as a Strong Buy.

        "title": "2 Unstoppable Stocks Trading for Over $500 That Could Be the Next to Split",
        "content": "When a company creates a substantial amount of value over the long run, its stock price can soar into the hundreds or even thousands of dollars, which makes it hard for smaller investors to buy (unless they use a broker that offers fractional shares). As a result, the company might opt for a stock split, which increases the number of shares in circulation and organically reduces its price per share by a proportional amount.\n\nIt's important to remember that the move is entirely cosmetic, and it doesn't change the underlying value of the company. However, splits often result in a short-term uptick in stock price as a broader investor base swoops in to buy.\n\nNvidia executed a 10-for-1 split in June, when its stock soared above $1,200 following an incredible run of value creation on the back of artificial intelligence (AI). Now, investors can buy one share of Nvidia for just $126. A long list of other tech giants have used stock splits in the past, including Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Tesla, to name a few.\n\nI think Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) could each explore a split soon because their stocks trade at $690 and $539, respectively, and could go much higher. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Netflix\n\nNetflix is the world's largest streaming platform with 269.9 million subscribers. Walt Disney is a distant second with 153.6 million members for Disney+, and it's unlikely to ever catch up given the breadth of Netflix's content catalog and its enviable operating efficiency.\n\nNetflix is the only stand-alone streaming provider generating a consistent profit. It delivered $6.4 billion in net income over the last four quarters from $34.9 billion in total revenue, which means it can invest heavily in content to attract more users without burning through cash. In fact, the company plans to spend $17 billion this year to produce and acquire content, whereas Disney is cutting billions of dollars from its budget.\n\nNetflix's budget includes a growing foray into live programming. The Roast of Tom Brady was one of its recent successes, with 2 million viewers when it aired live in May. The platform could top that figure when it shows the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match in November, and potentially again on Christmas Day with two live NFL games.\n\nFor an entire decade beginning in 2025, Netflix will also be the home of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which includes several live events each year.\n\nOver the past two years, Netflix has focused on attracting new subscribers at the lower end of the income spectrum with cheaper membership tiers.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst, its $7.99 monthly sharing plan is capturing some of the 100 million households that were borrowing Netflix for free from a friend or family member. Second, a $6.99 monthly plan is supplemented by advertising, and this accounted for 40% of all new sign-ups in the recent first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31) in countries where it's available.\n\nNetflix says the ad tier monetizes at roughly the same rate as the $15.49 standard tier. Regular subscribers don't grow more valuable over time unless it increases prices, but ad-tier subscribers definitely could.\n\nThe streamer accounts for only 8.1% of TV viewing time in the U.S., so there is still plenty of room to grow, and it will be able to sell more ads (and charge more for them) as it occupies more screen time.\n\nWith around $337 billion forecast to be spent on TV advertising this year alone, according to Statista, advertising could be one of Netflix's largest financial opportunities ever.\n\nThe stock trades at $690 as of this writing, on the back of a 57% gain over the past year. It could soon be trading at over $1,000 if it continues growing at that pace, so a stock split seems inevitable eventually. The company is no stranger to splits, having used them in 2012 and 2015.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms is the only company valued at more than $1 trillion that hasn't executed a stock split to date. It went public in 2012 priced at $38, and it has since climbed 1,321% to $539 as of this writing, so it isn't for a lack of value creation.\n\nMeta is home to social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and more, which serve 3.2 billion people every day. The company is a cash generating machine, bringing in $45.7 billion in net income over the last four quarters from $142.7 billion in revenue. But its biggest financial opportunity might still be ahead of it.\n\nMeta turned its attention to AI last year. It built the world's most popular open-source large language model (LLM), called Llama, and it powers the new Meta AI chatbot, which is integrated into its social platforms. Users can call upon Meta AI to answer complex questions, generate images, and recommend restaurants or gift ideas. It can even join your group chat.\n\nMeta AI is powered by the latest Llama 3 LLM, but the next generation is already in training and could unlock new capabilities. Eventually, every business using Meta's apps could have its own personalized chatbot to deal with questions from customers, and potentially even make sales.\n\nMeta is an expert at monetizing new features (just look at the success of Stories and Reels), so I bet it will find a number of ways to make money from its AI products and services.\n\nThe stock is cheap right now, at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31, a slight discount to the 32.4 P/E of the Nasdaq-100 index. But it could get even cheaper, because Wall Street thinks the company will generate $23.09 in earnings per share in 2025, which places the stock at a forward P/E of 23.4. In other words, Meta stock will have to rise 38% by the end of next year just to trade in line with the Nasdaq-100.\n\nThat would place the stock at a record high of $745, and given the company's positive momentum, I wouldn't be surprised to see a stock split before that point.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Netflix wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Although most investors are captivated by the long-term potential of artificial intelligence (AI), companies enacting stock splits are an equally hot trend on Wall Street.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows publicly traded companies an opportunity to cosmetically alter their share price and outstanding share count. It's superficial in the sense that stock splits don't affect a company's market valuation or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe two variations of stock splits are forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are purposely reducing their nominal share price to make it more affordable for everyday investors and/or their employees. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split is aimed at increasing a company's share price, often with the goal of meeting continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.\n\nAlthough some reverse-stock splits can be long-term winners, most investors tend to focus their attention on public companies conducting forward splits. High-flying stocks in need of a forward split are usually out-executing and out-innovating their competition.\n\nSince 2024 began, in the neighborhood of a dozen high-profile companies have announced and/or completed a stock split -- but none have garnered more attention than AI titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia was the most-anticipated stock split of 2024 on Wall Street\n\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) in January 1999, Nvidia has completed six forward splits. The latest was announced by the company's board on May 22 -- a 10-for-1 stock split -- with an effective date of June 7. At the snap of a finger, Nvidia's share price of more than $1,200 was adjusted to a little north of $120.\n\nThe reason Nvidia required its largest stock split since going public has everything to do with its AI dominance.\n\nSince the start of 2023, Nvidia's AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the undisputed standard in high-compute data centers. By some estimates, the company holds a virtual monopoly on the AI-GPUs that were shipped for use in enterprise data centers last year.\n\nOn top of being the preferred hardware provider for AI-accelerated data centers, demand for the company's H100 GPU has overwhelmed supply. Even with world-leading foundry services company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rapidly upping its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity for high-bandwidth memory packaging, Nvidia is nowhere close to meeting enterprise demand for its chips. As a result, it's been able to meaningfully increase the selling price of its GPUs, which has provided a hearty boost to its adjusted gross margin.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has plans to retain its first-mover advantages, as well. While most external competitors are playing catch-up to the H100, Nvidia is expected to release its next-generation AI-GPU architecture, known as Blackwell, later this year. Blackwell offers computational improvements in six areas, including quantum computing, generative AI solutions, and engineering simulation, to name a few. In June, CEO Jensen Huang teased the eventual rollout of its Rubin GPU architecture by 2026.\n\nNvidia's 10-for-1 stock split has laid a path for other fast-growing, market-leading businesses to follow. Interestingly enough, two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" might be next to answer the call. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTwo Magnificent Seven components appear ready to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks\n\nAs a quick refresher, the Magnificent Seven account for seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in America. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia have market valuations in excess of $3 trillion; Alphabet and Amazon are valued at north of $2 trillion; Meta is worth close to $1.4 trillion; and while Tesla is currently below $1 trillion, it's previously topped this psychological level.\n\nAmong Nvidia's six peers in the Magnificent Seven, two are primed to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven component that's long overdue for a stock split is the only member that's yet to ever complete one. I'm talking about social media colossus Meta Platforms. Shares of the company have risen by more than 1,300% since its debut in 2012, with the company's stock tipping the scales at roughly $540, as of the closing bell on July 5.\n\nThough Meta is among the basket of companies undeniably benefiting from the AI revolution, it would be well-insulated if the AI bubble were to burst at some point in the future. That's because nearly 98% of Meta's sales can be traced to advertising on its social media platforms.\n\nMeta is the parent company behind Facebook, the most-visited social platform globally, as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads. These are some of the world's most-downloaded social apps, and they collectively helped to attract 3.24 billion daily active users during the March-ended quarter. Businesses are well aware that no other social media company offers access to more eyeballs than Meta, which is what affords the company such exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nSomething else working in Meta's favor is its treasure trove of cash. As of March 31, Meta was sitting on more than $58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. To boot, it's also generated north of $76 billion in cash from its operations over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has the luxury of betting big on AI data centers, the metaverse, and augmented/virtual reality devices thanks to his company's immense cash-flow generation.\n\nWith Meta's stock well over $500 and the company's long-term growth prospects improving, its very first stock split would seem to be in the cards.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven member that looks ready to follow in Nvidia's footsteps and become Wall Street's newest stock-split stock is software and cloud juggernaut Microsoft.\n\nSince its March 1986 IPO, Microsoft has conducted nine forward splits. However, the last stock split it completed was back in February 2003! With the world's largest company by market cap closing the July 5 session at $467.56 per share, the ingredients are on the table for Microsoft to announce a stock split.\n\nThe beauty of Microsoft's operating model is that it relies on sizable margins from its legacy operations to fund its high-growth initiatives. Although iconic software segments like Windows and Office aren't growing like they once were, the exceptional moats and margins associated with these divisions provide Microsoft with plenty of cash to reinvest in the cloud and AI, or perhaps deploy when making acquisitions.\n\nThe bread-and-butter to Microsoft's future looks to be cloud infrastructure service platform Azure. While Microsoft has AI and cloud ties in other operating segments, Azure is consistently its fastest-growing segment -- 31% constant-currency sales growth in the fiscal third quarter (ended March 31). Azure ranks second to Amazon Web Services in global cloud infrastructure service market share.\n\nSimilar to Meta Platforms, Microsoft's balance sheet and cash-flow generation afford it the ability to take risks that few other companies can match. It closed out the fiscal third quarter with $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and has generated $110 billion in operating cash flow over the TTM period. This is what allowed Microsoft to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard last year for $68.7 billion in an all-cash deal.\n\nWhat better way for the world's largest public company to excite Wall Street and its shareholders than by being the next Magnificent Seven component to announce a stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Meta announced Tuesday that it updated its hate speech policy such that it will remove more posts targeting \"Zionists\" after a review found the term often appears in speech that dehumanizes Jews and Israelis, calls for their harm or denies their existence.\n\nThe parent company of Facebook and Instagram explained the change in a post on its Transparency Center blog, noting that the move comes after it has reviewed the term \"Zionist\" on other occasions in recent years before it was examined in Meta's Policy Forum in March. Meta said that, \"The word 'Zionist' has layers of meaning based on its origins and usage today, and may also be highly dependent on context.\"\n\n\"This term often refers to supporters of a political movement, which is not itself a protected characteristic under our policies, but in some cases may be used as a proxy to refer to Jewish or Israeli people, which are protected characteristics under our Hate Speech policy,\" Meta explained.\n\n\"We recognize there is nothing approaching a global consensus on what people mean when they use the term 'Zionist.' However, based on our research, engagement, and on-platform investigation into its use as a proxy term for Jewish people and Israelis in relation to certain types of hateful attacks, we will now remove content that targets 'Zionists' with dehumanizing comparisons, calls for harm, or denials of existence on the basis that 'Zionist' in those instances often appears to be a proxy for Jewish or Israeli people,\" Meta wrote.\n\nROBERT KRAFT GIVES $1M TO YESHIVA UNIVERSITY Meta announced an update to its hate speech policy that will see more posts targeting Zionists removed from its platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\n\nThe company said that in the past, Meta would remove posts referring to \"Zionists\" under the hate speech policy in \"two narrow circumstances: (1) where Zionists are compared to rats, reflecting known antisemitic imagery, and (2) where context makes clear that 'Zionist' means 'Jew' or 'Israeli.'\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nWhile it will continue to remove such posts under the hate speech policy, the new broader application of hate speech rules to the term \"Zionist\" will result in the removal of posts that aren't explicitly about the Zionist political movement and use antisemitic stereotypes or threaten other types of harm through intimidation or violence directed at Jews or Israelis \"under the guise of attacking Zionists.\"\n\nCOLLEGES HIT WITH LAWSUITS OVER HANDLING OF ANTI-ISRAEL CAMPUS PROTESTS Anti-Zionist rhetoric is often used in antisemitic attacks on Jews and Israelis, which prompted Meta to update its\n\nMeta provided examples of the ways in which posts referring to Zionists would be violations of the updated hate speech policy, including:\n\nStory continues\n\nClaims about running the world or controlling the media; Dehumanizing comparisons, such as comparisons to pigs, filth, or vermin; Calls for physical harm; Denials of existence; Mocking for having a disease.\n\nThe company noted that repeat violations of the community standards on Meta platforms \"may result in suspension or removal of the account posting the violations.\"\n\nPALANTIR CEO: COLLEGE PROTESTS ARE 'FULL-ON REGRESSION FROM BELOW OUR CONSTITUTION' The war in the Middle East sparked by Hamas' attack on Israel spurred a wave of protests that included anti-Zionist rhetoric, such as this sign at McGill University in Montreal.\n\nOne issue related to the use of the term \"Zionist\" that Meta noted is still under review is comparisons between Zionists and criminals.\n\nThe company's review found that in some instances, references to groups with protected characteristics as criminals are \"shorthand to refer to governments, soldiers, or other specific groups.\"\n\nThe company referred a group of cases with such criminal comparisons to its independent oversight board, which will provide the company's policy arm with guidance on how to treat such references under the hate speech policy.\n\nOriginal article source:Meta to remove more posts targeting 'Zionists' after updating hate speech policy\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The metaverse is still very much alive and well, creating opportunities for some of the top metaverse stocks.\n\nAt the moment, we’re seeing metaverse growth in gaming and e-commerce. We’re also seeing it in retail with IKEA and Nike (NYSE:NKE), for example. We’re seeing it with McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) latest jump into the metaverse. Plus, we’re seeing it in advertising, health and wellness, education and live entertainment.\n\nAccording to CoinTrust.com, the global metaverse market could grow 575% to nearly $500 billion by 2030.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut wait, there’s more.\n\nAs noted by TynMagazine.com, “According to Statista’s forecast, the total number of users in the metaverse landscape is projected to hit almost 2.6 billion by the end of the decade, four times more than the earlier forecast and three times more than this year. The total addressable market or the revenue opportunity for metaverse products and services in the conservative scenario, where 15% of the digital economy shifts to the metaverse, is expected to hit $1.9 trillion in this period.”\n\nThat said, I’d use every dip in metaverse stocks as a buying opportunity.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to top metaverse stocks, Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) will always be a top pick.\n\nFor one, multiple companies are working with Roblox to jump into the metaverse. That includes Nike, Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), Gucci, McDonald’s and Forever 21 — to name a few. Two, Roblox is the closest thing to a mainstream metaverse. It builds out a human co-experience platform that enables billions of users to come together to play, learn, communicate and explore.\n\nThree, recent earnings negativity appears to have been priced into the rebounding stock. Plus, analysts are bullish. Macquarie initiated coverage of RBLX with an Outperform rating, noting it’s one of the main “building blox” of the metaverse.\n\nMoffettNathanson also upgraded the stock with a $26 target after the sell-off in the stock. Better, as RBLX continues to pivot higher with the metaverse story, it’s a strong buy.\n\nLast trading at $39.82, the company just refilled its earnings gap in early May. From this price, I’d like to see RBLX run back to $47 a share initially.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecent weakness in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also a strong buy opportunity. Currently trading at $128.20, I’d like to see NVDA trade closer to $150 in the near term.\n\nWhile it’s been driven by artificial intelligence, demand for its chips and strong earnings growth, it’s also exposed to the metaverse with its Omniverse software.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith it, companies can create and test virtual environments all in real-time. Foxconn, for example, is using the Omniverse to create a digital twin of its new factory in Guadalajara to train robots in a virtual environment.\n\nHelping, analysts at UBS (NYSE:UBS) say NVDA could earn $5 a share in 2025 as budgets for hyper-scalers begin to firm up. The firm also has a $150 price target.\n\nWolfe Research also raised its price target to $150, “noting that recent checks indicate a path to 50% or more content growth for Nvidia’s GPUs in 2025, with incremental upside coming from unit growth and better networking attach rates,” as reported by Seeking Alpha.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) Metaverse stock. gaming cryptos\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you’d rather diversify with an exchange-traded fund (ETF), there’s also the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF holds 40 metaverse-related holdings, all of which should benefit from the metaverse’s potential $5 trillion impact by 2030. Some of its top holdings include Nvidia, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Roblox, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).\n\nFueling upside, “The Metaverse’s economic reach is anticipated to hit an impressive $10.7 trillion by 2033, signaling an era of unprecedented expansion,” said RoundHill Investments.\n\nTwo, “VR/AR headset shipments are forecasted to reach 31.1 million by 2026, indicating steady industry growth and market traction.”\n\nBoth could help fuel a significant upside for METV.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Markets might feel unstoppable, but it's important not to get complacent.\n\n\"There's definitely some level of froth [in markets],\" Fed Watch Advisors founder Ben Emons told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen here). \"There's a lot of liquidity in the market. You see speculation through these meme stocks — so that's happening.\"\n\nEmons suggests investors use this moment to reduce concentration risk in your portfolio, or take some profits in a stock that has surged this year and as a result is weighted too heavily.\n\nThe S&P 500 hit 35 record closing highs on Monday. From a trailing price-to-earnings (PE) ratio perspective, the S&P 500 is trading at 28 times compared to a historical mean of about 15 times.\n\nThe “Buffett Indicator” as it’s called in Wall Street circles — which takes the Wilshire 5000 Index (viewed as the total stock market) and divides it by the annual U.S. GDP — is now at a record high.\n\nWarren Buffett's favorite indicator stands at about 196.2% — up sharply from 137% or so from September 2022 lows.\n\nThe figure is well above the 159.2% seen just before the dot-com bubble.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of Apple (AAPL) have gained a cool 30% since April, allowing it to take back the mantle as world's most valuable company ($3.55 trillion market cap) from chip beast Nvidia (NVDA) ($3.15 trillion market cap).\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT), Apple, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are all trading at record high valuations. The top 10 companies in the S&P 500 make up 35% of the market cap but only 23% of earnings, according to data from Apollo (the parent company of Yahoo Finance) chief economist Torsten Slok.\n\nSeemingly everywhere one looks, the market is beginning to feel too hot, given the near-term risks such as a contentious presidential election cycle. The outlook for interest rate policy from the Fed also remains uncertain, and corporate earnings are only seen rising by a single-digit percentage in the second quarter.\n\nPros are beginning to line up on the other side of the trade amid those risks, and are calling for a swift and steep pullback.\n\nMorgan Stanley's top strategist Mike Wilson warned this week of a 10% pullback in stocks ahead of the election. Wilson is among the experts on the worried about current stock valuations.\n\nAnd Nvidia's stock caught a rare downgrade to neutral by New Street Research on valuation concerns.\n\nWhile there is no proverbial crystal ball on markets or individual stocks, Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods said on Opening Bid that 10% pullbacks happen once a year on average.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We had a 14% pullback last year,” reminded Woods.\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled, market-focused conversations and chats with the biggest names in business on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Meta Expands Policy to Remove More Posts Attacking ‘Zionists’",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta Platforms Inc. will start removing more posts that attack “Zionists” when the term is used to represent Jewish people or Israelis more generally.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMicrosoft Orders China Staff to Use iPhones for Work and Drop Android Biden’s Biggest Donors Left Powerless to Sway Him to End Bid Saudis Warned G-7 Against Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat Zyn Imitators Rush In as Online Sales Halt Worsens US Shortage Rich Chinese Return to Hong Kong as Singapore Steps Up Scrutiny\n\nMeta usually removes posts that attack a person based on a “protected characteristic,” such as their race, nationality or religion, though political affiliation doesn’t fall into that protected class. While Zionism is considered by many to be a political movement to establish a formal Jewish state in the Middle East, the company said that people are also using the term “Zionist” to refer to Jewish or Israeli people more broadly.\n\n“We will remove content attacking ‘Zionists’ when it is not explicitly about the political movement, but instead uses antisemitic stereotypes, or threatens other types of harm through intimidation, or violence directed against Jews or Israelis under the guise of attacking Zionists,” Meta wrote Tuesday in a blog post.\n\nMeta previously considered the term “Zionist” as a proxy for Jewish people in very narrow or explicit cases, like if Zionists were compared to rats, according to the blog post. This change in policy expands what could be a violation to phrases where “Jew” or “Israeli” are not mentioned.\n\nUse of “Zionists” on Meta’s services was more formally reviewed over the last several months, though the company has considered how best to police the term for the past three years, said Neil Potts, vice president of public policy for Meta. Potts and colleagues have consulted 145 “stakeholders” over the past three years, including academics and civil rights experts from around the world, to help decide how to address the term on its platforms. The company has also asked its external Oversight Board to weigh in on “how to treat comparisons between Zionists and criminals (e.g., ‘Zionists are war criminals’).”\n\nMeta acknowledges that policing the new rule could be a challenge. “There is nothing approaching a global consensus on what people mean when they use the term ‘Zionist,’” according to the blog post. But Meta will remove posts when the term is calling for physical harm, dehumanizing Zionists by comparing them to animals or “filth,” or suggesting Zionists are “running the world or controlling the media.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe expanded policy comes nine months after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing more than a thousand people and taking several hundred others hostage. The two sides are still at war, and Meta has made several policy changes in that time to cut down on posts showing violence from the attack or praising support for Hamas, which the US and European Union classify as a terrorist organization.\n\n(Updates with comment from blog post. A previous version of this story was corrected to clarify term that is prohibited is ‘Zionist’ not ‘Zionism’)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk’s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia—With a Catch The Rich Investor Club Is Getting Crowded How Stocks Became the Game That Record Numbers of Americans Are Playing How to Invest During a High Interest Rate Era\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Meta Platforms META shares hit a 52-week high of $542.81 on Jul 8 and finally closed at $529.32, up 49.5% year to date. Its shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet Software industry’s gain of 19% and the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 29.2% over the same time frame.\r\n\r\nMETA is riding on strong advertising revenue growth prospects. In the first quarter of 2024, advertising revenues increased 26.8% year over year to $35.64 billion and accounted for 97.8% of revenues. At constant currency, advertising revenues increased 26% year over year.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ offerings — WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and Facebook — currently reach more than three billion people daily. Its staggering reach and increasing ad impressions (up 20% year over year in first-quarter 2024) make META one of the most important players in the digital ad sales market apart from Google and YouTube parent Alphabet GOOGL.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ advertising revenues are expected to benefit from strong spending by advertisers as they leverage META’s growing AI prowess.\n\nMETA YTD Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2024 advertising revenues is currently pegged at $37.39 billion, suggesting 33.1% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for 2024 advertising revenues is currently pegged at $155.08 billion, indicating 17.5% growth over 2023.\n\nMETA Integrates AI Tools in its Offerings\n\nMeta Platforms has been leveraging AI and machine learning to boost the potency of its social-media offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Threads.\r\n\r\nCurrently, 30% of the posts on Facebook feed are delivered by its AI recommendation system. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 175 million monthly actives.  Meta Platforms\n\nImage Source: Meta Platforms\n\nMETA is now incorporating AI tools into WhatsApp to make businesses more customer-oriented. The rapid adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) is transforming conversational messaging platforms like WhatsApp to perform conversational commerce, including transactions like ride-hailing and grocery purchases.\r\n\r\nThe AI tools will enable businesses to help customers find new products. META is training AI to help businesses quickly answer the most popular questions they receive from customers on WhatsApp. AI integration will help businesses create ads on Facebook and Instagram.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is leveraging AI to boost Facebook’s appeal among young adults, a demography that prefers Alphabet’s YouTube and Snap’s SNAP Snapchat.\r\n\r\nPowered by cutting-edge AI, META is offering user-centric features, positioning Facebook as a platform that resonates with young adults. It has upgraded Reels and Feed ranking technologies, resulting in better content recommendations. A newly developed model architecture allows for efficient learning from large datasets, significantly improving the performance of Facebook Reels.\n\nStory continues\n\nHigher Spending to Keep Margins Under Pressure\n\nMeta Platforms now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\nFull-year 2024 total expenses are now expected between $96 and $99 billion, up from its prior outlook of $94-$99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs.\r\n\r\nCapital expenditures are projected to be in the range of $35-$40 billion, up from the prior range of $30-$37 billion for 2024. Meta Platforms expects that capex will continue to increase in 2025, driven by ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is currently pegged at $158.97 billion, indicating 17.84% growth over 2023. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $20.15 per share, down by a cent over the past 30 days, suggesting 35.51% year-over-year growth.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revision Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nMeta Platforms’ AI focus bodes well for its long-term prospects. However, higher investments in AI infrastructure development are expected to keep margins under pressure in the near term.\r\n\r\nGrowing regulatory concerns don’t bode well for META’s prospects. It is suffering from privacy regulations in Europe and the United States and is also expected to face antitrust issues in its usage of AI.\r\n\r\nMoreover, META is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month P/S of 7.91X compared with the Zacks Internet Software industry’s 2.76X and higher than the median of 6.21X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\r\n\r\nHence, investors should wait for a better entry point for Meta Platforms, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "content": "Cathie Wood was the hottest money manager in the game in 2020. Her Ark Invest family of funds offered investors blistering returns on their money. At one point, she more than doubled their money in a year. She has run hot and cold since.\n\nLast year, she was white hot, but in 2024, the investing guru has cooled off again. All of her funds are trailing both the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 by double-digit percentages.\n\nThat suggests there are many undervalued Cathie Wood stocks to choose from. While she is known for her big, bold bets on stocks that could pay off big time down the road, the three companies below offer some of the best values today. They might be worth a position in your own portfolio at these levels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPayPal Holdings (PYPL) PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayments platform PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) is the first undervalued Cathie Wood stock to consider. The stock is down almost 3% this year and 11% over the last 12 months but possesses several levers it can pull to grow once more.\n\nThe payments space is crowded. Where PayPal once held the field to itself, it now competes against Block (NYSE:SQ), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The latter wants to muscle its way in with more robust offerings. Last month, it introduced Tap to Cash, which allows iPhone users to transfer funds by tapping their devices against other iPhones. It will also let iPhone users access third-party buy now, pay later options when using Apple Pay. It shut down its own Apple Pay Later offering.\n\nYet, PayPal still dominates the market with a 45% share of global online payment processing technologies. That is more than the next 12 largest rivals combined, and its share is even bigger when you add in Venmo and Braintree. Payment volume is also accelerating, up 14% in the first quarter to $404 billion.\n\nPayPal is also launching an ad platform for marketers. While something of a “me too” product as everyone wants to be an ad platform these days, having insight into the spending habits of people using the service should provide a competitive edge.\n\nPYPL stock trades at 14 times next year’s earnings or less than Wall Street’s long-term earnings growth forecasts and 12x the free cash flow (FCF) it generates. It makes PayPal a leading undervalued Cathie Wood stock to buy today.\n\nIncyte (INCY) incy stock\n\nSource: Eyesonmilan / Shutterstock.com\n\nBiotech stock Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) has been on a roller coaster ride but recently landed 8% below where it was a year ago. That is an excellent buy-in price. Its lead hematology drug, Jakafi, continues to grow, generating $572 million in the first quarter. Although that was actually down 1% from a year ago, it was due to a $55 million inventory reduction. The therapy is still on a steady growth path of mid-single-digit gains.\n\nStory continues\n\nIncyte’s second-biggest drug, the dermatology therapy Opzelura, saw sales shoot 51% higher to almost $86 million. It should move even higher, as it launched in Europe. The biotech also completed its acquisition of Escient Pharmaceuticals. It now has a solid portfolio of existing treatments, a pipeline of promising therapies, and new additions like povorcitinib and new oral drug candidates from Escient.\n\nINCY stock trades at a significant discount to Wall Street’s $72 per share one-year price target. Going for just 12 times next year’s earnings, a fraction of its projected earnings growth rate, and 16x FCF, Incyte looks to have tremendous upside.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a stock up 54% this year and 83% of the past year, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) doesn’t present as the typical undervalued Cathie Wood stock. Shares also trade at 27 times estimates and 9 times revenue — hardly the bargain-basement stock you would expect.\n\nHowever, Wall Street expects Meta earnings to grow at double the rate they grew over the past five years as many of the initiatives it put into place gain traction. Meta Platforms’ long-term earnings are expected to expand 30% a year compared to less than 15% over the past five years.\n\nMost notable is Meta’s investments in artificial intelligence. The social media platform increased the budgets for both its operating expenses and capital spending for the rest of the year, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying it is important for Meta to “invest significantly more in the coming years.”\n\nInitially, the market recoiled at Meta’s AI ambitions, remembering the sinkhole for cash its metaverse plans created. But possessing some of the most powerful large language models around, Meta’s Llama-based AI agent is targeting the consumer side of the equation. Most AI models are for commercial purposes, and Meta Platforms’ distinction gives it a competitive leg up.\n\nWith AI proliferation, Meta’s dominant social media presence, and earnings growth potential, META stock seems poised to grow into its current valuation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "35% of the S&amp;P 500 Is Concentrated in the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Here's What That Means for Your Portfolio.",
        "content": "Mega-cap growth stocks continue to dominate the broader market and contribute the bulk of gains in the major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. But the sheer value of some of the largest companies might surprise you.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a term coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe seven industry-leading tech-focused companies: Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nThese seven companies are now so valuable that they make up a combined 35.5% of the S&P 500. Here's what these changing market dynamics mean for the stock market and how to position your portfolio in a way that matches your risk tolerance and helps you achieve your investment objectives. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA double-edged sword\n\nThe S&P 500 is up over 44% since the end of 2022. The primary reason is that the sectors containing Magnificent Seven stocks are outperforming the S&P 500 as a whole, while the other eight sectors are underperforming. ^IXT Chart\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia are in the tech sector. Alphabet and Meta Platforms lead the communications sector. And Amazon and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector.\n\nLarge stocks can move the market when they put up monster gains, especially if you factor in sizable companies that fall outside the Magnificent Seven -- such as Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), which is now valued at more than $800 billion  and is up more than threefold since the end of 2022. MSFT Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are so valuable that they can single-handedly spark a so-called correction in the S&P 500. A correction is a fall of 10% to 20% in a major market index, so an average decline of 28% in the Magnificent Seven would put the S&P 500 in correction territory. That math doesn't even factor in sizable stocks like Broadcom that would likely fall in lockstep with a major sell-off in Nvidia and other tech stocks.\n\nIn this vein, the Magnificent Seven's influence extends beyond their weight in the S&P 500. The group has been driving monster gains in the index during the past 18 months or so, but the larger it becomes, the more vulnerable the market will be to a growth-driven sell-off.\n\nExpectations are high\n\nNo matter your investment time horizon or risk tolerance, it's important to be aware of the S&P 500's composition, especially when it undergoes a significant makeover. The index changes based on the economy's evolution and investor sentiment. In other words, it's a moving target, or benchmark, driven by different themes at different times.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome investors might be nervous about the market's relatively expensive price tag, with the S&P 500's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sitting at almost 29. Even if the market rally is overextended, putting new capital to work -- even at record highs -- has historically been a winning strategy for investors.\n\nThere's also a case to be made that the market deserves to be more expensive. If the S&P 500 grows earnings faster because the weighting of growth stocks increases, then it would stand to reason the P/E ratio should be higher as well.\n\nInvesting is more about where a company is headed than where it is today. And so far, mega-cap growth stocks have mostly delivered on earnings growth. For example, Amazon is still not terribly overvalued despite seeing its stock price more than double during the past 18 months.\n\nA high P/E basically means that investors are willing to pay a higher price for a company relative to its earnings today because they expect earnings to be higher in the future. However, if growth slows and expectations come down, it can lead to a sizable sell-off.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the S&P 500's valuation has become based increasingly on future potential earnings, whereas a few decades ago, the most valuable companies -- consumer staples giants, banks, and oil and gas businesses -- were valued more on their past earnings. Outsize gains could continue if companies deliver the growth that investors expect, but there could also be higher volatility in the market.\n\nBuild a portfolio that's right for you\n\nGiven the expensive valuation of the S&P 500 and its puny 1.3% dividend yield, value- and income-focused investors could consider integrating quality dividend stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into a diversified portfolio.\n\nAs a starting point, Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) trade at discounts to the S&P 500, are both Dividend Kings (with over 50 consecutive years of dividend increases), and both have dividend yields of more than 3%.\n\nThe SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF(NYSEMKT: DIA) mirrors the performance of that index and has a 1.8% yield and a 23.3 P/E -- making it a good option for folks looking to stick with blue chip stocks but through a value lens.\n\nThere are plenty of low-cost Vanguard ETFs that can provide a lifetime of passive income, such as the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF(NYSEMKT: VYM), Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF(NYSEMKT: VDC), and the Vanguard Utilities ETF(NYSEMKT: VPU). Targeting lower-growth, higher-yield sectors can be an effective way to balance a portfolio that is heavily allocated in growth stocks.\n\nAdjusting with the times\n\nAt first glance, the market might look overvalued because the S&P 500 has an inflated P/E ratio. But that's mostly because it is now heavily weighted in surging mega-cap growth stocks.\n\nPlenty of pockets of the market are teeming with quality value and income stocks. Now is the perfect time for investors to conduct a portfolio review and update their watch lists to ensure they hit their passive-income goals while aligning their investments with their risk tolerance.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "3 Cash-Rich Stocks to Steady Your Shaky Portfolio",
        "content": "Amid an overbought market and expectations of prolonged higher interest rates, cash-rich stocks have emerged as prudent investments. These firms generate substantial free cash flows, crucial for managing debt effectively across business cycles.\n\nHolding a substantial amount of cash on a company’s balance sheet allows for flexibility. Whether that’s investing in AI for today or simply having the ability to weather any economic storm that may come, this cash is very valuable for certain investor types.\n\nMany investors are focused on building a stable stream of returns. To do so, it’s important to focus on creating a lasting portfolio of enduring companies rather than seeking quick riches.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese three cash-rich stocks have robust liquidity metrics, including cash-to-debt and quick ratios. So, for those seeking investments with strong balance sheets and growth prospects long-term, here are the companies I think are important to focus on right now.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has remained a top choice for investors who seek innovation. In recent decades, the company has put forward a product line that remains unraveled in terms of consumer discretionary products.\n\nWithin the company’s core ecosystem, which includes the iPhone, iPad and Macs, the company’s services revenue has continued to grow. This high-margin segment of the business is what largely drives the company’s cash flow over time and is what many look to for true underlying growth, particularly when it comes to profitability.\n\nApple’s cash hoard is one of the biggest out there, and it’s why massive investors (such as Warren Buffett, more on him later) continue to hold this stock. The company has used this cash pile to reinvest into its core business and pay dividends to investors, something many investors clearly like to see.\n\nIn recent quarters, this cash has been funneled primarily toward various AI initiatives, which have been crucial for Apple’s sales growth. Recent revenue had peaked and started declining, with annual iPhone updates offering minimal changes. Users, known for delaying upgrades, awaited significant improvements. AI could catalyze revenue growth, marking the most significant iPhone innovation since 5G.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt has been six decades since Warren Buffett bought Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) when it was still a struggling textile company. Buffett closed the operations in 1985 and transformed it into a diversified holding company, now holding hundreds of billions of dollars in assets.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is among the companies Buffett has chosen as portfolio staples. Companies like Apple, a host of insurers, railroads and other industrial and large-cap cash cows litter the investor’s portfolio. These companies spit off cash faster than the company knows what to do with the funds, leading to outperformance over the long term and overall portfolio stability.\n\nSo, it’s unsurprising that Berkshire continues to outperform from an earnings standpoint. In Q1 2024, Berkshire’s revenue reached $89.9 billion and operating profit reached $11.22 billion — surging 39%. Buffett highlighted its operating earnings and strong insurance underwriting and investment income. There are so many factors that make this stock a good long-term investment to hold. Buffett’s hand-picked team stands ready to take the reins when it is time, but for now, investors can rest easy knowing the companies in this portfolio are among the best in the world.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPivoting towards AI from the metaverse, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is now more focused on driving profitability and long-term growth via avenues investors agree with. Yes, the company’s Meta Quest headset is among the company’s core focal points right now. But Meta is now aiming to cater to varied consumer budgets amid economic pressures, potentially with the Quest 3S. That strategy contrasts Apple’s focus on affordability over advanced features in their headset approach.\n\nMeta’s core social media empire continues to drive strong profitability and cash flow. This is a fact many investors clearly aren’t overlooking, with META stock seeing strong performance in recent weeks. The stock now trades near its all-time high, boosted by optimism over the company’s AI investments as well as its user engagement across all its platforms. Analysts noted that AI-driven algorithms were extending user app usage, per Bernstein.\n\nMeta has excelled in messaging but faces doubts about sustained social media earnings growth. That said, analysts remain bullish, citing AI and augmented reality as key long-term drivers for this company. For those looking a decade or two out, Meta remains a top pick I think is deserving of its Buy rating right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget A.I.

        "content": "Mobile phone users can view more high-quality short-form videos as a result of a new technological collaboration between Vodafone and Facebook parent company Meta.\n\nThe two firms said they have worked together to free up network capacity for mobile users – testing it in 11 regions in Europe – to cut network traffic and enable more people to watch better-quality videos.\n\nVodafone said it had freed up network space at popular 4G and 5G sites in busy locations, such as shopping centres and transport hubs, while Meta said it had made improvements to its video engineering and infrastructure deployment systems, resulting in better optimisation and efficiency.\n\nThe two companies said they had conducted an initial three-week test in the UK in April, and were now open to working with other firms to expand the use of the technology, saying it would help keep critical networks free of congestion and save energy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeta also owns Instagram, which is known for its short-form videos as well as image-based posts.\n\nAlberto Ripepi, chief network officer at Vodafone, said: “Meta’s willingness to optimise the delivery of video for its applications leads the way for a more efficient use of existing network resources.\n\n“Vodafone and Meta have implemented these optimisations across Vodafone’s European markets and intend to continue collaborating to foster additional efficiencies.”\n\nMeta vice president of network engineering Gaya Nagarajan said: “Our relationship with Vodafone is a long-term partnership, and collaboration on video optimisation is an opportunity to drive innovation and shape the future of the internet.\n\n“We are committed to continuing our collaboration with innovative partners like Vodafone, device manufacturers, equipment vendors and the wider digital ecosystem, to push the boundaries of video optimisation.”",

        "content": "In the latest market close, Meta Platforms (META) reached $529.32, with a -1.96% movement compared to the previous day. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.1%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.08%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.28%.\n\nThe social media company's stock has climbed by 9.52% in the past month, exceeding the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 8.41% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.08%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Meta Platforms will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on July 31, 2024. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $4.66, showcasing a 44.27% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $38.15 billion, reflecting a 19.22% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $20.15 per share and a revenue of $158.97 billion, signifying shifts of +35.51% and +17.84%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Sell in July Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "The metaverse is a collective virtual shared space, merging emerging technology fields like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) with the connective tissue of the internet. On a metaverse platform, users can interact with one another through avatars. However, it is important to note that the idea of a metaverse is still relatively novel and only gained traction in the early 2020s, driven by advancements in VR, blockchain and social media. The social media giant Facebook, rebranded as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) have invested heavily in developing metaverse platforms.\n\nNowadays, as the market and technology world is reeling from the hype around generative artificial intelligence (AI), interest in the metaverse has definitely waned. Meta, for example, is looking to expand its reach in AI technologies and has put the whole metaverse idea on the back burner.\n\nThat all means investors should dump some metaverse stocks to sell. Below are just three of them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is an online software platform that has empowered game developers and content creators to design, implement and share 3-D experiences to users worldwide. The platform supports a wide range of platforms, including mobile devices, PCs, consoles and AR/VR headsets. This versatility is crucial for the metaverse, which aims to provide seamless experiences across different devices and environments. Unity Software’s deep exposure to the 3-D design space endowed the company with the right set of tools to take on the burgeoning metaverse space.\n\nWay back in 2021, Unity Software entered a partnership with UFC, which focused on bringing sports to the metaverse, allowing fans to experience live sports events in immersive 3D environments. Furthermore, Unity Reflect assists engineers in developing realistic, virtual environments for building and architecture lifecycles.\n\nHowever, in recent years, Unity Software has struggled to expand earnings and revenue amidst a broader slowdown in the gaming sector. In the company’s first-quarter results for fiscal year 2024, revenue was $460 million, down 8% year-over-year. Unity shares have collapsed 61% for the year, and a shaky macroeconomic environment could continue to move shares downward.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox has incredibly transformed into a global online entertainment platform over the past several years. In particular, the tech firm offers Roblox Studio, a free toolset that allows developers and content creators to build, publish and operate 3D experiences, while Roblox Client allows users to explore 3D experience. Roblox’s virtual platform thrives on its virtual economy, underpinned by its virtual currency — Robux. This virtual currency generates a high level of user engagement and stickiness for the platform, and that’s key to building any kind of metaverse experience. The online gaming platform has 77.7 million daily active users, as of its latest earnings release.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnfortunately, similar to Unity Software, Roblox has suffered from sluggish gains in its key performance indicators (KPIs) as gaming monetization has become difficult amidst the poor macroeconomic environment and the slowing economy. In fact, in the company’s first-quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2024, revenue and earnings came below Wall Street estimates. Roblox’s net loss, in particular, saw no meaningful improvements from the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.\n\nRBLX shares are down more than 13% year-to-date, and without significant reductions to Roblox’s net losses, shares are unlikely to make a strong rebound.\n\nFastly (FSLY) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Fastly (FSLY) website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nFastly (NYSE:FSLY) is an edge cloud computing platform that provides infrastructure as a service (IaaS) technology, empowering developers to create and deliver digital experiences. Edge cloud computing refers to a technique for distributing data closer to the original source of that data or near the edge of a data network. Because edge devices process and prepare data locally, there are fewer bandwidth and latency issues. The New York Times, for example, uses Fastly to handle the high traffic volumes that come with breaking news and major events. Because Fastly is an important enabler of streaming services, the company will surely play a role in creating the metaverse. That is to say, as metaverse content proliferates, demand for quick content delivery mechanisms will also be high.\n\nUnfortunately, the company has suffered from slowing earnings and revenue growth in recent fiscal quarters. An ongoing class action lawsuit, which alleged Fastly misled investors on its financial guidance, tanked the edge platform’s share price. FSLY shares have plummeted 58% since the start of 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Meta Platform’s META shares have surged 52.5% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s rise of 29.6%. The upside has been primarily driven by a robust portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass and mixed reality device Quest 3.\r\n\r\nThreads, since its launch has gained significant momentum. In the past year, it has garnered more than 175 million monthly active users. With more than 50 million topic tags created globally, the platform has fostered strong communities and friendly conversations.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is successfully leveraging AI to boost engagement across its platforms including Threads, Facebook and Instagram. META’s AI recommendation system delivered 30% of the posts on the Facebook feed in first quarter of 2024. More than 50% of the content seen on Instagram is now AI-recommended.\n\nExpanding Portfolio Aid META’s Prospects\n\nMETA’s social media platform, Threads continues to evolve as a go-to platform for sharing diverse interests and perspectives in real-time, with a strong emphasis on user interaction through text, photos and videos.\r\n\r\nIndia has become one of the most active countries for Threads with popular topics including film, TV, OTT content, celebrity conversations and sports, reflecting its role as a catalyst for fostering community and friendly conversations. This bodes well for META’s prospects in the country.\r\n\r\nFurther expanding its portfolio in June, Meta Platforms partnered with the National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) to launch an ‘AI Enablement for MSMEs’ program. The program aims to empower tech-enabled micro, small and medium enterprises in India through AI awareness, capacity building and access to resources.\r\n\r\nMETA is also advancing its generative AI capabilities with Meta Llama, providing users with more interactive and personalized experiences.\r\n\r\nIn April, Meta Platforms announced that Meta Llama 3-powered Meta AI will be launched in English in more than a dozen countries outside the United States. Meta AI, the intelligent AI assistant, can be used on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.\r\n\r\nMETA expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the most extensive AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern for its top-line growth.\r\n\r\nFor second-quarter 2024, META expects total revenues to be between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, assuming an unfavorable forex impact of 1% to year-over-year revenue growth.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2024 revenues is currently pegged at $38.15 billion, indicating 19.22% year-over-year growth.

        "title": "Companies Paid Their Investors $16 Billion More in Dividends Last Quarter. These 2 Magnificent Stocks Helped Drive the Increase.",
        "content": "Companies have been increasingly generous in distributing a portion of their profits to shareholders over the past year. U.S. companies paid a net $16 billion more in dividends during the second quarter, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That was slightly more than the net increase in the first quarter and about four times higher than in the prior-year period.\n\nMany companies contributed to the increase by initiating a dividend or raising their payout. However, two companies stood out as the biggest drivers of the boost in dividend payments last quarter: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Here's a closer look at these two magnificent dividend stocks.\n\nA monster dividend\n\nTech titan and \"Magnificent Seven\" member Alphabet initiated a regular quarterly dividend in late April. It made its first payment of $0.20 per share in mid-June.\n\nAlphabet's initial dividend seems small relative to its stock price (it currently has a 0.4% dividend yield, well below the S&P 500's 1.3% yield). However, it's massive on an absolute basis. It will cost the company about $10 billion per year. That made it the most meaningful contributor to the second quarter's increase in dividend payments.\n\nThe technology giant can easily afford that monster payment. The company generated $16.8 billion in free cash flow during the first quarter alone. It also had $108 billion of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet against a mere $13.2 billion of long-term debt. That strong financial position enabled the company to add a whopping $70 billion to its share repurchase program.\n\nAlphabet's initial dividend is likely only the starting point. Given the company's financial strength and earnings growth (more than 50% in the first quarter), it should be able to steadily increase its dividend payment in the future.\n\nAnother magnificent dividend\n\nAlphabet's dividend initiation followed in the footsteps of fellow Magnificent Seven member Meta Platforms, which initiated a dividend during the first quarter. The social media giant is paying $0.50 per share each quarter.\n\nLike Alphabet, Meta Platforms' dividend might seem small at first glance, given its low 0.4% dividend yield. However, its total payments will tally a massive $4.4 billion per year. That's the second-highest absolute dividend increase this year, more than double the newly minted dividends of Salesforce ($1.5 billion) and Booking Holdings ($1.2 billion). Add that trio to Alphabet's recently initiated payment, and 53% of this year's net increase in dividends has come from those four new dividend stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms can also easily afford to pay its mammoth dividend. The company generated $12.5 billion in free cash flow during the first quarter and had $58.1 billion of cash, equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet. The company's robust financial position is giving it the flexibility to invest heavily in AI while also returning generous amounts of cash to shareholders through its recently initiated dividend and share repurchase program (Meta bought back $14.6 billion in shares during the first quarter while paying about $1.3 billion in dividends).\n\nThe company is in an excellent position to increase its dividend in the future. In addition to its strong financial profile, Meta's earnings are growing briskly (over 110% increase in the first quarter). The company's heavy investment in AI could drive robust future growth.\n\nCompanies are doling out more dividends\n\nCompanies in the S&P 500 are on track to pay 6% more in dividends this year. That's an acceleration from last year's increase (5.2%), thanks in part to the recently initiated dividends from Magnificent Seven members Meta Platforms and Alphabet.\n\nThat upward trend in dividend payments appears likely to continue. Many companies, especially large technology companies, are flush with cash and briskly growing their free cash flow. That puts them in an excellent position to continue lining their investors' pockets with higher dividend payments. So, if you're looking to make some extra money, investing in dividend stocks could be your ticket to a steadily rising passive income stream.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Is Now the Best-Performing Stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average In 2024. Is It a Buy Around Its All-Time High?",
        "content": "Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average in late February -- giving the traditionally stodgy, income-oriented index more exposure to growth.\n\nAmazon has continued its torrid run since 2023. As of June 27, it is the best-performing stock in the index.\n\nHere's why Amazon continues to climb higher and whether the growth stock is worth buying around its all-time high. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon is gushing cash\n\nBefore changing its name to Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Google was named after its flagship search engine. But YouTube is arguably Alphabet's crown jewel. Facebook was named after its flagship social media app, but then changed its name to Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Instagram is arguably more valuable than Facebook today. Similarly, Amazon is named after its only retail outlet, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) is where much of the value lies.\n\nAWS is the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure. According to HG Insights 2023 Infrastructure as a Service Market Report, AWS had a 50.1% market share among the top 10 cloud providers and the highest year-over-year customer count growth at 31%. AWS has been tapping into start-ups, with 86% of AWS customers spending less than $1,000 a month on AWS services -- according to HG Insights.\n\nThe impact of AWS on the broader business is undeniable. Here's a look at Amazon's trailing-12-month (TTM) results as of the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same periods over the last five years.\n\nMetric Q1 2020 TTM Q1 2021 TTM Q1 2022 TTM Q1 2023 TTM Q1 2024 TTM North America revenue $181.09 billion $254.52 billion $284.71 billion $323.52 billion $362.29 billion North America operating income $6.06 billion $10.79 billion $2.25 billion ($381 million) $18.96 billion International revenue $77.64 billion $115.96 billion $125.9 billion $118.37 billion $134.01 billion International operating income ($2 billion) $2.37 billion ($3.46 billion) ($7.71 billion) $903 million AWS revenue $37.55 billion $48.65 billion $67.14 billion $83 billion $94.44 billion AWS operating income $10.05 billion $14.62 billion $20.89 billion $21.45 billion $28.93 billion\n\nData source: Amazon.\n\nNotice the inconsistent operating income from Amazon's North America and international segments, as well as the somewhat sluggish top-line growth. Meanwhile, AWS has been a juggernaut, with TTM operating income increasing nearly threefold in just five years.\n\nThe most impressive metric in this table is that AWS operating income has grown faster than AWS revenue, suggesting that margins are improving. Not long ago, one of the biggest red flags for Amazon's investment thesis was that AWS couldn't keep up its margins in the face of mounting competition. But the results tell a different story and are likely a reason why the stock has been crushing the market as of late.\n\nStory continues AMZN Chart\n\nA higher-quality business\n\nAmazon is notorious for reinvesting profits back into the company. So using net income-based metrics like the price-to-earnings ratio can be unhelpful. Traditionally, Amazon's go-to metric was its price-to-sales ratio, which is the value of a company compared to its revenue. In the following chart, you'll notice that Amazon's P/S ratio is higher than historical levels -- suggesting the stock is more expensive. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe P/S ratio can be useful when dealing with a consistent business over a period of time. But the issue with using it to evaluate Amazon is that the company is fundamentally different today than it was even two to three years ago because of the growth of AWS. That's why I think the best way to value Amazon is by looking at its P/S ratio within the context of its operating income and operating margin. AMZN Cash from Operations (TTM) Chart\n\nThis chart is perhaps the simplest way to visualize Amazon's success. Amazon's TTM operating income is nearly $100 billion, and its operating margin is at a 10-year high thanks to AWS and a rebound in its North America and international segments.\n\nPaying a 3.53 P/S ratio for a high-growth, low-margin business is one thing. But that same ratio for a company growing its top line and expanding margins is entirely different.\n\nThe biggest bull case for Amazon is that it is within striking distance of its historical P/S ratio, but the quality of the business is vastly improved, and it is on a path toward consistent profitability. After all, analyst consensus estimates call for $4.55 in 2024 earnings per share (EPS) and $5.78 in 2025 EPS -- giving Amazon a 34.1 P/E based on 2025 estimated earnings. That's not a sky-high valuation -- especially when considering the stock is up 130% in 18 months.\n\nAmazon is stretched thin but is still a good buy\n\nAmazon is at the top of its game, but its stock chart reflects that. Warren Buffett once said, \"You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.\" In other words, consensus positivity toward a company usually results in an expensive stock price, just as an out-of-favor stock can be quite cheap.\n\nLess than two years ago, Amazon was under immense pressure due to slowing growth and recession fears. It was the opposite of a cheery consensus. Today, Amazon is, once again, a darling. But the long-term investment thesis has also gotten stronger as AWS continues to be a high-margin growth engine that can fuel the company's other exploits.\n\nAll told, Amazon is a decent buy, but it is no longer the no-brainer buy it was before. It still must grow into its valuation and prove its higher margins aren't a one-off. If growth slows, expect Amazon to be under pressure.\n\nThe higher a stock runs up in the short term, the more its valuation gets stretched. But over the long term, Amazon certainly has the trajectory needed to compound earnings and benefit patient investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Will Meta Platforms Do a Stock Split in 2024?",
        "content": "News of a stock split can raise interest in a company, even though it really doesn't have any significant impact on the underlying investment. But whether it makes a real impact or not is beside the point because stock splits normally create buzz around a stock.\n\nOne stock that might be feeling left out these days is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), formerly known as Facebook, which hasn't done a split yet. But the social media company has seen its share price rise significantly since 2023 and is now trading at more than $500 per share. Is a split likely coming this year?\n\nMeta is no stranger to jumping on the hype\n\nWhether it's copying new features from its rivals, getting in on the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) by launching its own assistant, or trying to create its own cryptocurrency, Meta often likes to join the crowd. Deploying a stock split would appear to be par for the course, should the company decide to follow suit on that as well.\n\nAfter all, it's also the only company in the \"Magnificent Seven\" that hasn't yet done a stock split. Microsoft hasn't done one recently, but it has deployed multiple splits in its history.\n\nNow that Meta's price is around $500, it's at a high enough price for a split to be feasible, with the shares still trading at a fairly reasonable price afterward. Here are a few scenarios that could be likely:\n\nSplit Ratio Stock Price After Split 2 for 1 $250 3 for 1 $167 4 for 1 $125 5 for 1 $100 6 for 1 $83 7 for 1 $71 8 for 1 $63 9 for 1 $56 10 for 1 $50\n\nCalculations by author.\n\nIf Meta were to deploy a stock split, I would assume it wants to keep its price above at least $100. That has generally been around the target area for other tech stocks after a split. Chipmaker Nvidia recently did a 10-for-1 split, and its stock is trading for around $120.\n\nThere's definitely room for Meta to do a stock split and remain above the $100 mark. I wouldn't be surprised if the company were to announce one this year, especially if the stock continues to rally.\n\nInvestors should have bigger concerns than whether Meta does a stock split\n\nFor investors, what should ultimately matter is the outlook for the business in the long run, not whether the company is likely to announce a split. While its fundamentals are strong, with Meta reporting an impressive $45.8 billion in profit over the trailing 12 months, the company could face some challenges.\n\nIts growth rate has improved in the past year, but it wasn't all that long ago that the business looked to be in trouble and struggling to grow. I believe crackdowns on TikTok and Elon Musk's transformation of X, formerly Twitter, have played a role in the improvement. I don't believe Meta has suddenly found a button to turn on its growth and fix all of its problems.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's still also largely dependent on demand in the ad market, and that could soften if the economy goes into a recession. Meanwhile, as it continues to spend heavily on AI along with the metaverse and its Reality Labs division, its profit margin could also come back down. META Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nInvestors should tread carefully with Meta Platforms stock\n\nA stock split could give Meta's shares a boost, but it's not something investors will likely be able to rely on for continued gains. There's still plenty of risk and uncertainty surrounding the business: namely, whether its growth rate is truly sustainable in the long run.\n\nInvestors have seen how quickly the markets can turn on Meta when it isn't performing, after it fell by more than 60% in 2022.

        "content": "Intel And AMD Are Going For A Bigger Role In The AI Era, But At A Gradual Pace\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) undoubtedly had an early lead in the AI chip race, but its rivals are doing their best to challenge its dominance. After more than one failed attempt to discreetly enter the GPU arena, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), the largest producer of PC and server CPUs, might be slow but seems to be playing the long game. Then there’s Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) who is already promising to challenge Nvidia with its new chips.\n\nIntel is playing the long game.\n\nAccording to PassMark Software, Intel still controls 64% of the x86 CPU market, but it has undoubtedly given a lot of market share to AMD over the years. AMD pulled ahead with cheaper and more advanced CPUs while Intel struggled to manufacture smaller, denser, and more power-efficient CPUs on its own, grappling with delays and shortages.\n\nShares tumbled upon its latest quarterly report as sales were short of estimates and Intel provided a weak forecast for the current quarter. But, Gaudi 3 release is expected to bring in more than $500 million in sales during the second half of the year.\n\nIntel is also setting itself apart from AMD and Nvidia with competitive pricing. It is also betting big on becoming a leading player in the foundry market by opening chip fabs throughout the U.S., which is a costly move as Intel does not expect to break even on this front before 2027.\n\nBut, when it comes to AI, Intel is playing the long game. Intel launched new AI accelerators this year. It  started expanding its manufacturing capacity as it aims to become the leading AI chip fabricator. Intel made crucial changes to its business model, with these efforts and investments promising to result in significant benefits over the next decade. It is undoubtedly going for a bigger piece of the AI pie with the launch of Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 accelerators, which are capable of running AI workloads for data centers.\n\nAMD restructured its business to prioritize AI.\n\nLaunching its own AI GPUs and signing big fish clients like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), AMD's second-largest market share in GPUs position it well for the AI race. Also, AMD is capable of filling in the supply gaps that Nvidia might not be able to meet.\n\nBut even AMD didn’t provide an impressive earnings report. For the first quarter of 2024, revenue rose only 2% YoY to slightly over $5 billion and while it recorded revenue revenue gains of over 80% in its data center and client segments, client and gaming segments declined 40%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut in June, AMD introduced an upcoming series of chips. Expected to be available in 2025, the MI350 will be based on new chip architecture, promising to perform 35 times better in inference - the process of computing generative AI responses, compared to its currently available MI300 series. Additionally, AMD unveiled the MI400 series, which is scheduled for 2026 and will be based on an architecture called \"Next\".\n\nBut Nvidia is not staying still as also in June, it announced its next-generation AI chip platform called Rubin, it set to launch in 2026, and it would include GPUs, CPUs and networking chips. However, although the above companies are all at earlier stages of their AI journeys compared to Nvidia, this could also mean that they have more growth room to run.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Stocks are at record highs. Investors keep playing the hits.",
        "content": "Stocks are trading at record highs, and the market's main characters haven't changed.\n\nYahoo Finance's data whiz Jared Blikre flagged the stocks making new intraday record highs alongside the index on Friday. The names are a who's who of market leaders with only one exception — Nvidia stock (NVDA) was down after receiving a downgrade from New Street Research.\n\nApple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Costco (COST), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Walmart (WMT), on the other hand, all saw their stocks trade at intraday records on Friday.\n\nInvestors can maybe point to the soft jobs report and the prospect of lower interest rates as a catalyst for the move. At least for a chunk of these winners.\n\nTech was the biggest winner of low-interest-rate environments over the last decade, and the so-called hyperscalers in the AI race — Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet among them — are set to be the arms dealers should another speculative investment boom break out.\n\nBut on Wall Street, it appears that spending too much time in this market teasing out the fundamental particularities of why the same group of market leaders continues to lead the market is no longer a worthwhile exercise.\n\nTo wit: Piper Sandler's chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz on Wednesday dropped coverage of the S&P 500, writing that, \"Talking about the S&P 500 to communicate investment insights to institutional investors has become an exercise in futility.\"\n\nThe 10 biggest stocks in the index account for almost 40% of the index's market cap, Kantrowitz noted. And both the index's returns and earnings growth are being driven by this small handful of companies.\n\nRather than reflecting a broad swath of the corporate world's fortunes, then, the so-called benchmark stock index has become captive to the AI trade. For some, this is not a flaw of the index, but a feature, as argued by strategists at the BlackRock Investment Institute last week.\n\nSure, the S&P 500 may seem to tip out of balance, reflecting the fortunes of a privileged few over the more measured progress (or struggles) of the quieter majority. But the concept of an index is that investors can capture the market return in whatever form that takes.\n\nThis dynamic often benefits the DIY investor class looking for cheap exposure to \"the market,\" but it is a thorn in the side of portfolio managers who charge institutions more for their services as they seek to best the returns available to the masses.\n\nSaid another way, what institutional investors seek are returns — preferably returns that beat the market, of course — but most importantly, returns that do not come in whatever form the market takes. For big-money investors, safety is often paramount. And AI hype minting new multi-trillion dollar winners each week doesn't exactly scream safe by this measure.\n\nStory continues\n\nBack in 2020, before the pandemic turned markets upside down, we talked to Tom Lee at Fundstrat who saw the rally in Tesla (TSLA) stock that year as a sign of investors chasing their benchmark. Tesla stock, at the time, was responsible for a large chunk of the gains in the Russell 1000 Growth index (VONG), an index favored as the benchmark by many of Fundstrat's clients at the time.\n\nIn an effort to make up this gap, clients had a simple card to play: buy Tesla.\n\nFriday's market action — and much of what has been seen in stocks since May — seems reminiscent.\n\nBecause if the benchmark index is no longer a useful benchmark, a portfolio manager has a (seemingly) simple choice to make: either buy more of the stocks leading your benchmark, or find another way to explain your performance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- The S&P 500 closed at record highs Friday on bets that Federal Reserve rate rate cuts may soon be on the horizon after the June monthly jobs report pointing to cooling in the labor market.\n\nAt 15:43 ET (19:53 GMT), the S&P 500 gained 0.5% to a record high of 5,566.75 , the NASDAQ Composite climbed 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%, or 68 points.\n\nTreasury yields nosedive after payrolls point to cooling labor market\n\nTreasury yields came under pressure after the monthly jobs report for June showed the economy added 206,000 jobs last month, down from 218,000 in May, but the solid headline payrolls number was accompanied by \"sizeable downward revisions,\" Macquarie said, as jobs gains for the May and April were revised lower. Adding to signs of cooling labor market the the unemployment rate rose to 4.1%, from 4.0% in May, average hourly wage growth slowed, strengthening the case for a September rate cut.\n\n\"While for now our base case for a first cut remains December, it has become increasingly likely that one may occur earlier than this, with a reduction at the September meeting a strong possibility,\" Macquarie added.\n\nTraders now see a 70% of a rate cut in September, down from 60% in the prior week, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Too.\n\nThis cooling in the jobs market through June also comes after a series of weaker-than-expected labor market readings this week.\n\nMeta hits all time highs as tech adds to gians; Nvidia stumbles on downgrade, Tesla in China win\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) led the rise in big tech as the social media company soared more than 4% to hit record highs earlier in the day, with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also higher.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), down 2%, failed to partake in the broader market rally after New Street Research downgraded the stock to hold from buy, citing concerns about valuations.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock added 2% on reports that several state-owned firms in China's financial hub of Shanghai have recently purchased the EV manufacturer's best-selling Model Y as service cars after Tesla cars reportedly were added to the list Chinese local government purchase list.\n\nMacy's in fresh deal fever; Chinese EV stocks hit by new EU tarrifs\n\nMacy’s (NYSE:M) stock rose over 9% after the Wall Street Journal reported that Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management have raised their bid to buy the department store chain for about $6.9 billion.\n\nChinese EV stocks including Li Auto Inc (NASDAQ:LI), Nio Inc Class A ADR (NYSE:NIO) and Xpeng Inc (NYSE:XPEV) were sharplly lower after the European Union proposed increased tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China commended on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrypto stocks recover ground as Bitcoin pares some losses amid Mt. Gox supply wave fears\n\nCryptocurrency stocks including MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) ended the day off their lowest level after Bitcoin eased losses following a dip below $54,000 even as Mt. Gox exchange, which declared bankruptcy in 2014 after falling victim to a heist that saw it lose 950,000 bitcoin, said it had started making payments in both bitcoin and bitcoin cash to creditors. Many are worried that creditors will sell their bitcoin -- now valued at much than it was in 2014, given BTC's astronomical rise since then -- and force prices lower.\n\n(Peter Nurse, Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTD's chief compliance officer departs amid US anti-money laundering probe\n\nWorld stocks rise, US yields dip amid jobs data, UK labor landslide\n\nView comments",

AI may grab headlines, but the bigger business for both companies is the advertisements they serve up along with the content and search results their users are after.\n\nIn Q1, 77% of Alphabet's revenue came from advertising-related sources. For Meta, an incredible 98% came from ad revenue. This makes the advertising market a key factor in both stocks' investment cases.\n\nFurthermore, each is developing AI technologies to stay at the top of their game. In both cases, that means using generative AI models they have developed in-house to aid advertisers. For example, advertisers on Meta can use its tools to create multiple iterations of the same ad nearly instantly, which allows them to tailor their ads to their viewers. Alphabet offers tools that help advertisers quickly create campaigns that meet all of its internal guidelines. These examples show how each company is trying to stay ahead of its rivals by integrating new AI technologies as quickly as possible.\n\nThese innovations may (or may not) bring any new revenue, as the AI upgrades are essentially required for them to stay at the top of their respective industries. However, each company is doing so well right now that new revenue from new technologies isn't necessarily required for them to excel.\n\nGrowth for each business is strong\n\nIn Q1, Alphabet's ad revenue rose 13% to $61.7 billion. In particular, YouTube excelled, with revenue rising 21% to $8.1 billion. While most of Alphabet's advertising empire is fairly mature, YouTube is still growing quickly. Still, 13% growth companywide is impressive, considering the maturity of the business.\n\nMeta's growth put Alphabet's to shame. In Q1, its ad revenue grew 27% to $35.6 billion. And its revenue increased at a healthy pace in all of its regions worldwide.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese strong results aren't outliers, either. Wall Street analysts project Alphabet's revenue will rise 13% this year and 11% next year. For Meta, Wall Street expects 18% and 13% growth. Both of these are strong projections (considering the companies' size) and are great reasons to invest.\n\nHowever, the last point is just icing on the cake.\n\nYou don't have to pay a fortune to own either stock\n\nWhen you look at the rest of the Magnificent Seven  -- Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla -- every one of them is expensive from a valuation standpoint. Measured by their forward price-to-earnings ratios (which consider earnings projections over the next 12 months), none trades lower than 30.\n\nThat's a historically expensive price to pay, which should give investors pause. However, Alphabet and Meta don't command premiums quite that high. META PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt 24 and 25 times forward earnings, both still command slight premiums to the broader market's average of 22.3 (using the S&P 500 as a benchmark). However, their execution and market dominance justify those slight premiums.\n\nWith both companies excelling, projected to grow at respectable paces, and trading at reasonable valuations, they easily top my list as the best stocks to buy in the Magnificent Seven now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $786,046!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Marking the right stocks to buy is crucial for maximizing returns and securing long-term financial growth. Among the myriad options available, three companies stand out as compelling choices. These companies may have high leads, like a trillion-dollar market cap, by capitalizing on AI and Fintech trends similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nThese companies are in charge of global payment innovation, capitalizing on digital transformation trends and expanding their market presence with innovative payment solutions. They are leveraging their vast user base and advanced AI capabilities and continue to redefine digital engagement and advertising effectiveness across their platforms.\n\nMeanwhile, the strategic focus on AI and semiconductor solutions has propelled revenue growth significantly. This is particularly true in data centers and networking sectors. Pinpointing the underlying fundamentals driving these companies’ leads is pivotal to navigating volatile markets and capitalizing on emerging opportunities. Here, the focus is on these companies’ financial strengths, strategic initiatives and market positions, exploring why these stocks are the investments for today but may continue to be tomorrow’s market leaders.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) holds a grip on digital payments, facilitating secure and efficient transactions worldwide. The company generated $8.8 billion in net revenue (Q2 2024), marking a 10% increase year-over-year (YoY). This growth led to a 20% increase in EPS, highlighting Visa’s effective revenue management and operational edge in driving profitability.\n\nMoreover, Visa’s core business strength lies in its global payment volume. This grew 8% YoY in constant dollars. This growth was driven by a 6% increase in US payment volume and a sharp 11% growth in international payment volume. The 16% YoY growth in cross-border volume is particularly notable, excluding intra-European transactions. This reflects Visa’s strong international presence and ability to capture cross-border transactions efficiently.\n\nAdditionally, Visa targets a massive addressable market, estimating over $20 trillion in global purchase personal consumption expenditure (PPCE), excluding Russia and China. This growth is driven by initiatives like tap-to-pay and converting domestic network cards to Visa credentials. This is particularly highlighted by the success in Europe, with over 20 million credentials converted since 2018.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn short, payment volume growth, market expansion and the resultant top-line boost solidify Visa’s presence on the stocks to buy list.\n\nMeta (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) prevails in social media and digital advertising. In Q1 2024, Meta had a top-line of $36.46 billion, marking a sharp 27% increase YoY. This growth was primarily driven by a corresponding 27% rise in ad revenue, reaching $35.6 billion. This growth emerges from robust online commerce, gaming and entertainment performances. Revenue growth was robust in regions like the Rest of the World (40%) and Europe (33%). Hence, this reflects sharp monetization strategies tailored to diverse geographic markets.\n\nFurther, the company can effectively monetize its vast user base across its family of apps. This signifies its robust engagement strategies and sophisticated AI-powered recommendation systems integrated across platforms like WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram and Facebook. Hence, these AI capabilities may generate revenue by boosting advertising effectiveness and user engagement.\n\nWith billions of daily active people across its Family of Apps in March 2024, up 7% YoY, Meta continues to penetrate online advertising sharply. Overall, with a solid foundation to scale its AI-driven services and capitalize on emerging market opportunities, this global expansion makes Meta a top mark on the stocks to buy list.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Stock Is a Winner With Big Upside Potential\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) dominates AI-driven networking, data center semiconductors and infrastructure. The company’s AI revenue grew exceptionally, increasing by 280% YoY. The company can capitalize on the expanding AI sector. This is particularly true in the data center market, which positions the company well for continued revenue expansion. Following the acquisition of VMware, the annualized booking value (ABV) for VMware products accelerated from $1.2 billion to $1.9 billion from Q1 to Q2. This reflects strong customer adoption under Broadcom’s management.\n\nBroadcom’s semiconductor segment also had solid growth, with revenue reaching $3.8 billion, up 44% YoY. This growth was driven by increased demand from hyperscalers for AI networking and custom accelerators. Broadcom achieved consolidated revenue of $12.5 billion, marking a 43% YoY increase. Moreover, the gross margins for its infrastructure software were notably high, at 88%. This is showcasing its ability to maintain profitability amidst revenue growth. Operating margins for infrastructure software were also solid at 60%. Hence, this indicates sharp cost management and an operational edge in the VMware integration.\n\nBroadcom’s top-line performance, progressive VMware integration and bottom-line improvement led to its presence on the stocks to buy list.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in META.

        "content": "This may feel like the dog days of summer, but it also marks a significant event on the investing calendar – the beginning of the third quarter. Yes, 2024 is halfway done, and if you’re still trying to outperform the market this year, you should look at adding A-rated stocks to your portfolio.\n\nThe ratings come from the Portfolio Grader, a free tool ideal for sorting and screening stocks. To get an “A” rating, a stock must have high grades in factors such as growth, earnings performance, momentum, and analyst sentiment.\n\nAs companies begin the year’s second half, many are reassessing their strategies and goals to hit their full-year numbers. As an investor, you should do the same thing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis has been a good year, so far, for the market, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite showing a 21% gain. The S&P 500 is close behind at 16%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is only showing a 4.3% gain.\n\nSo, as you look at your portfolio for the year’s second half, you should put heavy consideration into tech stocks. You’ll see today’s list of A-rated stocks with a heavy emphasis on tech – none of which are represented on the Dow 30 list of Dow Jones stocks.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia Corporation logo on smartphone screen. Against stock prices, stock chart. Investments in securities.. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Trismegist san / Shutterstock.com\n\nAny company changing life as we know it will get the No. 1 spot on my list of top stocks to buy – and for several months now, that’s been Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe semiconductor company makes most – nearly all – of the high-powered chips needed for complex operations that power machine learning, the Internet of Things, and generative artificial intelligence.\n\nNvidia saw revenue in its most recent quarter jump 262% from a year ago to $26 billion, and earnings per share of $6.12 up 629% from last year.\n\nAnd even though logic dictates that this massive growth can’t continue forever – after all the company is facing some more difficult comparable numbers – Nvidia continues to roll.\n\nIts H100 processors have led the charge, but Nvidia’s H200 processors work even faster. And the Blackwell platform lets any organization operate large language models with 25 times less cost and energy.\n\nThat’s why I’m betting on Nvidia to continue to perform. The stock is up 159% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe home of Facebook, Instagram, Reels, WhatsApp and Messenger, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has a massive audience of users who use the social media platforms to connect with friends, family and to make new connections.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s a winning formula for Meta, because all that sharing gives Meta an enormous amount of information about its customers likes, dislikes, hobbies, political affiliations and spending habits – all information that advertisers can use to directly target customers with ads.\n\nMeta got 98% of its revenue in the first quarter from advertising. Bringing in $36.4 billion, up 23% from a year ago. Earnings per share was $4.71, up from $2.20 per share in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nMeta is also deeply involved with artificial intelligence with Meta AI, a large language model that can do everything from creating images and animated custom GIFs to suggest a dinner menu based on what ingredients you have on hand.\n\nMeta’s Q2 earnings report is slated for July 31. If it continues to grow revenue and daily average users, the stock will have a massive summer.\n\nMETA stock is up 44% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle restaurant store exterior sign and storefront. CMG stock\n\nSource: Robert V Schwemmer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is an amazing fast-casual restaurant stock. The company perfectly positioned itself as an alternative to a slew of burger joints by offering custom-made burritos and burrito bowls consisting of fresh ingredients – nothing is ever frozen.\n\nThat’s why Chipotle grew to over 3,400 locations. And unlike many other chains, Chipotle doesn’t sell franchises. All of its locations are owned and operated by the company, so Chipotle can do a better job in maintaining quality and standards.\n\nAnd if you thought Chipotle stock was too expensive to buy without fractional shares, think again. The company in late June executed a 50-for-1 stock split so shares of CMG stock are just over $60.\n\nThat makes them far more accessible to retail investors and it’s much easier to make options trades with CMG stock as well.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $2.7 billion, up 14.1% from a year ago. Comparable restaurant sales were up 7% and operating margins rose from 15.5% to 16.3%.\n\nChipotle stock is up 34% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe massive advances in generative AI and large language models has been a tailwind for Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), also known as Supermicro.\n\nThe company provides the custom server infrastructure that allows customers to bundle their GPUs and perform AI functions.\n\nThe company has a close relationship with Nvidia as its preferred server partner. And it also has a customer-friendly business model because its servers are like building blocks – parts can be easily swapped out and upgraded rather than a customer replacing the entire thing.\n\nEarnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2024 included sales of $3.85 billion, up from $1.28 billion a year ago. Income was $402 million and $6.56 per share versus $86 million and $1.53 per share last year.\n\nSMCI stock is down from all-time highs hit in March, but the stock still gained 197% in 2024 and maintains its “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith more of our business, banking and personal information on computers these days, there’s much more of a need for companies like CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD).\n\nCrowdStrike is a computer security company that operates a cloud-native platform that provides endpoint protection, cloud workloads, identity and data.\n\nCrowdStrike’s Falcon platform is powered by AI and machine learning to respond to and stop threats in real time. The company also sells modules, which are extensions that customers can add to customize their platforms and increase protection.\n\nModules include endpoint security, data security, IT operations, threat intelligence and more.\n\nCrowdStrike says 65% of its customers purchase and use at least five modules, making it a lucrative business model.\n\nRevenue for the company’s first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $921 million, up 33% from a year ago. Subscription revenue was $872.2 million, up 34% from the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nCRWD stock is up 51% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the king of streaming services, ranking No. 1 as the biggest paid-for streaming company on the planet (it trails only YouTube, which is free to watch and ad-free with a premium subscription).\n\nNetflix currently has 269.6 million paid subscribers – a number that increased dramatically last year when the company dumped its longtime password-sharing program and began charging customers an $8 surcharge to grant access to an account outside of the household.\n\nThe decision was controversial with customers, but wildly effective. Paid memberships are up from 232.6 million a year ago because people find value in Netflix’s content.\n\nRevenue of $9.3 billion in the first quarter was up 14.8% from a year ago, and Netflix forecast additional growth to $9.49 billion when it reports Q2 earnings in mid-July.\n\nNFLX stock is up 40% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (WSM) Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mall\n\nSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) proves that you don’t have to be a tech company to be an A-rated stock.\n\nThe California-based company sells kitchenware and home furnishings, operating under the brands that include Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn and West Elm.\n\nIn addition to retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K., Williams-Sonoma franchises brands to third parties that operate in the Middle East, Mexico and the Philippines.\n\nThe company is also in the process of a 2-for-1 stock split. Shareholders as of June 27 will receive the split through a stock dividend that will be issued on July 8; shares will then start trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 9.\n\nBut if you missed the split, there’s still plenty of reasons to have WSM stock. The company saw revenues drop in the first quarter to $1.66 billion from $1.75 billion a year ago.\n\nBut it was also more efficient, with profits of $802 million up from $675 million; net earnings of $265.6 million versus $156.5 million a year ago, and earnings per share of $4.07 versus $2.35 in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nWSM stock is up 39% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had LONG position(s) in NVDA, SMCI and CRWD. Louis Navellier did not have (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had a LONG position in NVDA.

        "title": "These 5 Stocks Account for 63% of the S&amp;P 500 Returns So Far This Year. Can Their Dominance Continue?",
        "content": "We're officially halfway through 2024, and it's shaping up to be another great year for stock investors.\n\nThe S&P 500 produced a total return of 15.3% through the end of June. That's more than double its historical average for the first half of the year. Its continuous push to new all-time highs bodes well for the second half of the year, too.\n\nIf you look under the hood, the vast majority of the S&P 500's returns have been driven by just five stocks through the first half of 2024. The list isn't too dissimilar from the group of stocks that accounted for the bulk of 2023's return either. If you know about the \"Magnificent Seven,\" you'll be familiar with these names. Can these five continue their dominance through the rest of the year?\n\nThe five stocks accounting for 63% of the S&P 500's returns in 2024\n\nThe S&P 500's aggregate market capitalization increased $5.8 trillion through the first half of 2024.\n\nThe following five stocks generated the biggest market cap increases during the first six months of the year, totaling about 63% of the S&P 500s increase in value for 2024.\n\nStock Market Cap Jan. 1 Market Cap June 28 Increase Increase as a % of S&P 500 Gain Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) $1.223 trillion $3.039 trillion $1.816 trillion 31.3% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) $2.795 trillion $3.322 trillion $527 billion 9.1% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) $1.764 trillion $2.266 trillion $502 billion 8.7% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) $1.57 trillion $2.013 trillion $443 billion 7.6% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) $910 billion $1.279 trillion $369 billion 6.4% Total $8.262 trillion $11.919 trillion $3.663 trillion 63.2%\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nAll of those companies were already among the largest components of the S&P 500 to start the year. Nvidia's continued dominance of the AI chip market has fueled a massive increase in its stock value. Meanwhile, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are four of the biggest companies investing in developing cutting-edge artificial intelligence. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon also provide the cloud platforms required for training and running AI-powered applications.\n\nThe current trend toward generative AI favors the biggest companies. Building large data centers capable of training large language models and running inferences all day requires a ton of capital. Meta leading the group with its plan to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion in capital expenditures this year. That's an investment smaller companies can't even start to compete with, especially in today's interest rate environment where debt isn't nearly as cheap as it used to be.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, the S&P 500 has become increasingly concentrated among just a few companies. Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple account for 20% of the index's value. The next seven components add another 16%. We haven't had this level of concentration among the top-10 companies in the S&P 500 since the 1970s.\n\nWhile there are good reasons for the current level of concentration, investors need to ask if these giant companies can continue to lead the market higher.\n\nWho will lead the next leg up in the market?\n\nRising concentration in the stock market isn't inherently a concern. As mentioned, there are good reasons the biggest companies have gotten bigger. But, investors should remain mindful of valuations and where the market presents good value.\n\nNvidia, for example, trades for a forward PE of around 47. That makes it a risky bet on its continued dominance of the AI chip market. It faces challenges from other chipmakers, and its biggest customers are designing their own chips to reduce their reliance on Nvidia. Analysts currently expect strong bottom-line growth for Nvidia, but its high valuation makes any shortfall extremely damaging to the share price.\n\nNot every member of the above group is expensive. Meta Platforms and Alphabet trade for forward PEs around 25x. While those valuations are higher than the S&P 500's overall earnings multiple, it's not an outlandish multiple relative to their earnings growth prospects.\n\nLooking beyond the biggest companies may present many more opportunities for investors. The S&P 500 equal-weight index historically outperforms the cap-weighted index over the long run. Smaller companies typically grow faster than the giants at the top of the market. A $1 billion increase in the market cap of a $10 billion company is a 10% increase. The same amount of inflows into a $1 trillion company is a 0.1% increase.\n\nTo make a larger bet on the other 495 companies in the S&P 500, investors could buy the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF(NYSEMKT: RSP). Investors could diversify beyond the S&P 500 using a small-cap ETF, too, such as the iShares Russell 2000 ETF(NYSEMKT: IWM).\n\nWhile the first half saw the continued dominance of a small number of large-cap growth stocks, the next leg up in the market could come from a large number of smaller companies.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nasdaq Underdogs: 3 Beaten-Down Stocks Primed for a July Comeback",
        "content": "As hot as the S&P 500 has been, the Nasdaq 100 is performing even better. The tech-heavy index is up 19% year-to-date (YTD) and 83% higher since the beginning of 2023. It routinely hits new record highs.\n\nIn such a frothy market it is not easy to find undervalued Nasdaq stocks. But they exist. Even when things get overheated, conditions aren’t always evenly distributed opening up opportunities for investors to profit.\n\nWith analysts expecting the job market to slow, unemployment to stay steady and wage gains to ease, the chance for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts grows. That could send the stock market soaring further and help boost undervalued Nasdaq stocks that have been waiting for their moment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe three stocks below are companies investors may want to buy in anticipation of that next leg up.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) A zoomed in image of a large concrete structure with a blue sign on it that reads \"Qualcomm Stadium\" with a clear blue sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMobile handset chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) hasn’t exactly been a laggard. Shares are up 39% in 2024 and are 68% higher over the past 12 months. Despite those gains, QCOM stock is still an undervalued Nasdaq stock with potential.\n\nHaving immersed itself in artificial intelligence (AI), Qualcomm is now a significant player in the space. Its Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 chip supports on-device generative AI and can run large language models (LLM) of up to 10 billion parameters. That includes LLMs from the likes of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Llama 2 and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Gemini Nano from Google.\n\nThe chip is firmly embedded in Samsung phones and the next iteration of the chipset may be exclusive to Samsung’s Galaxy S25 smartphone. Analysts also anticipate a significant price boost, which will flow through Qualcomm’s income statement.\n\nAt 18 times next year’s earnings and the free cash flow (FCF) Qualcomm produces, it remains comparatively cheap. It might not be the bargain it was a year ago, but Qualcomm stock could be a welcome addition to your portfolio.\n\nCharter Communications (CHTR) The Charter Communications (CHTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nCable and telecom provider Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) is the second undervalued Nasdaq stock to consider. Unlike Qualcomm, its stock is down 22% YTD and 18% over the past year. It is pressured by the winding down of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) that ended on June 1.\n\nThe federal program made broadband more affordable for households by providing a $30 subsidy to lower costs. Charter Communications was the primary beneficiary of the program as some 5 million customers, or 16% of CHTR’s total, received a subsidy. As a result of the program’s end, the company is guiding towards weak customer growth numbers for the rest of the year though its EBITDA will expand this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile revenue grew incrementally in the first quarter to $13.7 billion despite a 38% increase in residential mobile service revenue, CHTR showed surprisingly robust profits of $1.1 billion, up from $1 billion last year. It indicates the cable and telecom stock has been able to meet consumer demand for faster broadband speed by upgrading its network at little additional cost.\n\nAs conditions improve and Charter Communications gets beyond the end of the ACP, it’s business will look appreciably better. The stock trades at 9 times trailing earnings and estimates and 15 times FCF. Also going for just a fraction of its sales, Charter Communications is a stock to consider.\n\nPayPal Holdings (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayments specialist PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) is arguably the most undervalued Nasdaq stock of the three.\n\nIt also holds the most potential. Shares are weighed down by robust competition, particularly Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent moves to muscle its way towards a larger share of the payments pie. But the market has thrown the baby out with the bathwater.\n\nPayPal Holdings remains a potent competitor even if there has been share losses. It commands a 45% share of online payment processing technologies worldwide, or more than the next 12 largest rivals combined. Payment volume is also accelerating, up 14% in the first quarter to $404 billion. But there is more growth to come.\n\nPayPal Holdings is launching an advertising platform that is unique to its business. Relying upon the data from the buying habits of it 400 million active accounts, PYPL can offer advertisers the ability to zero in on a targeted audience.\n\nAnd, the stock is cheap. It trades at 15 times earnings, 12 times estimates and goes for just a fraction of its estimated earnings growth rate. Wall Street sees PayPal Holdings growing profits at a 16% compounded annual rate for the next five years. Add in a price-to-FCF ratio of 12 and you have an undervalued Nasdaq stock ripe for the picking.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Wedbush analysts are bullish on the tech sector, predicting a further 15% upside for the Nasdaq in 2024. They believe the current momentum is just the beginning of an AI-driven tech bull market, with the \"AI party\" just reaching 9 pm.\n\nWedbush highlights Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the early leaders of this \"AI Revolution,\" pioneering the foundation for a wave of new applications and spending. They anticipate a \"tidal wave of $1 trillion\" in tech sector spending related to AI over the next 12-18 months.\n\n\"We believe NASDAQ has another strong 2H ahead as tech stocks will be up 15% the rest of 2024 in our view with tech fundamentals set to accelerate as AI use cases materially expand,\" writes Wedbush.\n\nTheir initial forecast for a 25% growth in tech stocks for 2024 remains on track, fueled by strong performances by tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta (NASDAQ:META). They emphasize this is a new era – a \"1995 moment\" of technological revolution, not a repeat of the dot-com bubble of 1999.\n\nWedbush expects Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to join the party in the latter half of the year, unleashing the consumer side of the AI revolution. The upcoming iPhone 16 is seen as a potential catalyst for this shift, ushering in an era of AI-powered smartphones.\n\nWedbush predicts a race to a $4 trillion market cap between tech giants Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft over the next year. The firm says Nvidia's dominance in GPU chips, considered the \"new gold\" of the tech sector, positions them well for continued growth as enterprises and consumers embrace the AI revolution.\n\nWedbush concludes that they believe the tech sector is poised for significant growth fueled by the ongoing AI revolution.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWedbush sees 15% upside left for Nasdaq, tech stocks\n\nTD's chief compliance officer departs amid US anti-money laundering probe\n\nWorld stocks rise, US yields dip amid jobs data, UK labor landslide\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – July 5, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Tesla, Inc. TSLA and Natural Health Trends Corp. NHTC.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Research Reports for Apple, Meta Platforms and Tesla\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and Tesla, Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock Natural Health Trends Corp. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple’s shares have only slightly outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+14.5% vs. +14.3%). The company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. Apple’s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple’s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\r\n\r\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “Magnificent 7” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have far outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+78.1% vs. +32.7%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia/Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platform is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects.\r\n\r\nAI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 150 million monthly actives. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nTesla’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past year (-17.3% vs. -16.9%). The company’s recently shrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts have been plaguing Tesla. Tesla expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023 amid a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market.\r\n\r\nWith competition intensifying in the EV space, Tesla’s focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game-changer. It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its \"robotaxi\" venture.\r\n\r\nThe successful introduction of its Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China amid stiff competition marks a significant win. Additionally, TSLA’s Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving. While near-term challenges persist, long-term prospects appear promising, driven by its big bet on driverless software and AI.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Natural Health Trends have outperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (+25.6% vs. -10.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $79.12 million shows a promising uptick, with an 11% quarterly order rise and a 1% annual increase, suggesting a market and operational recovery.\r\n\r\nDespite a slight revenue drop, cash flow remains positive, supported by prudent financial strategies, including a $0.20 dividend. The company is capitalizing on emerging markets like India, showing substantial growth, and aligning with global e-commerce trends to boost online sales. Strategic initiatives, new products and member incentives such as MetaBoost are aimed at growth and market share.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenges include a significant membership decline, impacting sales potential, and heavy reliance on volatile markets like Hong Kong and China. Additionally, deferred revenue and regulatory risks in key markets pose financial and operational concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on National Health Trends here >>>)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Don’t count the metaverse out just yet. While it started as a costly failure, companies are racing to use it, creating opportunities for some of the top metaverse stocks.\n\nFor example, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) metaverse just debuted in Singapore, which will allow users to build virtual burgers, envision future McDonald’s restaurant designs and participate in contests that will reward users with real food deals and prizes.\n\nIKEA is launching a virtual universe on Roblox (NYSE:RBLX). In fact, its “The Co-Worker Game” will allow users “to live their home furnishing dreams and get paid for it.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) metaverse experience includes virtual roller coasters, mazes and games. “Bringing Six Flags to Roblox has enabled us to create a one-of-a-kind metaverse experience that will engage and entertain our fans in innovative ways,” said Selim Bassoul, CEO of Six Flags.\n\nEven The Rolling Stones are also debuting their music in the metaverse.\n\nBut this is just the start of the metaverse growth story. With demand only set to grow for virtual experiences in entertainment and gaming, analysts at SkyQuest say the metaverse market could be worth nearly $803.3 billion by 2031 from $86.31 billion in 2023.\n\nIn short, it’s time to jump into some of the top metaverse stocks, including:\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top metaverse stocks to buy is Roblox.\n\nAfter gapping from about $40 to a low of $30 on poor earnings, Roblox is back to $37.77, where it’s still a buy. Initially, I’m looking for it to refill its bearish gap at $40. Longer term, I’d like to see the stock rally back to at least $45 on improving earnings.\n\nHelping, recent earnings negativity appears to have been priced into the rebounding stock.  Plus, analysts are bullish. Macquarie, for example, just initiated coverage of RBLX with an outperform rating, noting it’s one of the main “building blox” of the metaverse.\n\n“In our view, there is still a long runway for growth ahead, driven by user growth, better monetization, international penetration and a new advertising initiative,” they added, as quoted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nMoffett Nathanson also upgraded the stock to a neutral rating with a $26 price target following the massive sell off in the stock.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also a buy on weakness.\n\nWhile it’s been driven by artificial intelligence, demand for its chips, and strong earnings growth, it’s also exposed to the metaverse with its Omniverse software.\n\nStory continues\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/foxconn-digital-twin-ai/\n\nWith it, companies can create and test virtual environments all in real time. Foxconn, for example, is using the Omniverse to create a digital twin of its new factory in Guadalajara to train robots in a virtual environment.\n\nEven more impressive, according to VentureBeat.com:\n\n“Such twins enable a company to design a factory in digital form through Omniverse simulations anchored by Nvidia’s chips. The engineers designing the factory can get feedback from the simulation about how good the design is. Once it is perfected, they can build the factory in the real world. And with sensors on the factory, they can get digital information about how good the design really is and then modify the digital design in a feedback loop for continuous improvement.”\n\nAll of which makes shares of Nvidia even more attractive following its 10:1 split.\n\nFidelity Metaverse ETF (FMET) A character inside a virtual world. Metaverse.\n\nSource: Led Gapline / Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you’d rather diversify with 53 metaverse stocks at less than $31 a share, there’s the Fidelity Metaverse ETF (NASDAQ:FMET).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.39%, the ETF tracks the Fidelity Metaverse Index, which tracks the performance of companies that develop, manufacture, distribute, or sell products or services related to establishing and enabling the metaverse.\n\nSome of its top holdings include heavyweights like Nvidia, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nBetter, thanks to the explosive nature of these top stocks, the FMET ETF ran from a recent low of about $26 to $30.94, where it’s still a buy. From its last traded price of $30.94, I’d like to see it test at least $40 a share.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "SPYI ETF: Get Paid Every Month, Enjoy the Massive Yield",
        "content": "What’s better than getting paid a dividend every quarter? How about getting paid one every month? That’s exactly what the NEOS S&P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI) has to offer investors, and it also comes with a massive dividend yield.\n\nI’m bullish on this new monthly dividend ETF from NEOS based on this attractive payout schedule and its show-stopping 11.6% dividend yield, which is an incredible nine times higher than the yield of the S&P 500 (SPX).\n\nWhat Is the SPYI ETF’s Strategy?\n\nAccording to fund sponsor NEOS, SPYI “seeks to distribute high monthly income generated from investing in the constituents of the S&P 500 Index and implementing a data-driven call option strategy.”\n\nThe fund “utilizes a call option strategy that may include both sold and purchased SPX index options, which may provide the opportunity for upside capture in rising equity markets.”\n\nEssentially, SPYI owns the stocks in the S&P 500. It then generates monthly income for its holders through both the dividend payments from these stocks and by selling call options on the S&P 500 to generate additional income via the premiums from these options contracts.\n\nWhile this generates a high level of monthly income, investors should also note that by utilizing this strategy, they are potentially sacrificing some level of upside from capital appreciation. If SPYI’s holding rises above the strike price for the covered call contracts it sells to generate this income, SPYI will forgo much of this additional upside.\n\nYou can see this dynamic in play by looking at the ETF’s results. For example, in 2023, SPYI generated a total return (which includes price appreciation and dividends) of 18.1% for the year. While this was a strong return, it underperformed the S&P 500’s return of 26.3% for the year.\n\nHowever, there’s one thing that SPYI does a bit differently from other ETFs employing this covered call strategy. Rather than investing all of the money it receives from selling call contracts, it has the option to reinvest some of the proceeds back into buying cheaper, further out of the money call options, allowing it to participate in some of this upside if the underlying holding goes beyond the strike price.\n\nAs NEOS explains in the fund’s summary prospectus, the fund seeks to use the S&P 500 call options “to generate a net-credit, meaning that the premium received from the sale of the call options will be greater than the cost of buying the long, out-of-the-money SPX call options.”\n\nIncredible Dividend\n\nWhile the strategy is complex and has some pros and cons regarding capital appreciation and total return, there’s no denying that it’s a powerful way to generate significant income. This is evidenced by SPYI’s mouth-watering 11.6% dividend yield, which is about nine times higher than that of the S&P 500 (currently yielding just 1.3%).\n\nStory continues\n\nNot only that, but SPYI’s yield is easily more than double the 4.35% yield offered by 10-year treasury bonds, making SPYI a compelling income investment no matter what type of interest rate environment we find ourselves in.\n\nETFs employing this strategy have grown in popularity in recent years, and it’s worth noting that SPYI also features a higher yield than many of these. For example, the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI), the largest and most well-known of these ETFs, features a 7.4% yield, and the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) yields 8.8%. These are both impressive yields, but SPYI’s is significantly higher.\n\nIt’s important to note that the level of SPYI’s dividend payout is not set in stone, and the amount can vary from month to month. However, the payouts have been relatively consistent, ranging between $0.47 and $0.50 per month over the past year. Additionally, since its launch in August of 2022, SPYI has paid distributions every month, so it is beginning to build up a strong track record of monthly dividend payments.\n\nSPYI’s Holdings\n\nSPYI offers strong diversification, with 508 holdings. Its top 10 holdings make up a reasonable 38% of the fund. Below, you’ll find an overview of SPYI’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nGiven the fund’s strategy of investing in the constituents of the S&P 500 index, its top holdings unsurprisingly largely mirror those of the broad market index. Its holdings include household names like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nSteep Expense Ratio\n\nOne negative aspect of SPYI is that it features a fairly high expense ratio of 0.68%. This means that an investor in the fund will pay $68 on a $10,000 investment over the course of the year. Assuming that the fund returns 5% per year going forward and maintains this current expense ratio, this investor will pay $379 in fees over a five-year time horizon, a fairly steep total.\n\nThat said, this is a complex, actively-managed ETF, so it is understandable that it has a higher expense ratio than the typical index fund. As long as the ETF keeps paying out large dividends like clockwork each month, most holders will feel comfortable with the above-average expense ratio.\n\nIs SPYI Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SPYI earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 403 Buys, 93 Holds, and nine Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SPYI stock price target of $55.24 implies 9.06% upside potential from current levels.\n\nThe Takeaway: A Strong Option for Income Investors\n\nInvestors should be aware that investing in call options ETFs like SPYI might limit potential capital appreciation. However, with a remarkable yield of 11.6%, it’s hard not to like this ETF anyway. I’m bullish on SPYI as a great option for income investors based on its attractive monthly payout schedule and its massive 11.6% dividend yield. As one part of a balanced portfolio, this is an effective tool for generating frequent, above-average income on a steady basis.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "If you’re looking for relative value in tech after the meteoric rise of the Nasdaq 100 and the Magnificent Seven in the first half, perhaps the social media scene is worth checking out this July. Undoubtedly, the artificial intelligence revolution will change many industries in profound ways that are difficult for some to fathom.\n\nWhen it comes to social media, AI has already begun to make an impact. And it’s not just AI behind the scenes, either, with social-media titan Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) showing off AI personas to users. Such consumer-facing AIs are intriguing, even entertaining, but they’re likely just a hint of what’s to come from the AI-first social media and metaverse company.\n\nAs Meta’s AI, or LLaMA, becomes more capable with every additional billion spent on advancing the technology, rival social-media firms should seek to borrow from Mark Zuckerberg’s growth playbook and look to AI to boost engagement and enhance the ad business.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nReddit (RDDT) Reddit (RDDT) app logo on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Henry Franklin / Shutterstock.com\n\nReddit (NYSE:RDDT) looks to be a huge IPO success story, with the stock now up around 60% from its opening day close of $46 per share. Undoubtedly, Tuesday’s 10% pop powered RDDT stock to a new all-time high of $73 and change.\n\nIndeed, Reddit’s traffic has been soaring of late, up 39% for May, according to a report issued by Similarweb. And, no, the boom isn’t about the latest meme stock frenzy surrounding Roaring Kitty and his latest bets.\n\nReddit has been used onAlphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google search in recent months. In an age where AI content is scattered throughout the web, many people likely seek a human perspective.\n\nAnd with Reddit, they’re getting just that. It’s no wonder why Google is becoming a stepping stone for many seeking an answer to a question, minus the risk of getting an AI-generated hallucination.\n\nWith a mere $12.04 billion market cap, RDDT stock still has a high growth ceiling. And in the age of AI, perhaps there’s more room for the underrated social-media play to fly.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms is in the Magnificent Seven for a reason: it’s a growth company that’s comfortable stepping outside of its circle of competence into new frontiers — think AI and the metaverse.\n\nOf course, jumping into an unproven, emerging market can be risky. But so, too, can being complacent and not taking any risks. As a proven capital allocator, investors should trust Zuckerberg as he positions the firm to take only smart, strategic risks.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn any case, Meta doesn’t seem to have lost its competitive spirit, as it shoots to become even more magnificent than its six mega-cap tech peers. Though the company has been subject to regulatory scrutiny lately, specifically from the European Union, such news is mostly noise.\n\nAt the end of the day, Meta is all about going big or going home. When it comes to AI, Meta is not afraid to open up the checkbook to spend on efforts to advance its positioning in the AI race.\n\nGiven what Meta has to gain by swinging for the fences, META stock is a relative AI stock bargain at 29.3 times trailing price-to-earnings.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is a Chinese internet titan behind the popular social media app Weixin, also known as WeChat, and various video-game studios. On the surface, Weixen seems like just another rival of WhatsApp for Chinese users.\n\nWhile Weixen is used for keeping up with friends via messaging, the app is also used for posting Moments, similarly to a Facebook feed) paying for things and even running mini-programs. It’s the ultimate super app, with more than 1.3 billion users. It also provides a common interface, regardless of the smartphone or mobile operating system being used.\n\nAt 29.9 times trailing P/E, TCHEY stock looks too cheap, especially given its monopolistic positioning with Chinese users and the ability to upsell them with new services.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Alphabet (Class C).

        "title": "3 Augmented Reality Stocks to Sell in July Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "In Friday’s Q3 2024 strategy outlook, BCA Research forecasted a hard landing for the economy. The Canadian investment research company projects the S&P 500 index drop from current 5,460 to 3,750, indicating a 31% devaluation of the stock market by the end of the year or in early 2025, highlighting the urgency to consider augmented reality stocks to sell.\n\nBCA’s chief global strategist, Peter Berezin, points to the slowdown in job openings and slowed wage growth to spill over to weakened consumer power. Combined with depleted Covid-era excess savings, even the AI-driven boom is not likely to stave off companies from reducing their capital expenditures\n\nAlthough this is reminiscent of recession calls throughout 2023 that failed to materialize, this could be a case of postponement. After all, there is no historical record of the Fed achieving a true soft landing even once. Bearing in mind the softish landing or outright hard landing, these augmented reality stocks to sell should be prioritized.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAt the end of the day, an augmentation is an extra layer, which takes a back seat in a hard landing scenario hitting discretionary spending.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) bread and butter comes from Google Services, the company has dabbled in augmented reality. Having received a similar hype as Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro, Google Glass spectacles ended up getting canceled in 2015.\n\nThe AR experiment suffered from multiple hardware issues. It saw poor voice recognition, along with unsuitable camera quality and battery life, leaving it stranded from mass adoption. Now that AI is at the forefront of Big Tech, Google is revisiting the concept with Project Astra. The company showcased the design at its annual developer Mountain View conference in May.\n\nPresently restricted to a smart phone app to interpret reality, a hands free wearable solution would be the obvious choice. However, Google has become notorious for self-imposed restrictions to accurately interpret reality.\n\nNot only was this demonstrated with Google’s Gemini launch debacle, but hardly a month goes by without a new demonstration of Google’s ideological commitments overriding user experience. Most importantly, a hard landing hit on small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) would significantly cut into Google’s ad revenue.\n\nThe present price exit ramp is aligned with that outlook, as GOOGL stock gained 32% value year-to-date. In fact, GOOGL stock reached an all-time high of $186.86 only recently, on June 27th. Investors should depart GOOGL shares on that good note, considering its 52-week average of $145.30 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a dedicated software platform for generating virtual environments, Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) shifted resources to AR as well. In 2022, the company bought The Wild, a cloud-based extended reality (XR) platform to integrate into its suite of tools.\n\nAll about streamlining tools to remain the 3D leader, Autodesk also launched Workshop AR to test 3D immersion deployment in real-time. However, while Autodesk is both a solid metaverse and AR exposure, a hard recession outlook makes ADSK stock a good choice for one of the augmented reality stocks to sell.\n\nRelying on new licenses, subscription renewals and Autodesk’s dependance on the manufacturing and construction sectors has the company looking at significant cash flow turndowns. SMEs struggling with their own cash flows would likely turn to Autodesk’s free competitors.\n\nIn the latest fiscal Q1 2025 earnings report, Autodesk reported $227 million free cash flow reduction from the year-ago quarter. Year-to-date, ADSK stock flatlined at 5% gains. Similarly to GOOGL, the present ADSK price of $245 is a solid exit point, holding close to the 52-week high of $279 per share.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe most established metaverse company, Meta (NASDAQ:META) is the obvious choice to consider as one of top augmented reality stocks to sell. Despite a continued push for extended reality, the company ended 2023 with a 40% year-over-year drop in VR headset sales.\n\nIn Q1 earnings call, Meta significantly increased its full-year 2024 capital expenditures, from $30-37 billion to $35-40 billion. As expected, the Reality Labs division is expected to continue to rack up operating losses.\n\nIn a hard landing scenario, ad revenue-reliant Meta holds nearly-identical vulnerability to Alphabet. However, Meta doesn’t have the metaverse baggage, which would then be perceived as a luxury at the end of a long line of discretionary spending considerations. On the upside, META stock greatly outperformed the broader market at 41% YTD gains.\n\nAt the present price of $504, META stock is close to its 52-week high of $531, making it an excellent candidate for locking in the profits. Later down the line, a buy-the-dip action should be considered as well.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The stock market might be near all-time highs, but it’s not champagne and caviar for every company or their shareholders. Many stocks are deep in the red this year despite the gains seen across the indices. This is especially true of technology stocks. While familiar mega-cap names such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are trending higher, a lot of smaller tech stocks are struggling in this market.\n\nSome tech stocks are floundering due to self-inflicted wounds and poor financial results. However, issues ranging from high interest rates and geopolitical conflicts to poor analyst ratings and negative investors sentiment are also weighing on share prices and hurting stocks. The good news for investors is that many technology stocks are now available at bargain basement prices, presenting opportunities to go bottom fishing.\n\nSo, let’s delve into this tech sector fire sale of three must-buy stocks at multi-year lows.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nParamount Global (PARA) In this photo illustration, the Paramount Global (PARA) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt looks like there might finally be a deal that will see privately held production company Skydance Media acquire streaming giant Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA). Media reports murmur that Skydance Media is expected to pay $1.75 billion for National Amusements, the parent company of Paramount Global, and then merge the two entertainment concerns. That news sent PARA stock up 7%.\n\nWhile Paramount stock has gotten a boost, its share price is still down 20% year-to-date (YTD). The long-term losses for Paramount Global’s stock are even greater. The company’s share price today is trading 78% lower than five years ago. Management is trying to right the ship beyond the potential deal with Skydance Media. They are exploring streaming joint ventures with other media companies. And, they may be eliminating $500 million in costs and divesting noncore assets. Also, paying down $15 billion in long-term debt is a top priority.\n\nWhile not without risk, PARA stock could be a good purchase for bargain hunters. This holds particularly true as the company remains in play as an acquisition target.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify (SHOP) on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce company Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is another potential buy. Its stock is down 11% this year and 62% below the all-time high from November 2021 of the pandemic rally peak. More recently, SHOP stock fell nearly 20% after the company reported a surprise loss for its fiscal first quarter. Shopify announced a loss of 21 cents per share. This was far worse than the 9 cent profit that analysts expected.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe financial loss in fiscal Q1 was blamed on the sale of Shopify’s logistics business and related fees that the company incurred on the sale. Looking ahead, Shopify said that for fiscal Q2, revenue will grow at a high-teens percentage rate year-over-year (YOY). Analysts had forecast a Q2 sales increase of 19%. In late June, Shopify also announced it is teaming up with discount retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) on a third-party online marketplace.\n\nCompanies that work with Shopify can now apply to join “Target Plus,” the retailer’s third-party marketplace. The arrangement with Target gives Shopify’s customers a larger consumer base to draw on. For Target, the deal adds new and diverse products and brands to its online marketplace. Financial terms of the arrangement are not yet disclosed.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo. Company was originally known as Research In Motion (RIM), a Canadian software company specializing in cybersecurity.. BB stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors really looking to bottom fish a hard luck technology stock should consider BlackBerry (NYSE:BB). The former smartphone maker turned IoT company has seen its share price drop 53% in the last 12 months. This was due to a string of poor earnings reports.\n\nBB stock is 98% lower than its all-time high reached in 2008 when it was still making handheld devices. At less than $2.50 per share, BlackBerry now trades as a penny stock. Most recently, BlackBerry reported its net loss in this year’s Q1 grew by nearly 300% as sales continue to deteriorate. Revenue declined 61% from a year earlier. BlackBerry is preparing to divide its cybersecurity and IoT divisions to cut costs.\n\nWhile not for investors with weak stomachs, BB stock could rise if management can get the company’s house in order. Additionally, BlackBerry has become a popular meme stock. So, its share price is prone to popping whenever that basket of securities rises.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day. That’s because these “penny stocks” are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators. If we ever do publish commentary on a low-volume stock that may be affected by our commentary, we demand that InvestorPlace.com’s writers disclose this fact and warn readers of the risks.\n\nRead More: Penny Stocks — How to Profit Without Getting Scammed\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "5 Historically Cheap Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks You Can Confidently Buy for the Second Half of 2024 (and Nvidia Isn't 1 of Them!)",
        "content": "For roughly 30 years, Wall Street and the investing community have been waiting for the next great innovation to come along that can rival what the advent of the internet did for corporate America. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) just might be this long-awaited technology.\n\nWith AI, software and systems are used in place of humans to oversee and/or undertake tasks. The true value of AI lies in the ability of these systems to learn over time without human intervention. This allows AI-driven software and systems to become more effective at tasks and perhaps even learn new jobs over time. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence represents an estimated $15.7 trillion opportunity by 2030\n\nAlthough estimates are all over the map, as you'd expect from a still relatively unknown technology, the analysts at PwC released a report last year in which they estimate AI can add up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade.\n\nWith an addressable market this large, a lot of companies can come out as winners. But that doesn't mean you can throw a dart at a written list of AI stocks and automatically make money.\n\nFor the moment, no company is more directly benefiting from the AI revolution than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's stock has gained up to $3 trillion in market value, with the company's board recently approving a 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nNvidia's otherworldly gains and textbook operational scaling are the result of its AI-driven graphics processing units (GPUs) becoming the standard in high-compute data centers. With demand for these chips absolutely overwhelming their supply, Nvidia has been able to meaningfully increase its prices and reap the rewards.\n\nUnfortunately, every next-big-thing innovation over the last 30 years, including the internet, underwent an early-stage bubble-bursting event. This is to say that investors consistently overestimate the adoption and/or utility of new technologies, innovations, or trends. AI will need time to mature, just like every next-big-thing innovation before it, and that bodes poorly for Nvidia's stock.\n\nBut not all artificial intelligence stocks would be in trouble if the AI bubble burst. Thanks to their foundational operating segments, the following five historically cheap AI stocks can be confidently bought for the second half of 2024.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first cheap AI stock that you can gobble up with confidence for the latter half of the current year (and likely hold well beyond 2024) is social media giant Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe beauty of Meta's operating model is that it generates close to 98% of its revenue from advertising. Even though CEO Mark Zuckerberg is aggressively investing in AI data centers, the metaverse, and various augmented/virtual reality devices, Meta's prime social media \"real estate,\" coupled with lengthy periods of expansion for the U.S. and global economy, are what power its operating cash flow and profits at the end of the day.\n\nAs of the end of March, Meta was luring 3.24 billion users to its social media platforms each day. Advertisers are well aware that there's no better alternative to reach users than to advertise with Meta.\n\nEven after more than quintupling from its 2022 bear market low, shares of Meta can be purchased right now for less than 14 times estimated cash flow for 2025. For context, this is a 6% discount to its average forward-year cash flow multiple over the last five years and represents its lowest multiple to cash flow in every year over the last decade, save for 2022. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlibaba\n\nThe next exceptionally inexpensive artificial intelligence stock you can buy without fear in the second half of 2024 is China-based e-commerce juggernaut Alibaba(NYSE: BABA).\n\nAccording to the International Trade Administration, Alibaba is China's top dog in online retail sales, with Taobao and Tmall accounting for an estimated 50.8% share of China's e-commerce sales. Even with China's economy stuck in neutral following the COVID-19 pandemic, an eventual strengthening of the country's burgeoning middle class should lift the long-term prospects for this segment.\n\nFurther, Alibaba Cloud is China's leading cloud infrastructure service platform by revenue. Alibaba Cloud is where generative AI solutions can be offered to customers to support and enhance their businesses. Enterprise spending on cloud services is still in its very early stages of ramping up.\n\nShares of Alibaba are currently valued at less than 8 times forward-year earnings, which is a steal when you account for its $85.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various investments as of March 31. INTC Price to Book Value Chart\n\nIntel\n\nA third AI stock that can shine in the second half of 2024, and likely well beyond, is semiconductor stalwart Intel(NASDAQ: INTC).\n\nThere's no question that Nvidia has left Intel in the dust over the last 18 months. But in the second half of this year, Intel is releasing its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerator chip on a broad scale. With Nvidia unable to meet the demand of all its customers, Intel and its rivals should be able to easily grab share.\n\nBut there's more to like about Intel than just its AI ties. Its legacy central processing unit (CPU) operations for personal computers and traditional data centers remain a cash cow for the company. This cash is being reinvested in various high-growth initiatives, such as the company's foundry services segment. By 2030, Intel anticipates becoming the world's No. 2 chip fabrication company.\n\nIn terms of value, Intel is trading at 25% above its book value of $24.89 per share. With the exception of September 2022-March 2023, Intel stock hasn't been this cheap, relative to its book value, dating back to the mid-1980s!\n\nBaidu\n\nThe fourth bargain AI stock investors can confidently add to their portfolios for the second half of this year is China-based internet search titan Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU).\n\nSimilar to Meta, Alibaba, and Intel, the bursting of the AI bubble wouldn't derail Baidu. That's because it's China's leading internet search engine. Over the trailing-10-year period, it's pretty consistently accounted for 50% to 85% of internet search share for the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. This means predictable operating cash flow and strong ad-pricing power for Baidu.\n\nHowever, AI represents the company's future. Baidu's AI Cloud is China's fourth-largest cloud infrastructure service platform. Meanwhile, Baidu-owned Apollo Go is the world's most successful autonomous ride-hailing service, based on total rides since its inception (more than 6 million). These non-online marketing segments have consistently grown at a faster pace than Baidu's internet search engine.\n\nA forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of only 7 is unbelievably low for a company sporting roughly $26 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments on its balance sheet. AMZN Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\nAmazon\n\nThe fifth historically cheap AI stock begging to be bought for the second half of 2024 is Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), the world's other dominant e-commerce player.\n\nAccording to estimates, Amazon accounted for a nearly 38% share of U.S. online retail sales in 2023. But while this segment brings in plenty of revenue, it does little for Amazon's cash flow or operating income. Where the company generates most of its growth and operating cash flow -- and where AI will come in handiest -- is its ancillary operations.\n\nNo segment is more important to Amazon's long-term success than Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure services platform and recently topped $100 billion in annual run-rate revenue. AWS can deploy various AI and generative AI solutions to help businesses train large language models and run virtual assistants.\n\nDon't forget about advertising services or subscription services, either. These two segments are also growing by a steady double-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis. As Amazon's e-commerce marketplace and content library grow, it should be able to command a premium subscription price for Prime.\n\nAlthough Amazon isn't cheap based on the traditionally used P/E ratio, it is historically inexpensive relative to its future cash flow. Shares can be purchased right now for around 13 times the consensus cash flow in 2025, which is markedly lower than the median multiple of 30 times year-end cash flow investors gladly paid to own Amazon stock throughout the 2010s.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meta Platforms Inc (META): Are Hedge Funds Bullish on This AI Story Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stories.\n\nAre Growing Patents in AI from China a Threat to the US?\n\nChina and the United States continue to compete against each other as the AI boom continues to reign in the tech industry. On July 2, Reuters reported that China plans to develop 50 new national and industrial standards for artificial intelligence by 2026. The country aims to standardize systems in the artificial intelligence sector by providing thorough guidelines to companies and budding startups. Furthermore, on July 3, Reuters reported that China filed six times more patents than the United States for inventions in AI like chatbots. On a global scale, more than 50,000 patent applications were filed in the past decade, a quarter of which were filed in 2023 alone. China filed 38,000 generative AI applications between 2014 and 2023, while the United States only filed slightly over 6,200 applications during the same period. Of the total applications, ByteDance, Alibaba Group, and Microsoft filed the largest number of applications. The report added that Chinese patent applications covered a wider range of sectors such as autonomous driving, publishing, and document management. South Korea, Japan, and India were ranked third, fourth, and fifth with the highest number of patent applications.\n\nThe United States, on the other hand, has reportedly accumulated $55.6 billion in venture capital funding in the second quarter of 2024, the highest quarterly total in two years. On July 3, Reuters reported that the surge in venture capital funding is driven by developments in artificial intelligence. Such is a 47% increase from the $37.8 billion raised by startups in the first quarter of 2024. Significant investments include $6 billion by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion raised by CoreWeave. Previously, venture capital funding took a hit, reporting $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 amid high interest rates and sluggish economic growth. While venture capital and investment in AI are increasing, the IPO market remains sluggish.\n\nOpenAI & Anthropic: A Comparative Analysis\n\nWhile the threat of Chinese innovations looms over the United States, startups in the country are disrupting the industry with key innovations. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is a leading artificial intelligence company based in the United States. In February this year, OpenAI closed a deal with venture capital firm Thrive Capital, allowing it to buy some of its shares in a tender offer, bringing its total valuation to $80 billion. This is a threefold increase in its value from a few months ago in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn June 10, OpenAI and Apple announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Users will now be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities on all these devices without having to switch tools. Siri will also be able to reach ChatGPT when a user asks a question and will present them with an answer directly from the chatbot. ChatGPT will be integrated into Apple's writing tools, allowing users to create content when required. The development ensures that user security remains intact. Requests are not stored by OpenAI and IP addresses remain obscured. Users may connect to their ChatGPT account, allowing them to choose their data preferences. The integration will be executed later this year and can be accessed for free without having to create an account.\n\nIn another update, Apple is reportedly positioned to join OpenAI's board. On July 2, Reuters reported that Apple is set to get an observer role on OpenAI's board, part of the agreement made by the two entities a month ago. Phill Schiller, head of Apple App Store and former marketing chief, was selected for this position. The board agreement will take effect later this year. As of yet, Schiller has not attended any meetings.\n\nAnthropic, OpenAI's direct competitor, is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2021. The company is led by Dario and Daniela Amodei as CEO and president. The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.\n\nClaude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models. The company strongly believes that the initiative will enhance AI safety level assessments, improve safety metrics, and develop infrastructure and tools for evaluations. The safety level assessments will encompass cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, model autonomy, national security risks, and social manipulation.\n\nA lot is going on in the AI space and several companies have emerged as interesting AI stories. We have compiled a list of the most interesting AI stories on Wall Street by studying many reports and publications and watching interviews. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, which was sourced from Insider Monkey's proprietary database that tracks over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 246\n\nMeta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) moves in AI contribute to its ranking as the third biggest AI story on our list. Meta AI, built on Llama 3, is one of the most advanced AI models developed by the company. Meta AI is capable of complex reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding instructions. Like Microsoft, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is also advancing its AI infrastructure capabilities. In April, the company introduced its next generation of custom chips to manage its AI workloads. The new chips will significantly enhance the company's recommendation ads model on Facebook and Instagram. 30% of posts on Facebook and 50% of content on Instagram are delivered by the company's AI recommendation system. The Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) v1 is the company's first inference accelerator designed in-house, capable of handling high-complexity and low-complexity ranking and recommendation models. The company expects expenditure on AI to expand. As per a recent update, the company looks forward to increasing its capital expenditure from $35 billion to $40 billion, driven by large investments in AI, in 2024.\n\nMeta's growth in producing responsible AI models can be attributed to its strong research capabilities. On June 18, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) launched new AI research models to boost innovation at a much larger scale than before. The company released five new models including image-to-text and text-to-music generation models, a prediction model, and a model that detects AI-generated speech. Meta Chameleon is a family of mixed-modal models capable of understanding, processing, and delivering both text and words at the same time. The AI can take any input of text and words to output any combination of text and words required. To replace standard text and idea generation, the company proposed a multi-token prediction approach that would make large language models significantly more efficient. This approach trains models to predict a variety of future words instantly, replacing the common one-at-a-time approach.\n\nJustin Patterson, Keybanc's managing director, recently talked about Meta's position in the market in an interview on Yahoo Finance. He raised his price target from $475 to $540 amid Meta's strong advertising growth. Patterson pointed out that Meta's ad revenue is increasing every quarter which is a reflection of strong demand and he is optimistic about returns from the AI advertising cycle. Overall, Patterson has noticed stronger engagement across all of Meta's platforms due to AI investments and improvements in its ad models.\n\nMETA was held by 246 hedge funds at the close of Q1 2024, with total stakes amounting to $46.92 billion. Of those, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was the highest stakeholder with a position of $7.07 billion.\n\nOn July 3, Loop Capital reiterated a buy rating on the stock and maintained its price target of $550. Based on price targets from 67 analysts, META's median price forecast of $530 represents an upside of almost 4% from its current price of $509.65.\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the biggest AI stories right now. You can visit 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Weekto see the other AI stories that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Wednesday that the company's newest social media platform, Threads, surpassed 175 million monthly active users (MAU) as it approaches its first anniversary.\n\n\"What a year,\" Zuckerberg said in a post on Threads noting the user milestone. In February, Zuckerberg said that the platform had more than 150 million MAU, suggesting that the platform has seen some growth in recent months.\n\nMeta, which is also the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, hasn't disclosed other key metrics related to Threads' usage, such as the platform's count of daily active users and the average time spent on the app per user.\n\nThreads was launched last year on July 5 as a rival to X, formerly Twitter, when that platform was in the early stages of a rebrand following its acquisition by an ownership group led by Elon Musk.\n\nMETA'S THREADS NOW AVAILABLE IN EUROPE FOR NEARLY HALF A BILLION USERS Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the tech giant's Threads platform\n\nAfter its launch, Threads' user base surged to 100 million users in less than a week. The initial launch included not only the U.S. but also more than 100 countries, including the United Kingdom.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nThat rapid growth was enabled in part by Meta creating an easy way for Instagram users to create an account on Threads, and some of its early users subsequently dropped off the roll of active users, with the platform seeing some key metrics decline in the days after its launch, according to analytics firms.\n\nDATA INDICATES THREADS HAD TWO ENGAGEMENT METRICS DECLINE DAYS AFTER ROLLOUT Zuckerberg previously said that Meta's goal is for Threads to reach the 1 billion user threshold within a few years.\n\nZuckerberg said in the fall of 2023 that Threads' MAU total was \"just under 100 million\" and that the company aimed to reach the 1 billion threshold within the next few years.\n\nIn December, Threads became available for users in the European Union which broadened its potential user base by 448 million users. The delay in launching in Europe was due to the EU's strict regulations covering online platforms, including the Digital Markets Act rules that were implemented in 2022. Threads launched on July 5, 2023.\n\nThreads doesn't have advertising on the platform and, as a result, makes little to no money for Meta.\n\nThe platform also recently came on the Fediverse, a group of social media sites that support the ActivityPub protocol and whose users can interact across platforms.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Meta's Threads tops 175 million monthly active users, Zuckerberg says\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Top Research Reports for Apple, Meta Platforms &amp; Tesla",
        "content": "Wednesday, July 3, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), as well as a micro-cap stock Natural Health Trends Corp. (NHTC).  The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple’s shares have only slightly outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+14.5% vs. +14.3%). The company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. Apple’s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple’s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\r\n\r\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “Magnificent 7” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have far outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+78.1% vs. +32.7%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia/Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platform is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects.\r\n\r\nAI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 150 million monthly actives. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nTesla’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past year (-17.3% vs. -16.9%). The company’s recently shrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts have been plaguing Tesla. Tesla expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023 amid a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market.\r\n\r\nWith competition intensifying in the EV space, Tesla’s focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game-changer. It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its \"robotaxi\" venture.\r\n\r\nThe successful introduction of its Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China amid stiff competition marks a significant win. Additionally, TSLA’s Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving. While near-term challenges persist, long-term prospects appear promising, driven by its big bet on driverless software and AI.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Natural Health Trends have outperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (+25.6% vs. -10.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $79.12 million shows a promising uptick, with an 11% quarterly order rise and a 1% annual increase, suggesting a market and operational recovery.\r\n\r\nDespite a slight revenue drop, cash flow remains positive, supported by prudent financial strategies, including a $0.20 dividend. The company is capitalizing on emerging markets like India, showing substantial growth, and aligning with global e-commerce trends to boost online sales. Strategic initiatives, new products and member incentives such as MetaBoost are aimed at growth and market share.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenges include a significant membership decline, impacting sales potential, and heavy reliance on volatile markets like Hong Kong and China. Additionally, deferred revenue and regulatory risks in key markets pose financial and operational concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on National Health Trends here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Coca-Cola (KO), S&P Global (SPGI) and Realty Income (O).\r\n\r\nMark Vickery\r\nSenior Editor\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "content": "An average American spends about 2 hours and 23 minutes daily on social media apps. While it has its positives and negatives, we must look at the bigger picture and understand the role of social media in our lives. Given the current times, it is impossible to live without social media, and we have at least one app installed on our phones. Investors know that social media has become a big part of our lives and is here to stay. If you want to make the most of it, invest in top social media stocks.\n\nThey will show steady growth over the next five years, and if you buy the stock at a discount, you can take home bigger gains. Even if we assume that a user accesses only two apps per day, with billions of users, it is a lot of money for the social media giants. I’ve identified three social media companies that are the talk of the town right now, and they are set to continue their rally. Let’s take a look at them.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nCall it an artificial intelligence (AI) push or an improvement in the economy, which has led to higher ad revenue. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been on a rally since the beginning of the year and isn’t done yet.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUp 45% year-to-date and 86% in the past 12 months, META stock is exchanging hands for $504, which could keep roaring higher. Yes, the company has been under regulatory scrutiny and has had to pay fines in the past, but this has not stopped its growth. It has faced many adversities but has bounced back. How?\n\nThe company’s fundamentals show that there could be more momentum coming. It makes most of its money from advertising revenue and has billions of users accessing its apps. Meta could soon become a social media powerhouse with the family of apps it owns.\n\nIn the recent quarter, its daily active users jumped 7% year-over-year to hit 3.24 billion. This growth attracts marketers who want to capture this user base. In the first quarter, the company’s ad volume jumped 20% year over year, and its price per ad increased by 6%.\n\nWith a rise in digital advertising, Meta is set to benefit. Analysts expect healthy revenue growth from the company throughout the year, and this world-class business has a long way to go. The stock could outperform the market in the long term.\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.\n\nSource: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best social media stocks to own right now, Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), is a hot stock to buy and hold for the next five years. The global audio streaming giant has more than 239 million global users and is known as a dominant industry player.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s growth story has been phenomenal, and it offers a free, ad-supported model and premium subscriptions. It recently hiked the premium subscription plans, and Wall Street believes that consumers will absorb this price hike, which only means good news for investors.\n\nFundamentally, Spotify is in an excellent place. In the first quarter, the company saw a 20% YOY jump in revenue to 3.6 billion Euros, and the EPS soared 184% YOY to 97 cents per share.\n\nSpotify’s management is focusing on growing profitability this year. It has enough cash flow to keep investing in the business, and it ended the quarter with a cash balance of 4.7 billion euros. Spotify has also introduced a basic, low-priced plan in the U.S.\n\nTrading at $313, SPOT stock is up 66% YTD and 95% in the past 12 months. There is no stopping Spotify’s rally, and investors who own the stock need to hold it tight. Spotify’s ambitious plans of growing the content library and improving user experience through personalized recommendations sets it apart from the other players in the industry.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo. PINS stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / shutterstock\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) became a hot social media app during the pandemic when we sought ways to decorate our homes or bake bread. The stock soared as high as $85 in 2021 but has dropped since then.\n\nWhen the pandemic subsided, we had to get back to our routines, which led to a drop in the amount of time spent on the app. However, Pinterest is regaining lost ground, up 58% in the past 12 months and 18% YTD. It is exchanging hands for $43 and is close to the 52-week high.\n\nThe company has invested in AI to enhance content recommendations, which will benefit it in the long term. It is also working on building the next generation of machine learning technologies, and the more tech improvements it makes, the higher the revenue will grow.\n\nIn the first quarter, it reported a revenue of $740 million, up 23% YOY, and it is seeing revenue growth from partnerships with the top e-commerce companies, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It enjoys positive cash flow, which allows it the flexibility to invest in business growth.\n\nThe image-focused platform could gain popularity in the coming years. While it is up 18% this year, it is still down from the highs of 2021. This means there is a lot of room to run.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Meta’s Threads Considers Ads as Rivalry With X Approaches First Anniversary",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc.’s Threads launched a year ago as Mark Zuckerberg’s bid to capitalize on the struggles of Elon Musk’s X, the social network formerly known as Twitter. Since then, the long-running feud between two of the world’s richest men has morphed into a real business rivalry — one that’s poised to accelerate as Threads gets ready to start selling ads in its feed.In July 2023, as Twitter users panicked over Musk’s product changes at X, Meta rushed Threads to market in a surprisingly direct assault on its longtime competitor. The service, which looks almost identical to X with likes, followers and a feed of posts based on user interactions, now has more than 175 million monthly users, up from 150 million three months ago.That’s still smaller than X, but quickly gaining ground and significantly larger than other services like BlueSky and Mastodon, which were also introduced in the wake of Musk’s Twitter purchase. Threads has launched a slew of notable features, too, and has attracted some of the celebrities, journalists and politicians who once helped distinguish Twitter as a social media hub for breaking news.If Instagram boss Adam Mosseri has his way, Threads may soon compete with X for advertising dollars as well. X’s ad revenue was already down an estimated 45% in 2023 from two years prior after advertisers pulled back, spooked by Musk’s diminished content moderation and the billionaire’s own unpredictable antics. Threads ads would offer an alternative place for businesses to spend their marketing budgets, especially for those that are already familiar with Meta’s successful suite of ad products on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Allies Say China Is Developing Attack Drones for Russia China Can End Russia’s War in Ukraine With One Phone Call, Finland Says Zelenskiy Challenges Trump to Reveal Plans for Ending War Democrats Weigh Mid-July Vote to Formally Tap Biden as Nominee Biden Plummets in Leaked Democratic Polling Memo, Puck Says\n\n“I would love to do it sooner rather than later,” said Mosseri, who also oversees Threads, in an interview last month. “It’s just really a question of opportunity cost. Is that the best way to drive business versus making Instagram ads a little bit better on any given month? But it’ll happen, and hopefully sooner rather than later.”\n\nWhile Mosseri said Threads plans to sell more targeted and personalized ads than X has historically offered, the move could still pose a threat to Musk’s business given how successful Meta’s advertising business has become. Meta’s $135 billion in sales last year — the vast majority from ads — was nearly 40 times X’s estimated revenue. “Twitter is very brand-oriented advertising,” Mosseri said. Meta’s advertising offerings focus more on “direct response” spots, or hyper-targeted messages intended to drive a specific outcome — like a product sale or app download. “You’ll probably see more targeted and hopefully more relevant and interesting ads” on Threads than on X, he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpportunity in ChaosThat Threads would survive a full year, much less amass a wide following, was far from guaranteed. While Zuckerberg has succeeded in copying many of his competitors’ strongest features – Snapchat’s Stories and TikTok’s short-form video feed, among others – Meta has failed repeatedly when building its own standalone apps from the ground up. Instagram and WhatsApp, both with well over a billion users, were acquisitions.\n\nThreads, though, offered a unique opportunity. Shortly after Musk took over Twitter in late 2022, some of the top product executives at Meta were on a video call when the conversation turned toward Musk, eventually asking aloud: How should Meta capitalize on the chaos unfolding down the road at Twitter?\n\nThe group had been watching closely as Musk laid off half of Twitter’s staff, openly discussed bankruptcy, and ran off dozens of major advertisers who were wary of what Musk’s “free speech” agenda meant for content moderation. Twitter had a long history of problematic content, including hate speech and misinformation, and marketers were concerned those types of posts would flourish unchecked with Musk in control. Instagram was already building a new product called Channels, which worked like a one-way private message to a user’s follower list, akin to an email blast. Channels, though, didn’t feel like enough of a competitor to Twitter.\n\nWhen Zuckerberg asked the group what it would look like if Meta went “really big,” Mosseri, who had joined the call late at night during an anniversary trip to Italy, floated the idea of going after Twitter directly with a look-alike product. Zuckerberg liked the idea, and the group decided to build a new text-focused social network as quickly as possible.\n\n“The idea was to have something launchable as quickly as possible, but not to launch it until it was ready,” Mosseri said. “Unless something wild happened over at Twitter.”\n\nSomething wild did indeed happen. On July 1, Musk abruptly announced that Twitter would start limiting how many posts users could read each day, an effort to combat data scrapers and encourage more people to pay for his $8-per-month subscription service. The decision led to widespread outrage from Twitter users. Mosseri, who was scheduled to take a one-month sabbatical, canceled his plans. The Threads team scrambled to get the new app out the door, and it was unveiled just four days later on July 5, one month earlier than planned. (Musk reversed the decision to limit Twitter users’ daily post access a few weeks later.)\n\n“There should be a public conversations app with 1 billion-plus people on it,” Zuckerberg wrote in a post on Threads after its launch. “Twitter has had the opportunity to do this but hasn’t nailed it. Hopefully we will.”A Political Strategy\n\nWhile Zuckerberg hasn’t yet nailed it, he’s come closer than anybody else. Where Meta has struggled, though, has been in its ability to clearly explain what Threads is for – ironically the same issue that Twitter grappled with for years. Because Threads looks almost identical to Twitter, it seems that most people assume they’ll have the same experience. But even though Threads was “heavily inspired” by Twitter, “we definitely wanted it to feel different,” Mosseri said in the interview. “We wanted to make it a less angry space.”\n\nThat difference in feeling appears noticeable to many users and has come with mixed reviews. “I miss twitter,” wrote one user. “This place is like facebook and twitter had a baby and the baby got twitter’s looks but facebook’s personality.”\n\nOthers are more optimistic about the change. “Threads of today is populated with millions of users who bolted Twitter in utter disgust. They don’t want that world again,” wrote Tim Fullerton, a digital marketing executive and former campaign staffer for former US President Barack Obama. “They want one that’s more focused on community and less on broadcasting.”\n\nWhile Twitter had many flaws, it had also established an identity before Musk arrived as a home for breaking news and live, real-world updates. Threads seems prepared to move in a slightly different direction, particularly when it comes to political news — a topic that is highly engaging, but often polarizing and controversial. Posts that include political news are still shown to a user’s followers and won’t be “downranked” or hidden, Mosseri said, but Threads won’t proactively recommend those posts to others on the service, either.\n\nIt’s a significant distinction, since Mosseri said more than 50% of the posts that people see on Threads are recommendations from outside their network. That means it’s harder to get attention or build a following by posting political content.\n\n“We don’t think it’s our place to amplify political news,” Mosseri explained, citing examples like abortion, the war in Gaza and the US presidential election. “We don’t think it’s our place to show you a hot take on a political issue from an account you do not follow and therefore you did not ask for it.”\n\nMosseri is adamant that Threads is still a place for news outside of politics, and said that he wants Threads “to be a place where you can be up to speed on what’s happening as it’s happening.” That hasn’t always translated, though, as Threads has been slow at times to show users posts about breaking news events. For a time, it was even common for users to see posts about a breaking news event days after it was over.\n\nWhether it’s possible for Threads to succeed as a digital town square for news more broadly, while simultaneously trying to corral political news, is still to be determined. Technology companies like Meta and Twitter have long argued that political content makes up a small percentage of the total posts on their respective networks, but those discussions are arguably the most urgent, contentious and captivating. Political discourse on X, for example, has been a defining feature of the service for years, capped by the fact that former US President Donald Trump used Twitter to post sometimes dozens of times per day.\n\nWhile minimizing the spread of political news may indeed make Threads a “less angry” place, Mosseri acknowledges that approach also comes at a cost.\n\n“I think we are going to give up some of that relevance, some of that attention, some of that business,” he said. “And that’s OK.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina’s Investment Bankers Join the Communist Party as Morale (and Paychecks) Shrink Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America The Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before Dragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing For Tesla, a Smaller Drop in Sales Is Something to Celebrate\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This article was originally published on ETFTrends.com.\n\nAs 1/7th of the vaunted \"Magnificent Seven\" that's been leading the way for market returns this year, Meta could continue to prosper with its investments in AI. That would give bullish traders reason to ride the momentum.\n\nCohesively, the Magnificent Seven were propelling the market rally of 2023. But 2024 saw each go in different directions. Meta has been the second-best performer YTD regarding price gains, only trailing behind Nvidia.\n\n\"Dubbed the Magnificent Seven stocks, Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Tesla lived up to their name in 2023 with big gains,\" confirmed an Investors article. \"But the end of the second quarter of 2024 showed a big divergence of returns.\"\n\nSome market analysts foresee Meta continuing to push higher, especially if their AI investments translate to tangible revenue generation. One analyst noted that the company is within the upper limits of its revenue guidance of $36.5 to $39 billion.\n\n“We have seen a meaningful uptick in Meta ad prices. We believe this reflects ongoing progress with AI across engagement, ad relevance, and advertiser returns,” said KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson. He noted that this revenue generation could offset its investment capital in AI.\n\n“We would argue that we are already seeing initial returns in engagement trends and monetization, suggesting that this capex cycle is worth supporting,” Patterson added.\n\nMeantime, traders who think Meta can only push higher may want to add leverage with the Direxion Daily META Bull 2X Shares (METU). Alternatively, if Meta's stock price pushes lower in the interim or if they want to add a pairs trading strategy, there's the Direxion Daily META Bear 1X Shares (METD).\n\nTrade All Magnificent Seven With Single-Stock ETFs\n\nAdditionally, Direxion's product suite of single-stock ETFs allow traders to add leverage to both bullish and bearish trades.

        "content": "When it rains, it pours. However, the storm will eventually pass. Accordingly, investors that are able to identify solid businesses that have the staying power to emerge stronger from the storm can certainly outperform. Indeed, I think it’s possible to realize triple-digit gains, as many did during the 2022 selloffs, from picking such stocks\n\nThe circumstances are very much different in 2024. It’s very difficult to find quality companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) at $90 these days. That said, there are still many other quality companies that are trading at bargain-basement levels. Such companies are my focus – the ones that can make a similar comeback over the next few years. We’re near a shift in economic policy, and this could catalyze a breakout over the next few years.\n\nI think these three undervalued stocks will be among the top beneficiaries of shifting market trends.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMongoDB (MDB) An image of different overlaid data charts\n\nSource: solarseven/Shutterstock\n\nMongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB) is a leading database platform company. Despite MDB stock plunging by a staggering 42% from mid-May to mid-June, I believe the selloff is majorly overdone. Currently, the stock appears to offer compelling value.\n\nFirst, it’s crucial to note that MongoDB’s steep decline came despite the company beating both top and bottom-line estimates in its latest quarter. MongoDB posted Q1 FY2025 adjusted earnings per share of 51 cents, handsomely surpassing consensus by 11 cents. Revenues also climbed by an impressive 22.3% year-over-year to $450.56 million, exceeding expectations by $10.9 million.\n\nThe primary culprit behind Wall Street’s severe punishment of this stock was MongoDB’s lowered outlook. The company trimmed its full-year sales guidance to $1.89 billion, down from the $1.915 billion projected in March. Similarly, adjusted earnings are now anticipated at $2.23 per share, a reduction from the earlier $2.38 forecast.\n\nHowever, I firmly believe the market’s reaction is a clear overreaction. MDB stock has already rebounded nearly 20% from its mid-June trough, and I expect this recovery to gain further momentum. If MongoDB continues its streak of beating estimates and increasing guidance, the stock could be poised for an even more jaw-dropping breakout.\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV) luv stock\n\nSource: Ryan Fletcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nSouthwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) operates as a passenger airline carrier, providing scheduled air transportation services in the U.S. and international markets. While airline stocks are anything but rosy right now (as they grapple with the post-pandemic debt hangover and steep interest rate hikes), Southwest’s first quarter results suggest glimmers of hope on the horizon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company achieved record Q1 operating revenues and passenger numbers, marking eight straight quarters of top-line records. Managed business revenues surged an impressive 25% year-over-year. And Southwest’s trailing 12-month revenue in Q1 2024 posted a towering surge, coming in $4.3 billion higher than pre-pandemic levels in Q4 2019. Notably, the airline’s fleet has also continued to grow. undervalued stocks: southwest airlines total aircraft\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nHowever, the crux of the issue lies in translating this revenue recovery into bottom-line profitability via margin expansion. As interest rates eventually moderate, Southwest should see much-needed relief on its interest expenses. I believe Southwest is far from dead in the water. The building blocks are there for a jaw-dropping breakout in the years ahead as the company polishes their operations and interest rates become more favorable. The current turbulence is undoubtedly significant. But Southwest seems poised to weather the storm.\n\nPfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is a global pharmaceutical giant delivering innovative medicines and vaccines. Indeed, Pfizer was the among greatest pandemic darlings. But this narrative has been crushed as the music stopped.\n\nCoronavirus vaccines are highly politicized and are a thing of the past. Many people believed these companies would see recurring sales from people permanently taking booster shots every six months, as vaccine manufacturers and the health departments of certain countries recommended. That definitely did not happen. As such, PFE stock has been treated as a one-trick pony, with the stock down 52% from its peak.\n\nHowever, I do think that a recovery is possible. The stock seems to be bottoming out. And when excluding sales Pfizer generated due to COVID-19 vaccines and medication, the business is reporting solid growth. In Q1 2024, Pfizer posted revenue of $14.88 billion, an 18.6% year-over-year decline. But this number still beat estimates by nearly $1 billion. The company’s non-COVID portfolio delivered strong results, indicating the underlying business remains robust. Financials are clearly stabilizing, and look poised to continue improving again. PFE revenue EPS chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe company’s oncology business should drive growth in the years to come, and Pfizer’s Seagen acquisition might also contribute to future growth. Pfizer’s pipeline progress gives me cautious optimism about its future prospects. I believe the worst may be over for PFE stock, as the company eyes a potential breakout.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Yahoo! Finance reports 21 analysts predicting a 1-year price range on ADSK between $225.00 and $310.00, with a mean of $270.62.\n\nADSK has shown strong revenue generation and profitability for Q1 2024. Revenue has grown 11.66% YOY and its net profit margin has grown 40.11% YOY. The company even shows signs of being undervalued as a current WACC of 9.1% but an ROIC of 13.6% presents an opportunity to gain on investment for investors.\n\nAutodesk has acquired Wonder Dynamics, a company that focuses on 3D cloud animation and VFX solutions through AI-powered tools. These tools lower artists’ workload on Autodesk platforms, allowing them to further their creativity and improve the Autodesk platform experience for artists. Autodesk has also changed its management structure, with previous CFO, Deborah Clifford, stepping down and Elizabeth Rafael being appointed in the interim. This decision came after an internal audit surprisingly discovered that “certain decisions” concerning discretionary spending and accounts payable resulted in decreased profitability. Autodesk is one of the best metaverse stocks for investors this July.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) A photo of the Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on a gray building against a blue sky.\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a company that designs and manufactures semiconductors and wireless technology services. Yahoo! Finance reports 23 analysts predicting a 1-year price range on QCOM between $123.59 and $252.81, with a mean of $182.32.\n\nQCOM presented robust financials for Q1 2024. The company was able to beat EPS and revenue expectations for Q1 2024, making it the third consecutive quarter of EPS and revenue surprises. Free cash flow has grown markedly to an astonishing 377.28% YOY increase, making a case for QCOM’s strong profitability beyond EPS.\n\nStory continues\n\nQCOM furthers its partnership with Meta Platforms (NYSE:META) by optimizing “Meta Llama 3 large language models” significantly on cell phones, VR/AR headsets, PCs and more devices on the Qualcomm Snapdragon platform. This greatly improves the user experience and efficiency of AI applications on Qualcomm devices.\n\nWith regards to the Metaverse, Qualcomm is ramping up development of its new “XR2 gen 3” VR GPU chips. The flagship chip is rumored to be capable of 4k resolution. While the Apple Vision Pro offers this as well, the products with the “XR2 gen 3” could offer similar capabilities at a massively discounted price. Strengthening ties to Meta and the development of a powerful VR chip with market-changing potential make QCOM one of the best metaverse stocks.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) ADBE stock adobe stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a leading software company that specializes in digital media and marketing. The company’s investment into AI features with its strong subscription model has helped with its success.\n\nThe company reported $5.31 billion in revenue in its Q2 earnings call, beating many analysts’ expectations alongside a 10% YOY increase. Profitability was outstanding with an 88.24% gross profit margin. in comparison to the sector median gross profit margin of 49.41%.\n\nAdobe’s investment in AI has been evident with its recent partnership with Microsoft. Specifically, this collaboration improves efficiency among marketing teams by utilizing Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Copilot AI. The company also unveiled new product features, enhancing personalization and engagement through the use of AI tools. Additionally, Adobe’s Creative Cloud subscription services contribute to a steady stream of income, reaching 33 million paid subscribers at the start of 2024.\n\nThis subscription model ensures a predictable revenue model and enhances financial stability. Moreover, Morningstar analysts believe that this stock is undervalued with a predicted annual growth rate of 11%. Coupled with its advancements in AI and the robust subscription framework, Adobe is one of the best metaverse stocks on the market right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Rodrigues did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The growth of artificial intelligence is a rising tide that raises all ships. This is evident when looking at one-year growth of companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), through a historic AI bull run that we are still in. Technology that helps corporations automate and make day-to-day tasks more efficient will be prevalent in the coming years. Just as automated machines took factory workers’ jobs, robots will start to do the same in multiple sectors.\n\nThis is backed by the robotics industry’s compound annual growth rate, which projected to be 18% through 2034. This is indicative of strong growth – even in companies that don’t match the industry average.\n\nWith that in mind, here are three robotics stocks that will give you favorable returns in the long run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is not the first thing that comes to mind when you think robotics stocks. The company is a globally renown EV manufacturer. But Tesla is expanding into the robotics sector through products such as Robotaxi and Optimus (Tesla Bot). However, Tesla’s core EV business is currently struggling, representing a risk investors should factor in.\n\nTesla’s financials are pretty good; it has a profit margin of 14.3%, an operating cash flow of $10.98 billion, and an EBITDA of $12.26 billion. However, quarterly revenue is down 8.7% from a year ago, with earnings growth down more than 55%. This is primarily due to delivery expectations falling. EV sales in the second quarter are expected to fall as much 12%. However, other sources suggest that this quarter marks the “rebound” with innovations such as Robotaxi carrying the company’s growth.\n\nRobotaxi is Tesla’s spin on the autonomous taxi. CEO Elon Musk has been teasing this for a while, but Robotaxi’s official reveal date has yet to be confirmed. Hinting to its release, the company recently patented a self-cleaning feature for Robotaxi. This shows a step in the right direction. Analysts are projecting this as being a huge catalyst, so it is best to move now and buy TSLA stock.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NYSE:ISRG) is a robotics company that specializes in products used in the healthcare sector. It has seen immense growth over the past year and is up 30% in 2024. Strong revenue and earnings growth make this pick a buy.\n\nISRG currently has a profit margin of 27.1%, with an operating margin of 24.8%. The company has $7.32 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, with quarterly revenue increasing by 11.5% in the last year. Profitability is very strong, with an earnings growth of 53.4% in the same period. The company has $4.8 billion in cash; enabling ISRG to expand its research and development departments.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is projecting 16.1% growth over the next five years. This is based on multiple catalysts, including the adoption of its systems and developments in AI, but counterbalanced by supply constraints. The company’s Da Vinci system has grown by 14% from a year ago with utilization up 2%. The increased prevalence of AI in the medical field also boosts ISRG stock. However, supply constraints are leading to ISRG losing sales; any missed sale means that the company misses out on market share. That being said, ISRG is still a solid robotics stocks pick.\n\nServe Robotics (SERV) a group of people eating fast food, including cheeseburgers and fries\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nServe Robotics (NASDAQ:SERV) operates in the autonomous food delivery niche. While it is a newer company, it saw immense publicity over the past few months. SERV is up 1% over the past five days, but is down 92% year-to-date. While this seems to be a negative sign, analysts are projecting an average price target of $46.33, representing a growth potential of over 2,200%.\n\nThe company’s financials aren’t great; the operating margin is a loss of 814.55%, EBITDA is a loss of $21.33 million, and operating cash flow is loss of $16.34 million. This led to the company losing a lot of money – debt stands at $8.47 million. However, a saving grace is that quarterly revenue is up 2,252%, which is extremely impressive for a company this small.\n\nA leading growth catalyst for SERV is its partnership with industry heavyweights – this includes Uber (NYSE:UBER), Nvidia, and 7-Eleven. These partnerships have become increasingly useful as they provide SERV with legitimacy and leverage. Recently, SERV announced that it would be expanding operations in Los Angeles, with Uber Eats helping SERV cover areas of Koreatown.\n\nInsiders and institutions control 44.2% of SERV stock, which should make investors confident. This suggests that people believe this company has a ways to go. Thus, it is a great low-cost robotics stock investment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Rodrigues did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy in July",
        "content": "Everyone's been talking about artificial intelligence (AI), and companies that are leaders in this technology have pushed the stock market higher in recent months. For example, the share price gains of chip designer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) accounted for 32% of the S&P 500's overall increase from the start of the year through the end of May, according to Statista. This area is hot right now, but its momentum could continue for quite some time because the AI growth story is still in its early days. Analysts at MarketsandMarkets predict the size of the AI market will soar past $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nMeanwhile, some of today's leading AI stocks still trade at reasonable valuations -- and some that have the potential to become future winners also look like reasonable buys. So there are still plenty of opportunities to get in on tech stocks that are likely to benefit over time from the AI boom. Here are three that look like solid buys right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Intel\n\nIntel (NASDAQ: INTC) didn't play a major role in the early chapters of the AI story. In fact, the leader in central processing units -- which are the main processors in any computer -- got left behind. But Intel recently put a new focus on accelerated computing and launched a strong portfolio of AI products, including one that may even rival leader Nvidia's top graphics processing unit (GPU). Intel's Gaudi 3 accelerator has surpassed Nvidia's H100 inference performance and energy efficiency in certain models -- at a lower cost. Even if Nvidia's next release surpasses it, price-conscious customers still could prefer Intel's offering.\n\nOn top of this, Intel may have another new revenue driver coming. The company has opened up its manufacturing infrastructure to other chipmakers, and set a goal of becoming the world's second-biggest third-party chip foundry by 2030. Today, North American customers largely turn to manufacturing in Asia for their foundry needs, but in the future, they may appreciate this closer-to-home option.\n\nThese two elements make Intel a compelling recovery and growth story for the long-term investor -- especially at today's valuation of 28 times forward earnings estimates.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg disappointed investors during Meta Platforms'(NASDAQ: META) latest earnings call when he said it would take the company time to monetize its AI investments. But I don't see that as bad news. As Zuckerberg said, this will follow the pattern of other big Meta investments -- which have delivered growth over time for the company and for investors who held onto their shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe social media giant aims to become an AI leader, integrating the technology throughout its products and services. Ensuring that its Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram apps stay on top is key for Meta because it generates most of its revenue from advertisers -- and they'll keep coming back if their target audiences stick around and spend more time on those apps.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta is financially solid, its free cash flow has been growing, and it even declared its first-ever dividend. META Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nTrading at 25 times forward earnings estimates, Meta looks like a great buying opportunity right now.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nNvidia has climbed at percentage rates in the triple digits over the past three years, and its shares soared past $1,000 earlier this year. The tech giant completed a stock split recently, which brought the price of each individual share back down out of the stratosphere, but it's important to remember that this financial maneuver didn't lower the chipmaker's valuation or change anything fundamental about the company. It just made it easier for a broader range of investors to access the stock without relying on fractional shares.\n\nThough Nvidia's market cap has advanced significantly, it still represents a great long-term buy. The company dominates the AI chip market, and its focus on innovation should help it keep that dominance going. Management has pledged to update its GPUs annually, a pace that could keep it ahead of its rivals. Next up this year is a particularly big launch -- the release of a whole new architecture called Blackwell that features six innovations including Nvidia's best chip yet.\n\nToday, Nvidia trades for 45 times forward earnings estimates, which is a high valuation. But Nvidia stock definitely is worth the premium thanks to its AI leadership and the likelihood of it remaining in a top position in this high-growth market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Dividend Stocks to Sell in July Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "When things go well, dividend stocks can generate steady gains while providing cash flow for investors. Ideally, corporations raise their dividends every year and deliver long-term returns for investors.\n\nHowever, the presence of index funds and thousands of publicly traded corporations should invite investors to be more selective about their assets. Some dividend stocks will get left in the dust and outperformed by indices. Even if a stock stays relatively flat and still gives out cash flow, your long-term gains are probably falling behind inflation.\n\nThe Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) increased by 2.6% year-over-year (YOY) in May. This reading indicates that inflation is cooling, but it also means a dividend stock must yield more than 2.6% to beat inflation. Some dividend stocks yield less than 1% but comfortably outperform the stock market. However, other dividend stocks offer high yields without much beyond that.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese are some of the dividend stocks to sell in July before they get worse and fall behind the stock market.\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTarget (NYSE:TGT) is up by 3% year-to-date (YTD) but are in the middle of a sharp correction. The retailer’s stock has rallied sharply since November 2023, yet the stock now looks overextended. While inflation is cooling, consumers are still grappling with tight budgets. Target has been affected and recently cut prices on 5,000 items to bring back shoppers.\n\nSales dropped by 3.2% YOY in the first quarter as comparable store sales dipped by 3.7% YOY. Target anticipates delivering 0% to 2% sales growth throughout 2024. Low revenue growth rates put a cap on income growth, especially in a business model that is known for low profit margins. Target is no tech company, and it only delivered a 3.8% net profit margin in the first quarter. It’s unlikely for profit margins to meaningfully grow while revenue growth remains flat.\n\nAnother concerning sign is the company’s meager 1.8% dividend hike. This low growth rate demonstrates Target is doing the minimum to keep dividend investors on board. Dividend growth has been negligible each year since 2022. Corporations only slow down their dividend growth rates if the business model is slowing down. It’s not a good development for long-term investors.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) The website for Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) needed a mid-April surge to log a 6% YTD gain. Shares are up by only 25% over the past five years and have woefully underperformed the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. Those indices have 5-year gains of 86% and 121%, respectively. The stock has a 3.05% yield. However, inflation has chipped away at most of the dividend, and that’s before you pay taxes on it.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe soft drinks company has a 25.5 P/E ratio, which looks elevated relative to its recent financial performance. Coca-Cola reported just a 3% YOY revenue growth in the first quarter of 2024. Net income growth was even worse, coming in at 2% YOY. Coca-Cola closed the quarter with an impressive 28.1% net profit margin, but slow growth still doesn’t warrant the valuation.\n\nFor comparison, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has a 29 P/E ratio and more than doubled its net income in the first quarter of 2024 while maintaining 27% YOY revenue growth. Meta Platforms’ success and valuation help to demonstrate why Coca-Cola appears overvalued in comparison.\n\neBay (EBAY) an ebay shipping box. cheap stocks\n\nSource: ShutterStockStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\neBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is having a good year. It’s up by 22% YTD and only has an 11 P/E ratio, but a closer look indicates some issues. eBay has been up by just 36% over the past five years, which indicates a history of underperformance. Furthermore, the stock’s 2.01% yield does not keep up with inflation.\n\nThe company’s financial growth doesn’t inspire much confidence. Revenue only grew by 2% YOY in the first quarter while gross merchandise volume was only up by 1% YOY. Net income dropped by 23% YOY. Also, the company’s recent decision to stop accepting American Express (NYSE:AXP) cards can impact its business in future quarters. While this impact shouldn’t be massive, eBay can’t afford to lose any growth at current levels.\n\nTherefore, Wall Street analysts are lukewarm about the stock. It’s only rated as a moderate buy with a projected 1% upside. The lowest price target of $45 per share suggests that shares can fall by an additional 17%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Social Media Stocks You Can Retire On",
        "content": "Social media is a fast growing market that Goldman Sachs expects to double to $480 billion by 2027. To take advantage of this trend, many invest in the obvious social media stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Meta (NASDAQ:META).\n\nHowever, these companies are trading at all-time highs and there is no way to know if they are overvalued. When planning for one’s retirement, investing in hot stocks of the day is too much of a gamble.\n\nPersonally, I like to look for social media stocks that are already dominating their respective markets. It also doesn’t hurt if they can pay dividends shortly and are reasonably or undervalued.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nZoom Video (ZM) Zoom (ZM) logo on a building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt one point, Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) traded at over $550 per share. Today it trades below $60, 4.5% lower than when it IPOed.\n\nEven though the hype is gone, Zoom is still the leading video conferencing software with 57% of the market share. With hybrid expected to become the most prevalent work arrangement, Zoom isn’t likely to become irrelevant any time soon. The stock is simply not what it was during the pandemic.\n\nIn quarter one of 2024, Zoom’s revenue improved just 3.2% year-over-year (YOY). However, net income improved from $15.4 million to $216.3 million. The key reason is that Zoom is growing its enterprise customers who have higher margins, and because it’s expanding into an area known as Unified Communication as a Service (UCaas) which could mean unifying all of a company’s internal communications like video calls, chats and phone calls all in one place. For example, one of its fastest growing products is the Zoom Phone, which grew from 4 million users in 2022 to over 7 million this year and is essentially a business phone system that is online. It’s able to leverage its existing enterprise customers to sell them\n\nTrading at a 11.63x forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, it is below Cisco’s (NASDAQ:CSCO) 13.5x even though Zoom has more growth potential. Moreover, it’s proof that Zoom certainly isn’t the Covid-19 bubble stock of the past and that it could be undervalued.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Adobe makes a strong investment in the social media economy for one main reason — its industry dominance. 90% of creative workers use Adobe’s Creative Cloud in order to create the content on social media. On top of this, it has strong and proven financials. Since 2015 ABDE has experienced on average over 18% annual revenue growth. Adobe’s net income for Q2 2024 was $1.573 billion, compared to $1.295 billion in Q2 2023, this is a 22% YOY increase, due to the growth of the digital experience segment where it helps companies run digital ads. In addition, this is due to the fact of increased revenue from existing subscribers upgrading to its AI tools. Through Adobe Sensei and Firefly, AI tools are natively implemented and improving users’ productivity.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts valuation isn’t cheap, trading at a forward P/E ratio of 30.86x. However, with it being a dominant player and potentially giving out dividends in the near future due to its strong earnings growth, I think its valuation right now is reasonable and makes it a great option among social media stocks.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) can increasingly be considered a social media stock due to its growing position as a digital advertiser and its short-form content app Inspire.\n\nFirst, let’s establish Amazon’s dominance in its various fields. In e-commerce, it is the largest player with over 40% market share in the U.S. In cloud computing, AWS is the largest player and has 31% of global market share. For video on demand streaming, Amazon’s Prime Video is the largest at 21% of the market share. Lastly, Amazon’s digital advertising business is rapidly growing the world’s third largest digital advertiser at 24% YOY and outpacing competitors.\n\nGrowth in AWS and advertising has driven operating margins to improve from 3.7% in Q1 2023 to 10.7% in Q1 2024, helping Amazon deliver over 200% in net income to $10.43 billion. With strong earnings and better margins, it sets Amazon up to deliver dividend payments soon along with the others in the “Magnificent 7.”\n\nThe thorn lies in Amazon’s valuation, which is hard to argue given its trading at all-time highs. However, I would argue that the premium paid is more justified given the fact its current P/E ratio is lower now than when the stock traded below $100. Essentially, what we are seeing right now is that Amazon stock price is returning to its 2021 levels but this time it’s backed up by strong earnings rather than pure hype. I’m willing to take a bet on valuation for a high-quality company like Amazon.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que held a LONG position in AMZN.

        "content": "RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazil’s national data protection authority determined on Tuesday that Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, cannot use data originating in the country to train its artificial intelligence.\n\nMeta's updated privacy policy enables the company to feed people’s public posts into its AI systems. That practice will not be permitted in Brazil, however.\n\nThe decision stems from “the imminent risk of serious and irreparable or difficult-to-repair damage to the fundamental rights of the affected data subjects,” the agency said in the nation’s official gazette.\n\nBrazil is one of Meta's biggest markets. Facebook alone has around 102 million active users in the country, the agency said in a statement. The nation has a population of 203 million, according to the country’s 2022 census.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta said in a statement the company is “disappointed” and insists its method “complies with privacy laws and regulations in Brazil.”\n\n“This is a step backwards for innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Brazil,” the spokesperson added.\n\nThe social media company has also encountered resistance to its privacy policy update in Europe, where it recently put on hold its plans to start feeding people’s public posts into training AI systems — which was supposed to start last week.\n\nIn the U.S., where there’s no national law protecting online privacy, such training is already happening.\n\nMeta said on its Brazilian blog in May that it could “use information that people have shared publicly about Meta’s products and services for some of our generative AI features,” which could include “public posts or photos and their captions.”\n\nRefusing to partake is possible, Meta said in that statement. Despite that option, there are “excessive and unjustified obstacles to accessing the information and exercising” the right to opt out, the agency said in a statement.\n\nMeta did not provide sufficient information to allow people to be aware of the possible consequences of using their personal data for the development of generative AI, it added.\n\nCompliance must be demonstrated by the company within five working days from the notification of the decision, and the agency established a daily fine of 50,000 reais ($8,820) for failure to do so.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Meta Platforms said on Tuesday it would lift its blanket ban on the word \"shaheed\", or \"martyr\" in English, after a year-long review by its oversight board found the social media giant's approach was \"overbroad\".\n\nThe company has been criticized for years over its handling of content involving the Middle East, including in a 2021 study Meta itself commissioned that found its approach had an \"adverse human rights impact\" on Palestinians and other Arabic-speaking users of its services.\n\nThose criticisms have escalated since the onset of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in October.\n\nThe oversight board, which is funded by Meta but operates independently, started its review last year because the word accounted for more content removals on the company's platforms than any other single word or phrase.\n\nMeta is the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe review found in March that Meta's rules on \"shaheed\" failed to account for the word's variety of meanings and resulted in the removal of content not aimed at praising violent actions.\n\nMeta acknowledged the findings of the review on Tuesday and said its tests showed that removing content when \"shaheed\" was \"paired with otherwise violating content ​​captures the most potentially harmful content without disproportionally impacting the voice\".\n\nThe oversight board welcomed the change, saying Meta's policy related to the word had led to the censoring of millions of people across its platforms.\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Ever since the Federal Reserve went on a crusade to increase interest rates and slow the progression of inflation at the beginning of 2022, investors have been cheering for a Goldilocks-type of economic soft landing. Last month, this narrative remained intact.\n\nThe S&P 500 index surged +3.5% for the month, the technology-heavy NASDAQ rocketed +6.0% (fueled by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other AI-related companies), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average a more modest +1.1% move thanks to the contribution of older economy stocks.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nDespite the looming presidential election this November and the recent debate, the stock market has continued on a +56% bull market tear since the October 2023-low, eight months ago (see chart below). The not-too-hot, not-too-cold economic data have provided comfort to investors. For example, growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the broadest measurement of economic activity, was positive (+1.4%) during the first quarter and it is expected to modestly accelerate in the second quarter (+2.2%), as forecasted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nIn addition, the job and inflation stories are staying consistent with the soft landing plot line, as well. The unemployment rate has been creeping higher, but currently remains near multi-decade lows at 4.0%. Inflation also continued its downward trend as evidenced by last week's Core PCE inflation data (the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge), which came in at +2.6%, the lowest level since March of 2021 (see chart below). Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nGasoline and food costs are significant inputs to the overall declining inflation dynamics. The two largest crops in the United States are corn and soybeans, and with those prices down significantly year-over-year (see chart below), it should come as no surprise that consumers are finally seeing some relief in skyrocketing food prices. Declining gasoline prices have also chipped-in to the improving inflation outlook. Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nWith all these economic statistics harmoniously aligning with a soft landing scenario, investors are currently comfortable in forecasting one interest rate cut over the next six months, and three and a half interest rate cuts over the next 12 months (see chart below). Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nSource:Yardeni Research\n\nBut a bull market cannot survive on interest rate cut expectations alone. Over the long-run, stock prices generally follow the direction of corporate profits, and as the chart below indicates (red line), fortunately, the path of profits has been rising after a period of stagnation last year.\n\nStory continues Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nSource: Yardeni Research\n\nThe last eight months have been an exhilarating ride in the overall stock market, which has been propelled by the multi-trillion dollar technology companies participating in the A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) buildout revolution (i.e., NVIDIA, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet-Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), et.al.). However, neither trees nor stock markets can grow, uninterrupted, to the sky forever. The recent environment has been jubilant for investors, but party participants cannot go on forever without experiencing a hangover. The best advice is to celebrate responsibly, while managing the risk of your investment portfolio, because eventually the cops will arrive and the party will come to an end.\n\nThis article is an excerpt from a previously released Sidoxia Capital Management complimentary newsletter (July 1, 2024).\n\nDISCLOSURE: Sidoxia Capital Management (SCM) and some of its clients hold positions in individual stocks , certain exchange traded funds (ETFs), including NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL, META, and AMZN but at the time of publishing had no direct position in any other security referenced in this article.

        "title": "Meta reverses policy on a controversial Arabic term as the Israel-Gaza war continues to spark Big Tech debates",
        "content": "As we reported a few months ago, Meta’s independent Oversight Board recommended that the Facebook parent end its policy of banning the Arabic term “shaheed” when used in reference to what Meta views as a dangerous individual or organization.\n\nMeta’s stance was that the term, which usually translates as “martyr,” was one of praise in these circumstances. However, “shaheed” does not always signal approval, and the issue was fraught enough for the company to ask the Oversight Board for its opinion (the board, which is funded by Meta, cannot issue binding recommendations outside of specific cases). And now, having received it, the company has decided to change the policy.\n\nToday, Meta said it would now only ban content with the word “shaheed” if it violates other policies or comes with “one or more of three signals of violence,” namely: a picture of weaponry; wording that advocates the use or carrying of weaponry; or a reference to a “designated event” such as a terrorist attack.\n\nThe Oversight Board still wants to see Meta become more transparent about how it designates people, organizations and events as being dangerous, but it nonetheless welcomed the move, saying the previous policy had led to millions of takedowns affecting mostly Muslim users.\n\n“This change may not be easy, but it is the right thing to do and an important step to take. By vowing to adopt a more nuanced approach that will better protect freedom of expression, while also ensuring the most harmful material is still removed, Meta is stepping up,” board member Paolo Carozza said in a statement.\n\nOthers are not so pleased with Meta’s decision, with Sacha Roytman—CEO of the Combat Antisemitism Movement—saying in a statement that “social media platforms have been used as recruitment centers for terrorist organizations over the last few years, and social media companies should be working to prevent rather than assisting this process.”\n\nMeta is not the only Big Tech outfit to face tough content calls in the context of the Israel-Gaza war, which began when Hamas, the militant group that ruled Gaza for a generation, slaughtered 1,139 people in Israel on October 7 last year—since then, the war has claimed over 37,000 lives in Gaza.\n\nAlso today, Wired reported on the disquiet within YouTube over the Google property’s decision not to take down a Hebrew rap song that backs the Israeli military action in Gaza with praise for bombing and shooting, and with references to Hamas fighters as rats.\n\nAccording to the piece, YouTube decided that the song targets Hamas rather than Palestinians in general, and there is no penalty for hate speech against terrorist organizations. However, some employees reportedly note that the song uses the Biblical term “Amalek,” which refers to Israel’s historical enemies, and say it therefore genocidally targets Palestinians in general. YouTube did not dispute the reporting of the internal controversy, but denied accusations of biased content moderation.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The suggestion that we apply our policies differently based on which religion or ethnicity is featured in the content is simply untrue,” spokesperson Jack Malon told Wired. “We have removed tens of thousands of videos since this conflict began. Some of these are tough calls, and we don’t make them lightly, debating to get to the right outcome.”\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AI is learning from what you said on Reddit, Stack Overflow or Facebook. Are you OK with that?",
        "content": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Post a comment on Reddit, answer coding questions on Stack Overflow, edit a Wikipedia entry or share a baby photo on your public Facebook or Instagram feed and you are also helping to train the next generation of artificial intelligence.\n\nNot everyone is OK with that — especially as the same online forums where they've spent years contributing are increasingly flooded with AI-generated commentary mimicking what real humans might say.\n\nSome longtime users have tried to delete their past contributions or rewrite them into gibberish, but the protests haven't had much effect. A handful of governments — including Brazil's privacy regulator on Tuesday — have also tried to step in.\n\n“A more significant portion of the population just kind of feels helpless,” said Reddit volunteer moderator Sarah Gilbert, who also studies online communities at Cornell University. “There’s nowhere to go except just completely going offline or not contributing in ways that bring value to them and value to others.”\n\nPlatforms are responding — with mixed results. Take Stack Overflow, the popular hub for computer programming tips. First, it banned ChatGPT-written responses due to frequent errors, but now it's partnering with AI chatbot developers and has punished some of its own users who tried to erase their past contributions in protest.\n\nIt’s one of a number of social media platforms grappling with user wariness — and occasional revolts — as they try to adapt to the changes brought by generative AI.\n\nSoftware developer Andy Rotering of Bloomington, Minnesota, has used Stack Overflow daily for 15 years and said he worries the company “could be inadvertently hurting its greatest resource” — the community of contributors who’ve donated time to help other programmers.\n\n“Keeping contributors incentivized to provide commentary should be paramount,” he said.\n\nStack Overflow CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar said the company is trying to balance rising demand for instant chatbot-generated coding assistance with the desire for a community “knowledge base” where people still want to post and “get recognized” for what they've contributed.\n\n“Fast forward five years — there’s going to be all sorts of machine-generated content on the web,\" he said in an interview. \"There’s going to be very few places where there’s truly authentic, original human thought. And we’re one of those places.\"\n\nChandrasekar readily describes Stack Overflow's challenges as like one of the “case studies” he learned about at Harvard Business School, of a how a business survives — or doesn't — after a disruptive technological change.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor more than a decade, users typically landed on Stack Overflow after typing a coding question in Google, and then found the answer, copied and pasted it. The answers they were most likely to see came from volunteers who'd built up points measuring their credibility — which in some cases could help land them a job.\n\nNow programmers can simply ask an AI chatbot — some of which are already trained on everything ever posted to Stack Overflow — and it can instantly spit out an answer.\n\nChatGPT's debut in late 2022 threatened to put Stack Overflow out of business. So Chandrasekar carved out a special 40-person team at the company to race out the launch of its own specialized AI chatbot, called Overflow AI. Then, the company made deals with Google and ChatGPT maker OpenAI, enabling the AI developers to tap into Stack Overflow's question-and-answer archive to further improve their AI large language models.\n\nThat kind of strategy makes sense but may have come too late, said Maria Roche, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School. “I’m surprised that Stack Overflow wasn’t working on this earlier,\" she said.\n\nWhen some Stack Overflow users tried to delete their past comments after the Open AI partnership was announced, the company responded by suspending their accounts due to terms that make all contributions “perpetually and irrevocably licensed to Stack Overflow.\"\n\n“We quickly addressed it and said, ‘Look, that’s not acceptable behavior’,” said Chandrasekar, describing the protesters as a small minority in the “low hundreds” of the platform's 100 million users.\n\nBrazil’s national data protection authority on Tuesday took action to ban social media giant Meta Platforms from training its AI models on the Facebook and Instagram posts of Brazilians. It established a daily fine of 50,000 reais ($8,820) for non-compliance.\n\nMeta in a statement called it a “step backwards for innovation” and said it has been more transparent than many industry counterparts doing similar AI training on public content, and that its practices comply with Brazilian laws.\n\nMeta has also encountered resistance in Europe, where it recently put on hold its plans to start feeding people’s public posts into training AI systems — which was supposed to start last week. In the U.S., where there's no national law protecting online privacy, such training is already likely happening.\n\n“The vast majority of people just have no idea that their data is being used,” Gilbert said.\n\nReddit has taken a different approach — partnering with AI developers like OpenAI and Google while also making clear that content can't be taken in bulk without the platform’s approval by commercial entities “with no regard for user rights or privacy.” The deals helped bring Reddit the money it needed to debut on Wall Street in March, with investors pushing the value of the company close to $9 billion seconds after it began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nReddit hasn't tried to punish users who protested — nor could it easily do so given how much say voluntary moderators have on what happens in their specialty forums known as subreddits. But what worries Gilbert, who helps moderate the “AskHistorians” subreddit, is the increasing flow of AI-generated commentary that moderators must decide whether to allow or ban.\n\n“People come to Reddit because they want to talk to people, they don’t want to talk to bots,” Gilbert said. “There’s apps where they can talk to bots if they want to. But historically Reddit has been for connecting with humans.”\n\nShe said it's ironic that the AI-generated content threatening Reddit was sourced on the comments of millions of human Redditors, and “there’s a real risk that eventually it could end up pushing people out.”\n\n——\n\nAssociated Press writer Eléonore Hughes in Rio de Janeiro contributed to this report.\n\n——\n\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Social Media Stocks to Sell in July Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "Social media continues to be extremely popular. Today, five billion people — more than half the world’s population — regularly access social media sites. The average person visits seven different social media sites each month. Use of social media is even greater among young people, with 93% of teenagers in the U.S. saying they regularly access social media.\n\nGiven the popularity of social media platforms, one might assume that stocks of social media companies would be great investments.\n\nSadly, no.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMost social media stocks peaked in 2021 during the pandemic when people were sheltering in-place at home. Since then, social media companies have struggled with a slump in online advertising that is only now starting to recover.\n\nThe result is that most social media companies have struggled in recent years and their share prices have fallen steeply from the heights seen in 2021 during the last bull market. Here are three social media stocks to sell in July before they crash and burn.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) In this photo illustration, the Truth Social logo seen displayed on a smartphone with a photo of former US President Donald Trump displayed in the background. DJT stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s gotten a lift since the first presidential debate, but make no mistake. Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) remains extremely volatile and prone to erratic price movements. To give a sense of the volatility, consider that while DJT stock is up 90% year to date, it is trading about nearly 60% below its 52-week high. And Trump Media & Technology Group has only been a publicly traded stock since March of this year.\n\nThe company runs Truth Social, a social media platform that is modeled after X, formerly Twitter, and popular among the former president’s supporters. However, the company behind the social media platform has some serious financial problems.\n\nIn its first print as a publicly traded company, Trump Media reported a net loss of $327.6 million on less than $1 million in revenue. Some analysts describe DJT as a “meme stock.”\n\nThe volatility in Trump Media’s stock could worsen as we get closer to the presidential election this November, making it a social media stock to sell.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) lost a lot of goodwill with investors after its first-quarter earnings print. The company’s stock plunged 16% after the technology giant behind social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram delivered forward guidance that underwhelmed Wall Street. Sadly, the outlook overshadowed what was otherwise a strong quarterly print from the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta reported EPS of $4.71 versus $4.32 that was expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $36.46 billion compared to $36.16 billion that was expected. However, Meta said that it expects sales in the current second quarter of $36.5 billion to $39 billion.\n\nThat fell short of the consensus estimate of $38.3 billion among analysts.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta’s capital expenditures for 2024 are anticipated to be $40 billion, an increase from a previous forecast of $30 billion.\n\nThe increased capital spending is mostly due to growing outlays on artificial intelligence technologies being developed through the company’s Reality Labs unit. Since 2020, Reality Labs has lost $45 billion for the company. META stock is up 46% this year, but more volatility could be ahead if the company fails to meet Wall Street’s expectations and the heavy spending continues.\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nYear-to-date, Snap (NYSE:SNAP), the company behind social media platform Snapchat, is down o.74%, badly trailing the benchmark S&P 500‘s gain of 15%. SNAP stock is trading 80% lower than its all-time high reached in 2021 during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, when social media sites and the company’s behind them were flourishing.\n\nDespite several attempts at boosting its share price, Snap has not been able to recover.\n\nThe stock has declined due to a series of poor earnings that have resulted from a downturn in digital advertising. Prior to this year, Snap had reported six consecutive quarters of sales declines.\n\nEarlier this year, Snap announced that it was cutting 10% of its global workforce, which equates to about 500 employees. While the company’s earnings print for this year’s first quarter showed improvement, its shares continue to lag the market, making Snap a social media stock to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is It Too Late To Consider Buying Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)?",
        "content": "Let's talk about the popular Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth of 17% on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The company is inching closer to its yearly highs following the recent share price climb. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Meta Platforms’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nWhat Is Meta Platforms Worth?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 14% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Meta Platforms today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $585.79, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Meta Platforms’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat does the future of Meta Platforms look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 52% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Meta Platforms. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in META’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on META, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you'd like to know more about Meta Platforms as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Meta Platforms, and understanding it should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Meta Platforms, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Cathie Wood Says Software Is the Next Big AI Opportunity -- 2 Supercharged Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying if She's Right",
        "content": "Last year, Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood said software companies will be the next big opportunity in artificial intelligence (AI), predicting they will eventually generate $8 in revenue for every $1 spent on chips from leading suppliers like Nvidia.\n\nArk operates several funds (both private and exchange-traded) that reflect that stance. Using the Ark Venture Fund, Wood has piled into private AI software companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Elon Musk's xAI. Plus, Tesla is the largest holding in the flagship Ark Innovation ETF, which Wood says is the largest AI opportunity in the world thanks to its autonomous self-driving software.\n\nIf Wood is right about AI software, there could be a long list of winners in the coming years. Here's why CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) might be two of the biggest.\n\n1. CrowdStrike: A leader in AI-powered cybersecurity\n\nCrowdStrike is one of the world's best cybersecurity companies. In fact, its stock only needs to rise another 14% to eclipse the $104 billion valuation of the current industry leader, Palo Alto Networks. CrowdStrike's success stems from its unique lightweight security architecture and its reliance on AI to autonomously thwart attacks.\n\nCrowdStrike's AI models make over 180 million indicator-of-attack decisions every second -- in other words, they are constantly analyzing the motive and intent of attackers to determine the type of threat they pose. Those models are trained on more than 2 trillion security events each day, and that number climbs as more customers join CrowdStrike, which extends the company's AI advantage over its competitors.\n\nAll of that happens in the cloud. By using CrowdStrike, companies don't have to install bulky programs on every single device in their organization. Instead, they install a lightweight sensor that is connected to the cloud, which occupies minimal processing power compared to traditional cybersecurity software.\n\nCrowdStrike has taken a platform approach to cybersecurity since the day it was founded, which is in contrast to industry norms where different providers specialize in specific segments like cloud security, identity protection, and endpoint security. CrowdStrike covers all bases through its 28 modules, and while not every business needs the entire suite, 65% of customers were using five or more modules as of the recent fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 30).\n\nAccording to a CrowdStrike-sponsored study by International Data Corporation, businesses can save $6 for every $1 they invest in consolidating their cybersecurity needs onto the one platform. Therefore, not only do they get best-in-class protection, but switching to CrowdStrike is a no-brainer financially.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike ended Q1 with a record $3.6 billion in annual recurring revenue, but management believes that figure will surge 177% to $10 billion within the next five to seven years. That estimate might even be conservative considering how quickly AI is advancing, which will not only improve CrowdStrike's protective capabilities, but will create new threats that will drive more cybersecurity spending in the corporate sector.\n\n2. Meta Platforms: A social media giant turned AI developer\n\nMeta Platforms is home to leading social networks like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which serve 3.2 billion people every day. The company is already using AI to curate the content feeds for each user on Facebook and Instagram to ensure they are seeing posts that are most relevant to them. Last year, this drove an increase in engagement across both platforms, which provided Meta with more opportunities to generate advertising revenue.\n\nBut the company might have an even greater AI opportunity in its large language model (LLM) called Llama. It's the world's largest open-source model, so developers can use it for free to build their own AI applications, which allows Meta to crowdsource its testing to make improvements more quickly. That's important because Llama is the key to creating new AI features for Meta's existing platforms.\n\nFor example, the company launched a chatbot called Meta AI last year that users can access through Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. It can answer complex questions and generate images like most chatbots, but it can also be added to group chats to make restaurant and travel recommendations, or even offer gift ideas. Meta AI is currently powered by Llama 3, but the company is already training its next-generation model, which should offer even better capabilities.\n\nEventually, every business using Meta's apps could have its own personalized Meta AI-style chatbot that can handle incoming customer queries, and potentially even process sales. That should create new opportunities for Meta to generate revenue.\n\nHere's the best part about Meta stock: It's cheap. Based on the company's $17.41 in trailing-12-month earnings per share, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.9. That's a 9.4% discount to the 31.9 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index.\n\nIn 2025, Wall Street thinks Meta will generate $21.59 in earnings, which places its forward P/E ratio at just 23.3. That implies Meta stock will have to rise 36.9% by the end of next year just to trade in line with the broader tech sector.\n\nIf Cathie Wood is right about AI software, Meta stock might be an even bigger bargain today than the above numbers suggest, because there could be entirely new AI monetization opportunities to come as this story unfolds.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CrowdStrike wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of the 10 Best AI Momentum Stocks to Benefit from Volatility Ahead. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWolfe Research has joined the ongoing market correction chorus as more and more experts warn of volatility ahead amid soaring valuations led by AI. Wolfe Research, however, believes investors would stick to mega-cap tech stocks to survive through this volatility.\n\n“Our sense is that volatility will continue to pick up over the summer. However, we expect this to generally benefit the Mag 7, secular growers, and the overall Momentum Trade in the weeks ahead.”\n\nWolfe analysts expect investors to pile into quality stocks that “they can count on” amid economic “data surprises” ahead. The firm expects “these themes to continue to benefit from an environment in which growth is slowing but the Fed is expected to kick off a deep cutting cycle.”\n\n“Further, our sense is that the biggest companies driving these trends will once again put up very solid results during 2Q earnings season.”\n\nSince Wolfe believes investors are poised to stick with Magnificent Seven stocks in the upcoming volatility and called The Information Technology (SPG1200-45)(XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) “big winners”, we picked Mag. 7 stocks and top 3 AI stocks from the XLK for this article. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) the Best AI Momentum Stock to Benefit from Volatility Ahead?\n\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\n\nMETA could offset volatility this summer as investors will flock to Mag. 7 stocks in case market begins to waver, according to a latest report by Wolfe Research.\n\nThe social media giant is using AI for optimizing ad targeting and recommendation systems to boost engagement and ads revenue. In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.  However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it’ll bode well for the stock down the road.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta’s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nRGA Investment Advisors stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We believe this section is crucial for highlighting some of the key lessons we have learned since 2022. At the outset, let us clarify that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) remains one of our three largest positions, fluctuating based on daily market movements. As you read this, it might in fact be our largest holding. In the closing remarks of our Q4 2022 commentary, we noted that we had “made…META substantially larger” during the quarter. Never did we expect the stock to generate such substantial returns in a short period of time. Between Mark Zuckerberg’s “Year of Efficiency,” a recovery in the digital ad market and an improving macro backdrop, META’s key multiples recovered to a comfortable level within their long-term ranges:\n\nAlthough these multiples are now back to “normal” levels, they are hardly expensive for a company whose top line growth re-accelerated into the double digits, with operating leverage and despite ongoing heavy investments in the Reality Labs segment. These are the reasons why we continue to hold a large position in META. As for why we did some selling, we want to emphasize a few key points.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Momentum Stocks to Benefit from Volatility Ahead. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Mega-Cap Chip Stocks That Could Make Major Moves Soon",
        "content": "We all know that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the top choice among for investors looking at chip stocks in this market. However, this company is far from the only company that stands to benefit from AI-related tailwinds and surging long-term demand expectations.\n\nPlenty of other chip stocks have emerged as beneficiaries of the recent hype. And as AI technology improves daily, more infrastructure is needed to support the developers and corporations building the applications.\n\nFor those looking at mega-cap chip stocks, and other related companies that could benefit from these trends, examine three stocks worth keeping an eye on now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper MicroComputer (NASDAQ:SMCI), a leader in IT solutions for AI, Cloud, Storage and 5G/Edge, is expanding in Silicon Valley to meet rising demand for liquid-cooled data centers. The goal of the company’s new campuses is to streamline global delivery of plug-and-play liquid-cooled solutions. This will enhance AI workload capabilities while cutting energy use and operational costs significantly.\n\nThe management team continues to emphasize SMCI’s cutting-edge generative deep learning and AI inference platforms, enhanced by liquid-cooled technology. With rising interest in energy-efficient Direct Liquid-Cooled solutions, Super Micro Computer to innovates with its modular systems for AI and HPC industries. The company foresees liquid-cooled data centers increasing from historically minimal levels to 15%–30% of all installations within two years. This will position SMCI as a leader with superior efficiency and lower operational expenses versus conventional air-cooled setups.\n\nThe company saw its stock price soar nearly fourfold in the past year on strong growth in data center products. In Q3 of 2024, revenue reached $3.9 billion and net income $402 million. For Q4 of 2024, the market expects a $5.1 billion revenue, with a full year revenue projection of $14.7 billion.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) An AMD sign on a CPU package. AMD Stock\n\nSource: Tobias Arhelger / Shutterstock.com\n\nChallenging Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) comes in second in the AI chip market. AMD is also turning into a giant AI semiconductor company. It is gaining trust from other big tech companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This led to an 80% increase in data center revenue last March. The growth stems from an emerging AI product lineup.\n\nRecently, AMD launched its MI325X AI accelerator chip, offering 30% more bandwidth and double the memory of comparable Nvidia products. AMD plans to match Nvidia’s pace in releasing next-gen AI tech.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf tempted to buy shares of this underappreciated growth company, down over 30% from its March high, analysts support your choice. With a consensus price target of $190.02—20% above the current price—35 of 49 analysts rate it a strong buy. Expect volatility and potentially more downside, but the company’s long-term potential remains promising. I think at current levels, AMD stock presents a significant opportunity.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother crucial AI player is Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). The company has enabled Nvidia to produce powerful chips. In fact, Nvidia’s Hopper uses TSM’s 4N process and its Blackwell AI processors will use the 4NP process. Aside from that, IntelCorporation (NASDAQ:INTC) plans to use TSM’s 3mm line for their notebook processes.\n\nUnlike Nvidia, INTC manufactures its own chips. But, it has fallen behind in developing advanced ones, thus relying on TSMC. Advancing toward 2nm process nodes, Taiwan Semiconductor continues to see high demand from Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm and other mega-cap tech companies. This demand continues to spur high factory utilization rates. Further, it’s likely continue to do so over the long-term.\n\nThe market expects more growth from TSM stock, projecting a 21% increase by 2029. The company’s earning per share growth estimates are very optimistic, with analysts expecting a 23% and 25% increase for 2024 and 2025, respectively. Given the big potential in AI, Taiwan Semiconductor is a company long-term investors may want to consider right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Last week, Tesla said that it would recall most of its Cybertrucks due to a fault with the windshield wipers and exterior trim. (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nEV maker Tesla saw its shares gain around 6% on Monday, but was lower in premarket the following day, as investors look to its quarterly production and delivery report later on.\n\nWall Street brokerage Wells Fargo added the stock to its \"tactical ideas\" watch list ahead of the data, but kept it at an \"underweight\" rating as other companies close in on the EV market in key territories.\n\nChina's BYD (1211.HK), for example, said it had seen a 21% rise in second-quarter electric vehicle sales, selling 426,039 EVs in the April-June quarter, according to a Reuters report.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast week, Tesla said that it would recall most of its Cybertrucks due to a fault with the windshield wipers and exterior trim. This would be the fourth time the vehicle has been recalled in the US.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stock markets fall as traders await eurozone inflation data\n\nThe disclosure revealed the number of vehicles affected by the recall — 11,688 trucks — which would equate to the number of Cybertrucks sold, since it includes vehicles in use and in transit to customers. Because Tesla does not officially break out Cybertruck sales in its quarterly delivery report, getting a read on early Cybertruck sales is noteworthy.\n\nExtrapolating the numbers shows Tesla could deliver around 23,500 Cybertrucks this year. However, at its annual shareholder meeting two weeks ago, CEO Elon Musk disclosed Tesla achieved a production record of 1,300 Cybertrucks per week, with a stretch goal of 2,500 vehicles per week by the end of 2024.\n\nMeta (META)\n\nMeta stock barely wobbled after news of new regulatory challenges in Europe, as the European Commission circled its wagons to implement new digital markets laws.\n\nThe Commission said Instagram's \"pay or consent\" advertising model, where users must either consent to personalised ads or pay to remove them, is in breach of its laws. The regulator said that the \"binary\" advertising choice does not comply with its Digital Markets Act.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nMeta is up for a fight, however, saying that its EU advertising model is compliant.\n\n“Subscription for no ads follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\" a Meta spokesperson said.\n\nIf Meta is proved to be in breach of these laws, it faces a potential fine of up to 10% of its global revenue.\n\nChewy (CHWY)\n\nPet food retailer Chewy has been on a memestock-fueled rollercoaster this week, heading 6.6% lower on Monday in US trading hours after notorious trader Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty, disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a 6.6% stake in the company.\n\nThe stake in the company seemed like an endorsement, causing retail traders to pile in and send the stock 18% higher in premarket trading on Monday. But the stock price quickly crashed lower after market open. On Tuesday, it looks set to stage a slight recovery when the market opens, with stock up around 1.8% in premarket.\n\nRyan Cohen — CEO of GameStop (GME), another memestock — is also the Chewy founder.\n\nSainsbury's (SBRY.L)\n\nUK grocer Sainsbury's said it had seen \"sustained grocery momentum\" in its first quarter, despite poor weather conditions.\n\nThe chain reported a 3% rise in like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, in the 16 weeks to 22 June. This figure strips out the closure of its Argos business in Ireland.\n\nTotal grocery sales were 4.8% higher as the firm saw robust growth by volume. However, this was the slowest growth seen for many quarters as food inflation has fallen back significantly.\n\nEven with seemingly positive numbers, its stock price took a knock in early trade on Tuesday, down around 3.6% shortly after the open.\n\n“We are pleased with our market-beating grocery performance and the early progress we’re making against our Next Level Sainsbury's plan,\" said Simon Roberts, Sainsbury's CEO. \"We’ve been winning from competitors every month for 15 months, as more and more people are choosing Sainsbury's for their big weekly shop.\"\n\nRead more: Shop price inflation at lowest point since October 2021\n\nSainsbury’s has been struggling to differentiate itself from rivals with stiff competition on price from the German discounters Aldi and Lidl while its premium ranges fall short of those on offer at Waitrose and Marks & Spencer (MKS.L), noted Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor.\n\n\"Nonetheless Sainsbury’s continues to make headway in growing its market share versus rivals with potential for further growth as inflation pressures subsides, a boost from the summer sun that has only recently appeared, and the excitement around the Euros,\" she said.\n\n\"Sainsbury’s was able to keep its full-year guidance unchanged for underlying operating profit of £1.01bn and £1.06bn representing growth of between 5% and 10%.\"\n\nWatch: EV demand, investing in AI, jobs data: Asking for a Trend<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/josh-lipton/\\\">Josh Lipton</a> breaks down the biggest takeaways from Monday's trading session.</p>\\n<p>Car manufacturers like General Motors (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM\\\">GM</a>) and Ford (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F\\\">F</a>) have scaled back their electric vehicle production plans amid weaker consumer demand.

The portfolio achieved positive returns in Q4 but trailed the Russell 1000 Index and outperformed the blended benchmark (60% Russell 1000 Index/40% Bloomberg US Treasury Bills 1-3 Month Index). The short positions didn’t perform as well as the index, giving a relative tailwind to the performance. The long positions in financials and communication services also contributed to relative strength.

        "content": "SYDNEY (Reuters) -New Zealand's conservative coalition government will proceed with a bill that would make it compulsory for digital technology platforms to pay media companies for news, it said on Tuesday.\n\nThe bill is being introduced as New Zealand media companies struggle against technology firms for advertising dollars, leading them to find new ways to provide news programming.\n\nThe Fair Digital News Bargaining Bill, introduced last year by the previous Labour government, will be presented in Parliament with amendments to support \"our local media companies to earn revenue for the news they produce\", Communications Minister Paul Goldsmith said.\n\nThe proposed changes would align it more closely with Australia's digital bargaining law, Goldsmith said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat law, which took effect in Australia in March 2021, gives the government power to force internet firms such as Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Alphabet Inc's Google to negotiate content supply deals with media outlets, if the parties fail to reach an agreement on payments.\n\nMeta said the New Zealand bill ignored the realities of how its platforms work, their voluntary nature, the preferences of users and the free value it provided news outlets.\n\n\"We will continue to be open and transparent with the government and publishers on our business decisions as this bill progresses,\" a Meta spokesperson said in an email.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.\n\nAfter Canada introduced a similar law in 2023, Meta blocked news content from appearing on Facebook there. Meta has also said it plans to stop paying Australian media companies for news and the government is still considering whether to intervene.\n\nGoldsmith said the proposed changes would give power to the communications minister to decide which digital platforms would come under the law. An independent regulator will be appointed as the bill's authority, he said.\n\nOne of the governing coalition's partners, the right-wing ACT New Zealand party, will not support the bill, Goldsmith said, which means it must have the support of other parties to pass.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe opposition Labour party said it would check the amendments but supported the intent of the bill.\n\n\"I am relieved the government is seeing sense and progressing with legislation to make the media landscape fairer for news companies operating online,\" Willie Jackson, Labour spokesperson for media and broadcasting, said in a statement.\n\n(Reporting by Renju Jose in Sydney; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Stephen Coates)",

        "title": "Social media giants get temporary Supreme Court win but no final clarity on free speech rights",
        "content": "The Supreme Court handed a temporary win to social media giants like Facebook (META), YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL), and TikTok as it sent a set of free-speech cases back to the lower courts.\n\nBut the unanimous decision left unsettled the question of whether states can strip dominant social media companies of their power to unilaterally block users or remove posts that express certain viewpoints.\n\nThe set of cases before the high court challenged state laws in Florida and Texas limiting the capacity of such platforms to moderate posts.\n\nBoth laws were passed due to concerns following the Jan. 6, 2021 US Capitol attack that the platforms had restricted or removed posts expressing conservative viewpoints. The US Capitol building in Washington. REUTERS/Jim Bourg (UNITED STATES) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nWhat the Supreme Court decided to do Monday was to send these Florida and Texas cases back to lower courts, explaining that the Eleventh Circuit and the Fifth Circuit failed to properly analyze so-called \"facial\" challenges to the state laws.\n\nSuch challenges attack an entire law as unconstitutional, as opposed to challenges that allege a law, or part of a law's application to a particular party, is unconstitutional.\n\n\"Today’s ruling from the Supreme Court is a victory for First Amendment rights online,\" said Chris Marchese, director of the NetChoice Litigation Center.\n\nNetChoice, a technology organization that advocates for Big Tech companies including Yahoo Finance, opposed both laws and was involved as a plaintiff in the Texas dispute and a defendant in the Florida matter.\n\nIt argued that, like newspapers or other editorial decision-makers, social media companies are entitled to their own First Amendment right to decide which statements by third parties are permitted on their platforms.\n\nThe Florida law blocked companies from removing content posted by \"journalistic enterprises,\" and from de-platforming qualified political candidates.\n\nIt also prohibited deprioritizing candidate-related posts and said platforms must notify and explain to users when they censor their speech. The law further required the platforms to apply their content moderation rules consistently to all users. The Supreme Court in Washington. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe Texas law said major social media platforms must not remove posts that express a \"viewpoint.\" And like the Florida law, it said platforms must individually explain each decision to moderate a user's post.\n\nAn appellate court upheld the Florida law, and a separate appellate court blocked Texas's legislation.\n\nSocial media companies have long pushed back against regulation that interferes with their editorial control over content by invoking Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The act immunizes the platforms from liability for content contained in user posts.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The irony of both the Texas and Florida laws is that they invoke journalistic liberty to force social media platforms to host speech they don’t like,\" Cliff Davidson, a partner at Snell & Wilmer, told Yahoo Finance before the high court's decision was rendered.\n\nThe laws, he said, could be difficult for social media companies to interpret and follow because their application to carry content from \"journalistic enterprises\" depends on the amount of content an enterprise creates or the number of its paid subscribers or users.\n\nBut \"it’s unclear how a social media platform is supposed to determine what content these laws protect day-to-day\" because the laws are silent on how those figures are determined, how long the minimums must be met, and whether the reported number of users must be verified.\n\nThe court also issued a decision in another case this term that challenged the editorial power of social media platforms.\n\nThe case — Murthy v. Missouri — questioned whether federal government officials and agencies infringed on First Amendment rights by encouraging social media platforms to remove their posts during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe officials encouraged platforms to remove posts that the administration deemed misinformation and to combat false health-related information.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling, the court held that the plaintiff states and social media users in the case lacked standing — the legal right to challenge the administration in federal court.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "‘Looksmaxxing’ apps that rate teen boys’ faces and boast millions of downloads are exacerbating the youth mental health crisis, psychologists say",
        "content": "After Dillon Latham’s girlfriend dumped him during their junior year of high school, the then-17-year-old decided to invest in his appearance. He began spending hours daily in the gym, applying homemade skincare concoctions to his face like beef tallow moisturizer, and permed his hair to give it a tousled mop look. He says he felt and looked better.\n\nSoon, Latham started posting tips on TikTok to inspire teen boys in similar situations. His videos are captioned with language like “this is making you ugly,” “stop ruining your skin,” and “get a smaller nose.” The makeover advice went, and continues to go, viral. To date, his TikTok clips have nearly 98 million likes and 1 billion views across social media. Latham, who is now selling his own brand of hairspray, says he’s making six-figures in revenue monthly from sales and social media, leading him to skip college and be a full-time influencer.\n\nLatham’s videos are part of a trend called “looksmaxxing” that capitalizes on mostly boys’ insecurities, and tells them they can become attractive and masculine by toning their faces and bodies via rigid fitness, skincare, and hair care routines. In its mildest form, looksmax social media creators tell teen boys to wash their faces; in its most extreme, they tell boys to regularly pummel their jaws to induce micro fractures, get surgery, and take steroids. Social media algorithms tend to amplify this content.\n\nPsychologists interviewed by Fortune expressed concern about the trend. They assailed the potentially devastating effects of the online advice and criticism that makes those seeking it feel inadequate and unattractive.\n\n“Psychologically, it’s essentially an erosion of the sense of self,” says Tom Hildebrandt, a clinical psychologist who has studied eating disorders for 20 years as the chief and founder of the Hildebrandt Laboratory at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in New York City. “It’s like, ‘The more I get feedback that I’m not good enough, the more I consume it. And then, I trade my attention, my time and sometimes my money and resources to give up my current identity in pursuit of this other one.’”\n\nLatham, too, says the negative content he posts attracts far more views and engagement than positive stuff. So the now 19-year-old continues to insult the appearances of his viewers, and in turn, sell more products, mostly via TikTok Shop.\n\nHe dismisses the critics, saying they should listen more closely to his advice. The negativity in his videos is mixed with positive messages, he argues. “People are really attracted to negative things because so many guys are insecure—so you pull them in with that in a way, and then try to help them.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThis negative feedback loop has also spurred a burgeoning looksmaxxing economy, including chewing gum meant to help with jaw exercises, personal care products, and clothing.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of apps claim to evaluate the looks of users and their success in following the looksmaxxing message. The most popular app is UMAX - Become Hot. Powered partly by OpenAI’s technology, UMAX rates paying users’ faces on masculinity, their jawlines, and cheekbones, among other attributes. Though it launched in December, the app is already raking in about $500,000 in subscription revenue monthly, according to Blake Anderson, the app’s 23-year-old founder and CEO. The amount could not be independently verified.\n\nUMAX, which relies on users uploading headshot photos, costs $3.99 weekly. It scores users’ faces each week on a scale up to 100, and gives tips like “start a skincare routine” to increase their scores. Though the app says users can forgo the first weekly fee if they refer three friends, this feature didn’t work in Fortune’s test of the app.\n\nUMAX has over 7 million total downloads, according to Anderson, and climbed to number 36 in the Apple App Store’s Lifestyle chart, which ranks apps by downloads, app usage and velocity of downloads. It ranked higher than the apps of Zillow Rentals and handyman service TaskRabbit. Anderson says 90% of users are males aged 16 to 45.\n\nHe credits UMAX’s popularity to its social media presence, helped by users who often show screenshots of UMAX’s app as a backdrop in their own social media videos in which they discuss their looksmaxxing journeys. He says UMAX has garnered over 1 billion impressions across all social media platforms. A UMAX competitor, LooksMax AI - Face Style Rater, is also among the top 100 lifestyle apps. (Its developer did not respond to Fortune’s interview request.)\n\n“Social media, as a whole, is the greatest advertising channel to exist,” says Anderson, who wants to build a brand that “embodies male self improvement.” “The videos that tend to do really well are glow up videos: ‘This is me before—maybe I had acne or wasn't as good looking, wasn't taking care of myself—and now, this is me after.’ UMAX scores help to quantify that change.’”\n\nIn response to critics who say that UMAX may contribute to users’ negative self-perception, Anderson says: “We never want somebody to feel insecure to the point that it causes anxiety or significantly impacts their mental health…If we just tell everyone to just love who you are 100% and there's never anything that needs any work—I think that's a dangerous mindset…self-improvement is extremely important and pays dividends over the course of one's life.”\n\nAnother reason for the growth of the looksmaxxing economy is TikTok Shop.\n\nLooksmax influencer Latham calls it an “insanely profitable” platform for his haircare brand because “you can literally just buy a product on the same screen that you watch the video.” He says the success of his brand on TikTok Shop is a reason he decided to forgo college to focus on his social media creator career.\n\nTikTok did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nMount Sinai’s Hildebrandt is deeply worried about the potentially devastating effects of negative content delivered through an algorithm, as he believes this could cause widespread and often-undetected male body dysmorphia. This phenomenon, he says, gained traction during Arnold Schwarzenegger’s muscular rise to fame in the 1980s. With the rise of social media, the problem has been supercharged and harder to detect. Now, the disorder is often characterized by people spending excessive time consuming and thinking about online beauty and wellness content. On the surface, it’s largely indistinguishable from today’s norm of people scrolling on their phones for hours on end.\n\nHildebrandt is unsurprised that UMAX’s app and Latham’s hair care products have caught on. He believes the looksmaxxing economy takes advantage of men’s insecurities using methods that have minted female-focused cosmetics and wellness brands trillions of dollars. “The producers of [looksmaxxing] content and products are figuring out that men are just as vulnerable as women to that negative feedback…if you make anyone feel insecure about their identities, they are willing to throw money after a solution for that.”\n\nTikTok has cracked down on weight loss content, though psychologists say problematic content very much still exists. A search for “looksmax” on the platform returns a banner saying “you are more than your weight.” The message is accompanied by a cartoon character hugging a heart and an option to click on a message that says: “If you or someone you know has questions about body image, food, or exercise — it is important to know that help is out there and you are not alone.” Users can follow links to TikTok’s own eating disorder resource center and nationaleatingdisorders.org. But once users begin to scroll, the banner disappears.\n\nMeta-owned Instagram and Facebook, Google’s YouTube, and Snapchat have no such warnings on looksmaxxing content.\n\nInstagram, which CNN and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said in 2021 promoted eating disorder content to teens, has a page about eating disorders that focuses on how users should approach friends about the problem. Facebook has a similar page. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment for this story, but pointed Fortune to its policy on suicide, self-injury and eating disorders.\n\nThough the company says it removes “any content that encourages suicide, self-injury or eating disorders,” it allows “people to discuss these topics because we want our services to be a space where people can share their experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from one another.”\n\nMeta says that it has added popup on searches related to suicide, self-harm, eating disorders or body image issues that gives users tips and ways to connect with relevant organizations, but it has no such warning on looksmax-related searches. When Fortune searched for “looksmax” on Instagram, it found a video of a user with a chiseled jaw who claimed to have obtained it by hitting his face with a hammer (a practice known as “bone smashing”). The video shows users how to do it, while warning of its dangers.\n\nSnapchat provides users with no information about eating disorders. A spokesperson for the platform declined to comment for this article, directing Fortune to its guidelines about the kinds of posts its algorithm recommends, noting the company prohibits the promotion of self-injury, suicide and disordered eating content. Despite the rules, under the #looksmax hashtag on Snapchat, Fortune found a number of posts that promote self-harm and violence. One video that begins with a selfie video of looksmaxxer is captioned “when she says I’m going to party with my new friends,” followed by a sequence of people firing assault rifles. A caption on the clip then said “me after pulling up to that party.”\n\nIn response to looksmaxxing content on YouTube, a spokesperson for the platform told Fortune: “YouTube has extra safeguards in place for videos recommended to teens and younger viewers, developed in consultation with child development experts.” The spokesperson, who share a link to the safeguards, says the company “limits repeated recommendations of content that compares physical features and idealizes specific fitness levels or body weights over others,” noting it has policies to remove content about disordered eating behaviors that “can be easily imitated.”\n\nSocial media companies are already facing scrutiny from federal and state officials for allegedly causing a youth mental health crisis with their addictive algorithms and features. A key accusation in these lawsuits and initiatives is that social media platforms incite body dysmorphia in users, especially young females.\n\nBut looksmaxxing may be evidence that young male users are just as affected by body dysmorphia.\n\nSera Levelle, a clinical psychologist who treats eating disorders and disordered eating in New York City, says she now has an even split of male and female patients. When she started her practice in 2007, it was mostly women and girls. Levelle says that over the last 10 years—concurrent with the rise of social media—the gender makeup of her patients has reached parity. “Society is now getting equally horrible for men as it has been for women for a long time,” says Levelle.\n\nLevelle’s anecdote is consistent with national reports that show that diagnosed male eating disorders have increased with social media’s rise.\n\nSarah Davis, also a psychologist in New York who is focused on children’s eating disorders, notes that a few patients have engaged in a looksmaxxing exercise during therapy sessions called mewing, a belief that touching one's tongue to top of mouth through clenched teeth can spur a defined jawline. She blames social media as her patients get “younger and younger,” with the youngest being nine years old.\n\n“We all want to be loved and accepted,” says Davis. “People think, ‘If I look a certain way, and I can throw money at that [to be loved and accepted,] then I'll do it.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

Now, again as predicted, it’s Meta’s turn.\n\nThough they involve the same law, the two cases are in many ways very different.\n\nApple stands accused primarily of making it difficult and overly expensive for app developers to steer their iOS users to cheaper deals off the platform, where Apple doesn’t get to take its lucrative revenue cut. Meta, however, is in trouble for charging a hefty monthly fee to Facebook and Instagram users who won’t “consent” to being surveilled across Meta and third-party services for ad-targeting purposes. This allegedly violates the DMA because, in the words of the European Commission:\n\n“[Meta’s model] does not allow users to opt for a service that uses less of their personal data but is otherwise equivalent to the ‘personalized ads’ based service [and because it] does not allow users to exercise their right to freely consent to the combination of their personal data.”\n\nOne case is about restricting developers; the other about railroading users. However, both take aim at core business models. Apple still earns most of its money from selling iPhones, but services (including App Store commissions) are the second-most important part of its revenue mix, and perhaps one day the most important. The data of Meta’s users is and probably always will be its lifeblood. Both cases therefore have enormous ramifications for their targets’ future revenue flows.\n\nWhat the Commission is doing to Meta is essentially data-protection enforcement through antitrust means.\n\nThe DMA’s rules reflect the increasing tendency of tech antitrust regulators to treat piles of data like the moat-building competitive asset they are. The Commission mentions “potential advantages compared to competitors who don't have access to such a vast amount of data, thereby raising high barriers to providing online advertising services and social network services.” However, while there’s a solid theoretical basis to this trend, it’s hard to escape the idea that regulators are also taking this tack because others have failed.\n\nWhat Meta has done here isn’t just allegedly illegal under the DMA; it also very likely violates the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect over six years ago. But enforcement of the GDPR has been patchy and achingly slow, largely because it’s the responsibility of underfunded national privacy regulators (the Irish Data Protection Commission in Meta’s case.) To avoid this problem, the DMA puts the European Commission itself in the role of enforcer, while also demanding a resolution to the case within a year of the investigation opening—which, for both Meta and Apple, makes next March the deadline for averting disaster.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe DMA also threatens much higher fines than the GDPR’s 4% of global annual revenue—up to 10%, or even 20% if the company persistently breaks the rules.\n\nFunnily enough, Meta only attempted its pay-or-consent tactic because GDPR-based court rulings removed all its other legal options for profiting off its users’ data without their actual free consent. “Subscription for no ads follows the direction of the highest court in Europe,” Meta protested in a statement this morning that also claimed its model “complies with the DMA.”\n\nSo, in a sense, privacy law corralled Meta into this position, and now antitrust law is going in for the kill.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. has been slapped with a warning over its subscription model for ad-free services on Instagram and Facebook, risking potentially heavy fines in the European Union’s latest attack on Big Tech under tough new rules.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDemocrats Weigh Mid-July Vote to Formally Tap Biden as Nominee Supreme Court Says Trump Has Some Immunity, Delaying Trial 24-Hour Stock Trading Is Booming – and Wall Street Is Rattled BlackRock Buys Preqin for $3.2 Billion in Private Data Push Trump as President or Private Citizen: Why Supreme Court’s Immunity Ruling Is a Test\n\nEU regulators announced Monday that the so-called pay-or-consent policy falls foul of the EU’s Digital Markets Act, because the new model “forces users to consent to the combination of their personal data,” while not being offered a less personalized version of either Facebook and Instagram.\n\n“Our preliminary view is that Meta’s advertising model fails to comply with the Digital Markets Act,” said Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s antitrust chief. “We want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience.”\n\nThe DMA lays out a series of dos or don’ts for some of the world’s largest tech platforms. The EU’s move is a preliminary step. But eventual fines for breaches can be as high as 10% of global annual revenue, or 20% for repeated violations.\n\nMeta introduced separate, ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram in November, to ward off growing regulatory pressure over its processing of users’ personal data. The company said in a statement that the new model complies with the DMA and that the company looks forward “ to further constructive dialog with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.”\n\nMeta shares fell 1.3% at 10:05 a.m. in New York while the Russell 3000 Index Computer Services Subsector advanced.\n\nUnder EU rules, Big Tech firms must must seek users’ consent for combining their personal data across platform services. If a user refuses such consent, they should have access to a less personalized version. The commission says that the likes of Meta cannot make the use of Facebook or Instagram conditional on users’ consent.\n\nThe EU regulator’s warning comes just a week after it issued a complaint over Apple Inc.’s DMA compliance, telling the iPhone maker that it must allow app developers to steer users to cheaper deals and offers outside of the App Store, in order to step into line with the rules.\n\nAs part of the DMA, it’s illegal for certain services operated by the likes of Apple, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Meta, Microsoft Corp., and Amazon.com Inc. to favor their own services over those of rivals. They are barred from combining personal data across their different services, prohibited from using data they collect from third-party merchants to compete against them, and have to allow users to download apps from rivals platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\n(Updates with shares in sixth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America Japan’s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found The FBI’s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators accused social media company Meta Platforms on Monday of breaching the bloc's new digital competition rulebook by forcing Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.\n\nMeta has been giving European users the option since November of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram as a way to comply with the continent’s strict data privacy rules.\n\nDesktop browser users can pay about 10 euros ($10.50) a month while iOS or Android users will pay roughly 13 euros to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant rolled out the subscription option after the European Union’s top court ruled that under strict EU data privacy rules, Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said preliminary findings of its investigation show that Meta's “pay or consent” advertising model was in breach of the 27-nation bloc’s Digital Markets Act.\n\nThe commission said Meta's model doesn't allow users to exercise their right to “freely consent” to allowing their personal data to be used to target them with online ads.\n\nThe commission had opened its investigation shortly after the rulebook, also known as the DMA, took effect in March. It's a sweeping set of regulations aimed at preventing tech “gatekeepers” from cornering digital markets under threat of heavy financial penalties.\n\n“The DMA is there to give back to the users the power to decide how their data is used and ensure innovative companies can compete on equal footing with tech giants on data access,” European Commissioner Thierry Breton, who oversees the bloc's digital policy, said in a statement.\n\nMeta now has a chance to respond to the commission, which must wrap up its investigation by March 2025. The company could face fines worth 10% of its annual global revenues, which could run into the billions of euros.\n\n“Subscription for no ads follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\" Meta said in a statement. \"We look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.”\n\nUnder the Digital Markets Act, Meta is classed as one of seven online gatekeepers while Facebook, Instagram and its ad business are among about two dozen “core platform services” that need the highest level of scrutiny.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "While artificial intelligence may have taken over the technology ecosystem at the moment, that doesn’t mean investors should ignore other components of the innovation space. On the contrary, sectors such as virtual reality stocks to buy may offer attractive entry points. Again, people may be distracted with AI, which potentially offers a discounted play on other relevant sectors.\n\nRegarding VR specifically, this innovation represents the next level of immersive digital experiences. What’s compelling here is that the technology isn’t just for entertainment though that is one of the key uses. However, it’s also important to note that several other industries (including government agencies) utilize VR for training purposes.\n\nLastly, the sector enjoys a massive total addressable market. According to Grand View Research, the global VR sector reached a valuation of $59.96 billion in 2022. Experts in the field believe that the space could expand by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.5% from 2023 to 2030. At the forecast culmination, the ecosystem could be worth $435.36 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat’s good money. With that, below are three virtual reality stocks to buy.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFormerly known as Facebook, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is one of the world’s biggest tech companies. Its mainline business centers on its gargantuan social network, which doubles as a data goldmine. However, the company has increasingly pivoted to many other sectors in the innovation space. Right now, Meta happens to be one of the top virtual reality stocks to buy.\n\nMeta’s Oculus VR headsets offers both gaming and professional applications. Further, the company has and continues to invest heavily in the metaverse. This virtual environment represents a potential pathway for VR hardware, making Meta an integrated player. Best of all, investors can rely on more than mere narratives. Over the past four quarters, Meta’s average earnings per share landed at almost $4.26.\n\nThis performance translated to an average earnings surprise of 9.93%. During the trailing 12 months (TTM), Meta posted net income of $45.76 billion or earnings of $17.39 per share. Revenue in the period hit $142.71 billion.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, EPS may rise 35.9% to reach $20.21. Sales may see a lift of 17.7% to $158.82 billion. It’s easily one of the virtual reality stocks to buy.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in San Mateo, California, Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) falls under the communication services sector. Specifically, it’s involved in electronic gaming and multimedia. Per its public profile, Roblox develops and operates an online entertainment platform. Notably, its Roblox Studio allows developers and creators to build, publish and operate three-dimensional experiences. What makes RBLX enticing for virtual reality stocks to buy is the functionality it brings.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoblox supports VR gameplay, allowing users to experience gaming content through an immersive platform. Further, its community of grassroots developers can (relatively) quickly bring VR titles to the table. Over time, demand for participation in this network could rise. To be fair, Roblox isn’t generating earnings. However, it has consistently mitigated expected losses per share.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Roblox printed a net loss of $1.15 billion or $1.86 per share. However, revenue in the cycle hit $2.95 billion. For fiscal 2024, experts see a loss per share of $1.70, an improvement from last year’s $1.87 in the red. On the top line, sales could rise 14.7% to hit $4.04 billion. And in the following year, revenue could move up again to $4.79 billion.\n\nKopin (KOPN) image of a woman wearing a VR headset\n\nSource: Barone Firenze/Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Westborough, Massachusetts, Kopin (NASDAQ:KOPN) falls under the electronic components industry of the tech ecosystem. The company along with its subsidiaries invents, develops, manufactures and sells micro-displays, subassemblies and related components for various entities, including those in the defense sector. Kopin is a powerhouse in the field of training and simulation headsets, making it one of the enticing virtual reality stocks to buy.\n\nThanks to its strong portfolio of military training applications, Kopin is incredibly relevant, especially in the present geopolitical climate. However, it’s super risky. Up until late April of this year, shares trade hands above $1 – and sometimes above $2. Unfortunately, it also slipped into literal penny stock territory. About the only good news is that the bulls are attempting to fight their way out of this muck.\n\nIn the TTM period, Kopin incurred a net loss of just under $50 million or 42 cents per share. Revenue during this time reached $39.67 million. For fiscal 2024, analysts admittedly see an unfavorable expansion of red ink to 36 cents per share. However, revenue may rise 12.5% to hit $45.43 million.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Wall Street looks set to start the new week and quarter on a positive note ahead of Friday’s crucial payrolls report. Meta Platforms could face EU charge, and Boeing finally completes its purchase of Spirit Aerospace.\n\n1. Futures marginally higher ahead of key payrolls release\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Monday, at the start of a holiday-shortened week which culminates with Friday’s widely-watched nonfarm payrolls report.\n\nBy 04:20 ET (08:20 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 50 points, or 0.1%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 11 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 62 points, or 0.3%.\n\nWall Street is coming off a mixed quarter, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite adding 3.9% and 8.3%, respectively, boosted by continued excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.7%.\n\nThe Nasdaq notched its third positive quarter in a row for the first time since a five-quarter streak ending in 2021.\n\nInvestors will be focusing their attention on Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report as they look for fresh indications on when the Federal Reserve might start to cut interest rates.\n\nAdditionally, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is to make an appearance at the European Central Bank’s annual forum in Sintra, Portugal on Tuesday, while Wednesday’s minutes of the Fed’s June meeting will be parsed for the central bank’s view of the economic outlook and the factors influencing the monetary policy outlook.\n\n2. EU to charge Meta Platforms - FT\n\nThe European Union is set to charge Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) with breaking the bloc's digital rules, according to a report by the Financial Times, released Monday.\n\nThe newspaper reported that the regulators will say that they are worried about Meta's \"pay or consent\" model, noting that this choice provides a false alternative, with the financial barrier forcing them to consent to their personal data being tracked for advertising purposes.\n\nThe EU’s Digital Markets Act was designed to rein in the power of the 'Big Tech' firms and ensure a level playing field for smaller rivals, and saw the region’s regulators last week charging Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with breaching the bloc's tech rules.\n\n3. Boeing to buy Spirit Aerospace, finally…\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) announced Monday that it would buy Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR) in a $4.7 billion all-stock deal, with the planemaker finally agreeing a deal for the key supplier after months of talks complicated by Spirit’s interactions with Boeing’s main rival Airbus.\n\nBoeing’s move to take back control of Spirit stems from a desire to resolve the quality problems that have plagued the key supplier in recent years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe total deal value will be about $8.3 billion including debt, and followed Boeing's decision to buy back its former subsidiary, which had branched out into supplying Airbus (EPA:AIR) and others since becoming independent almost two decades ago.\n\nAirbus said it would receive $559 million in compensation from Spirit, and would take over core activities at four of the supplier's plants in the United States, Northern Ireland, France and Morocco.\n\nSpirit said it also planned to sell businesses and operations in Scotland and Malaysia that support Airbus programs. It also plans to sell operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland that do not support Airbus programs.\n\n4. National Rally prevails in French elections\n\nFrance's far-right National Rally party and its allies reached 33% of the national popular vote in the first round of parliamentary elections, the interior ministry said, after Sunday’s vote.\n\nThe leftwing New Popular Front came in second with 28%, while President Emmanuel Macron's centrist bloc reached 20%.\n\nThis result has seen the euro bounce, with the single currency touching a two-week high, while the CAC 40, the French benchmark equity index, traded higher, rebounding after losses of around 6% since French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved parliament.\n\nAt 04:20 ET (08:20 GMT), EUR/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.0758, while the CAC 40 rose 1.9%.\n\nInvestors have been concerned that the far-right, as well as the left-wing alliance, have pledged big spending increases at a time when France's high budget deficit has prompted the EU to recommend disciplinary steps.\n\nHowever, this result was better than feared, but also suggests more volatility this week ahead of next Sunday's runoff with the final outcome likely to depend on alliance-building.\n\n5. China’s private PMI helps crude prices\n\nThe Chinese economy showed signs of growth in June, helping crude prices rise Monday on hope that the world’s largest importer can benefit from the solid momentum in the global economy.\n\nChina's Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI), a private survey, rose to 51.8 in June from 51.7 in May earlier Monday, growing at the fastest clip in more than three years, above the break-even line of 50.0 that separates growth from contraction.\n\nThis positive result has boosted sentiment after official PMI data released on Sunday showed China's manufacturing activity fell for a second month in June and services activity slid to a five-month low.\n\nBy 08:20 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.9% higher at $82.27 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.8% to $85.70 per barrel.\n\nBoth contracts gained around 6% in June, after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, extended most of its deep oil output cuts well into 2025.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMeta Platforms charge, Boeing deal, French elections - what's moving markets\n\nSouth African rand gains after Ramaphosa announces new cabinet\n\nBIS sends government debt warning before important elections\n\nView comments",

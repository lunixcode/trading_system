        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks were muted on Thursday as Japanese shares plummeted after the Bank of Japan flagged more interest rate hikes, while a rebound in Chinese markets stalled on more underwhelming business activity data.\n\nRegional markets took little support from an overnight rally on Wall Street, where signals on a September interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve and some strong technology earnings powered sharp gains on Wall Street.\n\nUS stock index futures rose in Asian trade, with focus turning to earnings from tech giants Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) later in the day.\n\nNikkei 225, TOPIX plummet as BOJ flags more rate hikes\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 and TOPIX indexes slid 3.1% and 3.8%, respectively, after the BOJ struck an unexpectedly hawkish tone during its Wednesday meeting.\n\nGovernor Kazuo Ueda said the bank will continue to raise interest rates after a 15 basis point hike on Wednesday, especially if the economy and inflation continue to improve in line with the BOJ’s outlook.\n\nJapanese stocks had initially reacted positively to the BOJ meeting, given that the bank struck a somewhat dovish tone by setting a prolonged timeline for reducing its bond buying program.\n\nBut Ueda’s comments, which came after the market close, indicated that the central bank was closer to ending its decades of stimulative measures earlier than initially expected.\n\n“If the economy and prices move in line with our projection, we will continue to raise interest rates,” Ueda said at a press conference. “We don't see 0.5% as any key barrier when raising rates.”\n\nThe BOJ’s benchmark short-term rate stood around 0.25% after Wednesday’s hike.\n\nChina rebound stalls on more negative PMI data\n\nChina’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes moved in a flat-to-low range after rebounding from more-than five-month lows in the prior session. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 0.2%.\n\nCaixin purchasing managers index data on Thursday showed an unexpected contraction in China’s manufacturing sector. The reading came just a day after government PMI data showed a similar trend.\n\nThe Caixin PMI was a major pain point, given that it had so far in 2024 painted a more positive picture of China’s manufacturing sector. But Thursday’s reading brought up concerns over a broader slowdown in the sector.\n\nWhile the weak PMIs and positive comments from Beijing had fueled bets on more stimulus- in part sparking Wednesday’s rebound in Chinese markets- persistent caution over an economic slowdown kept investors mostly averse towards Chinese stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroader Asian markets were marginally positive, tracking overnight strength on Wall Street.\n\nAustralia’s ASX 200 rose 0.4%, briefly hitting a record high at 8,148.70 points after some soft inflation readings from the country triggered a rally on Wednesday.\n\nSouth Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.4%, with local chipmaking stocks tracking gains in their U.S. peers. Taipei shares of TSMC (TW:2330) rose nearly 2%.\n\nFutures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a flat open, as the index struggled to make new highs above 25,000 points.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks: Japan tumbles as BOJ vows more rate hikes, China rebound stalls\n\nBillionaire Ackman pulls IPO of Pershing Square USA days before debut\n\nKeppel profit inches higher, with transformation into global manager 'bearing fruit'\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The unprecedented boom in fintech has made investing in fintech stocks a lucrative wealth generation tool.\n\nFintech companies have disrupted the traditional finance landscape, fueled by increased digitization and a thriving economy. The industry played a key role in transforming the financial sector by making digital transactions more accessible, transparent and efficient.\n\nIn the years to come, the fintech influence will only continue to grow. Research by The Boston Consulting Group shows that the global fintech market size will reach $1.5 trillion in revenue by 2030. That’s roughly five times its size today. The growth will be largely driven by GenAI tools and underbanked nations worldwide.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGiven the optimistic outlook, fintech companies leading the charge will benefit from long-term growth rates. For investors, this presents a unique opportunity to earn high returns from fintech companies as they pioneer new solutions and reach untapped markets. On that note, here’s a look at three fintech stocks to add to your portfolio.\n\nPagaya Technologies (PGY) In this photo illustration the Pagaya Investments logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPagaya Technologies (NASDAQ:PGY) is among the new-age fintech stocks revolutionizing the financial sector with AI. The company’s tool helps financial institutions automate the credit evaluation process. It does this by using machine learning and big-data analytics to generate several data points for customized credit recommendations. This helps increase credit accessibility for customers while generating risk-adjusted returns for institutions.\n\nPagaya posted impressive results in its first quarter. Revenue came in at a record $2.42 billion, a 31% increase year-over-year (YoY) and over the estimated $2.4 billion. Net losses for the period amounted to $21.2 million, a significant decline from a $61 million loss a year ago. In addition to its strong financials, the company also announced a partnership with U.S. Bank (NYSE:USB) to increase access to personal loans.\n\nPagaya’s unique offering and strong performance in Q1 underscores its high growth potential. The company is set to report results on August 9th and anticipates continued momentum. Investors bullish on the future of fintech will find PGY stock a rewarding play.\n\nShift4 Payments (FOUR) a person holding a smartphone over a check out scanner representing payments stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nShift4 Payments (NYSE:FOUR) offers payment processing solutions to businesses that accept online payments from customers. A suite of business intelligence tools complements this service to help clients manage their operations and analyze payment data. The company caters to over 200,000 customers with a strong focus on the hospitality and entertainment sectors.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmidst a highly competitive fintech landscape, Shift4’s stock has seen its fair share of volatility. Shares are up less than 3% this past year despite reporting strong earnings in the previous quarter. Gross revenue for the period grew 29% YoY to $707.4 million, along with a 36% increase in EBITDA and a 34% rise in free cash flow.\n\nIn other words, Shift4 Payments has plenty of fuel left in the tank, and the dip presents a great buying opportunity. The company achieved an over 50% increase in payment volume in Q1, signaling greater adoption of its payment tool, SkyTab. Its ability to sustain its adoption levels will be a key to driving gains.\n\nAlthough competitive headwinds persist, FOUR is one of the top fintech stocks in the market for investors seeking a high-risk, high-reward play.\n\nMercado Libre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercado Libre (NYSE:MELI), commonly referred to as the “Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Latin America,” is an e-commerce powerhouse. While e-commerce is its largest segment, it also operates a logistics, advertising, online marketplace and fintech business. This diverse portfolio has made the company a dominant force in Latin American markets.\n\nMercado Libre is best known for its e-commerce business, but its fintech arm, Mercado Pago, is a high-growth business. Initially designed as a means of payment for its online marketplace, the fintech solution now offers several features, including loan and investing services. Nearly 50 million people across Latin America use the app.\n\nThe company’s financials reflect its massive success. Total monthly active users on its fintech platform grew by 38%, while total assets under management increased by 90% to $5.5 billion. Mercado Libre’s revenue for the period climbed 36% to $4.3 billion, fueled by a 49% increase in e-commerce revenue.\n\nWith a dominant market position and excellent growth prospects, MELI is one of the top fintech stocks for investors seeking long-term returns.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Top 3 AI Stocks to Buy Now: Summer 2024",
        "content": "In July, most AI stocks entered a correction as the rotation into sectors such as homebuilders and banks gained momentum. Still, any pullbacks in these stocks present a buying opportunity. We are in the early innings of a new technological era that could continue for decades.\n\nNvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang calls this ongoing shift to accelerating computing the next industrial revolution. Bloomberg Intelligence research shows that generative AI will grow at a 42% compounded annual growth rate over the next 10 years. As AI proliferates through industries such as education, gaming and life sciences, it will spur an investment cycle in AI training and inference.\n\nThese three AI stocks are at the forefront of the generative AI infrastructure buildout. One is a key supplier enabling the buildout of AI data centers. The other two provide the semiconductors and networking infrastructure needed to accelerate computing for generative AI training and inference.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVertiv (VRT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Veritiv (VRTV).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs cloud service providers (CSPs) build out AI data centers to support large language model training and inference, Vertiv (NYSE:VRT) is well-positioned to benefit. It sells the entire critical infrastructure for data centers and has 50 years of experience in the industry.\n\nVertiv’s advantages are clear: instead of offering one-point products, it provides a comprehensive end-to-end solution. First, it offers thermal management solutions that include liquid cooling technologies. Secondly, its portfolio includes data center power management products like transformers, distribution units, busways and microgrid integration capabilities. These solutions, plus its IT systems, offer an integrated end-to-end solution for CSPs.\n\nAfter declining by over 15% over the past three months, Vertiv has become one of the interesting AI stocks to consider. After all, Q2 results highlighted the continued demand momentum across the business. Notably, this was another beat and raise quarter for Vertiv, as organic orders rose by 57% and organic net sales grew 14%.\n\nIn the quarter, adjusted operating margins hit 19.6%, a 510-basis points margin expansion. In response, the company raised its profit and free cash flow guidance for 2024. Now, management expects adjusted EPS between $2.47 – $2.53. Thus, using the low-end guidance, it trades at 31 times EPS, a fair multiple given the AI tailwinds ahead.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Exterior view of Nvidia's global headquarters in Santa Clara, California.

NVDA stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nToday, most of the investment in AI is happening in the enabling layer – chip design, semiconductors and data centers. A significant portion is going towards building data centers powered by Nvidia chips. Nvidia is in a one-horse race because its Hopper and new Blackwell chips have a huge performance advantage.\n\nStory continues\n\nShifting the trillion-dollar installed base of traditional data centers to AI ones spells a multi-year tailwind for Nvidia. That’s why Bank of Americadoubled down on shares with a $150 price target. Analyst Vivek Arya notes that generative AI deployments are in the second year of a potential 3–5-year investment cycle.\n\nIts new Blackwell chips are already in production and will be on the market later this year. This increases Nvidia’s revenue visibility into next year. Moreover, the company is combining its Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, NVLink, Quantum, Spectrum, mix and switches, high-speed interconnects and CUDA ecosystem to offer a complete solution to customers.\n\nAs of this writing, NVDA stock is one of the bargain AI stocks after pulling back from $140 to $113. At a forward non-GAAP price-to-earnings of 41, NVDA is trading below its 5-year average of 47. That’s too cheap for a stock expected to grow revenues by 97% this fiscal year.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the AI chip race, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has emerged as the runner-up behind Nvidia. The company is the leader in the custom AI chip market. For instance, it has long worked with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) on its tensor processing units.\n\nDue to the growing size and complexity of large language models, companies are opting for custom-designed AI chips to lower costs. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has launched its Tranium and Inferentia chips, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has its Maia chip.\n\nToday, Broadcom counts Google as its largest customer, producing their TPUs. Besides, it’s already working with Microsoft and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) on custom AI chips. Considering Broadcom is the leader in custom silicon, this is a massive tailwind.\n\nAt the same time, its AI networking revenues are soaring. In Q2 2024, the company saw strong demand from AI data center clusters for its switches, network interface cards and optical interconnects. The combined demand for AI networking and custom accelerators drove a 280% YOY surge in AI revenues to $3.1 billion.\n\nConsidering this acceleration in AI revenues, Broadcom is one of the best AI stocks. In FY2022, AI revenues were 10% of semiconductor revenues or about $2.5 billion. In FY2024, management expects this percentage to exceed 30% with AI sales of $11 billion, a quadruple from FY2022. This revenue momentum will continue into FY2025, making AVGO stock a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon set to join Big Tech's spending surge as AI race heats up",
        "content": "By Deborah Mary Sophia\n\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com is expected to join Google and Microsoft on Thursday in reporting a surge in capital spending on artificial intelligence as Big Tech companies rush to capitalize on the booming technology.\n\nThe e-commerce giant's capital investments - mostly for building cloud and generative AI infrastructure - is expected to have risen 43% in the second quarter to $16.41 billion, according to LSEG data. That represents a roughly $1.5 billion increase from the previous three months.\n\nThe steep spending is also expected to pressure Amazon's margins, outweighing benefits from cost cuts and supply chain efficiencies that are aiding the retail unit's profitability.\n\nThe company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has long dominated the cloud-computing market but it has been facing tough competition from Microsoft in recent quarters after the Windows maker rolled out AI-powered services to its Azure cloud business.\n\nIn response, Amazon has partnered with the likes of Anthropic and offered startups free credits that cover the cost of using major AI models to boost the market share of its AI platform Bedrock. It also named a new head for the AWS unit in May.\n\nMicrosoft and Google-parent Alphabet also said earlier this month they would plow ahead with investments even as the payoff from AI takes longer than some investors had hoped. This knocked Big Tech stocks whose valuations have soared this year on the promise of AI.\n\n\"Amazon's capex spend will certainly be scrutinized closely. It has been slow on the adoption of AI and is skewed towards smaller companies which have struggled in the high interest-rate environment,\" said Ben Barringer, analyst at Quilter Cheviot.\n\n\"We would expect AWS to start speeding things up in its AI development going forward.\"\n\nAmazon shares have risen about 23% this year. The stock has shed more than 6% since July 8, when it hit a record, part of a broader market selloff led by U.S. megacaps.\n\nGrowth at AWS is likely to have stayed similar to the previous quarter at just over 17%, according to LSEG data. But, Morgan Stanley analysts said: \"AWS needs to grow 18%+ in order to ... ensure investors of AWS's (AI) positioning and its ability to generate high-teens growth through this heavy capex investment period.\"\n\nAs a result of the spending increase, Amazon's gross profit margin growth is expected to have slowed to 1.3% in the April-June quarter, compared with 2.6% in the previous quarter and an average of 2.7% over the past two years.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowth in its North American retail business likely slowed to 8% between April and June, from 12.3% in the January-March quarter, amid signs of a wider slowdown in consumer spending and some competition from new and fast-growing Chinese players such as Temu and Tiktok Shop that are enticing more U.S. shoppers.\n\nAmazon's total revenue is expected to have grown 10.6% to $148.56 billion - the slowest rise in five quarters.\n\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Devika Syamnath)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled that an interest rate cut was close, while a slew of strong earnings from the technology sector also boosted stocks.\n\nGains in futures came following a strong session on Wall Street, after the Fed’s comments and some positive earnings sparked heavy buying into technology stocks. Wall Street also rebounded from a bulk of losses logged over the past week.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.6% to 5,588.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.9% to 19,678.50 points by 19:35 ET (23:35 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 41,141.0 points.\n\nFed says rate cuts are close, flags inflation progress\n\nThe Fed kept interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday, as widely expected.\n\nBut Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged progress in bringing down inflation and cooling the labor market- both factors which set the stage for a potential rate cut in September. Powell explicitly mentioned the possibility of a cut in September, although he noted that it was still contingent on positive data.\n\nThe Fed will have some inflation and labor market readings to consider before its September meeting. Markets are almost entirely pricing in a 25 basis point cut in September, according to CME Fedwatch.\n\nFocus is now on upcoming nonfarm payrolls data, due on Friday, for more cues on the labor market. The prospect of lower rates presents more liquidity for stock markets, which bodes well for valuations.\n\nTech rallies with Meta up front; Apple awaited\n\nTechnology stocks surged in aftermarket trade following positive earnings from Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). The stock rose nearly 7% after clocking stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings and also presenting a robust outlook.\n\nTech was also the biggest boost to Wall Street during the session, with major chipmakers rallying on the heels of strong earnings from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM). The two steadied in aftermarket trade after strong gains during the session.\n\nThe positive earnings helped investors largely look past middling results from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which missed estimates. Chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) also clocked weak earnings, sending its stock down 11% in aftermarket trade.\n\nTech earnings are set to continue with majors Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) set to report on Thursday.\n\nStrength in tech sparked strong gains in Wall Street on Wednesday. The S&P 500 surged 1.5% to 5,522.30 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rallied 2.6% to 17,598.79 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged on its limited tech exposure, rising only 0.2% to 17,598.79 points.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut tech stocks were still nursing steep losses over the past three weeks, as they were hit by a mix of profit-taking and as expectations of interest rate cuts sparked a pivot into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures surge on rate cut bets, strong tech earnings\n\nSingapore's Keppel HY profit rises on upbeat infra, connectivity performance\n\nArm stock dives 11% as slow AI gains lead to tepid outlook\n\nView comments",

It has few competitors with so much revenue.\n\nAlthough Amazon is an excellent choice for stocks to own for the long haul, it doesn’t hurt to consider owning other e-commerce stocks that also benefit from global online sales.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAfter all, an April 2024 blog post from Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) estimates that global e-commerce sales will grow from $4.98 trillion in 2021 to $7.96 trillion in 2027, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.1%.\n\nIf my business could grow by 8% annually, I’d be very happy. But I digress. The important point is that e-commerce is still a very lucrative business.\n\nHere are three e-commerce stocks from the Global X E-commerce ETF (NASDAQ:EBIZ) to ride the second wave.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (WSM) Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mall\n\nSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) is the third-largest holding from EBIZ with a 5.13% weight. WSM shares are up nearly 50% YTD and 378% over the past five years.\n\nI’ve said for years that Williams-Sonoma is one of the best omnichannel retailers anywhere because it balances its brick-and-mortar and online businesses so well.\n\nIn recent years, the home furniture and home goods retailer has leaned into e-commerce. In 2023, its e-commerce business accounted for 66% of its $7.75 billion in net revenue. That’s considerably higher than when I first wrote about the stock back in June 2016. Back then, e-commerce accounted for about 53% of revenues.\n\nWhat’s that done for profitability?\n\nIn 2016, it had an operating profit of $472.6 million, good for an operating margin of 9.3%. In 2023, its operating profit was $1.50 billion, good for an operating margin of 17.3%, 800 basis points higher.\n\nI’d say e-commerce has done a lot for profitability. It’s why WSM remains one of the top e-commerce stocks to buy.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is the 15th-largest holding from EBIZ with a 3.32% weight. MELI shares are up nearly 9% year-to-date and 169% over the past five years.\n\nMercadoLibre is a combination of e-commerce and fintech businesses.\n\nIn Latin America, that’s vital because the access to banks is far lower than in the U.S. It was started in 1999 as MercadoLibre.com. Today, it has one of the five highest market caps of e-commerce companies worldwide. It also has one of the 60 largest market caps of tech companies worldwide.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs far back as May 2013, I was recommending its stock, and even though I’ve become a big fan of Amazon as well, I still love what it’s doing in Latin America, which operates in a much tougher business environment than America.\n\nAt the time, it had $472.6 million in revenue, most of which was from the MercadoLibre Marketplace. Fast-forward to 2023. It generated revenue from two segments: Commerce and Fintech. The former accounted for $2.39 billion in revenue (34%), 41.2% higher than in 2022, while the latter accounted for $4.73 billion (66%), 32.6% higher than a year earlier.\n\nPart e-commerce, part fintech, total profit machine.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Let Shopify Stock Finish Cooling off Before You Invest. E-Commerce Stocks\n\nSource: Beyond The Scene / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify is the 22nd-largest holding from EBIZ with a 2.50% weight. SHOP shares are down nearly 20% YTD and up 79% over the past five years.\n\nShopify stock was pretty much on a straight up trajectory until the end of 2021. Since then, it’s been mostly misery mixed in with a little bit of good news. As a result, of the 51 analysts that cover its stock, only 30 rate it a “buy” (59%), with a target price of $76.20, nearly 30% higher than where it currently trades, so there’s hope.\n\nOn July 22, CIBC analyst Todd Coupland reiterated his “buy” rating for the stock with an $85 target price, even better than the median.\n\nWhen the company reported its Q1 2024 results in May, President Harley Finkelstein had some confident statements about the company’s future. Cantech Letter reported Finkelstein’s comments:\n\n“You’re seeing the strongest version of Shopify in our history. Our outstanding Q1 performance is clear proof of our dedication to the new shape of Shopify, our commitment to operating with a consistent team size, and our focus on building for the long-term to deliver both growth and profitability.”\n\nI would buy after it reports Q2 2024 results on August 7.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) climbed higher on Wednesday, adding as much as 3.4%. As of 12:46 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 2.7%.\n\nThe catalyst that sent the e-commerce titan higher was a report that Amazon is increasing its already expansive one- and two-day delivery options into underserved parts of the U.S.\n\nCementing its lead\n\nAmazon is working to expand its delivery empire into the most rural parts of the U.S. in a bid to increase sales in less densely populated areas, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. In recent months, it has been working to optimize its delivery and logistics services to more quickly reach a greater percentage of the population, particularly in more out-of-the-way places.\n\nTo better serve rural customers, Amazon will tweak its practices, \"using hyperefficient warehouses, contracted drivers, and mom-and-pop shops,\" according to the report. The company is experiencing growing demand in more remote areas and believes that by speeding up its delivery services, it can further increase that demand.\n\nReaching 100% of the country simply isn't practical, but Amazon is now trying to reach roughly 90% of U.S. customers. In a statement, the company said these efforts \"will help cut delivery times for customers in smaller towns and more isolated parts of the country.\"\n\nIncreasing its advantage\n\nWhen it comes to digital retail, Amazon has no equal, accounting for approximately 38% of U.S. online retail sales last year. For context, that's more than its next 15 largest rivals combined, according to data supplied by eMarketer.\n\nNot only is Amazon the leader in e-commerce, but it's also the top dog in cloud computing, controlling roughly 31% of the market in the first quarter, according to research company Canalys. This cloud dominance also gives Amazon a key advantage in the generative artificial intelligence (AI) revolution as a purveyor of cloud-based AI software and solutions. It's worth noting that AI stocks are also rallying, which likely helped fuel Amazon's rise today.\n\nFinally, at roughly less than 3 times sales, Amazon is attractively priced, particularly considering the multiple ways in which the company can grow. That's why Amazon stock is a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Apple AAPL and Amazon.com AMZN, two prominent members of the Magnificent 7, are set to report their respective quarterly results on Aug 1.\r\n\r\nInvestors are eagerly awaiting results from these two industry stalwarts to get a glimpse of the growing impact of AI, including Generative AI (GenAI), on top-line as well as bottom-line growth.\r\n\r\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group that also includes Tesla, Meta Platforms and NVIDIA. \r\n\r\nThe Magnificent 7 has been benefiting from the massive proliferation of AI. Demand for AI is escalating, and that has increased the need for data center capacity expansion. The advent of GenAI has further attracted investments.\r\n\r\nGartner estimates spending on AI software to witness a CAGR of 19.1% between 2022 and 2027 to hit $297 billion in 2027. GenAI software spending is expected to surge from 8% in 2023 to 35% by 2027. IDC expects worldwide revenues for AI platforms software to witness a CAGR of 40.6% over the 2023-2028 timeframe. These projections reflect strong growth opportunities for the Magnificent 7.\r\n\r\nLet’s delve deep to find out what Apple and Amazon are expected to report this earnings season.\n\nApple and Amazon: Impressive Earnings Surprise History\n\nAAPL’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 4.14%, on average. Meanwhile, Amazon’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 48.17%.\r\n\r\nApple expects third-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to grow low single digits year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $84.02 billion, indicating growth of 2.71% year over year. \r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for AAPL’s fiscal third-quarter earnings is currently pegged at $1.34 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 6.35% increase from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nAmazon expects second-quarter 2024 net sales between $144 billion and $149 billion, indicating 7-11% growth on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMZN’s net sales is pegged at $148.63 billion, indicating growth of 10.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for AMZN’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.03 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days, which indicates a jump of 63.49% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Amazon.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nAAPL Underperforms AMZN Stock YTD\n\nYear to date, Apple shares have gained 15.4% year to date, outperforming only Microsoft and Tesla. Amazon has returned 21.7% over the same timeframe, outperforming AAPL but lagging NVDA, META and GOOGL.\n\nYTD Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMoreover, AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Style Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment. In comparison, Amazon has a Value Style Score of B suggesting the shares are undervalued currently.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, Apple is trading at 8.14X, higher than its median of 7.17X, the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s 6.18X and Amazon’s 2.78X.\n\nPrice/Sales Ratio (F12M) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple’s Fiscal Q3 to Suffer From Weak China Sales\n\nApple’s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 50.6% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein sales decreased 10.5% year over year to $46 billion. \r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is expected to have struggled in China amid significant competition from domestic handset makers. Per IDC, China’s smartphone shipments grew 8.9% year over year to 71.6 million units in the second quarter of calendar 2024, driven by robust performance from Vivo, Huawei and Xiaomi. Apple is expected to have witnessed a 3.1% year-over-year decline.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. (Read More: Should Apple Stock be in Your Portfolio Pre-Q3 Earnings?)\n\nAmazon’s Q2 Earnings to Ride on Prime Momentum\n\nAmazon is benefiting from solid Prime momentum, owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive.\r\n\r\nThe strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings are tailwinds. The robust advertising business is also contributing well. Its strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain a plus. (Read More: Is Amazon Stock Worth Buying Ahead of Q2 Earnings?)\n\nConclusion\n\nApple and Amazon are both expected to benefit from the strong proliferation of AI in the long haul.\r\n\r\nHowever, ahead of the earnings release, we believe Amazon stock is a better buy, given its current undervaluation, which presents an opportunity for investors to jump in the stock. \r\n\r\nAmazon has a Growth Style Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2, a favorable combination that offers a strong investment opportunity, per the Zacks Proprietary methodology.

        "content": "Amazon’s AMZN second-quarter 2024 results, scheduled to be released on Aug 1, are likely to reflect gains from its strengthening cloud service offerings.\r\n\r\nAMZN’s cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), dominates the cloud market on the back of its growing adoption and popularity. This is anticipated to be reflected in the company’s second-quarter results.\r\n\r\nWe note that the solid momentum across AWS has been aiding Amazon in generating high margins from the cloud business. The trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nAWS’s revenues were $25.04 billion, accounting for 18% of net sales in first-quarter 2024, rising 17% year over year. We further note that its operating income was $9.4 billion, up 83.9% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2024 AWS sales is pegged at $25.9 billion, indicating an improvement of 16.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nClick here to know how the company’s overall second-quarter performance is likely to have been.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nA strong cloud services portfolio and expanding generative AI capabilities are expected to have aided the performance of AWS in the second quarter.\r\n\r\nAWS is gaining significantly from the solid adoption of Amazon Bedrock.\r\n\r\nIn the quarter under review, the company introduced Bedrock innovations, including custom model import capability and model evaluation capabilities, and Guardrails. These features are designed to provide customers a secure, easy and fast way to develop advanced generative AI applications. \r\n\r\nWith a wide selection of foundation models from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI and Stability AI, Bedrock offers seamless deployment, scalability and continuous optimization.\r\n\r\nAWS also made its generative AI-powered assistant called Amazon Q generally available.\r\n\r\nOn the back of portfolio strength, AWS witnessed solid customer momentum in the second quarter.\r\n\r\nNinjaTech AI partnered with AWS to launch its next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using the latter’s machine learning (ML) chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike CRWD extended its strategic partnership with AWS to accelerate cloud security and AI innovation. Notably, CrowdStrike is using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker in order to boost innovation in SIEM transformation, and novel cybersecurity AI use cases. More precisely, CRWD aims to accelerate the development of generative AI capabilities in its Falcon Platform.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Brightcove started using Amazon’s generative AI assistant called Amazon Q Business on AWS internally for real-world use cases applicable to the enterprise, media and entertainment technology sectors.\r\n\r\nBlackBerry recently unveiled a generative AI-backed cybersecurity advisor called Cylance Assistant, which leverages Amazon Bedrock to enable organizations to enhance their cybersecurity operations.\r\n\r\nZilch extended its collaboration with AWS to expand the use of the latter’s AI and ML services in order to accelerate sales in the next two years, and improve customer service and lending decisions.\r\n\r\nFWD Group Holdings selected AWS as its strategic cloud provider in the second quarter.\r\n\r\nAlso, SAP SAP teamed up with AWS to embed generative AI solutions across its enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications. SAP integrates generative AI models from Amazon Bedrock, such as the Anthropic Claude 3 model family and Amazon Titan, into its generative AI hub in SAP AI Core.\r\n\r\nFormula 1 partnered with AWS to introduce a generative AI-designed F1 trophy for the Canadian Grand Prix. \r\n\r\nWe note that the strengthening customer base is likely to have driven AWS's top-line growth in the second quarter. It is also expected to have aided Amazon, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), in sustaining its cloud dominance against its strong contenders like Microsoft and Alphabet GOOGL.

        "title": "The Top 3 Consumer Stocks to Buy Now: Summer 2024",
        "content": "While the stricter definition of consumer stocks might only consist of consumer discretionary stocks, in this article, I will utilize the larger definition that is inclusive of both consumer staple and discretionary sectors. Generally, consumer staples include companies that sell essential goods and services such as food, beverages, and everyday household items. On the other hand, consumer discretionary stocks refer to items that are often wanted yet not necessarily needed by buyers.\n\nThese stocks are heavily dependent on interest rates and other macroeconomic factors. When the economy is performing well, spending on discretionary items goes up, while during an economic downturn, consumer staples tend to perform better. Even though consumer stocks have underperformed relative to other sectors like technology, there are still good reasons for investors to buy consumer stocks this summer especially considering the economic volatility that comes with an upcoming election later this year. Below are the three best consumer stocks to buy this summer to receive a good return in the future.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is a long-time defensive stock that has proven to be stable through different economic cycles. With over 10,000 stores in 24 countries, Walmart is both the largest retailer domestically and globally. Even though it already brings in the most revenue among retailers, there are reasons to believe that Walmart will continue to grow and dominate the industry.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalmart’s most recent financial reports support this. In FY’25 Q1, revenue grew 6.0% year over year while operating income increased by 9.6% in the same time period. However, this was not what was most impressive about the earnings report. The eCommerce sales went up by over 20% globally last year, a very promising sign that Walmart has penetrated the online consumer market. This is especially important as retailers will gradually rely more on eCommerce, and eventually the future of the business lies in this field.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the largest eCommerce company in the world, and that is not going to change for a while.With more than $350 billion in revenue last year, it is the second largest retailer worldwide just after Walmart.\n\nWhile the stock itself is down, Wall Street analysts are still bullish on Amazon. This year’s “Prime Day” was the best in the company’s history. During those two days, American consumers spent 14.2 billion online shopping. While the exact second-quarter earnings are scheduled to come out this Thursday, analysts are estimating $148.68 billion in revenue, 11% up from the previous year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Amazon has been aggressively expanding its business beyond the eCommerce scope, including entertainment. Last week, Amazon signed a 11-year media rights contract with the NBA. Under this deal, Amazon Prime Video will cover games on Thursday nights, Fridays, and some games on Saturday games. There are still many growth catalysts going for Amazon, and investors should buy the stock this summer.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nThe last stock on this list is the well-beloved food and beverage company PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). Pepsi has a diversified business model which makes it a stable stock for investors to buy. It covers a wide range of items including soft drinks, breakfast items, and snacks. PepsiCo is constantly expanding into alternative food options to meet the rising demand for health-conscious consumers. It acquired healthy brands like Naked and Health Warrior, which give the company an upper edge against its competitors.\n\nIn addition to the varied revenue streams, PepsiCo has been delivering stable and strong returns to investors. Thecompany raised its dividend payment by 7% last month which was the 52nd consecutive annual increase, and the current annual dividend yield stands at 3.13%. With a defensive business portfolio yet an expansion into new markets that could bring long term profit, PepsiCo presents an attractive buy opportunity for investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andy Kim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor held a long position in AMZN.\n\nAndy is a self-taught investor who is interested in ESG and socially responsible investing. He has managed the portfolio of a small investment fund and started his own research firm. Through his freelance writing on InvestorPlace, he hopes to find and share promising investments in companies with the goal of bettering the world.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "title": "Jeff Bezos’ famed management rules are slowly unraveling inside Amazon. Can they survive the Andy Jassy era?",
        "content": "When Amazon ordered most workers back to the office three days a week in February 2023, Pamela Hayter was not happy about the end of a popular pandemic-era arrangement.\n\nBut Hayter, a program manager, was bothered on a deeper level: Because the policy effectively meant that only people living near an Amazon office would be able to continue working at the company, she believed Amazon was violating one of its sacred tenets to \"hire and develop the best.”\n\nWhat’s more, by announcing the mandate with little warning or buy-in, Hayter believed, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had betrayed his duty to \"earn trust,\" another important part of the Amazon code.\n\nAt Amazon these tenets, known as Leadership Principles, are much more than suggestions. They are a way of life that employees are judged on before they are even hired, steeped in from the moment they join, and scrupulously followed thereafter with the devotion of religious converts.\n\nHayter’s next move was a case in point: With the help of some of the 30,000 other employees who joined an internal Slack channel she’d created, she drafted a memo to lay out their concerns about the return-to-work mandate. The memo was exactly six pages long.\n\nLike the Leadership Principles, six-page memos (\"6-pagers,\" in Amazon lingo) are part of a unique work culture forged within the giant internet company over the years and considered as much of a contributor to Amazon’s world-beating success as any blockbuster product or individual, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos himself.\n\nIn reality, these principles and the processes they produce are among Amazon’s grandest innovations.\n\nThe customs and practices are widely imitated: More than a dozen books promise to teach managers the secrets to the principles and processes; consultants do brisk business helping firms import Amazon’s methods into their organizations; CEOs load their emails with Amazonian axioms.\n\nAnd yet, as the Hayter episode shows, the Amazon Way is a fragile concept even within Amazon itself. Jassy defended the return-to-work decision as a judgment call; after all, another company leadership principle notes that “leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts.” But the clash between employees and the CEO over who was being more faithful to the code reveals a growing tension that some fear could erode the pillars of the $2 trillion company. Employees walk past a mural relief reading \"Earn Trust\" at the Amazon.com Inc. office campus in Hyderabad, India, on Friday, Sept. 6, 2019. Amazon's only company-owned campus outside the U.S. opened at the end of August on the other side of the globe, thousands of miles from their Seattle headquarters. The 15-storey building towers over the landscape in Hyderabad's technology and financial district, signaling the giant online retailer's ambitions to expand in one of the world's fastest-growing retail markets. Photographer: Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nMore than three years after Bezos passed the CEO baton to Jassy, as Amazon recently celebrated its 30th birthday, the durability and staying power of Amazon’s foundational work culture are being watched closely by many inside and outside the organization.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortune spoke to two dozen current and recently departed Amazon executives and managers about how the famous Amazon Way is holding up in the post-Bezos era. Many of those interviewed paint a picture of a company where the key principles and practices remain core but have become less universally agreed upon. Increasingly, some insiders say, the leadership principles have become weaponized, diluted, or applied inconsistently.\n\nPowerPoint presentations, once strictly verboten, now pop up occasionally. Longtime leaders who embodied the principles in their every move have moved on.\n\nPerhaps in response to some of these new realities, Amazon recently disseminated to employees an hourlong video course hosted by Jassy himself explaining the company’s 16 leadership principles.\n\n“The leadership principles are not something that you just memorize or that you just study for a couple of hours, or you try once or twice and you’ve got them,” Jassy says in the intro. “It’s something that you have to practice a lot.”\n\nMargaret Callahan, an Amazon spokesperson, said that the company regularly updates internal resources and training, including on topics pertaining to the company’s culture. She said that Amazon’s culture—defined by the leadership principles, a “writing culture,” and working backward from customers’ needs—remains strong: “It’s what has driven innovations such as Prime, AWS, the Kindle, Alexa, the Climate Pledge, and Project Kuiper, just to name a few.”\n\nThe success of these products, and Amazon’s continued financial growth, indicate that the company is far from facing any immediate crisis. On Thursday, Amazon will report its second-quarter financial results, with Wall Street analysts expecting double-digit revenue and profit growth.\n\nAs Amazon seeks to extend its dominance into the next 30 years, however, the leadership principles and special work culture will almost certainly collide with the questions that have challenged so many corporate paragons of the past: Is having a sacred playbook an asset that companies should preserve at all costs, or does it become a liability holding companies back as the world around them changes? And, perhaps more important, is there a point at which a company’s size, growth, and industry-spanning tentacles make a unified culture of decision-making and inventing impossible?\n\nTrue believers in the Amazon Way\n\nCustomer obsession.\n\nBias for action.\n\nDisagree and commit.\n\nThere are 16 Leadership Principles at Amazon. Any Amazon employee can recite most of them by heart (those who can’t won’t last very long).\n\nThere are also the various homegrown Amazon practices: the two-pizza rule, which holds that cross-functional, or “single-threaded,” teams focused on a specific goal or project should be lean enough that two pies could suffice as a team meal. There’s also a rabid attention on so-called “input” metrics of a certain business—think selection or price—rather than output metrics such as revenue.\n\nAnd then there’s the intense focus on written narratives, including the 6-pager, a planning document that describes in storylike fashion a goal for a business line and how to go about accomplishing it, or a new project or plan (one variant of the 6-pager is the so-called PRFAQ, written in the style of a press release announcing the hypothetical future product, and the focal point of Amazon’s “Working Backward” product-development approach). Before a key meeting, every single attendee sits silently and reads the memo to themself. Only then is a discussion permitted to begin in earnest.\n\nIt sounds almost cultlike, Amazon insiders acknowledge. But as former Amazon Prime Video boss Bill Carr notes, the payoff is that historically Amazon employees up and down the corporate ladder understand things at a “granular level.” NEW YORK, NEW YORK - NOVEMBER 30: Andy Jassy on stage at the 2022 New York Times DealBook on Nov. 30, 2022, in New York City. (Photo by Thos Robinson/Getty Images for The New York Times)\n\n“The executives at Amazon are just so much more well-informed about what is going on in their company, in terms of metrics, in terms of the initiatives that teams are doing, in terms of what's working, what's not working,” said Carr, who left in 2015 but is the coauthor of the book Working Backwards and cofounder of a consulting firm by the same name, which both aim to guide business leaders on how to apply Amazon’s principles and practices to their own businesses.\n\nExecutives at Amazon brim with personal examples of the power of the leadership mottos. Ideally, multiple principles can mesh together on a project to help unleash a single breakthrough product or service.\n\nBeryl Tomay, a 19-year Amazon veteran and vice president of its transportation division, points to one recent success story that involved “regionalizing” the company’s network of U.S. warehouses so that each facility serves a distinct geographic area. The multiyear project has lowered costs, led to more environmentally friendly trucking routes, and allowed customers to get their goods faster, the company has said.\n\nFrom brainstorming the initial idea to executing, the project called for a collection of Leadership Principles— from “customer obsession” to “thinking big.” Tomay reels off more of them with the zeal of a true believer: “There’s a 'simplify' part [and] there's also the 'invent' part. 'Dive deep' too. Going super deep into what our topology looks like, and what our inbound inventory placement looks like.”\n\nIf mission statements and corporate values are viewed as empty slogans within many companies, at Amazon the Leadership Principles and special practices are embraced with genuine sincerity.\n\n“It’s critically important for an organization to have something like this if they are actually meaningful,” said Stephan Meier, chair of the management division at Columbia Business School and author of the forthcoming book The Employee Advantage.\n\nBut, Meier adds, “if it's not lived, if it's not on top of people’s minds, if it doesn't have any implications of how you would make decisions or treat each other, they are completely meaningless.”\n\nIt’s precisely this warning that made some Amazon insiders uneasy with what happened a few years ago.\n\nAn erosion of trust\n\nOn July 1, 2021, Amazon did something it hadn’t done in many years: It added two new leadership principles to its list. “Strive to be Earth’s best employer” was one new principle. “Success and scale bring broad responsibility” was the other.\n\nWhen these were introduced, Amazon was facing intense media coverage over the swell of unionization efforts in its warehouse network, as well as antitrust and environmental scrutiny. And with Bezos scheduled to hand over the CEO reins a few days later, the introduction of the two new principles served as a convenient opportunity to demonstrate a company committed to progress under his successor.\n\nInside the company, though, the reaction among many employees was swift and brutal: “They are clearly a marketing ploy and they devalue the rest of the Leadership Principles,” one former senior manager of more than 10 years who left the company recently told Fortune. “Total bullshit,” opined a former longtime communications employee at Amazon who was still at the company at the time, and who summed up the new principles as “playing the reputational game versus guiding how you think.”\n\nThe problem, explained a former Amazon vice president, is that the pair of new leadership principles are so radically different from the other 14 that it makes it tougher for employees to grasp the essence of the overall principles and to act on them. “I've got to think that that’s somewhat challenging for the rank and file. The fact that there are so many LPs, and the fact that these last two are so abstract,” the former VP said.

Such weaponization of leadership rules to criticize or squash dissent has always been a reality to a certain extent. “Earns trust” has been especially problematic in this regard, according to some women of color, and a former Amazon VP has written about leadership principles being weaponized by leaders when “they lack the power to give orders” and thus resort to “a crude attempt to apply the LP not as intended, but as a way to ensure an outcome.”\n\nEven knowing that, many who spoke to Fortune believe the issue has worsened in recent years as Amazon has hired many executives from outside the company. (Most of those who spoke to Fortune requested anonymity, either because they are not permitted to talk to the press without permission as current Amazon employees, or because they feared retaliation for speaking candidly even as former employees.) One current Amazon senior manager said they’ve consistently observed bosses new to the company use the principles “as weapons to put those who aren’t favorites in their place,” while employing other principles to build up their favorites.\n\n“Sometimes I’ll hear, ‘It’s amazing you had this ‘bias for action’…and other times when I believe I’ve had ‘bias for action,’ they will say you weren't data-driven (from the leadership principle ‘Dive deep’) enough.”\n\nAnother employee, a longtime AWS manager, said his superiors over the last few years frequently wielded “Disagree and commit”—a maxim intended to prevent groupthink during project planning while ensuring unity once a plan has been agreed upon—as a cudgel to quash any level of pushback.\n\n“The joke by the time I left [last year] was if you didn't like something, you could disagree and commit or disagree and quit,” the employee said.\n\nCallahan, the Amazon spokesperson, said that the two new principles are as important as the others, and that they all play a role in evaluating new hires as well as the performance of current employees.\n\nBut there are other signs of change within the organization too. Several current managers who spoke to Fortune said that PowerPoint presentations have supplanted written narratives in some cases over the last two years—not in a dominant way, but in a noticeable one nonetheless. In the Prime Video division, for example, new executives who have come to the company after long careers outside of Amazon have been known to chafe at the heavy focus on narratives.\n\n“There's a lot of resistance from outsiders at the executive level,” one current manager said.\n\nAnother senior manager who worked at Amazon for 15 years said his first 13 years at the company were marked by an overwhelming amount of writing, but that in the last two years that has shifted to PowerPoint decks.\n\n“We have this S team that is very religious about Amazon’s culture and gets it,” he said, “but they brought in an enormous amount of senior execs in the level or two below the S team from [other] companies and they brought in their culture and were never given a real, ‘This is how we do things at Amazon.’”\n\nNew executives who joined right before or immediately after COVID-19 shutdowns also struggled to grasp the supreme importance of business review documents like the weekly, monthly, and quarterly business reviews that exist elsewhere in the business world but are foundational inside Amazon.\n\n“There's huge value in the QBR when everyone sits together and puts everything on the table,” a former director-level executive who left Amazon last year said. “But when you’re doing it over video and have to limit the number of attendees because there’s too many people, and you’re really worried about anything in there that’s too sensitive to be leaked, then the QBR becomes an onerous burden.” MORENO VALLEY, CA - SEPTEMBER 29, 2021 - - A worker packages orders at the Amazon Fulfillment Center in Moreno Valley, California, on September 29, 2021.

How can you both “dive deep” while having a “bias for action”? How can you truly employ “customer obsession” if you also have to make sure that “frugality” is core to what you do?\n\nBezos excelled at explaining the mental models or logic he used to arrive at a decision, says Carr. He was able to articulate the “why” as much as the “what.”\n\n“Jeff’s brain just doesn’t work like other people’s brains,” adds Carr, who experienced 15 years of firsthand observations before leaving the company in 2015, and who stressed that he could only speak about Amazon’s culture as it was during his time at the company. “By learning from him, then you could start to take those paths, too, and teach people about why that’s the path we would take.” CEO of Amazon Jeff Bezos (R) gestures as he addresses the Amazon's annual Smbhav event in New Delhi on January 15, 2020. - Bezos, whose worth has been estimated at more than $110 billion, is officially in India for a meeting of business leaders in New Delhi. (Photo by Sajjad HUSSAIN / AFP) (Photo by SAJJAD HUSSAIN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThat would be a tough act for anyone to follow, even a 27-year veteran like Jassy who once served as Bezos’s “shadow,” a role similar to a chief of staff. That’s why many who spoke to Fortune don’t point to the Bezos-Jassy transition as the main fault line. The disruption caused by the pandemic, as well as the doubling of Amazon’s headcount in two years, was more to blame, they say.\n\nThose who joined right before the pandemic, or during the madness of 2020 and 2021, had little time to learn and adapt. Learning through meeting interactions over videoconferencing, for example, was much less conducive to osmosis than in-person interactions, either planned or serendipitous run-ins, several sources said.\n\n“The leadership we brought in from 2019 to 2021 at the director level and above never really were educated on the Amazon culture,” a senior manager of 15 years said.\n\n“They really struggled to understand the culture, but that wasn’t on them,” said another, an Amazon director-level executive who left the company recently after nearly a decade. “That’s on the changing of times and remote work.”\n\nAmazon’s Callahan said that for the last five years, new senior Amazon leaders at the director and vice president levels attend a three-day training on the company’s culture taught by peers, and are paired with other Amazon colleagues to help them adapt to the company in other ways. However, Callahan declined to respond to questions about whether this practice was put on hold during the pandemic and, if so, for how long.\n\nMany longtime standard-bearers of the company’s DNA have also walked away in recent years. Jeff Wilke, Bezos’s longtime right hand and the CEO of Amazon’s core consumer business, left in 2021; Dave Clark, a longtime head of Amazon’s warehouse and delivery operations who eventually replaced Wilke, departed Amazon a little more than a year later, reportedly in part due to Jassy’s hands-on managing style.\n\n“Culture takes active architecture and work,” said another former Amazon vice president who worked at the company for more than 15 years. “There was nobody else left to teach [that],” the former exec added, in a nod to all the top leaders who have left the company.\n\nWith so much change at the top, executives like Jamil Ghani are trying to step up. The global leader of Amazon Prime joined the company eight years ago and says that providing on-the-fly lessons and guidance about the leadership principles and Amazon customs, like written narratives, is an important part of his job.\n\n“I often tell the team that the point of your work is not the doc; that the point of your work is to create a doc that can inspire the right meeting, the right discussion,” Ghani told Fortune. “In the best meetings, you actually don't even talk about the document. Everybody has the same context and information and then you have a discussion.\"\n\nIn the event that a leadership principle has been misinterpreted or misapplied—including, as he acknowledges occasionally occurs, in situations when one is being used punitively—Ghani swoops in.\n\n“I've done this many times when it's happened or, offline, kind of follow up with a peer or somebody else and be like, 'Hey, I don't think that's quite right. And here's why,’” he added. “And people can have a very level-headed conversation about it.” This photograph taken on November 22, 2023, shows the Amazon logo on the facade of Amazon's logistic site in Bretigny-sur-Orge, some 30 km south of Paris. (Photo by Dimitar DILKOFF / AFP) (Photo by DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA Bible with many religions\n\nOne of the beauties of Amazon’s leadership principles has long been that they are detailed enough to serve as North Stars but broad enough for leaders to mold them as necessary depending on the type of decision or current environment.\n\n“These are not processes that give you the answers,” says Carr, the former head of Prime Video. “They don't tell you what to do. They don't tell you whether to turn left or turn right, or to green-light this thing or not that thing. They’re management tools that give you the right frameworks to use to examine the problem.”\n\n“Think of the LPs like the Bible,” a former member of Amazon’s exclusive senior executive team, known as the S-team, told Fortune. “Amazing how many religions are based off the same text.”\n\nThree years into Jassy’s CEO tenure, the changes are becoming increasingly clear. The question now is whether this is evidence that the magic formula is getting diluted or a sign of the framework’s versatility.\n\nTomay, the VP of transportation, says staying nimble sometimes requires tweaking longtime practices. In the last year, she’s told her teams to reserve the six-page memo for only the most important meetings and encouraged them to craft a one-pager first. If there’s an alignment on the path forward after reviewing the one-pager in, say, a 30-minute meeting, that person or team will get the green light to go off and dive deep in creating a 6-pager.\n\n“The company has shifted and grown,” she says, “so you have to keep adapting.”\n\nWith 1.5 million employees, Amazon is one of the largest employers in the world. And it has successfully expanded into lucrative markets like cloud computing, advertising, and entertainment. But with online retailers like China’s Shein and Temu gaining momentum, and AI threatening to reshape the entire business landscape, Amazon’s ability to adapt without losing what makes it special are sure to be tested in the years to come.\n\nBusiness history can provide some unifying lessons. One key one: a strong culture and DNA, anchored in principles and practices that are talked about and lived out most working days, can help stabilize—even bolster—an organization during periods of significant change, whether CEO transitions or massive shifts in consumer or enterprise trends.\n\nMeier, the Columbia Business School professor and author, points to Toyota as one legacy corporation worth studying in this regard. “Toyota had those very clear principles on how to treat employees and make decisions, and I think it served them really well,” he says. “As a result, they sustained some of their success over transitions.”\n\nThe auto giant, whose stock hit an all-time high in March, is 87 years old, almost three times older than Amazon.\n\nIt’s currently on its 12th president.\n\nAre you a current or former Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "title": "Is the Rivian R2 the Key to Profitability and Stock Growth for RIVN Stock?",
        "content": "Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) has popped recently. Rivian stock has gained approximately 16% over the past month.\n\nA significant portion of the gains have resulted from the June 26 announcement that Volkswagen Group (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) would invest up to $5 billion in Rivian as part of a joint venture between the two companies, focusing on next generation electronic architecture and software.\n\nAs a part of the deal, VW will initially invest $1 billion, with the remaining $4 billion to flow over the next three years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs a result, Volkswagen would become one of Rivian’s largest shareholders alongside Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) who owned 16.4% as of April 24.\n\nWhile there is no doubt having deep pockets like VW to backstop Rivian’s development will help keep it on a positive trajectory, these types of partnerships have a way of imploding before they’ve delivered a reasonable return on investment for everyone involved.\n\nHowever, the money should help get Rivian’s more affordable R2 up and running in 2026. That could make it the company’s savior. Here’s why.\n\nThe Margins Have Got to Improve\n\nThe good news from Rivian’s Q1 2024 report is that it only lost $38,784 per vehicle delivered in the quarter, down from $67,329 a year earlier, and from $43,372 in Q4 2023. It’s headed in the right direction.\n\nThe problem is that it still lost $1.84 billion from operations during the first quarter, up slightly from a year earlier, on $1.20 billion revenue, nearly double a year earlier.\n\nAs a result, the accumulated deficit for Rivian stock at the end of March was a whopping $20.0 billion.\n\nIt will take a tremendous amount of profit to erase that deficit. Needless to say, it’s not going to happen overnight.\n\nAt the very least, its gross margins will have to turn positive. They were -44% in the first quarter.\n\nBy comparison, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) took five years from Elon Musk first getting involved with the company in February 2004 to 2009 when it generated a gross profit on automotive sales of $9.5 million.\n\nRivian’s first deliveries started in September 2021. If it’s to match Tesla’s pathway to profitability, it should start generating an automotive profit by late 2026, just as the R2 production gets going.\n\nThe R2 Is the Lowest Common Denominator\n\nI believe the best way to solve most problems is by focusing on the lowest common denominator.\n\nHere, it is generating a gross profit from the R2, which is expected to start at $45,000, well below the R1S ($75,000) and R1T ($70,000), you’ll be able to make a boatload from your higher-priced vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nRivian is following the Tesla road map by starting with more expensive vehicles and over time and profit, moving to more reasonably priced EVs. As longtime Tesla shareholders would tell you, it’s made them plenty, so it’s not the worst move.\n\nHowever, consider BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY).\n\nIts playbook is to keep prices low in China, its home market – its attractive BYD Dolphin EV sells for $16,500 in China – but makes it more expensive in international markets such as Germany, where it retails for $37,400.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the Dolphin sold for between 39% and $178% higher outside China depending on the market.\n\nIn this case, and it’s clearly an apples-t0-oranges comparison, BYD is subsidizing its Chinese sales with higher revenues per vehicle elsewhere. The lowest common denominator in this case is that the average German car buyer can still afford the Dolphin at inflated prices.\n\nThe R2 Growth and Rivian Stock\n\nThe R2, which is expected in the first half 2026, already has over 100,000 preorders. It got 68,000 in just one day when it introduced the R2 in March.\n\nThe company’s plant in Normal, Illinois, will have an annual production capacity of 215,000 EVs by the time the R2 comes out. The lower-priced vehicle will represent 72% of the capacity with the R1S and R1T accounting for the rest.\n\nNot only will the launch of the R2 force the company to figure out how to make money from a vehicle that’s $25,000 to $30,000 less than its other products, but it will add economies of scale to its operations, lowering its costs, getting it closer to gross profits rather than losses.\n\nAs my InvestorPlace colleague, Faisal Humayun recently pointed out, the R2 launch will generate cost savings of $2.25 billion relative to the company’s original projections.\n\nFurther, the R3 launch after the R2, will cost even less than the R2. It will provide additional economies of scale to its overall operations.\n\nIf you’re an aggressive investor, I would agree with Humayun’s take to accumulate Rivian stock under $20. If not, buy VW stock instead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Why Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) the Best Drone Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Drone Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other drone stocks.\n\nThe term \"drone\" refers to any remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), which can vary in form and autonomy, either controlled by a human pilot or capable of fully autonomous flights. In 2005, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) adopted the term \"unmanned aircraft system\" (UAS) to describe these aerial drones. This terminology was later adopted by other governmental agencies globally, highlighting the importance of considering various system components rather than focusing solely on the aircraft for regulatory development. The rapid evolution of drones began with the advancement of defense technologies, enabling the remote piloting of aircraft equipped with both weaponized and non-weaponized systems. These larger military drones, often weighing several kilograms, are crucial for deployment in environments too dangerous for human pilots. Today, smaller drones are employed by various government agencies for a range of operations, including precision agriculture mapping and surveillance.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war, which began in February 2022, has driven a significant increase in demand for drones, as both militaries employ them for various operations, including intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and target acquisition support. The unprecedented scale of Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) deployment caught both Ukrainian and Russian forces unprepared for such extensive use. However, both militaries have rapidly advanced their drone technology, frequently modernizing and adapting these systems directly on the front lines. In a statement this past year, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's Minister of Internal Affairs, stated \"This war is a war of drones; they are the super weapon here.\" With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and increasing legislative support, the drone market seems poised for significant growth.\n\nAnother trend involves the development of specialized drones tailored for specific industries. These industry-specific drones are equipped with sensors, cameras, and software designed to meet the unique requirements of sectors such as agriculture, construction, and inspection. These 'Consumer' and 'Recreational' drones have become a common part of daily life, particularly among drone hobbyists. As of April of this year, over 780,000 drones were reportedly registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with 375,226 classified as commercial and 400,858 as recreational.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Does the Market Think About the Future of Drones?\n\nThe U.S. commercial drone market was valued at $5.85 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach approximately $14.11 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.2% from 2024 to 2033. In 2023, the rotary blade segment held the largest market share at around 81%, while the hybrid segment is anticipated to experience the fastest growth, with a CAGR of over 11% during the forecast period.\n\nOn the other hand, a report by MarkNtel Advisors states that the global military drone market was valued at approximately $20.21 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of about 12.21% from 2024 to 2030. This rapid growth is driven by the widespread adoption of Extended Visual Line of Sight (EVLOS) UAVs for long-range missions focused on data collection, battle management, and electronic warfare. A notable example of this technology came in the form of General Atomics' testing of advanced datalink and avionics enhancements for the MQ-1C Gray Eagle Extended Range (GE-ER) drone back in 2022.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the best drone stocks to invest in, we first sifted through ETFs and online rankings to come up with a preliminary list. Next, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 920 hedge funds and selected the 8 drone stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple, our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nA prominent leader in technology and e-commerce, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been making substantial advancements in the drone industry. The company's Prime Air program is shifting to smaller, quieter drone models with the six-rotor MK30. This faster, lighter, rain-resistant drone is expected to be available at the company's three testing sites and in cities in Italy and the U.K. by late 2024. These drones will operate from the same inventory facilities as Amazon's delivery trucks, offering customers a new delivery experience.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is solidifying its position as a leader in AI, driven by its AWS business, which achieved operating margins over 37% in the first quarter. AWS operating margins have consistently exceeded 30% for the past five quarters. Additionally, Amazon's first-quarter revenue increased by 12.5% year-over-year, and its adjusted EPS more than tripled.\n\nMoreover, JPMorgan recently reiterated its Overweight rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), with a price target of $240. This decision followed an in-depth analysis of the U.S. e-commerce landscape, including category penetration and Amazon's market share. The research suggests that Amazon is on track to surpass Walmart as the largest U.S. retailer by 2024, with long-term e-commerce penetration potentially exceeding 40%.\n\nAs of March 31, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) had 302 hedge fund investors out of 919 funds tracked by Insider Monkey. The largest stakeholder was Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management, with 42.5 million shares valued at $7.6 billion.\n\nVulcan Value Partners stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a dominant, world class company with powerful secular tailwinds in place including its ecommerce penetration, digital advertising growth, and the cloud transition. Amazon reported strong results during the quarter. Losses in the Core Retail business significantly narrowed. Amazon reduced its cost to serve on a per unit basis for the first time since 2018 as the company’s recent regionalization efforts continue to bear fruit.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best drone stocks to buy.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks That Could Make Your Summer Unforgettable",
        "content": "Investors have always looked at growth stocks to make relatively safe and steady returns. This is because these companies, while well-established, seem to be undervalued, providing a great entry price for investors. Over time, as the overall valuation grows, so does the value of the initial investment. Growth stocks like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have given many of their initial investors more than a thousand times their initial investment.\n\nWhile I can’t promise this for any of the companies on this list, I will say that these companies have a great outlook. This, combined with analysts agreeing that they’re going to grow heavily in the upcoming months, makes these safe bets that investors can trust. Strong fundamentals, when combined with the financials these companies have, set them apart and will make them cornerstones of your portfolio if you play your cards right.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) The Duolingo (DUOL) logo on a smartphone screen with a map in the background.\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock.com\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is an internationally available language learning platform. It is one of the leading providers in this sector, with competitors such as Babble showing up fairly recently. The majority of well-known competitors are privately held. Duolingo’s stock has fallen around 13% in the last month, but analysts predict a possible upside of over 46%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDUOL has some pretty impressive financials and growth. While profit remains a concern, with a margin of just 7.82%, year-over-year quarterly revenue growth was 44.9%, smashing analyst predictions. It also has a debt-to-equity ratio of around 7.97%, which is great for a company with such low profit margins, as DUOL can cover all its debt with its current cash.\n\nAnalysts regularly revise DUOL’s EPS estimates higher, which is incredibly bullish for a company that operates at the scale Duolingo does. The platform also only had a monthly active user base of ~90 million as of Q1 2024, which represents great growth potential going forward. The company is also expanding into the music business, with guitar lessons, among other things. This development allows it to expand through another vertical, which is once again a bullish sign.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (V) are among the world’s leading transaction processing companies. It has a widespread international network that facilitates purchases for both consumers and corporations. According to multiple analysts, the company is trading at $441.30 right now, with an implied upside of 17% over the next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a payment processing company, MA’s cash flow is amazing — operating cash flow was $11.73 billion in the most recent quarter. Revenue growth is solid, at 10.4%, with earnings rising over 27% in the same period, all with a profit margin of a whopping 46.09%. Additionally, over 85% of outstanding shares are held by insiders and institutions, with a short ratio of only 0.47%, which represents an incredibly bullish stance.\n\nMA is starting to expand its digital services footprint. As per an Accesswire article, it is establishing strong digital partnerships to build financial resilience. This shows forward thinking by management, especially as inflationary pressures, while ceasing, are still causing consumers to be more mindful of their spending in the US, which has the potential to hamper MA’s earnings.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a company that provides businesses around the world with Customer Relationship management services. These include data management and client acquisition, among other things. As of the market close on 7/29, CRM was trading at $258.59, with an implied upside of over 14%, according to multiple Yahoo Finance! analysts.\n\nAnalysts have repeatedly raised EPS predictions for the next quarter, which only increases my confidence in this company. It has seen solid revenue growth of 10.7% and impressive earnings growth of 670.4%. This indicates that management has pushed the company towards increasing profitability, which is almost always a great sign for investors.\n\nAdditionally, recently, Workday (WDAY) collaborated with CRM to bring out a new product that uses AI to make workspace tasks more efficient and provides even stronger data analytics tools. This enhances the use case for both of these companies, thereby providing value to both. This, along with many other reasons, is why CRM is a great growth stock to invest in.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Rodrigues held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "What Are the Hottest Tech Stocks Right Now? 3 Top Picks.",
        "content": "In recent months, tech stocks have consistently captured investors’ attention as a result of explosive advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and an ever-evolving semiconductor industry. These developments have ignited fierce growth and innovation across the sector, bringing numerous tech companies into the spotlight. Despite this buzz, there is a palpable sense of fear among some investors. Many worry the tech sector might be overvalued. This caution is understandable, given the rapid rise in tech stock prices and the volatility inherent in high-growth markets.\n\nHowever, not all tech stocks are created equal, and many exhibit attractive attributes that make them worthy of attention. In this article, we will explore three tech stocks that stand out as particularly hot right now. Each of these companies demonstrates unique strengths and potential. They’re each notable picks for investors keeping an eye on some of the hottest names in the tech space.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst on the list is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The semiconductor giant is at the forefront of the AI race due to its cutting-edge technology and GPU designs tailored for AI workloads. While AMD lags behind Nvidia in the software and hardware stack — Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) CUDA platform and specialized AI chips like the A100 and H100 have become the standard thus far — AMD is making notable progress with its own AI-focused GPUs, like the MI300 series, and partnerships to improve its overall ecosystem.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor this reason, I believe that AMD’s latest advancements position it as a strong contender in the AI chip market. Also note that while the stock has fallen modestly from its 52-week high, it remains expensive with a P/E ratio of 40X. Still, this multiple could be justified if AMD continues to capitalize on the rising AI infrastructure spending. This would lead to sustained revenue and earnings growth.\n\nIn any case, even if you don’t necessarily feel bullish about AMD’s investment case, I urge you to keep a close watch on the company’s developments. Noteworthy progress could eventually lead to a tempting opportunity. As AMD advances its AI capabilities, it is poised to become a more active competitor in the AI chip market, potentially strengthening positive investor sentiment toward the stock.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother hot tech stock to pay close attention to these days is Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). This might be surprising, given the company’s reputation for its legacy database systems. That said, this positions Oracle well in the current tech landscape. Its legacy division is still the backbone of many enterprises. It’s known for its reliability, scalability and unmatched security features.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, it generates substantial cash flow, which the company then utilizes to fuel growth in its rapidly expanding cloud business. In fact, Oracle’s cloud division is actively competing with Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Cloud and Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nOracle has invested heavily in expanding its cloud offerings lately, focusing on areas such as autonomous databases and AI-driven analytics. These moves have revived Oracle’s growth, leading to a re-acceleration in revenue growth. Specifically, Oracle’s revenues have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.4% over the past three years after being relatively flat between 2012 and 2020. It’s certainly a stock to keep a close eye on.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last stock on my list is Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce is a rather hot stock to watch, especially given that it’s trading well below its 52-week highs after the dip that occurred between April and June. The company leads the customer relationship management software while benefiting from the ongoing AI tailwind. Therefore, the stock could present a particularly strong opportunity at its current price levels.\n\nTo be fair, the fact investors remain somewhat skeptical regarding the stock’s investment case is valid. In its latest Q1 results for fiscal 2025, Salesforce missed revenue estimates, marking only the second instance in 20 years where the company fell short of the Street’s expectations. The first miss was in Q4 of 2006, making it just two revenue misses in 80 quarters. Also, the 10.7% revenue increase was the weakest in the company’s history, and management’s guidance for Q2 implies an additional deceleration, with revenue growth projected to range between 7% and 8%.\n\nHowever, I would focus on the bigger picture. Despite the relatively underwhelming top-line performance, Salesforce has made significant strides in expanding its margins and scaling profitability. This is a trend that Wall Street seems to overlook. The company achieved an adjusted operating margin of 32.1% in Q1, a 450 basis point increase from the previous year. Therefore, despite the revenue growth deceleration, Salesforce grew its operating cash flow by an impressive 39% to $6.25 billion.\n\nThe current disparity between Salesforce’s underlying profitability improvements and lagging share price makes ie one of the hottest stocks in tech today, even though most investors overlook this name.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nNikolaos Sismanis is a professional research analyst with five years of experience in the field of equity research and financial modeling. Nikolaos has authored over 1,000 stock-related articles that focus on uncovering deep value opportunities, identifying growth stocks at reasonable valuations, and shining a spotlight on overlooked international equities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nTech stocks led the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lower Tuesday as the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) closed at the lowest level since early June.\n\nIt was the fourth day the tech-heavy index lost 1.5% or more in the month of July, especially notable as there had not been any losses of that magnitude in the two prior months.\n\nAhead of June's Consumer Price Index reading on July 11, the Nasdaq 100 had been up 23% year to date. But after the CPI registered its first monthly drop in inflation since 2020, investors kicked off a stomach-churning rotation from large stocks into small.\n\nSince then, the Nasdaq has surrendered half those gains, sending many investors into relative shock upon learning that the laggard Russell 2000 index (^RUT) has nearly caught up to the volatile index known as home to the largest tech players.\n\n\"[I] didn’t have [the] Russell 2000 catching the Nasdaq 100 year-to-date on my bingo card to start this month. Getting close,\" wrote Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets and former NYSE floor governor.\n\nThe Russell 2000 is now sporting a better return this year than the artificial intelligence-fueled S&P Select Tech SPDR Fund (XLK) — and it's only a few points away from catching the S&P 500.\n\nIn the month of June alone, the Nasdaq outperformed the Russell 2000 by over 7 percentage points. Then, in July, the relationship violently inverted such that the Russell outperformed the Nasdaq by nearly 14 percentage points. It's the biggest month-to-month flip in leadership that we have data for, going back to 1988.\n\nThe narrative in the press followed the rotation as grave concerns over market concentration in the Magnificent Seven gave way to a small-cap miracle rally.\n\nTo be clear, sector rotation is a healthy feature of bull markets. When a leading group of stocks takes a back seat, other pockets of the market should take their place such that — at the index level — volatility is subdued. Extremes on either side average out.\n\nBut, given the speed and strength of the recent move, Wall Street is now assessing the damage to institutional portfolios.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley's derivatives team, \"volatility of the last two weeks started out being very rotational.\"\n\nHowever, as the move gained steam, institutions began reining in leverage (borrowed money) and reducing directional bets on stocks. \"What began as a de-grossing event has quickly turned more towards a shift in directional exposure to equities,\" the team continued.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of this, and there's still a Fed meeting later today and a Meta quarterly report to close July.

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Hold for at Least a Decade",
        "content": "The stock market has fluctuated greatly in recent years, highlighting the importance of dedicating a portion of your holdings to reliable long-term growth stocks.\n\nMacroeconomic headwinds saw the S&P 500 index plunge 20% in 2022. Excitement over tech stocks and artificial intelligence (AI) prompted a recovery the following year, with the same index rising 24% in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has popped 14% so far this year, and it is on track to at least equal last year's growth.\n\nHowever, recent market uncertainty fueled by unforeseeable events like a global pandemic and a subsequent economic downturn suggests it's not a bad idea to fortify your portfolio with historically reliable investments. The tech market is an excellent place to start, known for its wealth of growth stocks that have boosted the Nasdaq Technology Sector by 370% over the last decade. For reference, the S&P 500 has risen 176% in that period.\n\nSo, here are two growth stocks to buy in 2024 and hold for at least a decade.\n\n1. Amazon: A surprisingly great value\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has delivered impressive growth in its 30 years of business. Over the last decade alone, its stock has climbed more than 1,000%. Meanwhile, annual revenue has risen 545%, and operating income skyrocketed over 20,000%. The company's success is mainly owed to consistent reinvestment in its business, which has seen it expand to the far corners of tech.\n\nAmazon has become a behemoth of a brand, with solid positions in markets such as e-commerce, cloud computing, video streaming, grocery, AI, and more. The company has achieved leading market shares in multiple industries, with growth catalysts across tech that could boost earnings for years.\n\nMoreover, according to a recent Blomberg report, the company's cash hoard is expected to swell to $100 billion in 2024. The figure could see Amazon introduce its first dividend in the near future, with Ami Asset Management's Andrew Zamfotis stating, \"A dividend might be inevitable, and would really signal that it is going to be more focused on spending and profitable growth.\"\n\nThe company has previously been hyperfocused on reinvestment. However, with its free cash flow projected to nearly double this year, conditions could be ripe for a cash reward to investors.\n\nShares in Amazon are up about 20% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500 by about 6 points. Yet, consistent sales growth has kept the company's stock a value. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe table above shows that Amazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is at an attractive 3 and about in line with its five-year average. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is high at 51, yet well below its five-year average, signaling a buying opportunity. For reference, Amazon's stock has risen 88% in the last five years while maintaining this average.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeing below its average for both metrics represents a bargain, making Amazon a no-brainer growth stock to buy in 2024.\n\n2. Alphabet: Reliable financial growth\n\nLike Amazon, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has enjoyed stellar gains in its time. Its stock has soared 458% since 2014, with annual revenue and operating income rising 365% and 411%, respectively.\n\nThe company's success stems from an impressive roster of subsidiaries, which includes brands like Google, Chrome, Android, YouTube, and even Fitbit. These products have elevated Alphabet's business, allowing it to hit $61 billion in free cash flow this year. The company has used its abundance of cash to invest heavily in AI and reward loyal investors, introducing its first dividend in June with a quarterly payout of $0.20 per share.\n\nAlphabet's new dividend is a promising vote of confidence from executives, representing the belief that the company will continue expanding its earnings for the foreseeable future.\n\nOn July 23, Alphabet reported its second quarter of 2024 earnings. The company delivered revenue growth of 14% year over year, with operating income jumping 26%. Alphabet profited from significant gains in its Google Cloud segment, where revenue rose 28% year over year, and operating income almost tripled.\n\nGoogle Cloud is the world's third-largest cloud platform after Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft's Azure. However, Google Cloud has made impressive strides this year, consistently beating its competitors in growth. Alphabet's business has long been centered around digital advertising, which remains a lucrative division. Still, cloud computing will likely be a key growth driver over the next decade as AI continues to boost the industry.\n\nAlphabet is easily one of the most reliable growth stocks, with years of consistent financial and share price appreciation. Its P/E currently sits at an attractive 24, below its five-year average and lower than many of its rivals'. In addition to generating reliable financial gains, Alphabet is a growth stock you can buy now and hold indefinitely.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

In the context of this framework, Kupferberg said the Street is mis-modeling warrant expense and share-based compensation.\n\nAs warrant expense and Stock-based compensation (SBC) expense grind lower, the analyst forecasted GAAP profitability to arrive in fiscal 2026 faster than consensus.\n\nKupferberg flagged the increasing market expectations of three rate cuts in 2024 and four in 2025. A lower interest rate environment would be beneficial to Affirm Holdings’ funding costs and for gain on loan sales.\n\nAs per the analyst, Affirm Holdings recently moved its merchants to a 36% annual percentage rate (APR) cap on loans, up from 30% previously, which should remain a tailwind for yields and Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) growth.\n\nGiven recent share price underperformance, Kupferberg noted the fourth-quarter print could be a positive catalyst.\n\nAffirm Holdings may communicate a more bullish message on profitability while delivering fourth-quarter upside and guiding fiscal 2025 solidly in line, as per the analyst.\n\nNew Apple relationships, further scaling of Affirm Card, and potential geographic expansion of existing large partnerships like Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP) should all support fiscal 2025 and 2026 forecasts, Kupferberg added.\n\nThe analyst projected fiscal 2024 sales of $2.27 billion, fiscal 2025 sales of $2.75 billion and fiscal 2026 sales of $3.24 billion.\n\nPrice Action: AFRM shares closed trading higher by 2.31% at $27.46 on Tuesday.\n\nPhoto via Company\n\nLatest Ratings for AFRM\n\nDate Firm Action From To Feb 2022 Barclays Maintains Overweight Feb 2022 Credit Suisse Maintains Neutral Feb 2022 Jefferies Downgrades Hold Underperform\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for AFRM\n\nStory continues\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Affirm's Growth Boosted by Apple and Amazon Partnerships, Lower Interest Rates: Analyst originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "US stock futures mixed before Fed; Microsoft drops on disappointing earnings",
        "content": "Investing.com-- S&P futures were flat and Dow futures fell in evening deals on Tuesday as investors hunkered down before a decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve, while disappointing earnings from Microsoft weighed on major technology stocks.\n\nBut Nasdaq futures rose, aided by a rebound in chipmaking stocks following stronger-than-expected earnings from AMD, which showed artificial intelligence still remained an earnings driver for the sector.\n\nS&P 500 Futures steadied at 5,476.75 points, while Dow Jones Futures fell 0.4% to 40,795.0 points by 19:39 ET (23:39 GMT). Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.4% to 19,021.0 points.\n\nMicrosoft cloud revenue misses estimates despite spending increase\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell more than 3% in afterhours trade after its fourth-quarter cloud revenue growth missed Wall Street estimates. The stock had fallen as far as 7%, but pared losses after it said on an earnings call that cloud growth would accelerate in the coming quarters.\n\nWhile the firm’s overall earnings just edged past estimates for the June quarter, revenue from Azure, the company’s cloud business, grew 29%, missing estimates of 30.2% and also slowing from the 31% rise in the prior quarter. This came even as investment in AI saw capital expenditure surge by $5 billion in the quarter.\n\nAzure is Microsoft’s main platform for its AI offerings, and serves as a barometer for demand for the sector. The Redmond, Washington-based tech giant is among the frontrunners on Wall Street to monetize AI, having tied up with OpenAI to release a slew of products over the past year.\n\nMicrosoft’s earnings sparked losses across most of its heavyweight tech peers, given that they came just a week after earnings from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) showed a similar trend.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), which are set to report earnings on Wednesday, fell 1% and 0.7%, respectively, while Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which will report earnings on Thursday, fell 0.5%.\n\nChipmakers rebound on strong showing from AMD\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) surged over 8%, while rival NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) added 5.4% after AMD clocked stronger-than-expected earnings and forecast upbeat revenue for the current quarter, citing strong demand from AI.\n\nAMD’s earnings sparked gains across chipmaking stocks. But they highlighted a potential division in AI-fueled earnings- where the suppliers of AI-related equipment appeared to be faring better than their customers, especially following Microsoft’s disappointing showing.\n\nStory continues\n\nA measure of bargain buying also aided chipmakers, after heavy losses on Tuesday and over the past two weeks.\n\nWall Street nurses losses with Fed on tap\n\nWall Street indexes ended lower on Tuesday as investors pivoted from tech and into more economically sensitive sectors amid caution over the Fed and major tech earnings.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep rates steady at the conclusion of a meeting on Wednesday. But any signals on its plans to cut rates will be closely watched, as recent inflation data fueled growing conviction the Fed will begin cutting in September.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.5% to 5,436.44 points on Tuesday, while the NASDAQ Composite fell 1.3% to 17,141.98 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, rising 0.5% to 40,743.33 points.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures mixed before Fed; Microsoft drops on disappointing earnings\n\nSamsung flags strong AI demand as second-quarter profit soars on higher chip prices\n\nEarnings call: TriMas Q2 2024 results show mixed segment performance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "A union for Amazon warehouse workers elects a new leader in wake of Teamsters affiliation",
        "content": "Workers at Amazon's only unionized warehouse in the U.S. elected new union leaders, according to a vote count completed Tuesday, marking the first major change for the labor group since it established an alliance with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n\nA slate of candidates headed up by a former Amazon worker named Connor Spence received the most votes cast by employees from the warehouse located in the New York City borough of Staten Island. Although turnout was very low, Spence received enough support to lead the Amazon Labor Union as it aims to secure a contract with a company that has resisted those efforts for years.\n\nSpence, a prominent organizer with the union, more recently led a dissident group that sued the union last year to force new leadership election amid internal strife. He was fired by Amazon last year for violating a company policy that forbids workers from accessing company buildings or outdoor work areas when they’re off the clock, a policy critics say is designed to hinder organizing.\n\nOnly 5% of the 5,312 workers employed in the warehouse voted by mail-in ballot, said Arthur Schwartz, an attorney who represents the dissident group. Spence received 137 out of 247 votes cast, Schwartz said, defeating a current ALU officer named Claudia Ashterman and another prominent organizer named Michelle Valentin.\n\n“After more than two years of fighting to reform our union to make it more democratic, transparent, and militant, we are relieved to finally be able to turn our attention toward bringing Amazon to the table and winning an incredible contract,” Spence said in a statement.\n\nWorkers at the same warehouse voted overwhelmingly last month to affiliate with the Teamsters union, which agreed to provide the Amazon Labor Union, or ALU, with funding and other types of support until it negotiates a contract with Amazon and begins collecting member dues.\n\nThe affiliation agreement, a copy of which was reviewed by The Associated Press, says the ALU will be chartered as an “autonomous” local Teamsters union with the right to organize Amazon warehouse workers across New York City. The union branch, known as ALU-International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 1, also is expected to help with organizing Amazon warehouse workers elsewhere and to participate in strategy sessions.\n\n“The question is whether the outcome of the election, plus the Teamster affiliation, can create that kind of momentum needed among the rank-and-file,” said Ruth Milkman, a sociologist of labor and labor movements at the City University of New York. “But even if it does, Amazon is going to fight it tooth-and-nail.”\n\nStory continues\n\nSpence will take over the leadership role from Chris Smalls, a former Amazon worker. He spearheaded the first successful U.S. union organizing effort in the retail giant’s history in 2022, when workers at the Staten Island warehouse voted in favor of ALU representation.\n\nHowever, organizers inside the union began questioning Smalls' strategy after the group suffered two subsequent election losses in New York and withdrew a petition for a union vote in California. Some left quietly, while others joined the dissident group headed up by Spence.\n\nSmalls did not seek reelection. Instead, he backed a slate of candidates headed up by Ashterman.\n\nSince mail-in ballots were sent to workers in early July, candidates vying for leadership spots had engaged in a fierce campaign during shift breaks and in public areas near the warehouse, formally known as the JFK8 Fulfillment Center. Morning and evening campaigning also took place in front of a bus stop near the facility.\n\nOn a recent evening, Spence and some members of the dissident group erected a small tent by the bus stop and handed out heat safety literature and cold bottles of water to workers starting or ending their 10-hour shifts. Other candidates set up a table where they played music or spoke with warehouse workers waiting to go home.\n\nSome workers stood there 45 minutes or longer while watching for a shuttle bus to come, a pain point known to candidates who campaigned on acquiring or fundraising for additional shuttles.\n\nSpence said in an interview earlier this month that joint strategy sessions with the Teamsters would happen once Local 1 has new leaders. But the powerful labor union already began offering support by footing the bill for the Amazon warehouse election and providing legal aid when needed.\n\nSpence said the Teamsters offered him legal support two weeks ago when Amazon called local police to an ALU rally held near the warehouse. During the rally, which some Teamsters organizers attended, officers arrested Spence and six other participants, saying they had blocked a driveway.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis said the company had also asked non-employees to leave its property. But organizers say the demonstration was held on a patch of grass they believed to be public property and where they've previously held other rallies.\n\nSince the union's affiliation with the Teamsters, Amazon has made small changes around the warehouse, according to workers. The company, which employs methods to fend off labor unions, has installed gates around the building's parking lot and posted security guards to monitor everyone coming in and out of the lot.\n\nCompany spokesperson Paradis says Amazon took those extra steps for safety reasons and to deter trespassing incidents that have occurred in the past few weeks.\n\nAmazon continues to face worker unrest elsewhere, including in Kentucky, where employees at a large company Air Hub held a one-day strike last week in coordination with the Teamsters union. More than 100 contracted Amazon drivers in Chicago’s northern suburbs have been on strike since late June demanding higher pay and better health care plans, according to the Teamsters.\n\nBut Amazon also has scored a few wins in the past few weeks.\n\nIn mid-July, warehouse workers in Britain narrowly rejected a union bid at a facility in Coventry, a city about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of London. If successful, it would have been the first union to ever form at an Amazon warehouse in the United Kingdom.\n\nMeanwhile, last week, a Washington state judge ruled in favor of the company in a high-profile worker safety case. Regulators had alleged in the case that Amazon put employees at unnecessary risk of injuries.\n\nIn Staten Island, the ALU dissident group has been trying get warehouse workers out of their comfort zones and energized around issues such as heat safety and Juneteenth, for which Amazon doesn’t offer paid time off, Spence said.\n\nHe hopes the organizing work eventually will lead to a strike, which he thinks is the only thing that will get Amazon to the negotiating table. But, he also knows one unionized warehouse doesn’t have enough leverage.\n\n“To get them to the table, it has to be a national organizing campaign,” Spence said. “We have to identify strategic choke points, organize those warehouses and go on strike simultaneously.”\n\nSchwartz, the attorney, said the local union's new leaders will be sworn in on Wednesday.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Q3’s Rising Stars: 8 Dividend Stocks for Your Must-Watch List",
        "content": "Dividend stocks are a must-own component for any investor looking to establish serious wealth. We all know the statistic that the S&P 500 has returned 10.5% annually on average since its creation in 1957. It is one of the reasons the index is considered the benchmark against which we should compare our portfolios.\n\nWhat’s not as well known is that over the past 60 years, dividends have made up 85% of the index’s total return. Without dividend stocks and the reinvestment of those payouts, the S&P 500 would offer meager gains.\n\nAs a dividend growth investor, I’m looking to juice my returns even more. I want to see the dividend stocks I own grow their payouts over time, often by double-digit percentages. What follows is a list of top dividend stocks to watch. They are companies that have a strong history of rewarding shareholders by ever-increasing amounts. Not all will be increasing their payouts by 10% or more, but many do. All of them deserve a place on your watch list for the third quarter to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAutomatic Data Processing (ADP) In this photo illustration the stock market information of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. displays on a smartphone with the logo of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP stock.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock\n\nPayroll processor Automatic Data Processing (NYSE:ADP) is the first dividend stock to watch. Hardly a hidden gem, it is more a diamond in the rough since many investors ignore it because it is so ubiquitous.\n\nFounded in 1949 and going public 12 years later, ADP has a long history of paying its shareholders a dividend. It made its first quarterly payment in 1974 and has reliably raised the payout for 49 consecutive years. It is about to become a Dividend King, or a stock that has raised its dividend for 50 years or more. The payout yields 2% annually.\n\nMore remarkable is that the payroll leader has been increasing the payment at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 11% annually for the past decade. Because its business throws off so much cash it can reward shareholders over time. ADP generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow (FCF) last year while paying out $1.9 billion in dividends. Its free cash flow payout ratio of 52% means the dividend is safe, well-supported and has plenty of room for future growth.\n\nADP stock is up only 8% so far in 2024. With Wall Street forecasting earnings growth of 10% annually for the next five years, it makes it a great time to buy the stock.\n\nWendy’s (WEN) a Wendy's (WEN stock) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nFast-food chain Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) is probably more of a surprise as a rising dividend star. The burger joint began paying dividends 20 years ago and has raised the payout at a whopping 17% CAGR for the last 10 years. It is even better in more recent periods with the quick-serve restaurant growing its dividend at 19% a year for the last five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nWendy’s payout is also well-supported as it generates substantial FCF. Cash profits have grown 10% annually over the last decade and at a rate exceeding 21% a year for the past five years. While its FCF payout ratio is on the high side at 80%, it does show there are sufficient profits to keep making payments. The dividend yield 6% annually.\n\nThe quick-serve restaurant has bolstered its business fundamentals, too. It improved its menu through innovation and the launch of breakfast options. Store remodels and positioning itself as a value meal destination have helped make it a favorite destination for customers. That’s evident in stable same-restaurant sales growth.\n\nOften overshadowed by rivals McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and Burger King, Wendy’s stock earns its place on your watch list.\n\nAflac (AFL) the Aflac (AFL) logo on an office building\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nLife insurance giant Aflac (NYSE:AFL) deserves a seat at the table. Hurt by the pandemic and the wave of claims that ensued, Aflac has worked diligently to build up its bottom line again. Notably, the global health crisis did not impact its dividend. The insurer continued making its payout through the turmoil, adding to its 41-year history of making and raising its dividend payment.\n\nAlthough increases slowed during that period, for the last five years it has hiked its dividend by 13% a year. It also sports a low FCF payout ratio of just 30%, meaning it has plenty of opportunity to raise the dividend by substantial amounts. The dividend yields 2.1% annually.\n\nLike death and taxes, life insurance will always be with us and will protect our financial security from at least one of those eventualities. This benefits Aflac with a reliable, steady stream of profitable revenue.\n\nWith claim costs falling, new products added and the past few years of strong net interest income due to the high interest rate environment, Aflac is on a firm financial foundation and a dividend stock to watch.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarehouse club Costco (NASDAQ:COST) has been a tremendous dividend stock to own that has grown its payout at double-digit rates. The retailer’s dividend has expanded at a 13% CAGR over the last five- and 10-year periods, but it has a 20-year track record of raising the payout. The retailer’s dividend yields only 0.6% annually. Yet, if you only focus on that, you miss the bigger picture.\n\nCostco’s dividend has grown from $1.21 per share in 2013 to $4.64 per share today. More rewarding is the fact that Costco often rewards shareholders with a special dividend payment. Last December it announced a $15 per share dividend payment for investors and has made similar extra payments in 2012, 2015, 2017 and 2020 for varying amounts.\n\nThe warehouse club is able to grow and support its dividend because it is a profit-producing machine. Earnings over the last five years are up 88% and they’ve more than tripled over the past decade. The stock itself is up 48% over the last 12 months.\n\nAlthough shares pulled back 9% after it raised its membership fees for the first time in seven years, that represents an opportunity for shareholders. Those extra revenues will flow straight through to the bottom line.\n\nRTX (RTX) Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nDefense contractor RTX (NYSE:RTX) will deliver some offense to your portfolio. Shares are up 37% this year as demand for weapons systems grows. It manufactures numerous defense systems but missile systems are one of its primary outputs.\n\nIn its just reported second-quarter earnings, its Raytheon division saw a 4% increase in adjusted sales to $6.5 billion. Patriot and Stinger missile systems, along with anti-drone systems, helped lift the total. Raytheon accounts for one-third of total revenue.\n\nHowever, Collins Aerospace could quickly become RTX’s crown jewel. The commercial aviation business saw sales rise 10% with operating profits surging 24% year-over-year. It could see sustained growth in the years ahead as the commercial aerospace manufacturing sector grows.\n\nRTX pays a dividend of $2.52 that yields 2.2% annually. It has paid a dividend every year since 1936 and has raised it for 30 consecutive years. So, this rising star should be on your watchlist.\n\nAmerican Tower (AMT) American Tower Corporation logo on a smartphone with the website in the background on a computer screen. AMT stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nSpecialty real estate investment trust (REIT) American Tower (NYSE:AMT) leases cellular towers to wireless service providers, and radio and television broadcast companies under long-term leases. More recently it expanded into data centers where it owns 28 facilities.\n\nAmerican Tower is the biggest owner-operator of towers with over 224,000 communications sites globally. In the U.S., Statista says there are 129 companies that own towers. Yet, 75% of them belong to just three companies, and AMT is the largest, owning one-third of them. Other analysts suggest American Tower has a 63% market share.\n\nThat’s important for American Tower’s future growth as mobile communications rapidly expand. More and better coverage will be insisted upon by wireless carrier customers.\n\nAMT has raised its dividend by more than 16% annually for the last 10 years while growing FCF at a 12% CAGR. Over the last five years, FCF has grown nearly 18% annually. It makes the specialty REIT a dividend stock to watch.\n\nDick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) An image of a Dick's Sporting Goods retail location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors hit a home run with Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS). The sporting goods retailer stock is up 45% in 2024, has doubled over the past three years and is up nearly 460% over the last five. Equally impressive are its dividend stats.\n\nOver the past decade, DKS has increased its payout by a 24% CAGR, but in the last five years that has swelled to almost 32%. As FCF growth has kept pace, the sporting goods retailer has a low 32% FCF payout ratio.\n\nWhile consumers can buy their sporting goods equipment and apparel from any number of retailers, online or off, they have increasingly chosen Dick’s as the place to shop. As the largest pure-play sporting goods retailer, it benefits from having everything under one roof. With strong partners like Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY), Dick’s can meet the current trends in sports and athleisure fashion.\n\nIt might not have much of a competitive moat, but Dick’s Sporting Goods has exploited its position to good effect. It is why the retailer is a top dividend stock to watch.\n\nJPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) the word \"etf\" spelled out in many yellow cubes against a background of many black cubes\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Imagentle\n\nFor investors who might want broad coverage and not go through the process of buying individual stocks, exchange-traded fund (ETF) JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI) is one to consider. It pays its dividends monthly and offers a rich 6.5% yield.\n\nJEPI, as the ETF is known, seeks to deliver income by both investing in large cap stocks and trading options. It wants most of its returns to be associated with the S&P 500 index but with less volatility. Its top three holdings are Progressive (NYSE:PGR), TraneTechnologies (NYSE:TT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Yet if you look over its biggest positions, you notice they are not exactly high-yielding stocks. So how does JEPI generate such big yields?\n\nIt does so by investing up to 20% of its portfolio into equity-linked notes (ELN), essentially an advanced covered call option. JEPI collects premiums from buyers of those options. So, most of the dividends JEPI pays are from those premiums. The ETF tends to perform better during volatile market periods, especially down markets. It can often serve as a hedge for such times.\n\nYet the ETF is not for everyone. Because of the ELNs, a portion of its dividend payments are taxable, meaning JEPI is best held in a tax-deferred account. This ultra-high-yield stock may be best for those about to retire or who are retired and looking for immediate dividend income. But it is still a dividend stock to watch.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in RTX stock.

        "content": "Amazon Q2 Earnings Preview: Gains From eCommerce and Cloud Business, Operating Margin Upside On Analysts Radar\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a price target of $250, up from $225.\n\nSheridan previewed Amazon’s upcoming second-quarter operating results and increased his above-Street 2025 GAAP operating income estimate (now +8% above) as he noted a margin upside.\n\nThree central investor debates are heading into earnings, and according to the analyst, they are likely to drive incremental share price performance.\n\nBased on various industry checks, Sheridan said Amazon’s eCommerce business remained strong in the second quarter.\n\nThe analyst flagged Amazon’s ability to continue producing operating income margin upside.\n\nSheridan noted the potential for outperformance in 2025 driven by higher retail margins & a stronger contribution of advertising and also maintained a positive long-term view on international margins and expects AWS profitability to remain robust.\n\nSheridan also highlighted the trajectory of AWS revenue growth. The analyst expects reacceleration through 2024 as prior headwinds around optimization and workload migration turn into tailwinds, and AI workloads are a rising tailwind.\n\nSheridan noted room for retail margins to continue expanding, driven by operating leverage on fixed retail assets, continued progress on lowering costs, a more moderate rate of inflation of important input costs, and the high-margin contribution of growing revenue streams.\n\nThe analyst expects the growing scale of Amazon’s advertising efforts to be an additional tailwind to reported consolidated operating income margins.\n\nSheridan projected fiscal 2024 revenue and operating income of $633.89 billion and $64.48 billion. The analyst expects fiscal 2025 revenue and operating income of $697.93 billion and $82.76 billion.\n\nRBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson reiterated an Outperform rating on Amazon with a price target of $215.\n\nCommentary from RBC’s early July off-quarter software bus tour suggested that Amazon’s GPU activity had improved through the quarter, which was encouraging, and Erickson expects management’s broader AI commentary to remain bullish, though with commentary likely to stay only qualitative.\n\nMedia reports emerged throughout the quarter regarding Amazon shifting its orders with Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) to its next-gen chips. This could now be somewhat delayed until the impact there is decided. The bottom line is that Erickson expects the company’s steady reacceleration to continue pushing back against some type of a more dire share loss thesis as a function of AI.\n\nErickson expects the #2 and #3 players’ growth to continue outpacing but also remain focused if and as AWS gets back to the most considerable marginal dollar growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nSheridan projected fiscal 2024 revenue and operating income of $630.51 billion and $60.41 billion. The analyst expects fiscal 2025 revenue and operating income of $696.18 billion and $77.1 billion.\n\nPrice Action: AMZN shares traded lower by 1.12% to $181.16 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nPhoto by ANIRUDH on Unsplash\n\nLatest Ratings for AMZN\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Deutsche Bank Initiates Coverage On Buy Feb 2022 Tigress Financial Maintains Buy Feb 2022 Credit Suisse Maintains Outperform\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for AMZN\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAMAZON.COM (AMZN): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Amazon Q2 Earnings Preview: Gains From eCommerce and Cloud Business, Operating Margin Upside On Analysts Radar originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Amazon’s hugely beneficial product-safety loophole just evaporated",
        "content": "For all of Amazon’s technological innovations, the tech giant has also excelled at exploiting loopholes during its history. In its early years, that meant taking advantage of tax laws that allowed online retailers to avoid collecting, and thus charging, sales tax, which created a pricing advantage over traditional retail shops.\n\nAs a publicly traded company, Amazon convinced investors from early on to let it play by a unique set of rules: Reward us for revenue growth now and we promise the profits will follow at some point in the future.\n\nBut a significant one related to product liability may have just evaporated.\n\nMuch of Amazon’s retail success has been predicated on a structure where it acts as both a retailer that purchases and resells goods itself, as well as a marketplace that allows independent merchants to list items to be sold to Amazon customers. The marketplace model has been crucial to Amazon’s success, creating massive selection and price competition that now accounts for some 60% of all goods sold through the shopping site. Amazon also generated $140 billion in revenue in the form of fees from its marketplace sellers in 2023 alone.\n\nThat massive selection, however, has historically come with downsides that may include not as much vetting of a product as a traditional retailer might do. Case in point: The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) found a few years back that more than 400,000 items sold through Amazon’s third-party marketplace posed a significant product hazard, including faulty carbon monoxide detectors, hair dryers that lacked electrocution protection, and kids’ pajamas that did not meet federal flammability standards.\n\nThese items were offered by merchants through an Amazon program known as Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA, whereby Amazon handles the storage, packing, shipping, and customer service for an order.\n\nIn the wake of that finding, Amazon did credit customer accounts and inform them that a product they bought “may” cause harm but, at the same time, the tech giant fought the commission’s claim that it was legally responsible for the recall of the items as a “distributor” of the goods. Instead, Amazon said it was acting solely as a logistics provider.\n\nToday, however, the CPSC announced a unanimous ruling dismissing that argument, making Amazon legally responsible for product safety recalls as a “distributor” due to the holistic role it plays in the sale of goods through its FBA program.\n\nThe agency also ruled that Amazon downplayed the severity of the risks of these products in its communication to customers and should have to incentivize buyers to either return or dispose of the faulty products to avoid them being used.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the short term, the ruling means that Amazon must now submit a proposal to the commission on how it will notify customers and the public about the product hazards, and to provide refunds or replacements for these products. The commission will then consider the plans and rule on them.\n\nIn the long term, however, such a ruling of Amazon as a “distributor” through its marketplace business could have a profound impact on how the tech giant expands and monitors the business.\n\nJason Del Rey\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet?

        "title": "Google’s antitrust defense could benefit from the threat of SearchGPT",
        "content": "The new risk Google faces from AI challengers could play a role in the ultimate outcome of a landmark antitrust trial where a judge must decide whether the tech giant illegally monopolized online search.\n\nThe trial, brought by the Justice Department and a group of US states, centers on the government’s argument that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) illegally blocked rivals from competing. Google claims it came to dominate search because its service was better.\n\nBut even as the company waits for a ruling from US District Court Judge Amit Mehta, fresh threats to its preeminence are emerging via new ways of searching the web.\n\nThese threats could improve Google’s odds of lessening any consequences if Judge Mehta does find it liable for breaking competition law, according to antitrust experts.\n\n\"If a violation is found, Google will say the market is already solving itself,\" George Washington University antitrust law professor William Kovacic said. Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai departs federal court last October in Washington DC, after testifying in the antitrust case against his company. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nJust last week Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI debuted a new prototype search engine called SearchGPT and positioned it as a new means of searching the web — a potential threat to Google's long-standing search dominance.\n\nMicrosoft's Bing also has generative AI features powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT, as well as its Copilot and Prometheus software.\n\nGoogle, for its part, offers generative AI capabilities in its AI Overviews — its latest search product powered by its Gemini model. The company also offers its LaMDA, T5, PaLM, and GLaM models. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. His company debuted a new prototype search engine called SearchGPT and positioned it as a new means of searching the web. (Photo by Jason Redmond / AFP) (Photo by JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) (JASON REDMOND via Getty Images)\n\nOther new ways of searching the web are offered by AI-fueled large language models (LLMs), like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, introduced in November 2022, and Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine designed using multiple LLMs that attracted major funding from Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang.\n\n'Market developments are already solving the problems'\n\nNew search options won't necessarily help Google's defense of its past behavior, but they could significantly soften a punishment if the US government and states prevail in their antitrust trial.\n\nThat's because Google would have an opening to argue during a separate phase of the trial that any anticompetitive problems identified in the complaint no longer exist, or have dwindled.\n\nThe argument Google can make to the judge is \"'you don’t have to do a lot here, because the development of new products, new technology, the emergence of competitive alternatives means that market developments are already solving the problems identified,'\" Kovacic said.\n\nStory continues\n\nBakerHostetler’s antitrust and competition practice leader, Carl Hittinger, agreed that market changes that open up more options for consumers could work in Google's favor. Amit Mehta, left, acting as an attorney before the New York State Supreme Court in 2012. He now is the judge overseeing the Google antitrust case. Photo: DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images) (DON EMMERT via Getty Images)\n\n\"If consumers move over to another product, if they have that option and they can, then there's no anticompetitive harm there,\" Hittinger said.\n\nOn the other hand, the judge may not view SearchGPT and emerging search platforms as direct Google Search competitors since, for now, those products are not pre-installed as defaults across a variety of devices.\n\nOne of the key factors for the judge to consider in crafting a remedy, Hittinger said, is what's in the public interest.\n\n'It's an awesome responsibilty'\n\nThe government has yet to say what precise remedy it desires should it prevail.\n\nRemedies can include injunctive relief, such as controls on a company's future conduct, or structural relief, like requiring divestitures.\n\nFederal rules also allow Google to ask Judge Mehta to reopen the case, prior to his decision, in order to consider new material evidence. And even if an injunction is issued, new and material evidence can be brought into court to request that it be amended.\n\nIf Google is found liable, it is expected to appeal the case. That could come with a request from Google to table the remedies phase until the case has made its way through the appellate system.\n\nKovacic predicted that the governments will prevail on at least some of their claims, and said no matter what the outcome, Judge Mehta's decision is consequential.\n\n\"You can imagine how hard of an issue this is for the court,\" Kovacic said. \"Holding the fate of the entire search sector — it's an awesome responsibility.\"\n\nThe Google antitrust trial is the most prominent since another landmark case in the 1990s that eventually forced Microsoft (MSFT) into a settlement that opened its computer operating system to competitors in the early 2000s. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates pictured in 2001, the year his company agreed on the framework for a settlement in the government's marathon antitrust case against the software giant. Photo by HENNY RAY ABRAMS/AFP via Getty Images (HENNY RAY ABRAMS via Getty Images)\n\n'The landscape changes'\n\nIt remains to be seen what the antitrust trial and new rivals in the search business will mean for Google and its parent, Alphabet.\n\nCertainly a lot is at stake. In 2023, Google's search advertising business generated more than $175 billion in revenue.\n\nCoupled with Google's YouTube ads and Google network revenue, advertising accounted for a staggering $237 billion of the company's $307 billion in total revenue.\n\nBut the new marketplace threats to Google’s search empire still have a ways to go to unseat the leader.\n\nSo far, LLMs and rival search platforms haven’t radically changed how most internet users search the web. Bing gained about 1% of the search market share since the launch of Copilot, but Google still holds more than 90% of it.\n\nHittinger, who represented AT&T in another landmark antitrust case that ended in a breakup of the telecommunications giant in the 1980s, said changes in technology tend to impact difficult antitrust cases.\n\n\"While you're deciding the case, the world moves on and the landscape changes,\" he said.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

It ordered Amazon to come up with a system for notifying customers who purchased faulty items and to remove the products from circulation by offering incentives for their return or destruction.\n\nOverall, Amazon accounts for roughly 40% of e-commerce sales in the U.S., according to the market research firm Emarketer. The company sells many items directly to consumers and also partners with nearly 2 million third-party sellers, who drive the majority of the sales on the platform.\n\nThe online retailer has fought the “distributor” label since 2021, when the Consumer Product Safety Commission filed an administrative complaint against the company for distributing hazardous items.\n\nAmazon argued before an administrative law judge and the five-person commission that it shouldn’t be classified as a distributor under the Consumer Product Safety Act. The commission said the judge rejected the company's argument, and Tuesday’s order was an affirmation of that decision.\n\nAccording to the commission, Amazon failed to notify consumers about hazardous items and “did not take adequate steps to encourage” customers to return or destroy them, leaving them at risk of injury.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is often considered a reference stock for the technology sector, being one of the two largest stocks by market cap along with Nvidia (NVDA) (they have been swapping places over the last few weeks). Despite exceeding a whopping $3 trillion market capitalization and sitting at the top of the market, the company has exciting days ahead with double-digit growth thanks to the quality of its cloud business and its ability to incorporate artificial intelligence in all major business units and customer solutions.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MSFT. List of 52-Week Lows List of 3-Year Lows List of 5-Year Lows Supported by Cloud, AI Units, Microsoft Is on a Path of High Growth\n\nDecentralized structure is main growth engine\n\nStock analysts often highlight the products of Microsoft when referring to its growth. The company's growth potential is, however, rooted in its organization and not in specific products like Azure or Copilot.\n\nMicrosoft is a very large corporation with a complex structure. If I had to compare it to an animal, it would be the octopus as the company has three primary arms that have a number of subdivisions under each, which support the overall company. The main divisions are Intelligent Cloud (including the high-growth Azure unit), Personal Computing (including Windows and Gaming, which holds the recently acquired Activision Blizzard subsidiary) and Productivity & Business Processes, which encompasses all the corporate solutions (Teams, Skype, Outlook, etc.). Supported by Cloud, AI Units, Microsoft Is on a Path of High Growth\n\nSource: Lexchart\n\nOne of the reasons I believe the company will continue to grow is there will always be a business unit (or several) that will fuel the overall growth of the company. The highly decentralized structure has been in the DNA of the company since the years of Bill Gates (Trades, Portfolio), and seemingly encouraged by current CEO Satya Nadella. Autonomy of business units leads to innovation and ultimately consistent growth of the overall company, independently of potential market cycle and trend shifts.These units power Microsoft's growth engine\n\nMicrosoft's current growth catalyst is Intelligent Cloud, in particular its cloud solution Azure. The company managed to implement AI technology into the software to create rapid and custom-built solutions for its customers. According to the earnings report released on April 25, the Intelligent Cloud has been the fastest-growing business unit with 21% year-over-year revenue growth, second only to Xbox's 62% growth, of which 61% is a net impact of the Activision acquisition.\n\nWithin the Intelligent Cloud segment, server products and cloud services (which includes Azure) grew 24%. This growth rate is well above Amazon Web Services' 17% growth, showing the software is catching up. Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS is still in first place with 31% market share, but Azure is trailing close behind with 24% market share.\n\nStory continues Supported by Cloud, AI Units, Microsoft Is on a Path of High Growth\n\nSource: Mordor Intelligence\n\nThe company is likely to continue outperforming its competitors, particularly AWS, given it is a few steps ahead in terms of AI relative to Amazon. Being the main investor in OpenAI (Microsoft invested around $13 billion) helped and will continue to help it stay ahead of competition in terms of AI, with perhaps the only serious threat being Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Despite the competition, the space is large enough for all these companies to continue on a path of growth. Indeed, the cloud computing market is expected to grow at a 16.40% compounded annual rate in the next five years. Therefore, given Azure's AI capabilities and backing by other business units of Microsoft, it is not unreasonable to assume continued growth above 20%.\n\nFinancials\n\nMicrosoft's financials are solid and enviable. Its balance sheet is pristine. Despite the $68.70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard to boost its stagnant Gaming & Personal Computing segment, the company still has $80 billion in cash on hand, which is sufficient for another large acquisition. Its total debt amounts to $106 billion and with $70 billion of expected free cash flow it would generate in 2024, the company could easily repay all of its debt in a hypothetical scenario. Supported by Cloud, AI Units, Microsoft Is on a Path of High Growth\n\nFurther, free cash flow continues to trend higher year after year. Free cash flow is an indicator that is appreciated by investors as it shows the ability of a company to efficiently manage its business. Rising free cash flow is also an excellent indicator for the coming years; the cash generated by the company can support acquisitions and investments into the business that will in turn trigger new growth catalysts (i.e., investment in OpenAI, acquisition of Activision).\n\nFree cash flow is also a reassurance for shareholders as an uptrend also increases the likelihood of cash returned to investors in the form of share buybacks. Microsoft already returned $8.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends in the last quarter, according to its latest earnings report. The dividend yield is rather low (0.67%) - in part due to fast-paced stock price growth - but the dividend payments have been rising consecutively for 19 years. Supported by Cloud, AI Units, Microsoft Is on a Path of High Growth\n\nRevenue has been growing at an average rate of 14% over the last five years. Its return on capital averaged 30% per year and its earnings margin averaged 40% in the same period, which altogether further confirm the business is efficiently managed and the cash it generates continues to support and fuel its growth.\n\nValuation\n\nAt first glance, the stock may appear slightly overvalued. It is trading at 23 times last 12 months earnings and 27 times forward earnings, which puts it on the higher range of its historical valuation. However, it is important to note Microsoft's valuation has been on the rise since the Global Financial Crisis, with earnings multiples expanding. This is typical of companies that show sustained high growth, and it is likely that the multiples will continue expanding in the coming years. Supported by Cloud, AI Units, Microsoft Is on a Path of High Growth\n\nFrom a pure multiple perspective, the stock may indeed not be undervalued, as shown by the GF Value chart above.\n\nBut when computing the valuation via a discounted cash flow model, we can see the stock may actually be undervalued by approximately 20% to 25%. For the calculation, I used the actual total earnings per share in the last 12 months and a (very) conservative 7.50% growth rate for earnings per share. This gave me a stock value of $496 per share. Interestingly, this is in line with Citi analyst Tyler Radke's initial price target ($495) before he hiked it to $520, citing recent media reports in relation to OpenAI's doubled annualized revenue and Microsoft's cloud deal with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).\n\nMain risk factor to my case\n\nIn the technology sector, the main threat is always obsolescence, which is rooted in lack of innovation and results in the competition overtaking it. Especially for large and successful companies, staying at the top for decades is particularly hard. This requires consistency in the management team. There is one large exception here, however: the company's octopus-like structure and continued investments in distinct business units. These numerous tentacles of innovation and growth allow Microsoft to remain one of the top-performing companies and to minimize any adverse impacts when one or even multiple business units are struggling.\n\nBottom line\n\nDespite having reached an impressive market cap, Microsoft still has wonderful years ahead of double-digit growth. Artificial intelligence is yet another tailwind that is already boosting its cloud business and putting the company as one of the likely AI leaders.\n\nIts direct exposure to OpenAI additionally increases the likelihood of Microsoft staying ahead of the competition in the sphere of generative AI. Its structure ensures innovation and finds new growth catalysts in a rapidly changing technological landscape. The stock is attractively valued and represents a buying opportunity for long-term tech-focused or diversified investment portfolios.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Whole Foods Market’s 46-year-old CEO works out twice a day and ‘fully uses up’ his PTO. His keys to work-life balance",
        "content": "The CEO of Whole Foods Market doesn’t believe in skimping on PTO.\n\nJason Buechel, 46, took the top job in 2022, just five years after Amazon bought the high-end grocer for over $13.7 billion.\n\nAs chief executive, Buechel works on a tight schedule consisting of frequent business travel and a “minimum of ten meetings per day”—but that doesn’t stop him from taking care of himself. Buechel loves to travel internationally and has a trip to Europe later this year.\n\n“I highly prioritize PTO,” Buechel tells Fortune in a recent interview. “So I do use all of my allocation each year.”\n\nWhole Foods Market’s team members accrue PTO based on seniority and years spent at the company, but regardless of how many vacation days one has, Buechel emphasizes using all of it to “replenish, relax, and unwind.”\n\n“It’s one of the things we’ve changed within Whole Foods Market,” Buechel says, referring to the company’s previous PTO policy which allowed employees to cash out their unused vacation hours.\n\nBut the scheme often ended with employees opting out of their hard-earned time off, which Buechel believes can be detrimental to one’s mental health. Under a Whole Foods Reddit thread, one employee calculated that one team member was bound to earn up to $26,000 due to 2,000 unused PTO hours.\n\nTo ensure staff are taking vacations away from work, Whole Foods Market’s new policy places a cap on how many hours can be banked, which Buechel argues “really forces people to make sure they are taking PTO…and ultimately having a great work-life balance.”\n\nSkimping on taking PTO is a trend seen across corporate America. A 2023 survey by CalendarLabs found that 80% of employees felt guilty about taking PTO and 38% of U.S. workers did not use all their time off.\n\nBuechel is bucking the trend and makes a point to “always ask” his team members about what they’ve planned for their next vacation.\n\n“I think it's important for me to help set that example,” he says. This principle helps Buechel lead a balanced life, and he gave Fortune an exclusive look into his daily routine and wellness habits.\n\nWhole Foods Market CEO’s daily routine\n\n6:00 a.m.: After waking up “no later than” 6 a.m., Buechel does what most of us are guilty of.\n\n“First thing I'm typically doing is, I hate to say it, I'm checking my phone,” he tells Fortune.\n\nAfter skimming through his email inbox, he ventures out on a morning run that averages around five to six miles. The Whole Foods CEO has run six marathons.\n\nThe Whole Foods chief, who has also completed six marathons, “loves” finishing his workouts with a smoothie breakfast consisting of mushroom, vegan, and vanilla protein powder, plus oatmeal, bananas, peanut butter, and chia seeds.\n\nStory continues Buechel \"loves\" to finish his workouts with having a smoothie.\n\n8:00 a.m.: Work begins with attending to more emails, catching up on news, or listening to a podcast while he gets ready to commute to Whole Foods Market’s headquarters in Austin, Texas. Buechel says he has a \"minimum\" of ten meetings per day.\n\nA lunch of “whole foods”\n\nBeing the CEO of one of the biggest grocery stores in the country comes with its perks.\n\n“I happen to work above one of the best places to eat in Austin, which is our flagship store,” says Buechel, which makes it easy for him to walk down and pick his own lunch from the grocer’s lavish salad bar. Jason Buechel getting lunch from Whole Foods' salad bar.\n\n“I really care about what I'm putting in my body,” he tells Fortune, noting that he typically eats a vegan diet for breakfast and lunch. “I ultimately see the impacts of how it impacts my performance, my happiness, my well-being, and even my sleep.”\n\n6:00 p.m.: Buechel wraps up work by 6 p.m., unwinding with a second workout session at the gym or a simple walk to “stay active,” followed by a second round of grocery shopping at Whole Foods to prep for a dinner consisting of animal proteins.\n\n12:00 a.m.: To ensure “a solid six hours” of sleep, Buechel hits the hay no later than midnight, just after reading a book in bed.\n\nSaunas and plunges\n\nLike many CEOs who swear by the benefits of cold plunges, Buechel also touts a “great protocol hack” he started doing several years ago: 30 minutes of infrared sauna followed by two to three rounds of alternating three-minute cold and hot plunges, ending with a cold plunge.\n\n“While the cold is definitely painful while you're doing it,” says Buechel, “your body feels amazing afterward.”\n\nAn “enriched life” Jason Buechel hiking with friends.\n\nWhen Buechel is not working, he’s traveling, hiking, doing outdoor challenges with friends, watching sports, or enjoying Austin’s live music scene. “I look at it as having an enriched life,” he tells Fortune.\n\n“For me, it's making sure I always have time to unplug and that I'm taking care of myself.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "My Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Just Proved Again Why It's the Best Buy of the Group",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" has been a dominant group in the market over the past few years. It's made up of:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nMy top Magnificent Seven stock to buy just reported its latest results, and they were outstanding. However, the market didn't reward the stock, and it's down alongside the rest of the group. Is this a buying opportunity for one of the best stocks on Wall Street? I think so.\n\nAlphabet's business is rising steadily\n\nMy favorite stock in the Magnificent Seven right now is Alphabet. Over the past year, Alphabet has posted some excellent results and is starting to perfect its artificial intelligence (AI) product offering.Additionally, its advertising segment (which accounts for around three-fourths of all revenue) is doing well for how mature the business segment is. In the second quarter, sales rose 11% year over year to $64.6 billion. W\n\nWhile some investors may be concerned that this growth isn't nearly as quick as it needs to be for Alphabet to stand out, I don't view it that way. Alphabet's ad segment is a reliable business that creates massive cash flows for the company, allowing it to invest in next-generation technology like AI. It also funds the growth of another vital segment: Google Cloud.\n\nGoogle Cloud is the smallest of the big three cloud computing players. This size disadvantage can be traced back to Google's late entry into this market, but it's still growing quickly. In Q2, revenue grew 29% year over year to $10.3 billion. It also posted an operating margin of 11%, which is still far behind what industry leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) delivered in the first quarter with a 38% margin. Once Google Cloud reaches scale and improves its operating margin to similar levels, this segment will provide a meaningful profit boost, although that is still some years away.\n\nAltogether, Alphabet's quarter was solid, with revenue growing 14% year over year and earnings per share (EPS) rising from $1.44 to $1.89. It was hard to find a fault in the quarter, but it was also difficult to find a \"wow\" moment.\n\nThe stock fell 5% the day after trading, dragging the rest of the market down with it. But I think this pullback is a mistake and provides investors with an opportunity to get into the stock, now that it's down around 10% from its highs.\n\nUnlike its peers, the stock doesn't have an expensive premium\n\nFor the most part, the Magnificent Seven stocks are incredibly pricey when compared to the broader market. However, Alphabet doesn't have the same premium, so investors don't have as much risk on the table by investing in Alphabet. After the pullback, Alphabet's stock trades for 23 times forward earnings.\n\nStory continues GOOG PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile that only retraces its valuation to a few months ago, it prices it in the vicinity of the broader S&P 500 index, which trades at 22.7 times forward earnings. When you buy Alphabet stock at these levels, you're essentially buying an above-average company for a market-average price. That's a great deal, and investors should take advantage of it.\n\nThrough Alphabet's consistent revenue growth, expanding dividend, and aggressive share repurchase programs (Alphabet repurchased over $15 billion in stock during Q2), it's a shoo-in for a company that can grow earnings faster than 10% annualized. That's a fantastic investment proposition, and it's one that investors need to understand.\n\nYou don't have to hit a home run every time you invest. Sometimes, the steady growers that can outperform the market by a couple of percentage points each year are the best investments, and I think Alphabet falls into this category.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

For different reasons, of course.\n\nThere are, for instance, cloud stocks that have become overvalued, even when accounting for expected growth. “Priced for perfection,” just the slightest bit of disappointment could send them lower. Alongside this, there are also cloud stocks that already experienced sharp price declines, but are at risk of a further drop. Largely, because the issues driving their initial fall from grace are likely to persist.\n\nTo top things off, there are also cloud stocks, once super hot, that in recent years have become a bit of a “value trap.” With all of this in mind, let’s dive in, to find out about the top cloud stocks to sell right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s no surprise that CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) makes it to the top of this list. As you likely know, CrowdStrike is the company that recently experienced a software glitch that in turn resulted in what’s being called the largest IT outage in history.\n\nCRWD stock sank by more than 11% on the day of the incident. Shares in the cloud-based cybersecurity company have since continued to decline. Despite growing hopes that the “worst is now priced-in,” it may be far too soon to jump to that conclusion. CRWD remains richly-priced at 64.2 times forward earnings. It’s possible that investors have not quite yet taken into account the uncertain impact of this incident on future growth.\n\nCrowdstrike is scheduled to next report earnings late next month. With this, another big price decline may be just around the corner. Either the company’s updates to guidance, if indicating worse-than-feared changes to future growth due to the outage, cause shares to fall. Or, with investors still holding a bearish, fearsome view of the stock, the market latches onto the more negative aspects of an overwise mixed or positive earnings release, using it as justification to drive a post-earnings sell-off.\n\nDigitalOcean Holdings (DOCN) A laptop screen displays the logo for DigitalOcean (DOCN).\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the surface, DigitalOcean Holdings (NYSE:DOCN) may not look like it’s one of the top cloud stocks to sell. After all, shares in this cloud infrastructure company trade at a relatively low 19.6 times forward earnings. If growth in the coming quarters meets or beats expectations, it could dramatically improve investor sentiment for shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis in turn may result in a massive re-rating for DOCN stock, which is down over 75% from its all-time high of $130.26 per share. A turnaround and better-than-feared results could in theory make DOCN a comeback kid. Unfortunately, the chances of a such a comeback taking shape may be far too slim to justify the risk of taking a speculative stake in this once-popular tech stock. A big reason for this has to do with competition.\n\nAs Seeking Alpha commentator DT Invest noted back in May, DigitialOcean competes directly with cloud behemoths like Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. Even if these larger, Magnificent Seven backed platforms fail to muscle DigitalOcean out of business, this factor could limit the extent of future growth. Further concerns about DOCN’s prospects may lead to a further de-rating.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nPreviously, I have been skeptical about IBM’s (NYSE:IBM) potential to experience a growth resurgence thanks to the generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) growth trend. Even as shares in the legendary tech company have bounced back after giving back some “AI mania” gains during May, this continues to be my view.\n\nIBM’s recent quarterly earnings beat has been taken to be a sign that the company is indeed experiencing an AI and cloud-driven growth renaissance. However, many analysts have noted that the latest results and guidance were largely mixed in nature. With IBM stock continuing to climb towards its prior highs following the earnings release, shares may once again be “priced for perfection.”\n\nDon’t get me wrong. Upcoming tech earnings releases could drive a broad sector rally. If this happens, IBM may not be at risk of an immediate correction. Still, with expectations once again elevated, the next round of uncertainty and doubt about GenAI could lead to a dramatic reversal for shares. Whether you bought it at the beginning of the AI boom, or scooped up a position during its mid-spring dip, now may be the time to take the money and run with “Big Blue.”\n\nMonday.com (MNDY) Monday.com (MNDY) logo displayed on smartphone held by two hands\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/monticello\n\nMonday.com (NASDAQ:MNDY), a provider of cloud-based workflow software, has been making a steady recovery over the past year. While far from past highs hit during just before the 2022 tech stock sell-off, following MNDY’s partial recovery, shares have climbed back up to a staggering-high forward valuation.\n\nAt current prices, MNDY stock trades at forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 101. That’s quite high, any way you slice it. Although a rich valuation can persist, if bullish sentiment continues, there’s a potential negative catalyst that could drive a sentiment shift. In turn, resulting in a painful price correction. As Hedgeye analyst Andrew Freedman noted in June, Monday.com’s recent subscription price hike could lead to increased churn. These increases may also hurt new customer growth.\n\nFreedman believes this factor could drive an up to 30% price decline within 9-12 months, but a sharp pullback could potentially arrive even sooner. With the company set to next results before the market opens on August 12, on that date disappointment with results and guidance could possibly lead to a post-earnings sell-off. Hence, consider MNDY one of the cloud stocks to sell, pronto.\n\nCloudflare (NET) The logo of Cloudflare, (NET) an US web infrastructure & security company, its website on iOS.\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the midst of the Crowdstrike outage and subsequent price plunge for CRWD, shares in other cloud-based cybersecurity firms, like Cloudflare (NYSE:NET), inched slightly higher. Yes, it’s possible that Crowdstrike’s blunder is a potential positive for key competitors. Even so, keep in mind that NET is already well priced to vastly exceed expectations.\n\nRight now, NET stock not only sells for 126 times this year’s estimated earnings. Shares trade for 100 times estimated 2025 earnings. Granted, if Cloudflare manages to pull off a series of massive earnings beats, shares may be able to sustain such a rich valuation. Yet if results are only slightly better-than-expected, or worse, merely meet/slightly miss expectations, the negative impact on NET’s share price could be massive.\n\nA similar scenario could play out, if subsequent guidance updates fall short. That’s what happened following Cloudflare’s last earnings release in early May. With the company just days away from unveiling its latest quarterly results and updates to guidance, you may want to take the cautious route. Instead of holding onto positions into the Aug. 1 earnings release, sell or take profit now.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) The Snowflake logo on a company office in Silicon Valley, California. (SNOW stock)\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is another name I’ve long considered one of the cloud stocks to sell. In large part, due to the fact investors overly priced-in a dubious GenAI catalyst into SNOW during late 2023 and early 2024. Although the market began to walk back this view as early as late February, when shares experienced a sharp plunge in price, I believed that a further avalanche to lower prices was in the cards.\n\nSince making this argument back in April, SNOW stock has continued to drift lower. Yet while shares in this cloud data provider are down by more than 45% from their 52-week high, further downside risk may remain. Snowflake shares currently trade for over 200 times forward earnings. Although sell-side analysts anticipate more than 57% earnings growth next fiscal year, it may prove difficult to hit or exceed this forecast.\n\nWhy? Besides the still-strong possibility that AI growth fails to arrive as expected, other factors could affect the bottom line. For instance, as InvestorPlace’s Yiannis Zourmpanos recently noted, Snowflake’s AI buildout is hurting gross margins. If this and other factors lead to a series of earnings misses, SNOW may be in for additional rounds of multiple compression.\n\nZoom Video Communications (ZM) A woman sitting at a desk waves at a large number of people on the videoconferencing software Zoom (ZM).\n\nSource: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nSure, it may be a bit of a stretch to call Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) a cloud stock. However, Zoom’s video conferencing platform is cloud-based. Not only that, the company, still getting over its post-pandemic growth hangover, has attempted to cash in on the AI boom, with new AI-powered cloud-based platforms like Zoom Workplace.\n\nStill, while the company is actively working to get back into high-growth mode, few on Wall Street are buying it. Forecasts still call Zoom to experience little in the way of improved results during the upcoming fiscal year ending January 2021. It’s not a mistake on the market’s part that ZM stock sells for less than 12 times estimated earnings. Worse yet, this “cheap” tech stock could get even cheaper.\n\nPretty soon, investors may cease to give Zoom the benefit of the doubt when it comes to a potential growth resurgence. If the market ends up convinced that Zoom is a “tech dinosaur,” ZM could sink to a valuation on par with other low-growth “dinosaurs” like Xerox Holdings (NASDAQ:XRX). XRX trades at a valuation nearly half that of Zoom’s current forward multiple.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) the Best Stock in Obama’s Portfolio?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Obama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year Returns. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks in former U.S. president Barack Obama's portfolio.\n\nFormer United States President Barack Obama took office during one of the worst recessions in U.S. history, yet the stock market reached new highs during his tenure. Stepping into office in 2009, the year after stocks plummeted nearly 40% amid the financial crisis of 2007-2008, Obama made a remarkably well-timed market prediction. On March 3, 2009, just days before the S&P 500 hit an intraday low of 666 and a closing low of 676.53, the then-president stated, \"What you're now seeing is profit-and-earnings ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you've got a long-term perspective on it.\" By the time he left office on January 20, 2017, the S&P 500 had soared to 2,263.69, reflecting a gain of about 225% since his predictive remark.\n\nThe \"Obama Years\" coincided with rapid technological advancements that significantly impacted the stock market. Apple Inc.'s iPhone, introduced less than two years before he took office, exemplified this era of innovation. In addition, during Obama's presidency, billionaire Reed Hastings transformed Netflix Inc. from a DVD rental-by-mail company into a video-streaming giant, revolutionizing entertainment consumption. On the other hand, renewable energy, particularly solar energy, struggled during the president's tenure. Despite the administration's solar subsidies, investors were largely disappointed as those subsidies eventually faded. First Solar Inc., one of the largest U.S. solar equipment producers, saw its stock plummet by as much as 74% due to falling solar panel prices, making it the worst-performing S&P 500 stock of the Obama era.\n\nHow Did the Obamas Make Their Money?\n\nFrom speaking at events worldwide to writing memoirs and signing a major production deal with Netflix, the Obamas have led a busy and highly lucrative life post-White House. Michelle Obama's first memoir, \"Becoming,\" published in November 2018, became that year's No. 1 best-selling book. Her second book, \"The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times,\" also achieved bestseller status. Similarly, Barack Obama's latest memoir, \"A Promised Land,\" sold nearly 890,000 copies within 24 hours of its November 2020 release. These ventures, along with the six-figure pension that all former presidents receive, have significantly boosted the Obamas' net worth, which is at least $70 million according to the International Business Times. The New York Post, however, estimates their fortune to be much higher, at $135 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, Barack Obama’s income isn’t limited to speaking fees and pensions. Like many other wealthy individuals, he has invested significantly in the stock market. So what does his portfolio look like? When he took office in 2009, Obama, like all presidents, was required to make financial disclosures by law. At that time, Obama held $200,000-$450,000 in the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares that tracks the S&P 500 index, according to a report by CBS News.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThese investments were selected from the top holdings of the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares, one of Barack Obama's primary investments during his presidency, according to official disclosures. We have provided each stock's trailing 10-year returns to assess their performance over the decade. Data from approximately 919 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024 was also analyzed to determine the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each firm.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple, our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy picks 14 small and large-caps every quarter and it has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNote: The stocks are sorted in ascending order of their trailing 10-year returns.\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nTrailing 10-Year Returns: 28.41%\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), a leading American multinational technology conglomerate, operates across various sectors including e-commerce, cloud computing (Amazon Web Services – AWS), online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. In the first quarter, the retail giant surpassed expectations with $143.3 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $0.98, beating the estimates of $142.5 billion in revenue and $0.83 EPS.\n\nOn June 14, JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), maintaining a price target of $240. This decision followed a comprehensive analysis of the U.S. e-commerce landscape, considering category penetration and Amazon's market share. The research indicates that Amazon is on track to surpass Walmart as the largest U.S. retailer by 2024, with long-term e-commerce penetration potentially exceeding 40%.\n\nFurthermore, the tech giant has been strengthening its leadership in AI through its AWS business, which achieved operating margins of over 37% in the first quarter. AWS has consistently maintained operating margins above 30% for the past five quarters. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s first-quarter revenue saw a 12.5% year-over-year increase, and its adjusted EPS more than tripled.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey's research for the March quarter of 2024, out of the 919 hedge funds covered, 302 held stakes in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management was identified as the largest hedge fund investor in the company, with a stake valued at $7.67 billion.\n\nVulcan Value Partners stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a dominant, world class company with powerful secular tailwinds in place including its ecommerce penetration, digital advertising growth, and the cloud transition. Amazon reported strong results during the quarter. Losses in the Core Retail business significantly narrowed. Amazon reduced its cost to serve on a per unit basis for the first time since 2018 as the company’s recent regionalization efforts continue to bear fruit.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 4th on our list of former U.S. president Barack Obama's portfolio stocks. You can visit Obama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year Returnsto see the other stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – July 30, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nMagnificent 7 Earnings Preview: Can Investors Buy Tech Now?\n\nGet ready for some action this week in the stock market as four of the Magnificent 7 tech giants — Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple —gear up to report their quarterly earnings.\n\nThese tech titans have been the primary drivers of this year’s return, pushing the market to new heights. But with the recent bout of market volatility, the big question remains: Is now the time for investors to dive into tech stocks?\n\nHere, we will explore the broader picture of the sector and potential outcomes of these quarterly earnings reports and try to figure out if any or all of them are worthy additions to investor portfolios at current levels.\n\nStrong Earnings Growth… But AI Concerns Loom\n\nLast week, following the quarterly report from Alphabet, investors started to grow cautious. Concerns about overinvestment into AI infrastructure and its ability to generate profits moving forward have been the main cause of selling over the last week.\n\nManagement’s comments about Capex regarding AI will be an important talking point for all these stocks.\n\nAlong with weakness in Alphabet, Semiconductor stocks and the other Mag 7 stocks have experienced considerable selling. But are these concerns overblown? I think they may be, and with another quarter of impressive growth likely coming, and reasonable valuations from the group, this dip could be a buying opportunity.\n\nAmazon is expected to post a 63.64% year-over-year increase in earnings to $0.54 per share, with revenue projected at $140.88 billion, driven by robust AWS and North American retail operations. Apple, despite a slight revenue dip to $81.64 billion, is forecasted to achieve earnings of $1.19 per share, bolstered by its services and wearables segments.\n\nMeta Platforms anticipates a significant earnings jump to $3.04 per share, a 45% jump and $31.05 billion in revenue, fueled by strong ad revenue and user engagement. Microsoft is projected to deliver $2.72 per share in earnings and $62.03 billion in revenue, reflecting Azure's impressive performance and continued strength in Office and LinkedIn.\n\nOverall, the Mag 7 is expected to bring in +26.8% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.7% higher revenues.\n\nValuations: Amazon and Meta are Relatively Cheap\n\nLooking at the valuations of these tech giants we see a spectrum of results. Although they are broadly trading at reasonable levels, two of them look much more appealing than the others.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms stands out with a free cash flow (FCF) yield of 4.1%, above its 10-year median of 3.2%, making it particularly attractive. Amazon too boasts an FCF yield of 2.6%, above its 10-year median of 1.8%.\n\nApple, on the other hand, has a FCF yield of 3%, which is below its 10-year median of 5.7%, indicating it may be pricier relative to its historical norm. And Microsoft shows a similar trend with an FCF yield of 2.2%, below its 10-year median of 3.6%.\n\nUncertainty Into Year End but Forecasts are Strong\n\nI think it may be a bit of a crapshoot buying these names ahead of earnings, but the reasonable valuations and secular tailwinds these companies enjoy make them compelling buys if they sell off further following the reports.\n\nCritical to the performance of these stocks through the end of the year is investors' perception of AI. Can these companies turn a profit in their new AI products? The answer is probably yes, but shareholders want to see hard evidence.\n\nAnother worthy consideration is the setup in the broader market and the approaching US Presidential Election. Big tech has been carrying the market higher all year, and it may be time for a pause in this run. Additionally, as the election approaches so does the perceived uncertainty, and investors may rotate into defensive sectors until after it concludes.\n\nHowever, it is hard to understate the long-term growth catalysts at these big tech companies – they are almost all expected to grow earnings faster than the market, which will drive even higher stock prices in the coming years.\n\nAny pause they take now, or in the coming months, is likely an opportunity to acquire shares in these generational assets.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Fed starts policy-setting meeting\n\nThe Federal Reserve starts its July policy meeting later in the session, and after a benign June inflation report, investors after looking for the policymakers to lay the groundwork for a September rate cut.\n\nThe U.S. central bank concludes its latest meeting on Wednesday, and is widely expected to maintain its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, as it has done since last July.\n\nInvestors are looking for signals about when and how many rate cuts may occur this year, and will therefore be intently following any policy guidance issued by the central bank, as well as the post-meeting press conference with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nFed officials have repeatedly stated that they are looking for more evidence that inflation is steadily returning to 2% before cutting rates, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated earlier this month that the central bank may not wait until inflation reaches this target before cutting rates.\n\nFutures are fully priced for a quarter-point easing in September, with a small chance of a reduction of 50 basis points, and have 66 basis points of easing priced in by Christmas.\n\n2. Futures edge higher with corporate results in focus\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Tuesday as investors awaited the start of the latest Federal Reserve meeting as well as key corporate earnings.\n\nBy 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 60 points, or 0.1%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 12 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 35 points, or 0.2%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is set to start its two-day policy meeting later in the session, and investors will be looking for clues over the timing and number of rate cuts to expect this year.\n\nThe main earnings release Tuesday will be from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) after the close, but there will also be results from the likes of Merck (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Procter&Gamble (NYSE:PG) before the open, as well as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) post closing bell.\n\nSo far, more than 40% of the S&P 500 companies have reported their results with 79% posting earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to LSEG.\n\n3. Microsoft’s Azure sales in spotlight\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) releases its quarterly results after the close Tuesday - the first of a series of numbers from the tech giants this week, including Facebook-parent Meta (NASDAQ:META) on Wednesday and then both Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors will be looking to see if sales in Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing business have picked up enough to justify the billions of dollars being spent on artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nThe software behemoth is expected to report that Azure's growth stayed steady quarter-over-quarter at about 31% between April and June, according to data from Visible Alpha, helped by its tie-up with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft's capital spending likely surged about 53% year-over-year to $13.64 billion in the period, according to 16 analysts polled by LSEG. A big step up from the $10.95 billion in expenditure it recorded in the previous quarter.\n\nShares of Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell sharply last week after the company reported a quarterly capital spending that exceeded estimates by nearly $1 billion, while the revenue boost from AI integrations remained modest, sparking a selloff in major tech companies.\n\n4. BP (NYSE:BP) lifts its dividend after Q2 results\n\nBP (LON:BP) released impressive second-quarter results earlier Tuesday, resulting in the energy giant raising its dividend after beating profit forecasts.\n\nBP reported an underlying profit of $2.76 billion for the second quarter of the financial year, up from $2.59 billion in the same quarter in 2023, and slightly higher than the $2.72 billion it earned in the first three months of the year.\n\nThe oil major generated substantial cash flow of $8.1 billion, enabling it to lower net debt to $22.6 billion as well as raising its dividend by 10% and announcing another share buyback, worth $1.75 billion, for the last quarter.\n\n“Our decision to increase our dividend by 10%, and extend our buyback program commitment to 4Q 2024, reflects the confidence we have in our performance and outlook for cash generation,” said CFO Kate Thomson.\n\n“We are maintaining a disciplined financial frame and remain committed to growing value and returns for BP.”\n\nAt 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), BP shares rose 2.5% to £4.65, trading largely flat year-to-date.\n\n5. Crude prices remain weak\n\nCrude prices steadied Tuesday, traded near two-month lows on continuing concerns about demand in China, the world's largest crude importer, while traders shrugged off the risk of conflict escalating in the Middle East.\n\nBy 04:00 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.1% to $75.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $79.09 a barrel.\n\nTraders were seen pricing out a risk premium from crude after media reports said Israeli officials were not seeking all-out war with Lebanon in their retaliation for a rocket strike that killed 12 in Israel-occupied Golan Heights.\n\nCrude prices are trading near two-month lows amid persistent concerns over slowing demand, especially in top importer China after last week’s weak growth data.\n\nThat said, the Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, pledged at the end of its July meeting to pursue a \"proactive\" fiscal policy, suggesting more stimulus ahead.\n\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets later in the week to discuss output levels, although recent weakness in crude is likely to see the cartel downplay any plans for scaling back production cuts.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFed meeting, Microsoft earns, BP dividend - what's moving markets\n\nBank of Korea board split on rate cut timing amid hot housing market, minutes show\n\nNew UK government cuts billions of pounds of spending to fix 'unsustainable' finances\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a report on the 30 Countries with the Most Income Equalityand in this article we will look at the country with the highest income equality.\n\nGlobal Income Distribution\n\nGlobal inequalities are in bad shape and appear to be getting worse overall. Disparities today are enormous and the impacts of global pandemics and wars have affected income equality in many countries. In addition, high interest rates and inflation have also increased income disparities. According to the International Monetary Fund, global inflation stands at around 5.9% in 2024, which is quite high despite dropping from 6.8% in 2023. Moreover, high income tax rates in Europe immensely impact income equality across the region.\n\nCountries have more disparities in wealth equality compared to income equality. The majority of wealth inequality is concentrated in Africa. Countries including Lesotho, Zambia, South Africa, Botswana, Equatorial Guinea, Namibia, and Nigeria are leading African countries with the highest wealth inequality. According to the World Inequality Report 2022, the share of the bottom 50% of the world, excluding Europe, in total earnings is less than 15%. Whereas, the same share of the world’s 50% bottom population is less than 10% in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the MENAS region. An average individual adult in 2021 was earning around $23,380 per year, while the average adult possessed $102,600. On average the richest top 10% of the world earns around $122,100 per year compared to $3,920 earned by the poorest half of the global population.\n\nOn the other hand, the world’s richest 10% people share over 40% of the total global earnings, and in some regions, it is around a whopping 60%. The bottom 50% of the people have a mere 2% share of the total global wealth against the 76% global wealth share owned by the top 10% of the population. The wealth of the top 1% of people in the world is growing rapidly compared to the rest of the global population. The top 1% gained 38% of the global increase in wealth compared to only 2% wealth share obtained by the bottom 50% between 1995 and 2021. According to the IMF, income inequalities are not much better and the richest 10% take over 52% of all income, as of 2022. Whereas, the poorest half only obtain 8.5%. The top 35 poorest countries by GDP per capita in 2024 have an average GDP per capita of just over $900.\n\nSmall-scale businesses are one way to erase poverty. Some of the top easy-to-start small businesses that could elevate your income include print-on-demand services, dropshipping, virtual assistant services, mobile app testing, and launching a Newsletter, among others. These fields have high growth potential going forward and could help you earn good enough to fight against poverty.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, countries with higher income equality have better job and business opportunities. Europe hosts the top countries with the highest average salaries in the world with Switzerland leading the list followed by Luxembourg and Denmark. The United States has the fourth highest average salary in the world with an average salary of $59,428. Luxembourg and Denmark have average salaries of around $75,316 and $71,268, respectively.\n\nOne of the Best Employers in the World\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the largest employers and highest-paying companies in the world. Amazon.com, Inc. employs over 1.5 million full-time and part-time employees. The company operates in various areas but is mainly known for its gigantic e-commerce network. Apart from e-commerce, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is well-known for its cloud services offered by AWS, and over-the-top media service Amazon Prime Video, among many. Amazon.com, Inc.’s e-commerce platform accounts for 37.6% of total market sales, the highest market share of all e-commerce companies in the US. By 2027, experts expect the e-commerce market to grow over $7.9 trillion from an expected market value of $6.3 trillion in 2024, as per Forbes.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud service platform, AWS, remains a dominant player in the cloud market. AWS has a staggering 50.1% market share followed by a 28% share of Google Cloud Platform and a 20% share of Microsoft Azure. According to HG’s 2023 Infrastructure as a Service Market Report, almost 2.38 million businesses are buying AWS cloud computing services, while the AWS customer growth rate is also the highest among the global cloud providers at 31%, as of 2023. Around 53% of all AWS customers are from North America, representing a total of 1.27 million customers, almost twice as many in the region compared to 2023. AWS is enhancing its platform through generative AI and AI modeling in machine learning. In addition, AWS has 240 fully featured services for computing, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning, AI, IoT, mobile, security, hybrid, media, and application development, deployment, and management.\n\nOver the years, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has performed exceptionally well based on strong financials, backed mainly by its e-commerce and cloud businesses. Apart from these businesses, Amazon is advancing in other sectors such as advertising. Amazon’s Advertising business increased from $38 billion in 2022 to $47 billion in 2023, up by 24% year-over-year. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) increased its total revenue by 12% year-over-year from $514 billion in 2022 to $575 billion in 2023.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides a wide range of job opportunities and pays market-competitive salaries in a time of distress when companies like Tesla and Microsoft are laying off. With that said, let’s take a look at the list of countries with the most income equality. The Country with the Most Income Equality\n\nTTstudio/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo determine the countries with the most income equality, we used the Gini coefficient of countries. The Gini coefficient describes income inequality or wealth distribution. A Gini coefficient of 0 represents perfect equality and a Gini coefficient of 100 means perfect inequality. The data on the Gini coefficient is taken from Credit Suisse’s Global Wealth Databook 2022. The countries with the most income equality are those with the least Gini coefficient and are ranked in descending order of their Gini coefficients.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nThe Country with the Most Income Equality\n\n1. Slovakia\n\nGini Coefficient: 50.5%\n\nSlovakia, officially known as the Slovak Republic, has a Gini coefficient of 50.5% and a GDP per capita of $44,080. The country has a total population of around 5.4 million. More than 72% of the population is employed, while only 5.8% of people in Slovakia are unemployed. In 2024, the average wage in Slovakia is just under €30,000 per year. According to the World Inequality Database, the top 10% and bottom 50% population of the country have a pre-tax national income share of 26% and 25%, as of 2022, respectively. Slovakia ranks first on our list of the countries with the most income equality in 2024.\n\nCurious to learn about other countries with the most income equality?

        "content": "I have long been skeptical about Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) as a company and Rivian stock.\n\nThe California-based automaker, with an assembly plant in Illinois, is going through an Electric Vehicle version of Death Valley. It needs to stay afloat long enough to build a new plant in Georgia, which it was forced to delay in March.\n\nThe plan is that the Georgia plant will, in 2027, deliver the R3. That’s a smaller, less expensive EV that might be competitive with what China is putting out right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGetting from here to there looked like a stretch in March. But is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) making it easier?\n\nThe Tesla Backlash The Tesla, Inc, TSLA, on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is seen on a screen, viewing the stock price for the electric vehicle and technology company.\n\nSource: The Bold Bureau / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla’s second-quarter earnings report was not good. Growth slowed and earnings were way down. It was clear to those who heard its conference call that CEO Elon Musk is focused on things other than building cars.\n\nAmerica is falling out of love with Tesla. Musk’s behavior is being blamed. Personally, I think this is less with politics and Twitter than the Cybertruck, the Edsel of EVs.\n\nAll this has given Rivian a luster and an opportunity it didn’t have before. Price targets are being raised on the heels of Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) putting $5 billion into a joint venture for its various innovations.\n\nThat’s equity which, if properly leveraged along with $4.8 billion in current debt, could get Rivian to Georgia.\n\nGeorgia is what it’s all about.\n\nGeorgia on my Mind Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian has 2,000 acres in Social Circle, Georgia, on which it agreed to build a new plant with state help in 2021. It’s the biggest subsidy Gov. Brian Kemp has given any company. His political future is riding on it.\n\nAssuming Rivian can build the plant, it will be within a few hours of two huge battery plants, one in Commerce and one in Ellabell,  near Savannah. The U.S. Southeast is becoming a center of new battery technology, and batteries represent 40% of an EV’s cost.\n\nRivian will deliver its second-quarter report on August 6, and analysts are hopeful. But Rivian is still a small company. It delivered just 13,790 vehicles during the second quarter.\n\nWhen Rivian reports its numbers, it will also tell analysts about the mix of its production and deliver some guidance for the rest of the year. The company is continuing to deliver on its order of 100,000 trucks for Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN), originally placed five years ago. At last check 10,000 had been delivered, and the reviews I get from drivers are very good. Amazon recently dropped its exclusivity on the design.\n\nStory continues\n\nReviews on the latest versions of Rivian’s R1 truck and SUV are positive. The second generation of its vehicles can go up to 420 miles on a charge, and they’re simpler. They also use the same charging port as the Tesla, and can add 140 miles of range in just 30 minutes.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Rivian Stock The back of a silver Rivian (RIVN) pick-up truck.\n\nSource: Miro Vrlik Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf Elon Musk is the Henry Ford of American EVs, Rivian founder R.J. Scaringe could become the Walter Chrysler. Chrysler became Ford’s primary competitor in the 1920s, with its Touring Car outshining anything Ford delivered.\n\nScaringe is a respected car guy and will likely remain one. He convinced Amazon, Ford Motor (NYSE:F), the state of Georgia, and now Volkswagen to invest in him.\n\nRivian is delivering a good EV. While the company still hasn’t gotten through the EV Death Valley and has yet to show a profit, it may have enough orders to do it. At its July 26 closing price, it’s selling at barely three times sales, against more than seven times sales for Tesla.\n\nTesla’s mistakes have made Rivian stock a worthwhile speculation.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in AMZN.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell on Tuesday, reversing a rebound from the prior session as sentiment remained on edge before interest rate decisions from the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve in the coming days.\n\nChinese markets continued to lag their peers, with local benchmarks hitting six-month lows as concerns over a slowing economic recovery showed few signs of easing.\n\nRegional markets took middling cues from Wall Street, which ended flat on Monday as caution over the central bank meetings kept investors from making big bets.\n\nU.S. stock index futures fell in Asian trade ahead of Wednesday’s Fed rate decision, while a slew of heavyweight technology earnings were also in focus.\n\nJapanese stocks sink amid uncertainty over BOJ\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 index fell 0.9% as did the broader TOPIX, amid uncertainty over the BOJ’s upcoming rate decision.\n\nAnalysts were largely split over a potential rate hike by the BOJ, following some mildly positive readings on inflation in the past two months. But underlying inflation- which is a key factor for the BOJ’s rate decisions- remained well below the bank’s 2% annual target.\n\nForecasts for the BOJ meeting ranged from a hold to a hike of 10 or 15 basis points.\n\nBut apart from the rate decision, uncertainty also persisted over the BOJ’s plans to begin tapering its quantitative easing programs. The bank had said it will elaborate on its plans during its July meeting.\n\nAn end to QE heralds less support for Japanese stock markets, with the BOJ set to taper down its asset purchases.\n\nChina stocks test 6-mth low, PMIs awaited\n\nChina’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively, with both indexes at their lowest levels since early-February. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slid 1.2% to an over three-month low.\n\nChinese stocks saw an extended rout through July as concerns over a slow economic recovery were exacerbated by middling signs on stimulus from Beijing.\n\nUncertainty over what the trajectory of the U.S. presidential race, with regards to U.S.-China trade relations, also kept traders averse to Chinese markets.\n\nFocus this week is squarely on a string of purchasing managers index readings from China, which are set to offer more cues on Asia’s largest economy.\n\nBroader Asian markets retreated, with technology stocks dropping in anticipation of earnings from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) later this week.\n\nSouth Korea’s KOSPI lost 1%, while Taipei shares of TSMC (TW:2330), the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, shed 1.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAustralia’s ASX 200 fell 0.8%, retreating before a consumer price index inflation reading for the second quarter. Monthly CPI indicators through the quarter herald a strong reading on Wednesday, which gives the Reserve Bank more impetus to keep rates high, or even potentially hike further.\n\nFutures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a negative open, after the index clocked wild swings in recent sessions as it struggled to make new highs above 25,000 points.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks sink as BOJ, Fed meetings approach; China shares hit 6-mth low\n\nAustralia's government on alert to support airline Rex as it hits turbulence\n\nBHP and Lundin Mining boost copper access, to buy Filo for $3.25 billion\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): A Good Stock to Buy According to Peconic Partners?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 191.50% in 3 Years: Peconic Hedge Fund's Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks.\n\nEstablished in 1997, Peconic Partners is a hedge fund manager based in New York, under the leadership of William Harnisch. The firm manages both its capital and that of its clients, using long/short equity hedge fund strategies. It also follows a thematic investment approach with a structured and consistent methodology, aiming to achieve positive returns over the long term regardless of market conditions.\n\nPeconic Partners's stock selection approach is driven by its deep experience. The Peconic Partners investment strategy has a history spanning over 40 years, originating with its predecessor firm. Peconic Partners' long-term track record, history of capital appreciation, and past ability to generate alpha are testaments to the vision, insight, and patience derived from their experience.\n\nWilliam Harnisch is the Chief Investment Strategist at Peconic Partners. He managed Peconic Partners from the late 1970s until 1997 when the long-only business was sold to a privately-held financial services firm aiming to expand its asset management business. However, William Harnisch and his partners retained exclusive ownership of the hedge business. In December 2004, he and the current Peconic team formed Peconic Partners, continuing the successful and disciplined hedge fund strategy practiced since the late 1970s.\n\nMr. Harnisch's career began in 1968 at Chase Manhattan Bank. He later joined Forstmann-Leff Associates (FLA), managing assets exceeding $5 billion and entering the hedge fund business in 1986. In 1997, he sold FLA's long-only business and in 2004, he founded Peconic Partners to concentrate on hedged products. William Harnisch holds a B.B.A. from Baruch College and is a Chartered Financial Analyst. He is active in philanthropy through the William F. Harnisch Foundation and is a board member of the Baruch College Fund. His market insights have been featured in the Wall Street Journal and Barron’s.\n\nIn 2023, Peconic Partners LLC regained the top spot on HedgeFollow's Top 20 Best Performing Hedge Funds list. Despite challenges like rising inflation and market volatility, Peconic Partners delivered a remarkable 191.50% performance over three years. This achievement is significant as many money managers struggled during a surprising market rally. While only 38% of large-cap mutual funds beat the market in 2023, and long-short hedge funds saw minimal gains, Peconic Partners excelled. For the fourth year in a row, the New York-based fund achieved an annual gain of 38%, three times higher than the S&P 500’s performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn late December of 2023, Mr. Harnisch increased bets against the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust and took short positions in expensive industrial stocks and consumer-product makers that have raised prices aggressively. This caused the fund's net leverage to decrease from 50% to 33% in a few weeks, and it has continued to drop in early 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe companies mentioned in this article come from Peconic Hedge Fund's top 10 stock picks at the end of the first quarter of 2024. To give readers a thorough understanding of these companies, we've included analyst ratings and other relevant details. We also mention the number of hedge fund investors in each company. Why focus on the stocks that hedge funds invest in? Our research shows that mimicking the top picks of the best hedge funds can lead to market-beating returns. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy, which selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks each quarter, has returned 275% since May 2014, outperforming its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a leading global e-commerce platform and major player in cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS), benefiting from the increasing use of cloud services by businesses. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also expanding its offerings in AI, logistics, and digital streaming, which supports its growth and market opportunities. With accelerating growth in AI cloud and advertising, management anticipates a significant increase in capital expenditure for FY2024, primarily to expand AWS infrastructure.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has demonstrated strong financial performance, with revenue rising to $514 billion in 2023 from $469 billion in 2022, and profit margins improving. Analysts note that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s EV/Sales ratio is in line with its 5-year average, and its non-GAAP P/E ratio for FY2024 is consistent with the Nasdaq 100 index. While Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) focuses on high-growth areas like AI, cloud computing, and advertising, retail sales still account for 82.5% of its revenue. As of the end of Q1 2024, Peconic Partners had a $718K position in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nAlphyn Capital Management stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In his annual letter to shareholders, CEO Andy Jassy underscores Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) commitment to “primitive services” over the last 20 years – creating foundational building blocks that empower rapid development of higher level products and services. Examples include developing core functionalities like payments and search, which eventually led to the Fulfilled by Amazon service, or developing logistics infrastructure, which led to the Buy with Prime service. Amazon is adopting the same approach to the next front, GenAI, from custom AI chips and training/deployment services to empower companies to construct their own core GenAI models, to their Bedrock service which allows customers to use pre-existing models to more quickly develop applications, to Amazon developing their own applications for internal use (think Alexa and a new shopping AI called Rufus).\n\nAmazon’s dominance comes not just from its scale but also from a relentless “customer obsession,” exemplified by its focus on building services that empower customers. This positions Amazon to capture significant shares of the growing retail and cloud markets. With a 45% share of online retail, which only makes up 25% of total retail sales, Amazon is well-placed for growth. The company’s expansion into the grocery sector, backed by investments in same-day delivery, shows promise. Currently, Amazon holds a 20% share of the grocery market, a segment that constitutes 34% of US retail sales but is only 12% penetrated. As online retail trends towards 40-50% penetration, Amazon’s growth potential is meaninful. Similarly, in the cloud sector, only 10% of IT spending has shifted to the cloud, with AWS holding a 35% market share.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 10th on our list of Peconic Partners' top 10 stock picks. You can visit 191.50% in 3 Years: Peconic Hedge Fund's Top 10 Stock Picksto see the other stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we recognize AMZN's potential as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "In the busiest week of the Q2 earnings season markets will be awaiting quarterly results from Amazon AMZN on Thursday, August 1.\n\nFurthermore, Amazon’s stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as now looks like an ideal time to invest in its e-commerce growth and diverse business operations.\n\nAmazon’s Q2 Expectations\n\nSupporting Amazon’s e-commerce dominance has been the company’s advertising services and cloud expansion through Amazon Web Services (AWS). Advertising services revenue for Q2 is projected to leap 22% to $13 billion with AWS revenue expected to spike 17% to $25.86 billion.\n\nNotably, Amazon is still the largest cloud provider ahead of its Magnificent Seven peers Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL. Overall, Amazon’s Q2 sales are thought to have risen 10% to $148.63 billion versus $134.38 billion in the comparative quarter.\n\nOn the bottom line, Q2 EPS is expected to increase 63% to $1.03 compared to $0.63 per share a year ago. Plus, the Zacks ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) indicates Amazon could surpass earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q2 EPS slated at $1.08 and 4% above the Zacks Consensus. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon has surpassed bottom line expectations for six consecutive quarters posting a very impressive average earnings surprise of 48.17% in its last four quarterly reports.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nReasonable Valuation\n\nWith Amazon’s growth outpacing most of its big tech counterparts outside of Nvidia NVDA, the tech giant’s valuation has become more reasonable as well. After trading at very stretched premiums in the past it's noteworthy that Amazon’s stock has a “B” Zacks Style Scores grade for Value.\n\nTo that point, AMZN is currently trading near its cheapest P/E valuation with a forward earnings multiple of 39.7X. This is pleasantly below its five-year high of 161.3X and a 44% discount to the median of 71.8X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nYTD Performance Comparison\n\nOnly trailing Nvidia and Meta Platform’s META price performance, Amazon’s stock is up +20% year to date to roughly match Alphabet while topping the rest of its Magnificent Seven peers and the broader indexes.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven its far more reasonable valuation and compelling growth, Amazon’s stock certainly looks poised for more upside if the e-commerce and cloud behemoth can indeed reach or exceed Q2 earnings expectations.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Microsoft to report fiscal Q4 earnings as Wall Street eyes AI revenue and spending",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) will report its fiscal fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday as Wall Street continues to look for signs that the massive wave of AI investments among Big Tech firms is starting to pay off.\n\nFor the quarter, Microsoft is expected to report earnings per share of $2.94 on revenue of $64.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft reported EPS of $2.69 on revenue of $56.2 billion during the same period last year.\n\nCloud revenue is expected to come in at $36.8 billion with Intelligent Cloud revenue, which includes Azure, set to hit $28.7 billion.\n\nDuring its prior quarter, Microsoft announced that AI services contributed 7 percentage points of growth to its Azure and other cloud services revenue. That was up from 6 percentage points in Q2 and 3 percentage points in Q1. The company initially began reporting AI contributions in Q4 of last year, saying AI added 1 percentage point of growth to Azure at the time.\n\nShares of Microsoft are up 13% year to date.\n\nMicrosoft’s report follows rival and Google parent Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) earnings announcement last week, during which the company said it is seeing an uptick in cloud revenue partially due to interest in AI products.\n\nStill, Google didn’t offer specific numbers on the impact of AI on the cloud business, leaving some analysts like UBS Global Research’s Stephen Ju to predict that revenue benefits from the company’s AI spending might not come until the first half of 2025 at the earliest. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build conference at Seattle Convention Center Summit Building in Redmond, Washington, on May 21, 2024. (Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images) (JASON REDMOND via Getty Images)\n\n“Our checks for Microsoft have been robust this quarter again, as we believe the AI tidal wave with Redmond in the driver's seat is accelerating cloud deal flow for Azure with strong momentum into the rest of 2024/2025,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an investor note ahead of Microsoft’s announcement.\n\nAccording to UBS Global Research analyst Karl Keirstead, Microsoft has also been grabbing more market share from Google and Amazon.\n\n“In terms of share shifts among AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, the most consistent theme in this round of checks was the number of customers and partners that cited share gains by Microsoft resulting from its early lead on the AI front,” Keirstead wrote in a recent note about the three major cloud players.\n\n“This has been a recurring theme from checks over the last 6-12 months and the commentary about Azure’s relative strength felt consistent with prior checks,” he added.\n\nOutside of how much Microsoft is making on AI, investors will want to know how much more the company plans to spend on the technology moving forward. In Q3, Microsoft reported capital expenditures of $14 billion as it continues to build out its AI infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring Alphabet’s earnings call, CFO Ruth Porat said the company spent $13 billion on capital expenditures, up from $12 billion in the prior quarter, adding that the vast majority of that spending is going toward AI.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is set to report earnings on Aug. 1.\n\nShares of Google are up 22% year to date, while shares of Amazon are up 23%.

        "title": "The Top 3 Cathie Wood Stocks to Buy Now: Summer 2024",
        "content": "Investing guru Cathie Wood still attracts a large following. Although the founder of the Ark Invest family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is trailing the market by a wide margin in 2024. Cathie Wood stocks are also known to trounce the S&P 500 by like amounts, too.\n\nThat’s because Wood likes to make big bets on her big ideas. Each year the millionaire investor lays out her thoughts on what she believes will be transformational investments in her “Big Ideas” thesis. Whether it is genomics, precision therapeutics or artificial intelligence, her ETFs typically reflect those concepts.\n\nNaturally, because they represent such paradigm shifts, these investments will take time to grow and become mainstream. Wood sees the opportunity to generate phenomenal returns by buying representative stocks early and watching them evolve. It means some of them will lag until they eventually gain critical mass.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat gives investors an excellent chance to buy Cathie Wood stocks at a discount and see them grow. Patience may be required but the following three companies are top stocks to buy now.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nSmall-merchant point-of-sale (POS) technology leader Block (NYSE:SQ) has long been the industry innovator. Increasingly, the fintech is adding other services to its platform to meet the needs of micro merchants, which are typically ignored by larger financial institutions.\n\nWith founder Jack Dorsey once again giving Block its full attention to improve profitability, the business is growing. Revenue and gross payment volume (GPV) grew 11% and 9%, respectively, in the first quarter, though down slightly sequentially. Importantly, the Cash App business remained strong for the period with revenue 23% higher.\n\nBlock does face competitive pressures and Fiserv’s (NYSE:FI) Clover platform is outperforming Block in GPV growth. Annualized GPV at Block’s rival is up 17% to $313 billion, according to PYMNTS. Yet Block is committed to shoring up the business and adjusted operating income soared from $51 million last year to $364 million this year.\n\nOne area of arguable concern is Dorsey’s obsession with Bitcoin (BTC-USD). He even started off his shareholder’s letter with a question he often receives, “Why the hell are you all spending so much time on Bitcoin?” His belief is that cryptocurrency will become the internet’s native currency and he is poised to pounce. He does note that Bitcoin-related projects account for less than 3% of Block’s total resources.\n\nStory continues\n\nWood is a believer and owns 8.1 million shares of Block. Excluding Bitcoin, which will be volatile, Block’s merchant business and Cash App are strong reasons to consider this option in Cathie Wood stocks.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) CRISPR (CRSP) logo within a DNA sequence\n\nSource: Catalin Rusnac/ShutterStock.com\n\nGene-editing pure-play CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) is the second Cathie Wood stock to consider. It fits neatly into her precision therapies vision for curing disease efficiently and at lower cost.\n\nCRISPR’s proprietary platform allows for precision slicing of DNA to modify genes to treat disease. Called Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, or CRISPR, it directs programmable enzyme Cas9 to meticulously cleave DNA in virtually any organism.\n\nIts first approved product was developed with Vertex Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VRTX) for the treatment of transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD). It has billion-dollar blockbuster potential.\n\nThe gene-editing stock possesses a significant portfolio of therapies in early-stage clinical trials that it will seek to develop and commercialize. Because they are still in the very early stages they are not something to consider at the moment but as they pass through the various trial phases they will become more relevant to its future growth.\n\nWood owns 7.5 million shares of CRISPR Therapeutics. The biotech’s CRISPR/Cas9 platform will be a powerful tool going forward and buying its stock now gets you in early on what will likely be dramatic growth later.\n\nTrade Desk (TTD) The logo for The Trade Desk is displayed on a smart phone.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter having sold off her position in Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) in 2021, Wood began buying fistful’s of the advertising technology platform late last year. She now owns nearly 1.8 million shares. There is good reason to believe this was a smart bet.\n\nTrade Desk is an agnostic platform for advertisers and ad agencies to purchase advertising from publishers and content creators. Because it is independent, unlike larger rivals like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) selling ads for their own verticals, buyers have developed substantial trust for its platform to help them manage their programmatic ad buying. Trade Desk has a 95% customer retention rate.\n\nFirst-quarter revenue jumped 28% year-over-year to $491 million while adjusted EBITDA surged 48% to $162 million.

        "content": "Another chance for mega tech to impress investors\n\nThis week the megacaps get another chance to prove themselves when Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Apple (AAPL?) all report second-quarter earnings.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) got the reporting party started on Tuesday after-the-bell to little fanfare. Disappointing results from both those names led to a general selloff on Wednesday, which saw the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite clocking their worst performance since 2022. Weakness was obvious in Tesla's results, which missed earnings per share expectations by 9 cents and saw auto revenue slip 7% year over year.[1] On the other hand, Alphabet handily beat expectations on both the top and bottom line, but it was worse-than-expected YouTube advertising revenue that caused investors to punish the stock.[2] Alphabet shares took another leg lower on Thursday when OpenAI announced the prototype of its search engine, SearchGPT. As a result of these early earnings results, other mega-cap tech names such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta and Apple fell in sympathy.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MCD.\n\nThe markets climbed their way out of the trenches late last week, boosted by a better-than-expected gross domestic product report which saw the U.S. economy expanding by 2.80% [3] and the June Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCEPI) that showed inflation continuing to ease.[4] Despite that, many tech names ended the week lower, with Meta, Microsoft and Apple down approximately 2% for the week, Nvidia falling 3% and Alphabet down nearly 6%.\n\nThe bar was set high coming into the second-quarter season with little room for error for corporations releasing results. Despite the recent rotation out of tech, many of these names still have very rich valuations and investors want to see they are justified by strong fundamentals. Thus far, the trend of investors rewarding positive surprises less than usual and punishing negative surprises more than usual remains in play.\n\nAccording to FactSet, the current consensus for S&P 500 EPS growth is for 9.80% year over year, an increase from 9.70% last week.[5] Thus far 78% of companies that have reported have surpassed analyst profit estimates, while only 60% have beaten on revenues.[6]\n\nSecond peak week\n\nThis week marks the second peak week of the second-quarter earnings season with nearly 2,500 companies anticipated to release results. All eyes will be on mega tech once again, as Microsoft reports on Tuesday, Meta on Wednesday and Apple and Amazon on Thursday, all after the close.?\n\nStory continues Will the Next Batch of Tech Earnings Encourage Investors to Rotate Back In?\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nOutlier earnings dates this week\n\nAcademic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.[7]\n\nThis week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their second-quarter 2024 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. Ten companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, eight of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those names are F5 Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV), McDonald's Corp. (NYSE:MCD), IDEX Corp. (NYSE:IEX), Meta Platforms, Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA), The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY), Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) and Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). The two names with positive DateBreaks Factors are ANSYS Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) and Smurfit WestRock PLC (NYSE:SW).\n\n* Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company's 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.\n\nMcDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Monday July 29, BMODateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\nMcDonald's Corp is set to report second-quarter 2024 results on Monday, July 29. While this is only two days later than they reported last year, it would be the latest they've ever reported for the second quarter.\n\nMcDonald's rang the alarm on the U.S. consumer last quarter after disappointing earnings per share results pointed to a pull-back in discretionary spending. Consumers continue to be even more discriminating with every dollar that they spend as they faced elevated prices in their day-to-day spending, which is putting pressure on the industry, CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's first-quarter earnings call.\n\nThe Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Wednesday July 31, BMODateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\nBoeing is set to report second-quarter 2024 results on Wednesday, July 29, the latest they've ever reported for the second quarter, but still sticking with their Wednesday reporting trend.\n\nAfter all of the setbacks and bad press Boeing has received this year, it probably isn't particularly surprising to see them move their earnings date later. On Wednesday the planemaker plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge for misleading U.S. regulators in order to get the 737 Max jetliner approved before it was ready, leading to two fatal crashes.[8] It isn't just the issue with the 737 Max jetliners, but other models such as 777 freighters that are incomplete and awaiting additional parts or updated software, costing the company about $1 billion a month as they scramble to get these idle planes up and running.[9]\n\nSecond-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis season peak weeks will fall between July 22 and Aug. 9, with each week expected to see over nearly 2,000-plus reports. Currently Aug. 8 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,438 companies anticipated to report. Thus far only 69% of companies have confirmed their earnings date (out of our universe of 11,000-plus global names), so this is subject to change. The remaining dates are estimated based on historical reporting data.?

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures retreated in evening deals on Monday as sentiment remained strained in anticipation of a Federal Reserve meeting and earnings from some of the country’s biggest companies.\n\nA rebound in technology stocks ran out of steam this week, with the sector nursing deep losses over the past two weeks amid profit-taking, a shift into more economically sensitive sectors and underwhelming earnings from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nTraders were reluctant to buy back into the sector, with several tech majors set to report quarterly earnings this week, beginning with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.2% to 5,494.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.2% to 19,169.75 points by 19:13 ET (23:13 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.2% to 40,707.0 points.\n\nMicrosoft to kick off next round of major tech earnings\n\nThe Redmond, Washington-based tech giant is set to report its June quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the firm is set to clock strong growth in earnings on the back of more artificial intelligence products, investors will be watching for any increased expenditure, and whether AI demand appeared to be sufficiently boosting earnings.\n\nThe increased caution comes after high AI spending and some sluggish revenue metrics soured otherwise strong earnings from peer Alphabet last week. The stock had tumbled after its earnings.\n\nBeyond Microsoft, tech heavyweights Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are set to report earnings on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nOther major earnings are also on tap this week, with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Merck&Company Inc (NYSE:MRK), Procter&Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) due in the coming days.\n\nWall Street indexes were largely unchanged on Monday amid caution ahead of the earnings. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% to 5,463.54 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.1% to 17,370.33 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1% to 40,539.93 points.\n\nFed meeting awaited for more rate cues\n\nMarkets were also on edge before a Fed meeting this week, with the bank widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of the meeting on Wednesday.\n\nBut any signals on when the bank plans to begin cutting rates will be closely watched, given encouraging signs from inflation and positive comments from Fed officials in recent months.\n\nMarkets are pricing in a 25 basis point cut by the Fed in September, according to CME Fedwatch.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStory continues\n\nUS stock futures fall with Fed meeting, mega tech earnings on tap\n\nAd group WPP lines up former BT boss Philip Jansen as its new chair, FT reports\n\nMeta to let users to create custom AI characters\n\nView comments",

        "content": "As I’m sure everyone reading this is aware, artificial intelligence, or AI, has been quite a volatile sector in the recent past. All indicators suggest this will continue in the near to semi-long-term future.\n\nMany are skeptical of the high valuation AI companies carry, often comparing it to those seen before the dot-com crash. Statistically speaking, we are far away from that level of inflated valuations — at least for now.\n\nAI companies rise and fall every day. In a way, they can be seen as a “playground” for investors who want to take risks to reap awards, but are too risk-averse to invest in even more volatile sectors, such as biotechnology.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile there are many AI-centric companies that are likely to benefit from the seemingly exponential growth trend, here are three that I believe will be your safest bets for the long run.\n\nShopify (SHOP) There Are Still so Many Problems With Shopify Stock\n\nSource: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) is a prominent up-and-coming e-commerce company that offers websites, tools and back-end support for businesses. It also heavily uses AI to improve the end-user experience by automating stores, providing relevant suggestions and being compatible with multiple third-party AI tools.\n\nSHOP stock has slid recently, down almost 30% over the last six months. However, I believe it is ripe for a comeback. While it is currently making a loss, with negative profit margins of 2.82%, the company has seen solid growth lately. Quarterly revenue was up 23.40% int the most recent period and it maintains cash flows of over $1 billion. Earnings have consistently surprised investors, too.\n\nFive analysts on Yahoo Finance! give this stock an average price target of $108, setting its implied upside at over 80% at the time of writing. Shopify’s biggest strength is its ease of use, as it allows merchants to seamlessly start selling products. This, along with rapid revenue growth and adoption by some of the world’s biggest celebrities, has led people to compare SHOP to the next Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). While this isn’t certain, SHOP remains a great AI stock to buy.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) robotic arms over medical bed symbolizing medical robotics. favorite robotics stocks to buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/MAD.vertise\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a global technology leader in minimally invasive care and the pioneer of robotic-assisted surgery. The company develops, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system and related instruments and accessories, which are designed to enable complex surgery using a minimally invasive approach.\n\nThe robotics stock is using AI to enhance its robotic-assisted surgery systems and is enjoying tremendous profits as a result. ISRG profit and operating margins of 27.65% and 28.23%, respectively, indicate the company is a leader. This is also seen by its year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth rate of 25.20%. The stock is up 33% over the past month though down 5% this week, making it the prime time to invest.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s AI-driven products improve surgical outcomes, reduce operation times and minimize patient recovery periods. ISRG has a 75% share of the surgical robotics market, a huge number considering the market is valued at around $94 billion. The stock enjoys industry-wide backing, with more than 89% of the stock held by institutions and insiders. Given its strong market position and growth potential, ISRG is one of the best AI stocks to buy.\n\nMicron Technologies (MU) A zoomed in image of a hand placing a CPU chip onto a CPU socket.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMicron Technologies (NASDAQ:MU) is a global leader in semiconductor solutions, specializing in memory and storage technologies. The company designs and manufactures memory products essential for data centers, automotive and industrial applications. It also plays a significant role in advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities.\n\nMU stock is currently trading at around $110 per share with a market cap of $121.3 billion. The stock has fallen almost 17% over the past month but I expect that to reverse soon because of its strong fundamentals. The stock has consistently beaten EPS predictions over the past year, with an average surprise of 75%. However, that is primarily due to a huge 268% EPS beat in the first quarter.\n\nThe company is set to report third-quarter earnings on Sept. 26. With a target price of $159.47, MU stock has a growth potential of 45.75% implied.\n\nThe companywill benefit from increased demand for memory and storage solutions driven by AI advancements. This is seen with the YOY quarterly revenue growth rate of 81.50%, and an increase in revenue of $2.81 billion over the past year. These factors position MU stock as a compelling AI stock to buy due to its significant growth potential fueled by the demand for AI-optimized memory solutions.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Magnificent 7 Earnings Preview: Can Investors Buy Tech Now?",
        "content": "Get ready for some action this week in the stock market as four of the Magnificent 7 tech giants—Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL)—gear up to report their quarterly earnings.\n\nThese tech titans have been the primary drivers of this year’s return, pushing the market to new heights. But with the recent bout of market volatility, the big question remains: Is now the time for investors to dive into tech stocks?\n\nHere, we will explore the broader picture of the sector and potential outcomes of these quarterly earnings reports and try to figure out if any or all of them are worthy additions to investor portfolios at current levels. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStrong Earnings Growth… But AI Concerns Loom\n\nLast week, following the quarterly report from Alphabet (GOOGL), investors started to grow cautious. Concerns about overinvestment into AI infrastructure and its ability to generate profits moving forward have been the main cause of selling over the last week.\n\nManagement’s comments about Capex regarding AI will be an important talking point for all these stocks.\n\nAlong with weakness in Alphabet, Semiconductor stocks and the other Mag 7 stocks have experienced considerable selling. But are these concerns overblown? I think they may be, and with another quarter of impressive growth likely coming, and reasonable valuations from the group, this dip could be a buying opportunity.\n\nAmazon is expected to post a 63.64% year-over-year increase in earnings to $0.54 per share, with revenue projected at $140.88 billion, driven by robust AWS and North American retail operations. Apple, despite a slight revenue dip to $81.64 billion, is forecasted to achieve earnings of $1.19 per share, bolstered by its services and wearables segments.\n\nMeta Platforms anticipates a significant earnings jump to $3.04 per share, a 45% jump and $31.05 billion in revenue, fueled by strong ad revenue and user engagement. Microsoft is projected to deliver $2.72 per share in earnings and $62.03 billion in revenue, reflecting Azure's impressive performance and continued strength in Office and LinkedIn.\n\nOverall, the Mag 7 is expected to bring in +26.8% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.7% higher revenues.\n\nValuations: Amazon and Meta are Relatively Cheap\n\nLooking at the valuations of these tech giants we see a spectrum of results. Although they are broadly trading at reasonable levels, two of them look much more appealing than the others.\n\nMeta Platforms stands out with a free cash flow (FCF) yield of 4.1%, above its 10-year median of 3.2%, making it particularly attractive. Amazon too boasts an FCF yield of 2.6%, above its 10-year median of 1.8%.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (AAPL), on the other hand, has a FCF yield of 3%, which is below its 10-year median of 5.7%, indicating it may be pricier relative to its historical norm. And Microsoft (MSFT) shows a similar trend with an FCF yield of 2.2%, below its 10-year median of 3.6%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUncertainty Into Year End but Forecasts are Strong\n\nI think it may be a bit of a crapshoot buying these names ahead of earnings, but the reasonable valuations and secular tailwinds these companies enjoy make them compelling buys if they sell off further following the reports.\n\nCritical to the performance of these stocks through the end of the year is investors perception of AI. Can these companies turn a profit in their new AI products? The answer is probably yes, but shareholders want to see hard evidence.\n\nAnother worthy consideration is the setup in the broader market and the approaching US Presidential Election. Big tech has been carrying the market higher all year, and it may be time for a pause in this run. Additionally, as the election approaches so does the perceived uncertainty, and investors may rotate into defensive sectors until after it concludes.\n\nHowever, it is hard to understate the long-term growth catalysts at these big tech companies – they are almost all expected to grow earnings faster than the market, which will drive even higher stock prices in the coming years.\n\nAny pause they take now, or in the coming months, is likely an opportunity to acquire shares in these generational assets.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Amazon (AMZN) Stock Worth Buying Ahead of Q2 Earnings?",
        "content": "Amazon AMZN is scheduled to report second-quarter 2024 results on Aug 1.\r\n\r\nFor the second quarter, the company expects net sales between $144 billion and $149 billion. Net sales are expected to grow 7-11% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales is pegged at $148.63 billion, indicating growth of 10.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.03 per share, which indicates a jump of 63.5% from the year-ago quarter. The figure moved 0.98% upward over the past seven days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company has been benefiting from dominant position in the e-commerce and cloud markets. It is also riding on expanding generative AI capabilities.\n\nAmazon has an impressive earnings surprise history. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 36.14%. The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 48.17%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Amazon this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nAMZN has an Earnings ESP of +4.58% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nKey Factors to Influence Amazon’s Q2 Results\n\nPrime Drives Retail & Streaming Momentum\r\n\r\nAmazon’s solid Prime momentum on the back of strong and fast delivery services, including Prime Free One Day and Prime Free Same-Day Delivery, is expected to have continued driving its prospects in the e-commerce space.\r\n\r\nExpanding grocery services are expected to have been a positive. A strengthening distribution network, which is crucial for any e-commerce company, is likely to have contributed well. \r\n\r\nAmazon’s growing worldwide e-commerce business, along with the expanding global footprint of Prime, is anticipated to have aided its financial performance.\r\n\r\nThe growing pharma business on the back of Prime perks is likely to have been another positive. The company offers RxPass, a Prime membership benefit, which enables Prime members to receive all of their eligible medications for one flat monthly fee of $5 and get them delivered for free.\r\n\r\nThese factors are expected to have driven growth in the company’s online retail sales in the second quarter. The consensus mark for the second quarter’s physical store sales is pegged at $5.25 billion, indicating growth of 4.5% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon’s strong physical presence is expected to have benefited the quarterly performance. Growing momentum across Amazon Fresh grocery stores, Whole Foods stores and Amazon Go outlets across the United States is anticipated to have contributed well to the company’s sales in the second quarter.\r\n\r\nIts introduction of the smart shopping cart called Amazon Dash Cart, powered by advanced computer vision technology, to deliver an enhanced shopping experience is likely to have driven momentum across its in-store shoppers in the quarter under review.\n\nThe consensus mark for the second quarter’s physical store sales is pegged at $5.25 billion, indicating growth of 4.5% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nGrowing relationships with third-party sellers are expected to have been a major positive. The consensus mark for sales generated by third-party sellers is pegged at $36.3 billion, indicating growth of 12.3% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nComing to streaming services, solid momentum across Prime Video is anticipated to have been a major tailwind. Expanding original content and overall content portfolios on Prime Video are likely to have accelerated Prime engagement.\r\n\r\nPrime membership offers free access to ad-free Amazon Music, which is a plus.\r\n\r\nPrime benefits in the retail and online streaming fields are anticipated to have continued aiding Amazon’s subscription revenue growth in the quarter under review.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for subscription service sales is pegged at $10.83 billion, suggesting growth of 9.5% from the year-ago reported figure.\r\n\r\nAWS Strength Boosts Cloud Momentum\r\n\r\nAmazon’s strengthening AWS segment is expected to have contributed well to its second-quarter performance.\r\n\r\nThe expanding cloud services portfolio on the back of generative AI technology and expanding data center networks is likely to have aided the performance of AWS in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe solid adoption of Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space, is likely to have driven AWS sales in the second quarter.\r\n\r\nThe increasing number of AWS regions and availability zones is expected to have been a positive.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AWS sales is pegged at $25.9 billion, suggesting growth of 16.8% from the year-ago reported figure.\r\n\r\nSmart Device Portfolio to Consider\r\n\r\nAmazon’s robust Fire products family, portfolio of Echo smart speakers, Blink smart security cameras and doorbells, and eero WiFi systems are expected to have continued benefiting its financial performance in the second quarter.\r\n\r\nStrengthening Alexa features is likely to have aided Amazon in delivering a better user experience, the impacts of which, in turn, are expected to get reflected in the upcoming results.\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nAmazon’s shares have appreciated 20.4% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry and S&P 500 index’s rise of 14% and 14.6%, respectively.\r\n\r\nAMZN has outpaced its cloud peer namely Microsoft MSFT which has returned 13.5% year to date. Meanwhile, it is slightly underperforming Alphabet’s GOOGL Google which has gained 20.8% year to date.\n\nYear-to-Date Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNow, let us look at the value Amazon offers investors at current levels.\r\n\r\nCurrently, AMZN is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month P/S of 2.8X compared with the industry’s 1.66X, reflecting a stretched valuation. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nWhile a stretched valuation might be perceived as a risk, the premium is justified due to AMZN’s consistent financial performance and solid growth prospects in e-commerce and cloud.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Amazon has a Growth Style Score of A, which is hard to ignore.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s near and long-term prospects are expected to benefit from strong retail strategies, which include bolstering its online and offline retail presence, distribution channels, and delivery services. An expanding global presence and the growing adoption of Prime are other tailwinds. The growing footprint in the video streaming space with Prime Video is another positive.\r\n\r\nSolid AWS momentum, coupled with a deepening focus on generative AI, is a plus. It is helping Amazon maintain its dominant cloud position.\r\n\r\nGiven the fundamental strength, growth-seeking investors should consider AMZN stock as a strong contender in their portfolios ahead of the second-quarter earnings report.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Costco Is Beyond Overvalued",
        "content": "Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ:COST) has been an investing darling for as long as I can remember. It has also been a darling for shoppers as they have some of the strongest brand loyalty in the market. I know firsthand as I am a card-carrying member of its club and happily pay the membership fee every year to shop in its warehouses. No one can beat its rotisserie chickens, toilet paper and giant box of spinach.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with COST.\n\nThis is not a shopping blog, so let's jump into the company and stock. Costco has been performing wonderfully over the last 12 months, especially compared to its peers. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nCOST Data by GuruFocusIts GF Score is also very high at 90 out of 100. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nLet's dive in to figure out what is driving this performance.\n\nEPS growth is outpacing competition\n\nCostco's three-year growth rate of earnings per share without nonrecurring items was over 16%, which is better than most companies in its sector and the best in its peer group. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nWhat has been driving this growth? I will examine revenue and then costs to figure out what is happening.\n\nRevenue grew post-pandemic\n\nCostco views itself as a single segment company, but it does break out revenue into something called Core Merchandise Categories. Here are those categories:\n\nFood and Sundries - These include sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor and tobacco. Fresh Foods - This includes meat, produce, service deli and bakery items. Warehouse Ancillary and Other Businesses - This includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, tires, business centers and travel. Membership Fees - Fees that members pay to gain access to Costco warehouses. Non-Foods - This is everything else that includes things like appliances, electronics, sporting goods, toys, apparel, furniture, housewares and jewelry (and much more).\n\nBelow is a chart showing the sales growth in each of these categories going back the last few years. Please note that the fourth quarter (quarter ending in August) is longer than the other quarters, which is why there is a jump. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nThe growth is positive but has been declining slightly each quarter. The only exception was in the Warehouse Ancillary and Other Businesses Segment, where the growth rate plummeted from highs in 2022 (this is not in the chart to make it more readable for the other segments). This was largely due to increased travel in 2022 compared to 2021 as Covid-19 travel restrictions were lifted worldwide.\n\nIs Costco growing by adding warehouses or by increasing revenue in its existing locations? The chart below shows that most of the revenue growth is from existing warehouses rather than opening new locations.\n\nStory continues Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nThis is great as it shows Costco is able to grow organically. However, sales, while still positive, are growing less than a few years ago. Analysts are expecting positive sales growth going forward. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nCOST Data by GuruFocus\n\nHowever, they also expect growth to be slightly above 5%, which continues the worrying trend of a declining growth rate.\n\nCosts are steadily rising with revenue\n\nCostco breaks up its operating costs into merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative. Merchandise costs are the costs associated with purchasing the products that are sold in its warehouses. Selling, general and administrative are the costs associated with running the warehouses, such as salaries and benefits paid to employees, marketing expenses or utilities.\n\nOver the last few years, the operating expense as a percentage of sales has been very stable. Merchandise expenses hover around 87% of revenue while SG&A is between 8% and 9%.\n\nOperating income is increasing, but volatile\n\nGrowing revenue with a commensurate increase in costs will lead to an increase in operating income, which Costco has done the last few years. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nHowever, revenue growing at differing rates each quarter has led to operating income growth being all over the place. This is not necessarily a bad thing. I would certainly prefer volatile positive growth over stable negative growth. Even with the volatility, Costco has led its peer group in Ebitda growth over the last few years. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nROE is one of the highest in the industry\n\nCostco's return on equity is one of the major selling points for investors Currently, it is higher than almost 90% of other companies in the industry and 3 times higher than the industry median. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nUsing the five-step Dupont analysis can provide more information on why the company's ROE is so high. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nCostco's net margin is low at just shy of 3%. However, retail is an industry with really tight margins, so it is actually better than the industry median. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nWe do not have an industry-level equity multiplier, but we can use the equity-to-asset ratio as a proxy since that is just the inverse of the equity multiplier. Here, Costco is a little behind the industry median, but it is not so far off to be a cause for concern. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nWhere Costco really stands out is asset turnover. Compared to its peers, the retailer is way ahead of everyone else with an asset turnover that is 20% higher than second place, BJ's Wholesale (NYSE:BJ). Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nThis all sounds great, so what is the problem?\n\nValuation ratios are at all-time highs\n\nCostco's valuation ratios are screaming overvalued at the moment. Just pick one out of a hat, throw it in a chart and you will see it is near anall-time high. Below is a chart showing the price-earnings ratio and it is not pretty. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nCOST Data by GuruFocus\n\nCompared to its peers, Costco's price-earnings ratio is significantly higher at 3 times the industry median. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nThe PEG ratio, which incorporates expected growth, is not any better, and is also 3 times the industry median. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nTo put all of this into perspective, Costco's current price-earnings ratio is higher than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and has a similar price-earnings ratio to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Costco is great, but its growth prospects are not even close to these other companies.\n\nThe company's price-earnings ratio over the last 10 years has averaged around 33. Costco's management does not issue guidance, so I will use analyst estimates instead. Analysts are expecting earnings per share of $16.24 for fiscal year 2025. Multipling 33 by that EPS gives a target price of $535, which is significantly below current price levels.Time to take some profits\n\nCostco's growth has been impressive. Throw in an industry-leading ROE with incredible brand loyalty and the company looks like a slam dunk for investors.\n\nHowever, the price movement has gone a little crazy the last couple of years and valuation ratios are way too high. If I was looking to invest in Costco, I would sit on the sidelines and wait for the price to come back down to Earth. If you already are a Costco investor, it probably makes sense to sell some shares and lock in those profits.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Unlocking Q2 Potential of Amazon (AMZN): Exploring Wall Street Estimates for Key Metrics",
        "content": "Analysts on Wall Street project that Amazon (AMZN) will announce quarterly earnings of $1.03 per share in its forthcoming report, representing an increase of 63.5% year over year. Revenues are projected to reach $148.63 billion, increasing 10.6% from the same quarter last year.\n\nThe current level reflects no revision in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as a yardstick to evaluate the company's quarterly performance, scrutinizing analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics can offer a more comprehensive perspective.\n\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some Amazon metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Net Sales- AWS' will reach $25.87 billion. The estimate points to a change of +16.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Net sales- Physical stores' reaching $5.25 billion. The estimate points to a change of +4.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Net sales- Online stores' at $55.76 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5.3% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Net Sales- Subscription services' stands at $10.84 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +9.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Net Sales- Advertising services' of $13.00 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +21.7% year over year.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Net Sales- Third-party seller services' to reach $36.31 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +12.3%.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Geographic Revenue - International' will likely reach $31.94 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +7.6%.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Subscription services Y/Y Change' will reach 9.5%. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 14%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Online stores Y/Y Change' should arrive at 5.4%. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 4% in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Third-party seller services Y/Y Change' to come in at 12.5%. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 18%.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Headcount - Total' should come in at 1,483,446. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 1,461,000.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'WW shipping costs' will reach $22.61 billion. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $20.42 billion.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Amazon here>>>\r\n\r\nShares of Amazon have experienced a change of -5.6% in the past month compared to the -0.2% move of the Zacks S&P 500 composite.

        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Expedia (EXPE) holds a Zacks Rank #1 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $3.23 a share 10 days away from its upcoming earnings release on August 8, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $3.23 Most Accurate Estimate and the $3.18 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Expedia has an Earnings ESP of 1.45%.\n\nEXPE is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Amazon (AMZN) as well.\n\nAmazon is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on August 1, 2024. AMZN's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.08 a share three days from its next earnings release.\n\nFor Amazon, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 is 4.58%.\n\nEXPE and AMZN's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "Small-Cap Stocks Surge: 3 Tiny Titans Poised to Take Over in 2024",
        "content": "It’s a great time to consider investing in small-cap stocks. The Russell 2000 index — comprising 2,000 firms with market capitalizations between $250 million and $2 billion — recently hit its highest level since January 2022.\n\nThe benchmark index has continued to outpace the S&P 500 over the past several weeks. The index is more sensitive than its larger cousin and tends to move quicker in either direction. Given cooling inflation data, many believe small-cap stocks are set to rise rapidly over the coming months.\n\nInvestors also continue to rotate out of large tech stocks that have driven so much of overall market returns on AI’s growth. Investors are also beginning to price in the potential of a win in the upcoming election by Donald Trump this November. Trump is widely expected to boost the economy if elected. Meanwhile, rate cuts will serve to boost the economy regardless of election results. It all continues to benefit small-cap stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEnlight Renewable Energy (ENLT) rows of solar panels, representing solar stocks\n\nSource: Love Silhouette / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnlight Renewable Energy (NASDAQ:ENLT) has to be one of the more intriguing plays available to investors currently. It is well positioned as a small-cap stock with a market cap of $1.94 billion. That puts it right at the cusp of moving out of small-cap territory.\n\nRegardless, what I like about Enlight Renewable Energy is the unique combination of factors conspiring in its favor currently. The small-cap narrative speaks for itself. What’s equally important is the fact that the company operates a renewable energy platform serving Israel, Europe and the U.S.\n\nRenewable energy is in high demand as AI firms are looking to reduce their carbon emissions. However, they are increasing their energy consumption due to the AI boom. That makes renewable energy — with its negligible carbon footprint — the perfect choice for AI firms. AI hyperscalers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and others will look to utilities firms including Enlight Renewable Energy to meet that demand.\n\nNot to mention, the company is booming in 2024 from both a top- and bottom-line perspective.\n\nHarmonic (HLIT) A woman in a pink jacket sits at a table inside while filming herself on camera\n\nSource: garetsworkshop / Shutterstock\n\nHarmonic (NASDAQ:HLIT) sells communications equipment in the broadband and video markets. The company specializes in virtualized broadband and video delivery solutions. Harmonic creates the infrastructure that allows cable and internet service providers (ISPs) to deliver high-quality internet and video streaming services to their customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company produces and sells hardware and software products. These technologies help ISPs efficiently manage their networks and deliver faster internet speeds. Harmonic sells those products to large, well-known broadband firms, Comcast for example. It is a B2B small-cap stock providing the products that power the internet and video you and I use everyday.\n\nIt’s also a stock that is widely positively regarded by analysts, all of whom rate it a “buy” or better. There are other strong reasons to consider HLIT aside from the small-cap narrative. One of the best is its very strong gross margins. Harmonic benefits from strong pricing advantages that should fuel everything that falls below gross margins on the income statement.\n\nSMART Global (SGH) a man working on a computer hard drive\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSMART Global (NASDAQ:SGH) recently rebranded as Penguin Solutions and designs, develops and sells memory solutions. Those memory solutions include products like DRAM modules, flash storage devices and memory upgrades. Those products are especially in demand at companies working in artificial intelligence, big data and cloud computing. That makes it a small-cap stock that is heavily leveraged in the AI opportunity.\n\nPenguin Solutions’ head of marketing, Mark Seamens, notes:\n\n“AI is being used to drive competitive advantage in almost every industry. Large language model (LLM) computing, analytics, inferencing, and simulation have all become critical across a wide range of applications, and enterprises of all sizes are racing to deploy AI for both differentiation and business acceleration, However, AI infrastructure is incredibly complex. It differs significantly from traditional enterprise IT and requires a new set of technical expertise that organizations have not yet developed. In many cases, the complexity involved in AI solutions is leading to slow adoption, delayed deployments, underperforming systems, and unrealized return on investment.”\n\nPenguin Solutions has deployed more than 75,000 GPUs and has deep experience that it should be able to leverage in the AI space. The stock is very well regarded by the analysts who cover it suggesting real potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Hero to Zero: 3 Stocks at 52-Week Highs to Sell Now",
        "content": "Warren Buffett’s favorite market indicator is signaling the stock market has reached the top. By comparing the value of the market to the size of the economy, you get an idea of where stock valuations stand, especially for stocks at 52-week highs.\n\nBuffett once noted the indicator was “probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.” Today, it suggests the stock market is bloated. MarketWatch recently ran the numbers and found the ratio above 2.0, which is a level last seen in 2022. Recall, that was the year the market significantly retraced the gains it had made following the pandemic.\n\nAlthough MarketWatch noted Buffett doesn’t follow the metric anymore, it is still a useful way to gauge if the market is topping out. Investors should proceed with caution when buying stocks, particularly those at 52-week highs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEven though the S&P 500 has pulled back from its all-time high in recent weeks, several stocks continue to push forward. Some are even setting new all-time highs of their own. Thus, the three companies below are stocks at 52-week highs or very close to their peak.\n\nNow might be a good time to sell.\n\nWalmart (WMT) An image of a large tan Walmart store front on a bright clear day with empty handicap parking spaces, trees, bushes, and blue poles in front and a large white \"Walmart\" sign and logo with six yellow lines forming a circle above the entrance.\n\nSource: Tupungato / Shutterstock.com\n\nRetail king Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is on a tear. Shares are at an all-time high of over $70 a stub. First-quarter results were strong with revenue rising 6% year-over-year as both its domestic and international markets expanded. That allowed the retailer to easily surpass analyst earnings estimates, posting profits of 60 cents per share.\n\nWith the business firing on all cylinders, why sell? Higher margin goods are coming under pressure and after decades of expansion, Walmart may be reaching a saturation point in the U.S. That will require the retailer to focus more attentively on its e-commerce operations where it remains large and growing but comes nowhere near Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It is also a much more competitive market.\n\nWhile Walmart is in second place with a 6.4% share, it trails far behind the leader at well over 37%. Third place Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is quickly growing and has a 3.6% share, according to Statista. Walmart is not likely to gain much ground on its rival, and as its digital footprint grows, it will face more margin pressure on those higher margin items that have carried it. The physical side of the business could also see smaller rivals nip off business around the edges.\n\nInvitation Homes (INVH) Residential neighborhood subdivision skyline Aerial shot\n\nSource: TDKvisuals / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvitation Homes (NASDAQ:INVH) is the largest single-family rental real estate investment trust (REIT). Focusing on the new homes market in the starter home and move-up niche, Invitation’s economies of scale have allowed its stock to hit a new 52-week high of just under $37 a share.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet it may have reached its limit. Because it has used its size and the demand for rental homes to quickly raise rates, it may have priced many people out of the market.\n\nInvitation Homes just reported second-quarter results that saw revenue rise 9% but net income plummeted 47% to 12 cents per share and occupancy rates slightly decreased. It still stands at 97.5% but it indicates this could be a trend as renters are tapped out on paying higher costs.\n\nThe homebuilder market also continues to slide. Single-family housing starts fell 2.2% in June, an eight-month low, while building permits declined 2.3%, the lowest point in a year. It was especially acute in the Northeast and West, which is a problem for Invitation, as 37% of its homes are located in the western part of the U.S. This signals a growing problem for Invitation stock.\n\nSpotify Technology (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) logo is on the screen of a smartphone with headphones plugged in.\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe world’s leading music streaming service Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) recently soared to a new all-time high of $346 per share after second-quarter revenue jumped 20% from last year. Total monthly active users (MAUs) rose 14% to 626 million but more importantly, premium subscribers jumped 12% to 246 million.\n\nLike Walmart, it raises the question of why sell now? While digital delivery of music and podcasts is likely to continue growing, Spotify will have to continue paying up for rights to the music. A small cabal of record labels controls 80% of the content thus, the oligopoly will be able to use its leverage to maintain pricing advantages by increasing costs.\n\nSpotify also faces significant competitive pressure from the likes of Apple, Amazon and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Because streaming is not their primary profit driver, they can run their businesses at break-even rates or even a loss.\n\nAmazon Music, for example, is a side benefit of its Prime member loyalty program, though it does also offer a premium service. Apple Music and Apple Podcasts, which has a 21% share of the market, likely will not lose many subscribers to Spotify as its customers tend to stay within its ecosystem. Even bigger is iHeartMedia (NASDAQ:IHRT) with a 24% share for its iHeartRadio platform, according to eMarketer. Some 33% of people also get their music from YouTube.\n\nWith Spotify stock trading at 40 times projected earnings, it is a rich premium to pay even for the industry leader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "U.S. stocks edged higher on Friday, with Wall Street ending a volatile week on a high as investors assessed new U.S. inflation data.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 654.27 points, or 1.64%, closing at 40,589.34. The S&P 500 rose 1.11%, finishing at 5,459.10, and the Nasdaq Composite increased by 1.03%, ending at 17,357.88.\n\nThe gains were driven by a combination of oversold market conditions, a stronger-than-expected GDP report on Thursday, and expectations that the Federal Reserve might start cutting rates soon due to economic resilience.\n\nDespite Friday's rally, the indexes still experienced losses for the week. The S&P 500 fell by 0.8%, while the Nasdaq dropped 2.1%, with both indexes recording back-to-back weekly declines for the first time since April.\n\nLooking ahead to this week, key economic data releases this week include the JOLTS job openings report on Tuesday, the ISM manufacturing index on Thursday, and the employment report on Friday.\n\nThe July FOMC meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, with the much-anticipated post-meeting statement set to be released at 2:00 PM ET, followed by Chair Powell’s press conference at 2:30 PM.\n\n“We think the July Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that concludes Wednesday will signal that the Fed is on track to cut soon and open the door to a cut in September but will stop short of explicitly pre-signaling a rate reduction at that following meeting,” Evercore ISI strategists said in a note.\n\n“We believe Powell will wait until Jackson Hole end August – by which time the Fed will have another month’s data – to deliver the explicit September cut signal,” they added.\n\nIt's that week of the Q2 earnings season\n\nApart from the FOMC’s statement, much of the market’s attention this week will be directed toward the Big Tech earnings results, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) all set to report in the coming days.\n\nWall Street analysts and investors are eager to gain insights into these tech giants' latest AI-driven capital spending and key trends in both enterprise and consumer technology expenditures.\n\nFor Apple, Barclays analysts expect a more favorable outlook for the September quarter, leading to upward revisions in estimates for iPhone, Mac, and Services, as well as their projections for fiscal 2025.\n\nThey said feedback from its Asia checks suggests better-than-expected September-quarter builds, with IP16 production in the low 20 million range. Late cycle demand for IP15 Pro models has slightly improved following WWDC due to their AI compatibility.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The stock has already run in anticipation of iPhones bottoming and the upcoming ramp of AI features,” analysts added.\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nOppenheimer: \"We remain positive on equities and continue to see fixed-income securities as complimentary to stocks in providing portfolio diversification. Some near-term profit-taking in the day-to-day action of the market particularly in segments of the market that have had exceptional run-ups since last year into this year should be expected and continues to appear to us quite normal. Such activity combined with a process of rebalancing and rotation into other segments of the stock market in our view can be healthy and should contribute to the broadening of the markets’ progress that began last year and becomes more evident in the second half of this year.\"\n\nUBS: “Following an impressive run since late last year, investors have increasingly become concerned about the pace and timing of artificial intelligence (AI) revenue and what it may mean for continued investments in AI infrastructure. With results still due from some big firms this week, market volatility is likely to continue. But we think the tech sector should find support in the coming weeks and resume its leadership. In fact, the recent pullback creates a re-entry opportunity, in our view, especially for those companies with strong earnings growth visibility.\"\n\nBTIG: “We can probably drift a bit higher on SPX towards its gap at 5550, before moving lower to fill a gap at 5375. Internally, the rotations remain vicious. The 12-day rate-of-change for RTY vs. NDX is over 20%. Since 1985, that ranks as the 5th biggest such move ever, only eclipsed by a few days in December 2000 and Jan. 2nd, 2001. Tactically we think a 'reversal of that reversion' is likely, with semis (SMH) oversold into support while homebuilders (ITB) are overbought and rallying on anticpated rate cuts, when in fact higher rates were part of their bull thesis over the last couple of years. We are also seeing breakouts among the defensive stocks, and areas like staples, utlities, REITs, and healthcare all look strong.\"\n\nStrategas: \"On average, the market bottoms 213 days later and 23% lower after the first Fed cut in a series of rate cuts. S&P 500 operating earnings decline by about 10% on average in the 12 months following the first easing. In short, be careful what you wish for when it comes to an easing of monetary policy. There is, naturally, a chance, broadly supported by recent policy, that policymakers have decided to effectively “outlaw” recessions. While it seems appealing, such an approach makes it difficult to control inflation. What we don’t know is whether the fact that President Biden is not seeking reelection weakens his resolve or urgency in providing stimulus for the broader economy in the months leading up to the election.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEarnings call: Eni aims for growth and net zero by 2030 amid strategic divestments\n\nEarnings call: ASE Technology sees mixed Q2 results, plans expansion\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Central bank meetings, Apple, corporate earnings - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures rise at the start of a week that includes several major central bank meetings, including the Federal Reserve, as well as earnings from key tech companies. Apple is taking its time incorporating artificial intelligence features into its key products, while the European corporate results season also continues.\n\n1. Fed leads central bank parade this week\n\nThe spotlight this week will be on central banks, with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan all set to hold policy meetings.\n\nThe Fed concludes its July policy meeting on Wednesday, and is widely expected to maintain its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, as it has done since last July.\n\nHowever, markets are overwhelmingly expecting a September rate cut, especially after Friday’s personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s favorite gauge of inflation, showed signs of cooling prices.\n\nThus the statement by Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be studied carefully to see if he sets the stage for a rate cut at the next meeting.\n\nThe Bank of Japan concludes its latest policy setting meeting on Wednesday, and speculation over the prospect of a rate hike is mounting despite a fragile economy and weak consumer sentiment.\n\nThe Bank of England meets on Thursday amid a great deal of uncertainty over whether policymakers will deliver their first rate cut since 2020.\n\nLast month, the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to keep rates on hold, but this decision is expected to be more finely balanced with policymakers having to judge between higher-than-expected service price inflation and weak growth.\n\n2. Futures rise ahead of Fed meeting, earnings\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Monday at the start of a week dominated by a Federal Reserve meeting as well as a number of key corporate earnings.\n\nBy 04:05 ET (08:05 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 60 points, or 0.2%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 12 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 70 points, or 0.4%.\n\nThe major indices slipped lower last week, with the Nasdaq Composite hit hard, in particular, by the cooling off of the tech trade.\n\nBig Tech earnings are set to continue in the coming days, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday, followed by Facebook-parent Meta (NASDAQ:META) on Wednesday and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as well as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday.\n\nDisappointing numbers could reignite the worries that caused a bruising selloff last week, with the Nasdaq suffering its worst day since late 2022 on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Apple’s AI plans take time\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking longer than expected including its recently unveiled artificial intelligence features, known as Apple Intelligence, into its flagship iPhone and iPad devices, and they will not be included in an initial software update, according to a report by Bloomberg.\n\nApple’s AI plans will miss the initial September releases of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, the Bloomberg report showed, but should be included with the October updates.\n\nThe company had in June unveiled a slew of new AI-powered features for its flagship devices, hoping the seemingly insatiable demand for all things AI would help the firm offset steadily slowing sales of its flagship iPhone.\n\nApple is set to report its June quarter earnings later this week, and is expected to log a sustained decline in device sales amid increased competition and saturation in the smartphone market.\n\n4. Heineken writes down Chinese investment’s value\n\nThere are also earnings in Europe to digest, as the second-quarter results season continues.\n\nHeineken (AS:HEIN) shares slumped 7% after the world’s second-largest brewer missed half-year estimates and announced a hefty impairment, as it wrote down the value of its 40% stake in China Resources Beer.\n\nThat said, Heineken also raised its full-year profit guidance, expecting to deliver organic operating profit growth of between 4% and 8% in 2024, compared to its previous guidance of between low and high single-digit growth.\n\nPhilips (AS:PHG) stock rose 10% after the Dutch medical device maker reported second-quarter results that beat expectations, boosted by higher earnings, the implementation of its restructuring program and insurance income linked to its Respironics product liability claims.\n\nPearson (LON:PSON) stock fell 3.5% after the educational publisher posted a drop in pretax profit compared with a year earlier, even as the company said it is on track to meet full-year expectations.\n\n5. Crude gains on raised Middle East tensions\n\nCrude prices rose Monday on concerns of a widening conflict in the Middle East, potentially impacting global supply, after a deadly rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.\n\nBy 04:05 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.1% to $77.20 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $80.38 a barrel.\n\nThe weekend’s strike reportedly killed at least 12 people, and has been blamed by both Israel and the U.S. on Iran-backed Hezbollah, who have denied responsibility for the attack.\n\nIsrael has vowed retaliation against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Israeli jets hit targets in southern Lebanon on Sunday.\n\nThese increasing tensions are also seen diminishing the prospect of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, as hopes of a ceasefire in Gaza had been gaining momentum.\n\nStill, gains are limited as the outlook for crude demand remains bleak.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCentral bank meetings, Apple, corporate earnings - what's moving markets\n\nTake Five: Scores on the doors for Big Tech\n\nJapan to achieve primary budget surplus next year, govt estimate shows\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we look at the largest handicraft exporting country in the world. To see the full free list, you can head over to the 13 Largest Handicraft Exporting Countries in the World.\n\nAccording to a recent report, the global handicraft market size was valued at over $1 trillion in 2023. Asia-Pacific dominates the market holding 36.3% of the overall share, followed by North America with an increasing import volume of handicrafts from Asian countries. The industry is forecast to reach $2.39 trillion in size by 2032 at a CAGR of 10.11%, driven by the rising trend of home décor and international travel recovering back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nHomeowners are increasingly investing in personalizing and improving their living spaces. A report by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies states that American households had spent over $150 billion since 2019 on rejuvenating their homes. Moreover, the rise of the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) culture in the United States has also gained popularity, resulting in many individuals taking it upon themselves to personalize their homes. On the other hand, the increase in international travel has led to a spike in demand for handicrafts. Tourists often seek locally-made artifacts, souvenirs, and products to take back from the countries they are visiting.\n\nHandicraft Market in the United States\n\nThe handicraft market size in the United States reached $294 billion in 2023 and is expected to go past the $600 billion mark in 2032, as interest in diverse traditions, craftsmanship, and cultural appreciation grows. Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) is one of the leading players in the American market. The e-commerce firm sells handmade, vintage, and crafts items such as craft supplies, jewelry, artwork, bags, clothes, decor items, and more. The company conducts craft fairs, allowing sellers to set up storefronts at the cost of a specified fee per item.\n\nAs of 2024, Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) has over 96 million active buyers, 9 million sellers, and more than 100 million items available for sale. In 2023, the company posted a gross merchandise sale (GMS) of $13.2 billion, while its revenue of $2.7 billion was 7% higher compared to last year. During the first quarter of 2024, Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) narrowly missed Wall Street’s GMS and earnings expectations, due to lower demand for handcrafted goods on its marketplace and increased competition from smaller rival platforms such as Temu. Its EPS was recorded at 48 cents, against forecasts of 49 cents.\n\nDespite the dip, investors remain confident about the company’s long-term potential. ClearBridge Mid Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\nStory continues\n\nOnline marketplace Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) also saw weaker performance as consumer preferences for goods lagged market expectations. However, we think there is substantial opportunity for the company to reaccelerate growth and increase margins as it extracts greater economic rents from its two-sided marketplace for artisanal goods due to commanding market share, lack of direct competition and support from new activist investors.\n\nAnother major player in the handicrafts market is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), the leading online retailer in the United States, with more than 2.5 billion visitors every month. In 2015, the company launched Amazon Handmade for businesses specializing in handcrafted products. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) does not publicize financials about the platform, but on its 5th anniversary in 2020, it announced that more than 100 makers on Amazon Handmade had crossed annual sales worth $1 million.\n\nThe company also stated that during this period, the number of active Amazon Handmade makers had increased by 750%, while its worldwide selection rose by 2000%. One of the benefits that sellers experience on Amazon Handmade is the massive potential reach considering that Amazon is one of the most visited websites in the US. Moreover, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) does not charge any listing fees either, and you only pay if you make a sale. The Largest Handicraft Exporting Country in the World\n\nAndrea Meling/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nThe largest handicraft exporting countries in the world are ranked in ascending order of their export trade volume. Data has been sourced from multiple independent sources for each country and we have considered figures for the latest year for which export volume numbers were available for each country.\n\nThe largest handicraft exporting country in the world is China.\n\n1. China\n\nExport Volume: $5 billion +\n\nWhile there is a scarcity of information on the export volume of Chinese handicrafts, there is consensus among most industry experts that it is the largest handicraft exporting country in the world, with an estimated trade volume of more than $5 billion. These handicrafts are mainly exported by Beijing to the United States, Japan, South Korea, India, and Europe. Handmade rugs, silk embroidery, lamps, bracelets, jewelry, woodware, glass mirrors, and table and kitchen accessories, are among the country’s top handicraft exports. Chinese crafts are also popular among tourists who visit the country, with an estimated $500 million worth of handicrafts sold annually to tourists who wish to take souvenirs back home from their journey.\n\nTo learn about other major handicraft exporting countries, you can check out our detailed report: 13 Largest Handicraft Exporting Countries in the World.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from handicraft exports to other business aspects in the industry; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Sunday as focus turned to an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting for more cues on interest rate cuts.\n\nFocus was also squarely on a string of June-quarter earnings from Wall Street’s biggest companies, such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which are due in the coming days.\n\nWall Street indexes had rebounded sharply on Friday after PCE price index data- which is the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge- read mostly within expectations for June, driving up optimism that the central bank will begin cutting rates in September.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.2% to 5,512.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.4% to 19,244.50 points by 19:40 ET (00:40 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 40,931.0 points.\n\nFed meeting set to provide rate cut clarity\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nBut any signals from the central bank on when it plans to begin cutting interest rates will be closely watched, amid increasing signs that inflation had cooled in recent months.\n\nA slew of Fed officials also said in recent addresses that the central bank was gaining more confidence in its battle against inflation, and that it did not need to see inflation reaching its 2% annual target to begin cutting rates.\n\nGeneral consensus is that the Fed will keep rates steady this week, but potentially offer signals on a September rate cut. Traders were seen pricing in a 25 basis point cut by the Fed in September, CME Fedwatch showed.\n\nApple, Microsoft set to report earnings\n\nEarnings reports from some of Wall Street’s biggest companies are on tap this week, with Microsoft and Apple set to report on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nOther tech majors including Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) are also set to report earnings through the week.\n\nThe results come in the wake of an extended rout in technology stocks, as the sector was walloped by profit-taking and as expectations of rate cuts saw investors pivot into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nUnderwhelming earnings from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) last week also sparked increased caution ahead of the tech earnings, with investors waiting to see whether increased investment in artificial intelligence was bearing fruit.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.1% to 5,459.10 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 1% to 17,357.88 points on Friday.

        "title": "7 Smart Stocks to Buy BEFORE They Report Q2 Earnings",
        "content": "We’re into the second week of the earnings season, and some of the top banking companies and other big guns have reported results. The start of the season looks good, and every investor hopes to see the same momentum as their favorite companies report. The earnings season also sees a lot of volatility in the market due to the reaction to the results, and if you want to make the most of this volatility, you want to find stocks to buy before earnings reports are filed.\n\nI believe these some of the biggest and most well-known companies will keep up their winning ways and report strong growth, taking the stocks higher. Since the market reaction to the results is temporary and could sometimes be extreme, it is important to make the most of the dip and pounce on these high-quality stocks in time.\n\nThese are excellent businesses with the potential to grow your money in the coming quarters. With that in mind, let’s look at the seven stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept. Nvidia company logo on screen of smartphone against blurred background of up trading stock chart\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you are only buying one stock before the earnings, it should be Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The tech giant is growing at an incredible rate, and the company’s results often take the market higher. NVDA stock often jumps following its earnings reports and the same could happen again.\n\nIt is expected that the company will beat expectations and meet its revenue estimate of $28 billion. Nvidia hasn’t announced an earnings release date, but Nasdaq estimates it will report on or about August 28.\n\nAdditionally, Goldman Sachs has reported that Nvidia could show how their customers make money using AI chips and this could be a game-changer for the business. As one of the largest market shareholders in the AI segment, Nvidia is here to stay and the sooner you buy the stock, the bigger your profits.\n\nI do not think the tighter restrictions on China will impact Nvidia’s business. There could be a temporary slump, but that’s all that will be, temporary. Trading at $113, the stock is up 128% year-to-date. Buy NVDA before it skyrockets again.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) prime label on a parcel\n\nSource: Claudio Divizia / Shutterstock.com\n\nI am certain Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will report blockbuster earnings this season. The company, which announced it will post earnings on August 1, is on a roll and has had an excellent 2024. The earnings, driven by cloud services and advertising will see a strong jump and could take the stock higher.\n\nAmazon recently held a Prime Day event, which saw $14.2 billion in sales in two days. This led to an 11% jump in the company’s e-commerce market, which shows its strength as an e-commerce player.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the majority of its revenue comes from cloud computing, and this segment will continue to report impressive growth as companies transition towards the cloud. As one of the best tech stocks to own, Amazon has dominated the market over the past few months.\n\nUp 20% so far in 2024, AMZN stock is exchanging hands for $182 and is a solid bet below $200. This stock is going beyond $200 very soon and is one of the best stocks to buy before earnings.\n\nJMP Securities has a buy rating for the stock and a price target of $225, while Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating and a price target of $240 per share.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is a pharmacy company raking in big money through its weight loss drugs. As one of the top industry players, Eli Lilly’s weight loss drugs, Zepbound and Mounjaro, generate the majority of its revenue. The obesity industry is lucrative and the demand for its drugs is only going to rise. To keep up with this, the company has already invested $9 billion in a new manufacturing facility.\n\nEli Lilly reports on August 8 and could beat expectations. In the previous quarter, the company saw a revenue of $1.8 billion from Mounjaro and $517 million from Zepbound. It has also received the FDA approval for its Alzheimer’s drug. We could see Eli Lilly soar higher from here and the results could give it a strong push. It is one of the best stocks to buy before earnings.\n\nTrading for $804, the stock is up 38% YTD and 76% in the past 12 months. This is one stock to buy before it inches closer to $1,000. The lofty stock price also makes it an ideal stock split candidate.\n\nWalmart (WMT)\n\nUp 32% so far this year, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock is trading for $70 as of writing and is on an impressive rally. The biggest grocery and retail giant has thousands of locations, which makes it easier for customers to pop into a store quickly. It is also known for offering products at low prices. The company saw a 6% revenue growth in the first quarter and announced a 9% dividend hike.\n\nWalmart is investing in automation and e-commerce to remain relevant. The company saw a 22% jump in e-commerce sales in the recent quarter. To maintain market dominance, Walmart is also opening five distribution centers for fresh food across the country. By 2026, management aims to have about two-thirds of the stores achieve some sort of automation.\n\nI believe Walmart will continue to display strength in the competitive industry and if you are a passive income investor, this stock will not disappoint you. BMO analyst has a price target of $80 for the stock and enjoys a dividend yield of 1.2%. Walmart plans to report earnings before the opening bell August 15.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) Man holds out a McDonald's bag with the golden arches logo on it at a drive-thru window.\n\nSource: Gargantiopa / Shutterstock\n\nA long-term restaurant stock, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) will report results before the market opens on July 29. The company hasn’t had a good 2024 and the stock is down 15% YTD.\n\nTrading at $252, the stock is a buy in the dip. The company reported flat revenue in the previous quarter, which led to the downfall of the stock. However, the company is not the one to sit back and bleed. In response to customer complaints about higher prices, it introduced a value $5 meal, which is a huge hit and it is being extended.\n\nThe company has suffered more than it deserved due to low consumer spending, high interest rates, and price hikes. However, this will pass and MCD will remain a solid stock for the long term. Such issues are temporary and it is hard to imagine that McDonald’s doesn’t have the resources to rebuild from here. It has been in a similar situation in the past and has handled it well.\n\nThe company can bounce back and any dip is a chance to buy. Additionally, it also enjoys a dividend yield of 2.6% and has a history of increasing dividends for 48 consecutive years.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe smartest AI stock to buy right now, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) has been on a rally all year. Up 58% in 2024, PLTR stock is exchanging hands for $26 and is a leader in the AI space.\n\nIf you think Nvidia is too expensive, buy PLTR and hold for the long term. The company reported terrific results for the first quarter with a 74% year-over-year jump in remaining performance obligations. It will be looking for similar performance when Palantir reports earnings August 5 after the market closes.\n\nThe company saw a 21% jump in revenue in the first quarter to $634 million, but management issued a lower-than-expected guidance. It is now aiming for revenue in the range of $649 million to $653 million. I believe Palantir will beat expectations with a strong increase in its commercial client count. Its deal momentum has impressed the market and the company has proved its strength in the competitive industry.\n\nIts growing client base, profitability, and exceptional product make it one of the best tech companies to own.\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US sports betting company DraftKings Inc. (DKNG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline sports betting platform DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) holds about 30% market share in the U.S. and operates in 26 states. With the growing popularity of sports betting, the company has become highly popular, and this is reflected in its revenue growth.\n\nAs states continue to legalize online betting, DraftKings will have bigger expansion opportunities. The company is also aiming for expansion in its current markets and is planning to launch a sports betting app in Washington D.C.\n\nFundamentally, DraftKings has shown strong progress with a 53% year-over-year jump in revenue in the first quarter. It lifted the annual guidance and is now aiming for revenue in a range from $4.8 billion to $5 billion. The company is steadily moving from losses to profit, and this will change its narrative.\n\nA solid long-term play, DKNG is a bet you won’t regret. Exchanging hands for $36, DKNG stock is up 3% in 2024 and is a buy before it reports earnings on August 1.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Could This Undervalued Stock Make You a Millionaire One Day?",
        "content": "Becoming a millionaire by investing is less about hitting the jackpot and more about playing the long game with patience, persistence, and a few wealth-building safeguards.\n\nHow to build wealth over time\n\nFirst off, you have to be patient. The market will zig and zag and maybe even zog, but you must stay cool and not panic during downturns. It may be tempting to sell when things look dark, but that may be the worst possible time to take action -- you're just converting temporary paper losses to real cash destruction.\n\nA long-term horizon lets you harness the magic of compounding returns, where your investment winnings start generating their own gains. The longer you stay invested, the bigger the difference you'll see from this snowballing effect.\n\nYou should also diversify your portfolio. Spread your investments across different industries, geographies, and company sizes to minimize risk. Going beyond stocks, you should also consider assets such as real estate, bonds, and maybe some cryptocurrencies. This way, a bad day in one sector won't ruin your whole plan. Going all-in on a single stock may work for a while, but even long-lived titans of industry can fall.\n\nInvesting discipline is also helpful. Regularly invest, rebalance your portfolio now and then, and don't let emotions drive your decisions. Stick to your long-term plan, but don't hesitate to update your strategy as you become a better investor or as market conditions change.\n\nThis patient buy-and-hold strategy is championed by investing legends like Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham. It's about picking quality stocks and holding on to them, letting time do its work.\n\nBy following these steps, you can steadily build wealth and achieve your millionaire dreams. Investing is a marathon, not a sprint, so keep your eye on the long-term prize.\n\nSo, I honestly can't say that any one stock will make you a millionaire. It takes a diversified portfolio to get there, and it will take time. But if I had to choose a single stock that just might deliver steady growth for several decades, it would be an experienced industry leader with a strong track record, consistent earnings, and a durable competitive advantage. And it needs to be ready for abrupt change if new technology, economic trends, and other unexpected changes turn the marketplace inside out.\n\nThat's a very short list, and I really don't recommend putting all your eggs in one basket. Still, my best bet for truly long-term durability and robust wealth creation has to be Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Amazon, of all stocks?\n\nDon't get me wrong -- several stocks look ready to stay on their feet for years and years. Alphabet is always searching for the next big technology to replace its dominant search and advertising business. Apple may be polishing the device to pick up the iPhone's fallen crown someday. IBM has been adapting to market changes for more than a century and might be around in 2124, too.\n\nBut none of them can match Amazon's cross-sector muscle and constant hunger for greater business gains.\n\nAmazon's e-commerce empire\n\nStarting as a simple online bookstore with minimal inventory overhead, Amazon has become the defining example of an e-commerce retailer. With a staggering market share of about 40% of total e-commerce in the U.S., the vast majority of Amazon's online retail sales come from North America. But it's a big world out there, and the American market accounts for just 19% of the global opportunity. Amazon has a lot of international growth left to do, even if it outduels chief rival Walmart on American soil.\n\nThat's Amazon's financial foundation, accounting for $434 billion of global sales in 2023. Besides providing a stable fiscal platform, the e-commerce business also helps Amazon establish new operations, such as shipping services, payment processing, and cloud computing. Remember, the soaring Amazon Web Services (AWS) business started as an experiment in getting more use out of Amazon's network of order-processing data centers.\n\nReaching into new markets\n\nThat's a story worth telling, too. AWS accounted for 16% of Amazon's total revenues last year but generated two-thirds of the company's operating profits. This fast-growing and wildly profitable business has its finger on the artificial intelligence (AI) boom these days, and I'm sure you'll see Amazon pull new tricks from its AWS sleeves after that.\n\nAWS is a great example of Amazon finding brand-new business ideas and taking the lead in the resulting market. I can't wait to see what else the company will do over the next 10, 20, or 30 years. Beyond that, I'm probably more worried about my own lifespan than Amazon's. The company was built to last.\n\nAgain, I don't recommend betting your entire nest egg on Amazon or any other single stock. But this stock could certainly help you build wealth in the long haul, and maybe you should hold a larger stake in Amazon stock than in other ideas. Given enough time and a large enough starting position -- not to mention consistent long-term buying -- Amazon could very well push you over the millionaire goal line someday.\n\nWith earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) soaring to a record high of $98.7 billion in the last four quarters, Amazon's stock is changing hands at a measly enterprise value to EBITDA valuation ratio of 19. That's well below the five-year average of 25. In other words, Amazon's stock is on fire sale. If you haven't started a position in this uniquely robust stock yet, this would be a great time to take that first step.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $692,784!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Why the tech stock selloff isn't over yet: Wall Street strategists",
        "content": "The tech rout is far from over.\n\nThat’s the warning from strategists this week as investors dump big tech stocks in favor of previously unloved areas of the market. The Nasdaq 100 closed the week down 2.7%, marking the third week in a row of declines, with the technology sector suffering its largest single-day percentage drop since October 2022.\n\nThe culprits: bets on Fed rate cuts, Tesla’s (TSLA) lackluster earnings, and fears about Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) AI spending ramp.\n\n“Valuations were priced to perfection from an earnings standpoint and from an interest rate standpoint, that eventually we would see some sort of a valuation correction,” Verdence Capital Advisors chief investment officer Megan Horneman told me.\n\nHorneman, who warned the AI trade is “hitting a wall,” added that this week’s rotation out of big tech is only the start of a “valuation correction.”\n\nThe significant shift under way has pushed small caps to the top of investors' buying lists. The Russell 2000 (RUT) recorded weekly gains for the third week in a row, marking its best three week stretch since 2022. Data compiled by Bespoke found that the outperformance spread between the Russell 2000 and the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) over the last 12 trading days, in favor of the small-cap index, is the second most extreme in the history of the two indices.\n\n“With multiples as high as they are for the Mag seven, they're building in earnings growth. And if you don't see that earnings growth, that means that valuations come into question,” Commonwealth Financial Network’s Brad McMillan explained to me.\n\n“There’s a threat of more pressure ahead,” McMillan said.\n\nAnd that risk of slower profit growth, coupled with increased spending on AI, could signal that the “epic momentum reversal” will persist, unless big tech raises forward revenue guidance, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn a note to clients, Goldman Sachs’ David Kostin wrote investors are starting to worry about the prospect of “overinvestment” in AI without timely proven returns, noting that Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet are driving the bulk of the spending.\n\n“Consensus estimates of 2024 and 2025 capex and R&D spending by the hyperscalers have increased by $65 billion compared with expectations at the start of the year. However, analysts have lifted their sales forecasts for 2025 and 2026 by only $36 billion — a gap of nearly $30 billion,” Kostin wrote.\n\n“These firms during the past six months have dramatically increased their planned spending on AI initiatives but it is not apparent when the return will come — in 2027, 2028, 2029, or perhaps not at all,” he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs our markets reporter Josh Schafer noted, two charts in Yahoo Finance’s Chartbook suggest further selling ahead. Analysis by Truist’s Keith Lerner found that the S&P 500 sees an average correction of about 9% in the second half of the year, after the index rallies more than 10% in the first six months.\n\nMeanwhile, BMO Capital Markets chief investment officer Brian Belski’s review of past performance found that stocks usually drop an average of 9.4% in the second year of a cyclical bull market, which started in October 2022.\n\n“This market has become quite frothy with everybody looking to big cap tech stocks and chasing the market,” Belski told me. “It's really difficult to be overweight Apple or overweight Nvidia … especially given how much they've rallied.”\n\nSafe to say, earnings results this coming week from Meta, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft will be a crucial measuring stick. Any sort of disappointment, similar to what we saw from Alphabet and Tesla this week, could trigger more carnage for the tech market.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "2 Magnificent Stocks That I'm \"Never\" Selling",
        "content": "Long-term investors aim to identify and buy great companies, and to never have to sell. Warren Buffett once said his favorite holding period was forever. After all, why not make one great decision and let it reward you for years to come? To be clear, never selling is aspirational -- there are certainly valid reasons to sell a stock. But I think setting the default to \"never\" selling results in better outcomes.\n\nHere are two companies that have earned a spot on my \"never\" sell list. Each has competitive advantages in its industry, a track record of success, and plenty of room ahead for continued growth and strong financial performance. Let's look at what makes these stocks long-term holdings in my portfolio.\n\nAmazon\n\nChances are that if you've purchased something online recently, you did so on Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Put simply, that could be the thesis statement for owning the company. As long as Amazon is the go-to online marketplace for millions of people, there's a good chance it will remain a winning stock for investors.\n\nThat may not have been as believable in early 2023, when the stock returned to its pandemic crash low and investor sentiment was souring on the e-commerce giant. However, in the time since, the stock has been on an incredible run as the company has figured out its cost structure and improved the bottom line.\n\nWhile online shopping is what comes to mind when people think about Amazon, it's important to also remember that it's the leader in cloud infrastructure with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon's market share lead should be sustained, as the company is seeing increased demand for its services to accommodate the rush toward artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nInterestingly, AWS isn't the fastest-growing part of Amazon's business anymore. In first-quarter 2024, AWS' revenue growth of 17% was outpaced by advertising, which grew by 24% to $12 billion. Advertising revenue is still significantly less than the e-commerce and AWS parts of the business, but its rapid growth is another reason to be bullish on Amazon's future.\n\nWinmark\n\nWhile Amazon is one of the best-known companies in the world, Winmark(NASDAQ: WINA) flies under the radar. Winmark is a franchisor of stores that resell used items. Its brands include Play it Again Sports, Plato's Closet, Once Upon a Child, and others. Winmark has been a winning stock for a long time, but it's still relatively small, with a market capitalization of $1.4 billion.\n\nWhat's attractive about owning Winmark's stock is its business model. As a franchisor, most of the costs associated with owning a retail business fall on the franchisees. This provides Winmark with attractive margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, in second-quarter 2024, Winmark's gross margin was 95.8%. Looking further down the income statement, this led to a net profit margin of 51.8%. These margins have also ticked up slowly and steadily over time. WINA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWhile it's clear that the economics of being a franchisor work out well for Winmark and its shareholders, there's evidence that its franchisees are happy as well. In Q2 2024, Winmark had a 100% renewal rate in four out of five of its brands.\n\nWinmark adds new stores throughout the year, but the pace is deliberate. So far in 2024, the company has grown its total store count by 1.2%. The fact that its franchisees renew in such high numbers is a good sign for the future of the business, as it helps supplement the slow but steady store growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Big Tech earnings, a Fed meeting, and the July jobs report: What to know this week",
        "content": "The stock market rally is in its most fragile state in months ahead of Wall Street's busiest week of the summer.\n\nThe S&P 500 (GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) recently had their worst single-day drops since 2022 as the indexes struggled to recover losses during a Friday rally. All three major averages closed the final full week of July lower. The S&P 500 was down more than 1%, while the Nasdaq fell over 2.3%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose about 0.6%.\n\nIn the week ahead, a Federal Reserve meeting, the July jobs report, and earnings from Big Tech stalwarts Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) will drive the direction of markets to kick off August.\n\nUpdates on job openings, activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, and consumer confidence are also on the calendar.\n\nA busy week of corporate earnings awaits, with 171 members of the S&P 500 expected to report quarterly results. AMD (AMD), Arm (ARM), Boeing (BA), McDonald's (MCD), and Starbucks (SBUX) will be among the companies highlighting the schedule.\n\nA September 'signal'\n\nThe Fed will announce its latest monetary policy decision next Wednesday. Markets largely expect the central bank to hold rates steady at its July meeting.\n\nRecent updates in the economy have investors eyeing when the Fed's first cut will come though. In June, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out the cost of food and energy and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 2.6% over the prior year, its lowest annual increase in more than three years. Separate data for the month showed a significant decrease in another inflation metric, the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market has shown signs of cooling. The ratio of job openings to unemployed workers is back at pre-pandemic levels, and last month, the unemployment rate hit its highest level since November 2021.\n\nThis has prompted markets to price in the Fed's first cut in September, and investors will be keenly listening to Jerome Powell's press conference on Wednesday for any confirmation.\n\n\"The overall tone from the meeting, including from Chair Powell's press conference, should signal that a rate cut in September is a reasonable baseline without pre-committing to this action,\" Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti wrote in a note to clients. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell departs after holding a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on interest rate policy in Washington, U.S., May 1, 2024. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nLabor market look\n\nFriday will bring a fresh look at monthly job additions as economists continue to debate whether recent cooling in the labor market represents normalization or more significant deterioration.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe July jobs report is expected to show 175,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy, with unemployment holding steady at 4.1%, according to data from Bloomberg. In June, the US economy added 206,000 jobs while the unemployment rate rose to 4.1%.\n\n\"The 180K increase to payrolls we expect in July would still be a respectable gain, but would underscore that, directionally, the jobs market is deteriorating,\" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients. \"By a range of measures, including the unemployment rate, quit rate, level of temporary help workers and small business hiring plans, the labor market is not only softer than a year or two ago, but weaker compared to its pre-pandemic state.\"\n\nGiven this backdrop, whether unemployment holds steady or ticks up as it has for the past three months will be in particular focus.\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nThe stock market's recent slump has included a big sell-off in tech.\n\nSince July 10, Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) — which tracks Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — has dropped about 12%.\n\nTruist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner recently told Yahoo Finance the pullback has made sense given the runup in Big Tech stocks over the past year and how overstretched positioning in many of the large tech stocks had become. This, combined with investors rotating into less-loved areas of the market rally that could benefit from the Fed cutting interest rates, has become the hallmark of the market action over the past two weeks.\n\nEarnings from four of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple — could change that. But as the sell-off after Alphabet and Tesla earnings showed in the prior week, it's been a tough season to impress investors with earnings.\n\n\"When we look at the earnings that we've seen over the last week, I don't think the earnings are bad,\" Lerner said. \"I don't think the businesses, the fundamental business trends, are bad, but I just think that they were not good enough relative to these really high [expectations].\"\n\nAnd, to Lerner's point, stocks that miss on Wall Street estimates for earnings, revenue, or both are seeing significantly worse price reactions in the next trading day than typically seen over the past five years, according to research from Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel.\n\nFor now, Emanuel wrote in a note to clients, \"earnings remain a catalyst for volatility, not higher S&P 500 prices.\"\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, July (-14.2 expected, -15.1 prior)\n\nEarnings: McDonald's (MCD), Philips (PHG), Tilray (TLRY)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P CoreLogic 20-city year-over-year NSA, May (7.2% prior); Conference Board consumer confidence, July (99.7 expected, 100.4 prior) JOLTS job openings, June (8.14 million prior); Dallas Fed services activity, (-4.1 prior)\n\nEarnings: Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), BP (BP), Caesars Entertainment (CZR), Electronic Arts (EA), First Solar (FSLR), JetBlue (JBLU), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), Merck (MRK), Pinterest (PINS), Pfizer (PFE), Procter & Gamble (PG), Starbucks (SBUX), SoFi (SOFI)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended July 26 (-2.2% prior); ADP private payrolls, July (+168,000 expected, +150,000 prior); Minnesota Chicago PMI, July (44.0 expected, 47.4 prior); Employment cost index, second quarter (1.0% expected, 1.2% prior); Federal Reserve monetary policy decision (no interest rate change expected)\n\nEarnings: Meta (META), Altria (MO), Arm (ARM), Boeing (BA), Carvana (CVNA), Generac (GNRC), Humana (HUM), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC), Mastercard (MA), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), Paycom (PAYC), Qualcomm (QCOM)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, July, (+19.8% prior); Unit labor costs, second quarter (+4% prior); Nonfarm productivity, fourth quarter (+1.6% expected, +5.2% prior); Initial jobless claims, week ending July 27 (235,000 prior); S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, July final (49.5 prior); Construction spending, month-over-month, July (+0.2% expected, -0.1% prior); ISM manufacturing, July (49 expected, 48.5 prior); ISM prices paid, July (52.1 prior)\n\nEarnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Block (SQ), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Canada Goose (GOOS), Coinbase (COIN), ConocoPhillips (COP), Crocs (CROX), DraftKings (DKNG), Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Mobileye (MBLY), Moderna (MRNA), Roku (ROKU) SiriusXM (SIRI), Wayfair (W)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, July (+175,000 expected, +206,000 prior); Unemployment rate, January (4.1% expected, 4.1% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, July (+0.3% expected, +0.3% prior); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, July (+3.7% expected, +3.9% prior); Average weekly hours worked, July (34.4 expected, 34.3 prior); Labor force participation rate, July (62.6% previously); Factory orders, June (+0.5% expected, -0.5% prior); Durable goods orders, June final (-6.6% prior)\n\nEarnings: Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks That Scored Big on Amazon Prime Day",
        "content": "Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) held its annual Prime Day sales extravaganza on July 16 and 17. Shoppers spent an estimated $14.2 billion this year over the two-day event, an 11% increase from last year.\n\nWhile Amazon is light on details of how much was actually spent, it said it was another record-breaking sale that saw a record number of people sign up for Prime. While some of those undoubtedly signed up just to take advantage of the sales and will cancel afterward, Amazon likely significantly built on its estimated 180.1 million Prime users in the U.S.\n\nYet Amazon is not alone in running a sale. Other retailers realizing the interest consumers have in saving money during the event, piggyback on Prime Day with their own sales. However, it is becoming increasingly common amongst Amazon’s main rivals to avoid directly competing against the e-commerce giant. Instead, many run their own sales events either just before or just after Amazon.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three Amazon Prime Day stocks that benefited from the sales-apalooza either with their own doorbuster event or on Prime Day itself.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) used to compete directly with Amazon by holding sales on Prime Day but it hasn’t for the past couple of years. Now that it has its own member loyalty program, Walmart+ Week is an exclusive opportunity for subscribers to save big. It ran a month ahead of Prime Day, going from June 17 to June 23.\n\nAccording to PYMNTS Intelligence, its survey of Walmart+ members found the fourth annual event was used as a chance to stock up on groceries. Two-thirds of shoppers bought grocery products while the next largest items were health and beauty products where approximately 60% of shoppers purchased them. Clothing and accessories was third with about 50% of members buying.\n\nAs the sales event was both online and in-store, PYMNTS found online shoppers bought 20.6 items on average versus 14.9 items for those who visited a brick-and-mortar store.\n\nWhat the PYMNTS Intelligence survey indicates is that Walmart continues to do well at what it does best. Particularly during periods of elevated inflation, shoppers go to the retailer to get the best deals on essentials, primarily food for their families. As they were also able to take advantage of free shipping, Walmart remains a destination for everyday low prices.\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTarget (NYSE:TGT) was another retailer that used to go head-to-head with Amazon on Prime Day but decided holding its own event separately was a better use of its resources. The retailer has held week-long savings events in the past but this year it launched Circle Week in April. It coincided with Target revamping its loyalty program to include a new $99 tier, Target Circle 360.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts second Circle Week event of the year was held just ahead of Prime Day between July 7 and July 13. It was exclusive only to Target Circle members, whether in the free or paid tier. Like Walmart+ Week, the Target sale was also an omnichannel event letting members shop online, in-store or via the Target app.\n\nTarget may have even gotten a benefit over Amazon but at the expense of the sellers. CNBC reported that Amazon’s pricing algorithm detected the sales price on Target’s website. It caused third-party retailers to lose the “buy box” location on Amazon. That is the listing that first pops up when a consumer searches for a product. While a sale may have been made at Target, merchants found their Amazon sales imploded.\n\nTarget’s sales week success hasn’t translated yet to its stock price. Shares are flat in July though they are up 5% year-to-date and 11% higher over the past 12 months.\n\nBest Buy (BBY) A photo of a Best Buy store front.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectronics retailer Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) held a Black Friday in July sales promotion that coincided with Prime Day. Yet it started one day earlier on July 15. According to the website Tinuiti, many other retailers also ran competing events. However, only Best Buy ranked high enough to register alongside Walmart and Target.\n\nWhere 35% of consumers said they would shop Walmart+ Week and 34% said Target Circle Week was on their radar, Best Buy’s summer sale was being considered by 11%. Yes, significantly less than the others, but miles ahead of other retailers.\n\nIt also offered some incredible deals. TVs were starting at $64, Chromebooks went for $139 and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watches were offered for $299, a $100 savings. And unlike other retailers, you didn’t need to belong to a member loyalty program to score the deals. However, if you were a subscriber, you got additional savings.\n\nAfter falling hard last year, Best Buy stock has been scrambling to recover. From its low point in November, BBY is up 40%. It has found its footing again in the digital space. Best Buy is effectively using its stores as fulfillment centers for online sales. Some 35% of its stores now account for 70% of ship-from-store volume. Best Buy has become a competitive threat again to other consumer electronics retailers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Opinion: These Will Be the 3 Largest Companies in 2029",
        "content": "A lot can happen in five years. For example, in 2019, most people had never heard of coronaviruses, mRNA vaccines, or social distancing.\n\nSimilarly, five years can change the stock market, too. As new technologies arrive, the corporate hierarchy will evolve. Existing leaders can stumble, and rising stars can take their place.\n\nSo, who will be the three largest companies by market cap in 2029? Here's my prediction. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nBy 2029, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) will regain its position as the largest public company in the world.\n\nThere are many reasons why Microsoft will leapfrog Apple. Still, I think the central reason is that software will become more important than hardware over the next five years, which will significantly benefit Microsoft and hurt Apple.\n\nGranted, Microsoft isn't just a software company anymore. It makes gaming devices, laptops, and tablets. However, those products make up a fraction of Microsoft's sales. Most of the company's revenue comes from cloud computing, application and operating system software, and, increasingly, artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMicrosoft's long-standing partnership and investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has already paid off, as the company has integrated many ChatGPT-powered features into its software products. Moreover, as AI technology develops, investors should expect further integration and innovation that will keep Microsoft's iconic software suite on top for years to come.\n\nOver time, that should help Microsoft overtake Apple, whose revenue growth has stalled as iPhone sales have leveled out. Granted, Apple has some exciting AI-powered features that have reinvigorated its stock price. However, over the long run, Apple must develop new, innovative hardware, or its stock will fail to keep up with Microsoft's.\n\nNvidia\n\nIt's been the hottest stock on Wall Street for the last two years, and it's currently the third-largest company by market cap. It's Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and I think it will be the second-largest company by 2029.\n\nGranted, I've recently turned neutral on Nvidia due to its lofty valuation. However, I still believe the company can reach the  No. 2 spot on this list within five years.\n\nThat's because Nvidia's graphics processing unit (GPU) technology is the industry standard. When companies want to develop cutting-edge AI systems, they need Nvidia GPUs--lotsofthem. Companies like MetaPlatforms and Tesla have bought hundreds of thousands of these chips to perfect the metaverse or crack full self-driving.\n\nIn turn, that's led to a massive jump in Nvidia's revenue. Annual sales have skyrocketed nearly threefold, from $25 billion to $70 billion in less than two years.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile I have concerns about whether Nvidia can keep meeting (and beating) sales estimates as competition from AMD and others heats up, I still think the company's stock can outperform Apple's.\n\nAmazon\n\nFinally, there's Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). It is currently the fifth-largest American company, with a market cap of $1.9 trillion. But by 2029, I think it will leapfrog Alphabet and Apple to reach No. 3. Here's why.\n\nLike Microsoft, Amazon relies on a diversified set of revenue streams. It operates the world's largest cloud services platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's largest e-commerce network, and one of the top advertising networks. Crucially, it also has underappreciated assets in AI and robotics.\n\nConsider Amazon's vast warehouse network. The company has over 750,000 robots working inside these facilities, and it plans to add many more in the coming years. Indeed, the company has already doubled its robotic workforce over the last three years.\n\nNot only does this use of robots make Amazon more operationally efficient (leading to more profits for shareholders), but it also puts Amazon in a prime position to grow its robotics business -- if it so chooses. The company could use the lessons learned from its robotics operation to assist other organizations, from restaurants to retail, as robots in the workplace become the norm.\n\nFinally, Amazon's AI-powered smart speakers present an opportunity for growth. Over 500 million have been sold, but they've never been particularly profitable. However, a recent internal shakeup should give investors hope that Amazon could solve the puzzle of how to make in-home AI speakers more than just novelties. If the company can pull it off, it could be a vast new revenue stream for Amazon.\n\nTo sum up, Amazon is performing well with just its existing business streams. However, if the company can cash in on its robotics and AI potential, I think Amazon could climb past Alphabet and Apple to grab the No. 3 spot by 2029.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Daniel Loeb Owns $2.2 Billion Worth of These 3 Brilliant Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "There's no getting around it: The oncoming storm of artificial intelligence (AI) is only just beginning, and the flag-bearer for this shifting paradigm is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company has become virtually unforgettable as a key player in the AI revolution thanks to its gold-standard graphics processing units (GPUs), which provide the computational horsepower that underpins AI.\n\nIf you have any doubts, consider this: For the company's fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), record revenue of $26 billion soared 262% year over year, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.98 surged 629%.\n\nYet, as the AI revolution gains steam, some investors are questioning Nvidia's staying power, concerned with the onset of competition and a rich valuation. As a result, some investors have already moved on from the chipmaker in search of the \"next big thing\" in AI. Perusing the holdings of a highly successful hedge fund manager might provide food for thought.\n\nBillionaire Daniel Loeb is one such money manager, having made a name for himself as the CEO of Third Point, which he founded in 1995. From humble beginnings and starting capital of just $3.4 million, Loeb parlayed his seed money into assets under management of nearly $7.8 billion.\n\nHe's been crystal clear regarding his opinion on the potential of AI. He believes it will be \"transformational,\" providing the catalyst for a \"profound economic upheaval.\" Loeb believes so strongly in AI that it's the \"key element\" in the thesis of nearly half the fund's stock holdings.\n\nThree are by far his largest AI holdings. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 1: Amazon -- 11.8% of holdings\n\nThird Point is heavily invested in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), having held a stake in the e-commerce and cloud kingpin for years. Loebe waxed poetic about the vast potential of Amazon in an interview in 2022. While the company was then valued at roughly $1.6 trillion, Loeb believed Amazon possessed $1 trillion in \"untapped value.\" He argued that the online retail segment alone was worth more than $1 trillion, while its cloud infrastructure segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), was worth $1.5 trillion.\n\nLoeb recently suggested that the \"most direct consequence\" of the rapid adoption of AI is \"an acceleration in cloud usage\" for businesses looking to leverage the large language models that form the foundation of generative AI. This includes the big three cloud providers -- Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. He further believes these cloud services are the \"'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush and should benefit regardless of which products ultimately 'strike gold.'\"\n\nStory continues\n\nLoeb increased his Amazon holdings by roughly 21% in the first quarter, bringing his total stake to 5.1 million shares worth about $930 million and nearly 12% of Third Point's portfolio. Furthermore, at roughly 3 times forward sales, Amazon is still attractively priced.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 2: Microsoft -- 9.5% of holdings\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is widely credited with helping to kick off the mad dash to AI adoption, as the company was quick off the mark to integrate AI across a broad cross-section of its products and services.\n\nThe poster child for those efforts is Microsoft Copilot, the company's AI-fueled digital assistant. Copilot offers a suite of functionality that helps to streamline and automate time-consuming chores, boosting productivity in the process. Not only is demand for Copilot robust, but AI is also helping increase market share for Microsoft's Azure cloud.\n\nWhile the company has thus far been mum about how much incremental revenue Copilot has generated, Loeb estimates that \"Copilot software ... could increase [Microsoft's] revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.\"\n\nThird Point trimmed its Microsoft position by about 12% in the first quarter, even as the total value of its position increased -- thanks to a dividend payment and the stock's 12% move higher in Q1.\n\nMicrosoft stock was currently selling for a premium at 36 times earnings. That said, the company is already one of the early beneficiaries of the AI revolution and has positioned itself for further gains.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 3: Meta Platforms -- 7.7% of holdings\n\nThe ongoing recovery of the digital advertising market likely factored into Loeb's considerable position in Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), but the company has also established itself as a dark horse candidate in AI.\n\nMeta has a distinguished history of using AI to surface relevant content to users on its various social media platforms and target the advertising that generates 98% of the company's revenue.\n\nMeta's current efforts are focused firmly on the future. The company recently debuted the latest version of its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which is available on each major cloud infrastructure platform, paying Meta a fee to carry it.\n\nWith billions of daily users on its social media platforms, the company boasts a treasure trove of data to train its AI systems, which have been gaining popularity. Furthermore, this is an entirely new revenue stream for Meta, though the impact on its financial results isn't yet clear.\n\nThird Point initiated a position in Meta during the third quarter of 2023 and has increased his holdings each quarter since that time, recently boosting his position by 7%. That brings Third Point's stake to 1.24 million shares worth $577 million and nearly 8% of the hedge fund's holdings.\n\nLoeb hasn't said much about his Meta position except to point out that it was the fund's biggest winner in the first quarter. That said, Loeb focuses on \"high-quality companies trading at reasonable valuations,\" and Meta certainly qualifies using those criteria. The stock currently sells for less than 27 times earnings, a discount compared to a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead",
        "content": "Investing.com -- It’s set to be a big week for markets with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan all set to hold policy meetings. Also in the spotlight will be Friday’s U.S. jobs report and more big tech earnings results. Here's your look at what's happening in markets for the week ahead.\n\nFed decision\n\nWith markets currently pricing in an 88% chance of a September rate cut amid signs of cooling inflation and an uptick in the unemployment rate this week’s policy statement by Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be firmly in the spotlight.\n\nThe Fed, which concludes its July policy meeting on Wednesday, has said it wants to be confident inflation is moving sustainably towards its 2% target before cutting interest rates.\n\nInflation data on Friday underscored expectations for the U.S. central bank to set the stage for a September rate cut this week.\n\nThe Fed has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range since last July. It has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points since 2022.\n\nNonfarm payrolls\n\nWednesday’s Fed statement will put the already closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, due out on Friday, under heightened scrutiny as investors try to gauge whether recent signs of cooling in the labor market continued in July.\n\nEconomists are expecting the U.S. economy to have created 177,000 jobs in July, moderating from 206,000 in the prior month.\n\nThe unemployment rate, which has ticked higher in each of the past three months, is expected to hold steady at 4.1%.\n\nAhead of Friday’s report the U.S. will release data on JOLTS job openings on Tuesday.\n\nBig tech earnings continue\n\nBig Tech earnings are set to continue in the coming days and any disappointments could potentially further roil markets already on edge amid worries over stretched stock valuations.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday, followed by Facebook-parent Meta (NASDAQ:META) on Wednesday and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday.\n\nDisappointing numbers could re-ignite the worries that caused a bruising selloff in U.S. stocks on Wednesday, when both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their worst day since late 2022.\n\nThe huge run-up in tech stocks may have set a high bar for their results. Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) whose earnings were one of the triggers for the selloff, actually reported better-than-expected revenue, but investors grew wary that rising spending on AI infrastructure could squeeze margins, sending shares 5% lower.\n\nBank of England meeting\n\nThe BoE meets on Thursday with investors divided over whether policymakers will deliver their first rate cut since 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe level of uncertainty is higher than usual in the run-up to the meeting as key central bank officials have not spoken publicly for over two months due to rules in the lead up to Britain’s July 4's general election.\n\nInvestors have been left guessing whether recent higher-than-expected service price inflation is enough to prevent the BoE cutting rates from their 16-year high of 5.25%.\n\nLast month, the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to keep rates on hold, but minutes of the decision recorded that it had been a \"finely balanced\" decision for some of the policymakers who had not voted for a cut.\n\nBank of Japan decision\n\nThe BOJ concludes its latest policy setting meeting on Wednesday and speculation over the prospect of a rate hike is mounting after high-profile politicians, including the prime minister, hinted at the need for near-term policy normalisation.\n\nThe impact of the weak yen on household and business spending appears to be turning the exchange rate into a central issue for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's leadership convention in September.\n\nThe fact that the currency has rebounded by a staggering 10 yen per dollar from three-decade lows at the start of the month hasn't deterred some from predicting a July hike.\n\nThey argue the BOJ can get the most bang for its buck by hiking into a rallying yen. Others worry a fragile economy and weak consumer sentiment couldn't weather higher borrowing costs, with slowing U.S. growth set to have a knock-on effect already.\n\n--Reuters contributed to this report\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTop 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead\n\nAustralia signs $1.4 billion deal to upgrade navy submarines\n\nBeing boring key to central bank success says SNB's Jordan\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nAnalysts lift Nvidia PTs ahead of Blackwell launch\n\nPiper Sandler analysts on Monday reaffirmed an Overweight rating for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and raised their target price from $120 to $140 in a move driven by strong expectations ahead of the company's earnings report for the July quarter and guidance for the October quarter.\n\n\"We see the strong business trends exhibited over the prior year by NVDA set to continue aided by the official launch of the Blackwell architecture in the October quarter,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThe investment bank views the launch of the Blackwell architecture as a catalyst for a new phase of growth, anticipating continued strong demand from cloud service providers (CSPs), enterprises, and sovereign entities. Analysts believe that demand for NVIDIA's upcoming B100/B200 products will significantly outpace supply.\n\nIn its bullish scenario, Piper Sandler says NVDA could exceed expectations by more than $2 billion in reported revenue for the July quarter, thanks to a recovery in networking supply.\n\n\"In our view, NVDA continues to be a premier player in the accelerated compute and gen AI end market,\" the analysts added.\n\nSimilarly, Loop Capital analysts increased their price target for Nvidia stock from $120 to $175, citing the company's potential to significantly exceed consensus revenue and earnings estimates for fiscal 2026.\n\nAmazon ‘most favored among mega-caps’ - Wells Fargo\n\nWells Fargo analysts have identified Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as the \"most favored long among mega-caps\" as the tech giant approaches its second-quarter earnings report.\n\nDespite mixed hedge fund positioning for competitors like Meta (NASDAQ:META), Wells Fargo believes Amazon stands out due to strong performance expectations and positive forward commentary.\n\nThe bank's analysts predict an 18% increase in Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue for the second quarter, with a sufficient operating income (OI) guidance of $16 billion for the third quarter.\n\nWells Fargo also plans to closely monitor Amazon's air freight commentary, estimating its impact on third-quarter operating income to be in the $200-$400 million range.\n\n\"See AMZN as the most favored long among mega-caps vs. META with more mixed HF positioning,\" the analysts stated, highlighting strong investor sentiment towards Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey note that the upcoming second-quarter earnings reports will be critical for understanding CapEx allocation and return time frames, especially given potential changes in AI strategy at AWS following the recent CEO change.\n\nApple seen as ‘more stable AI play for volatile times’, PT hiked\n\nRaymond James analysts have raised their stock price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $250 from $200, describing the company as \"a more stable AI play for volatile times.\" The firm maintained an Outperform rating on the stock, expecting a slight beat in F3Q24 results and an outlook in line with previous expectations.\n\nThis optimism is based on recent conversations in the Asia supply chain, TSM results, and China CAICT data, all indicating positive near-term trends for iPhone and Mac sales.\n\n\"We expect a slight beat and largely in-line outlook,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nWhile near-term results may not significantly impact the AI narrative, Raymond James remains \"optimistic that upcoming AI features will drive a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle.\"\n\nThe firm pointed to upward revisions in iPhone 16 builds for the second half of 2024, based on supply chain conversations, and mentioned significant changes to the internals of the iPhone 17, indicating Apple's increased focus on enhancing on-device AI capabilities.\n\n\"Supply chain data also points to material changes to iPhone 17 internals, suggesting that Apple is looking to do more AI on the device,\" analysts noted.\n\nApple's unique position in offering on-device AI features stems from its strong ecosystem, advanced hardware capabilities, and a focus on privacy.\n\n\"We believe Apple is in a unique position to offer on-device AI features given its ecosystem strength, hardware capabilities, and privacy focus,\" the note added.\n\nBaird: Buy QCOM after recent pullback\n\nEarlier in the week, Baird analysts added Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock as a “Bullish Fresh Pick” and increased their target price on the stock to $250.\n\nThis revision follows Baird’s initial channel feedback, which revealed a procurement units estimate of over 90 million for the upcoming iPhone 16, a significant rise from the low 80 million units of previous iPhone launches.\n\n“Similar to the Galaxy S24 launch earlier this year, AI is the driver,” analysts noted.\n\nThey expect strengthening demand trends in Qualcomm's handset business in the third quarter of the calendar year, following a seasonal trough in the second quarter and a year-over-year comparison trough in the first quarter.\n\nBaird’s team believes that AI will drive double-digit increases in Qualcomm's average selling prices (ASPs) for various components, starting with the iPhone 16 in the second half of this year. Moreover, initial AI content in high-end phones from Chinese smartphone OEMs will contribute, followed by the next-generation Galaxy platform in the first half of 2025.\n\nRadio Frequency (RF) ASP and content are also expected to benefit from AI beginning in the second half, driven by higher performance, faster uplinks, and greater integration.\n\nAdditionally, the investment firm pointed out a strong initial response for Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite processor in South Korea, as the chipmaker is the first to market in the initial wave of AI in PCs.\n\nSamsung (KS:005930) has launched Copilot+ PCs based on the X Elite, with demand surpassing initial channel expectations. Besides Samsung, the X Elite is also currently being shipped by HP (NYSE:HPQ), Dell (NYSE:DELL), Acer, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Lenovo.\n\n“We would be buyers of QCOM shares on recent share pullback,” the analysts concluded.\n\nUBS says AI optionality already priced in Tesla stock, sees downside risk\n\nUBS analysts have reiterated their Sell rating on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), citing substantial downside risk due to overvaluation and challenges in the automotive business highlighted in its latest quarterly report.\n\nThey believe Tesla's stock, which is currently trading at over 100 times its run-rate EPS of approximately $2.25, has a considerable amount of AI optionality already priced in, resulting in an inflated valuation.\n\n\"TSLA 2Q24 results showed the stress on the automotive business, just to keep vehicle deliveries ~1.78mm annualized units (which would be -2% y/y),\" analysts noted.\n\nThe bank pointed out that Tesla's aggressive pricing and promotional strategies to stimulate demand have caused its auto gross margin, excluding credits, to drop to 14.6%, the lowest since the first quarter of 2019.\n\nAdjusting for higher-than-normal credits and restructuring charges, UBS estimates Tesla's run-rate EPS to be around $0.56, which still includes a strong but potentially volatile quarter for its Energy business.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are skeptical about the near-term drivers for Tesla's earnings. While the introduction of a new lower-cost model and increased Full Self-Driving (FSD) take rates could provide some support, the analysts argue that even an improvement of $1 per share in earnings would still leave the stock trading at over 75 times its price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nThe analysts assert that Tesla's current stock price heavily relies on future AI initiatives such as robo-taxis and Optimus humanoid robots.\n\nThey believe Tesla's stock faces more downside risk if confidence in these AI initiatives wavers. Upcoming events like Robo-taxi day on October 10 could trigger a \"sell-the-news\" reaction, emphasizing the overvaluation of the stock based on uncertain future opportunities, analysts explained.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: PT hikes for Nvidia, Apple; Tesla downside risk flagged\n\nWhat are the best trades to position for a red wave in the US election?\n\nWould the US outperform if Trump wins a clean sweep?\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation.Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a program last week tried to make sense of the decline in tech stocks, saying companies with the “best fundamentals” got “hammered once again.”\n\n“I did not expect that to happen.”\n\nCramer said that sometimes it’s difficult to own the “winners.” The CNBC host said it’s important to understand the bear cases around stocks otherwise you will never know what “you are up against.”\n\nJim Cramer tried to find out whether the latest decline in top tech stocks was just a “periodic selloff” that presented an “opportunity.”\n\n“When we get this kind of rotation, you never know whether these stocks are selling off because there’s something wrong or because they are up huge.”\n\nJim Cramer pointed to a caveat when it comes to holding winning stocks. When you have the losers, there are no profits, but when you own winners in your portfolio, you can see losses because people want to take some profits off the table, Cramer said.\n\nThe CNBC host said when top stocks go down, people holding those in their portfolios often end up thinking about whether they should also sell these stocks and if something has “changed.”\n\n“From what I can tell you, nothing has changed about the stocks we are going talk about tonight. But it is true that the stocks are a heck of a lot more expensive than they were one year ago.”\n\nIn this program, we took a look at some top tech stocks that fell last week and explained the reasons they lost value according to Jim Cramer. We also discussed these companies’ fundamentals and hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Jim Cramer Talking About Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Falling Stock Amid Latest Market Rotation?\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nJim Cramer said in a latest program that people are selling Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) because it sells 40 times its earnings, which is “unusually high, even for Amazon.”\n\n“It’s not a huge beneficiary from lower interest rates so people are fleeing from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and buying cyclical plays.”\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to gain on the back of its AWS business which is set to benefit from the rise in AI spending. Mizuho recently cited a survey conducted by one of its partners which shows that AWS sales cycle is seeing acceleration. Mizuho analyst James Lee reiterated his Outperform rating on the stock and gave a $240 price target.  The survey shows that spending on AWS is expected to rise about 22% year over year in 2024, up from the previous estimate of 20%, as generative AI projects are seen at an “inflection point” with external models about six months away from commercial deployment.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Dan Ives of Wedbush thinks have the potential to grow based on the AI revolution.\n\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\n\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn’t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled “chatbot recommendations” as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strength in the application layer of AI.\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates the world’s leading e-commerce marketplace and the largest public cloud platform and has a burgeoning advertising business. We expect to see sustained margin improvement as Amazon’s retail regionalization efforts are bearing fruit and as its advertising business continues to scale ahead of peers. We believe the profitability ramp is still in the early innings as the company turns its attention to improving costs. One area will be inbound shipping, where faster delivery times through reduced freight, miles and packaging can reduce waste. We also see generative AI tailwinds and infrastructure modernization driving re-acceleration in growth at AWS, further enhancing Amazon’s free cash flow compounding potential. In addition, following our early 2024 ESG engagements with Amazon (after multiyear engagements) we were positively inclined to see continued improvements in labor relations (health and safety metrics, benefits and wages), as well as in environmental stewardship (climate targets, reducing packaging materials, electric delivery trucks) and innovation (commitments to responsible AI and data privacy). One of the newly announced initiatives on the retail side is consolidating deliveries into fewer boxes, which reduces packaging.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Why Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) the Best Edge Computing Stock Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Edge Computing Market Size and 7 Best Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other edge computing stocks.\n\nWhat is Edge Computing?\n\nThe information technology sector has consistently outperformed investor and analyst expectations in 2023, and this trend appears to be continuing into the current year. This impressive performance can largely be attributed to significant advancements such as the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI, which have driven tech stock prices to unprecedented highs. Of course, AI is not the only area that is revolutionizing the technology space. Edge Computing comes in as another compelling area of growth and investment. Also known as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) or Multi-Access Edge Computing, Edge Computing focuses on bringing computing power closer to where data is generated, rather than relying on a centralized cloud-based system. In layman's terms, Edge Computing involves relocating part of the storage and computing capabilities from a central data center to locations near the data sources.\n\nBy keeping computational capacity close to users, devices, or data sources, edge solutions offer benefits such as reduced latency, increased bandwidth, local device processing, and data offloading. For instance, smart speakers perform minimal computational work, sending requests to servers owned by the provider. With Edge Computing, smart speakers could process a user’s request entirely on the device itself. Gartner, in its March 2024 Market Guide for Edge Computing, states:\n\n“By placing data, data management capabilities and analytic workloads at optimal points, ranging all the way to endpoint devices, enterprises can enable more real-time use cases. In addition, the flexibility to move data management workloads up and down the continuum from centralized data centers or from the cloud-to-edge devices will enable greater optimization of resources.”\n\nEdge Computing with the Internet-of-Things & Artificial Intelligence\n\nThe automotive industry is a prime example of rapid advancements driven by edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI) integration in recent years. As vehicles evolve to incorporate self-driving capabilities, these technologies have become essential for effective decision-making and real-time responses. For instance, Tesla leverages extensive real-world driving data to refine its AI algorithms for autonomous driving. The rollout of EV maker's Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software to more drivers highlights its performance in real-world conditions, with the vast amount of visual data collected during these drives enhancing the company's AI learning process.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the advent and adoption of 5G, the fifth generation of cellular network technologies offering substantially greater bandwidth, is accelerating the growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and facilitating the widespread adoption of edge computing. With 5G networks enabling lightning-fast speeds and a greater number of connected devices, data volumes are expected to surge. Predictions state that by 2025, every connected person will interact with digital data at least once every 18 seconds, largely due to the billions of IoT devices projected to generate over 90 zettabytes of data by then.\n\nEdge Computing Market to Reach $217 Billion by 2032\n\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global edge computing market was valued at $15.96 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from $21.41 billion in 2024 to $216.76 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate of 33.6% over the forecast period. This growth is fueled by the increasing adoption of edge devices, ranging from IoT devices such as mobile point-of-sale kiosks and smart cameras to computational infrastructure that enables faster and real-time data analysis at the source. On the other hand, PwC projects that the global market for edge data centers will nearly triple, growing from $4 billion in 2017 to $13.5 billion this year. This expansion is driven by the potential of locally situated data centers to reduce latency, manage intermittent connections, and facilitate data storage and computation close to end-users.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best edge computing stocks to buy now.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best edge computing stocks, We began by sifting through ETFs' holdings and online rankings to gather a preliminary list of 15 stocks. We then scanned Insider Monkey’s first-quarter database which tracks 920 elite money managers and selected the top seven that were the most widely held by hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a leading American multinational technology company with a diverse portfolio, including e-commerce, cloud computing via Amazon Web Services (AWS), online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. Notably, AWS offers edge computing services as part of its cloud solutions.\n\nInsider Monkey’s research for the March quarter of 2024 revealed that 302 out of the 919 hedge funds tracked held stakes in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The largest hedge fund investor was Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management, with a stake valued at $7.67 billion.\n\nOn June 14, JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a price target of $240. This stance followed a comprehensive analysis of the U.S. e-commerce landscape, including category penetration and Amazon's market share. The research indicates that Amazon is on track to surpass Walmart as the largest U.S. retailer by 2024, with e-commerce penetration potentially exceeding 40% in the long term.\n\nFurthermore, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is emerging as a powerhouse in AI, driven by its AWS business, which achieved operating margins of over 37% in the first quarter. AWS operating margins have exceeded 30% for the past five consecutive quarters. Additionally, Amazon's first-quarter revenue increased by 12.5% year-over-year, and its adjusted EPS more than tripled.\n\nVulcan Value Partners stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a dominant, world class company with powerful secular tailwinds in place including its ecommerce penetration, digital advertising growth, and the cloud transition. Amazon reported strong results during the quarter. Losses in the Core Retail business significantly narrowed. Amazon reduced its cost to serve on a per unit basis for the first time since 2018 as the company’s recent regionalization efforts continue to bear fruit.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best edge computing stocks to buy. You can visit Edge Computing Market Size and 7 Best Stocks To Buyto see the other edge computing stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy With $300 Right Now",
        "content": "The market indexes have surged to new highs this year, but there are a handful of growth stocks with solid long-term prospects that offer excellent value to investors right now. A few of these stocks have fallen to new lows, which could be a once-in-a-decade opportunity to buy them at a discount.\n\nTo give you some ideas, let's see why three Motley Fool contributors believe now's a great time to scoop up shares of Nike(NYSE: NKE), Lululemon Athletica(NASDAQ: LULU), and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nA long-term winner at a deep discount\n\nJeremy Bowman (Nike): There's no question that Nike is struggling right now. The sneaker king has reported anemic growth in its last several quarters as it's losing market share to upstart rivals like On Holding, Deckers' Hoka and Lululemon, and it's struggled with weak consumer spending in North America and elsewhere. Its Major League Baseball jerseys have been roundly jeered, turning what seemed to be a big win for the brand into a loss, and its brand seems to be losing its luster.\n\nAs a result, Nike's revenue was flat in its recently ended fiscal year at $51.4 billion, and the stock is trading near a five-year low.\n\nWhile Nike stock should be down on those results, the good news for investors is that all of those problems are fixable. Nike has always faced competition, and it has responded time and again. It has the street cred, marketing reach, and retail relationships to turn things around. It won't happen overnight, but there are several catalysts that could drive a turnaround.\n\nFirst, Nike is taking steps to replenish its bench. It recently hired a new CIO, Cheryan Jacob, who previously worked at Microsoft and Flexport. Jacob will be tasked with modernizing the company's tech infrastructure.\n\nIn March, Nike hired a new VP of men's apparel as well, and it rehired a senior executive as VP of marketplace partners, showing it's giving more attention to the wholesale channel again.\n\nLeaning on partners like Foot Locker should help boost growth once again, and those wholesale relationships are a source of competitive advantage for the company as it takes time to build those. Finally, the Summer Olympics could also give the company a chance to revitalize its brand in front of billions of TV viewers, a unique opportunity in sports.\n\nThere aren't any guarantees in investing, but Nike has survived enough challenges to give investors confidence that it can bounce back from the latest setback as well.\n\nA top stock at a price you don't want to miss\n\nJennifer Saibil (Lululemon Athletica): Lululemon has carved out a niche in athletic wear and is challenging the traditional leaders. It has become synonymous with premium gym clothes and spawned a wave of yoga-inspired brands that are following in its footsteps. But while growth has slowed -- for now -- it would be a mistake to assume that Lululemon is past its prime. It's well in the thick of it, and there are plenty of growth opportunities for Lululemon and its stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is still reporting double-digit sales growth despite the inflationary environment and ongoing troubles at other brands, like Nike. Plus, profitability is improving even under these adverse conditions. Gross margin expanded by 0.2 points in the 2024 fiscal first quarter (ended April 28), and earnings per share (EPS) was up from $2.29 last year to $2.54 this year.\n\nStill, the market wasn't thrilled with management's guidance for second-quarter sales growth to be similar and full-year growth to be about 12%. Lululemon also raised full-year EPS guidance from $14.10 to $14.37.\n\nThe company is on schedule to meet its Power of Three x 2 growth strategy goals, which are to double 2021 sales by 2026 by doubling men's and digital sales and quadrupling international sales. These are where it sees the greatest opportunities right now. Its women segment is its core business, and it's launching plenty of innovative products there, too, but it's the non-seasonal favorites in Lululemon's patented fabrics that drive so much of its sales.\n\nLululemon stock tanked after Nike's recent uninspiring earnings report, where management updated investors that it expects sales to drop in fiscal 2025. Investors are worried that Lululemon may meet the same fate and revise its own ongoing guidance, and Lululemon stock is down 47% year to date. At this price, it trades at a P/E ratio of 22, almost as cheap as Nike stock, and its cheapest valuation in five years.\n\nLululemon operates an efficient, growing, and profitable business, and it has robust long-term opportunities. It looks like an incredible deal right now.\n\nAmazon is investing in profitable, high-growth opportunities\n\nJohn Ballard (Amazon): Unlike Nike and Lululemon, Amazon stock has continued to perform well in 2024, but the company's efforts to squeeze more cash flow and profits out of sales could yield more upside.\n\nAmazon will report second-quarter financial results on Aug. 1, but it should be another solid report. In the first quarter, net sales increased 13% year over year, driven by double-digit growth in non-retail areas like advertising and cloud computing services (e.g., Amazon Web Services).\n\nThe company achieved record trailing free cash flow of $45 billion through the first quarter. Free cash flow is a closely watched metric that measures the actual amount of cash the business generates from operations after all costs. Amazon's free cash flow may decline in the near term as management increases capital expenditures to drive growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS), particularly artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. But AWS is a very profitable revenue source, so further investment in this business will reward shareholders down the road.\n\nAnother very profitable growth opportunity for Amazon is advertising. Sponsored product listings and streaming TV ads are high-margin sales opportunities that can also fuel increases in free cash flow. Amazon generated $49 billion in ad revenue over the last year, and with ad revenue (excluding currency changes) up 24% year over year in Q1, it was Amazon's fastest-growing business.\n\nAmazon shares continue to trade within their historical average range using various valuation metrics, such as price-to-sales ratio, price-to-earnings, or price-to-free cash flow. This means the stock should continue to climb in value over the next several years along with the growth of the business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The 2024 Q2 earnings season continues to roll on, with next week’s reporting docket stacked with many notable names. The period has remained positive so far, with the big banks’ results not causing any spooks.\n\nConcerning next week’s docket, several Mag 7 members, including Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, and Apple AAPL, all report. All three stocks have been big-time performers in 2024, with many wondering if their momentum can continue.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at how they stack up heading into the releases.\n\nApple’s China Sales in Focus\n\nApple shares were scrutinized for their slow start to 2024 but have picked up considerable steam lately, up 14% overall YTD. Worries surrounding China and falling behind in AI weighed on performance, though these concerns seem to have temporarily subsided.\n\nThe stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with earnings expectations for the period to be reported ticking higher over the last several months. The $1.34 expected suggests a 6% climb from the year-ago period, with sales also expected to be up 2.7% Y/Y. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company experienced woes in China throughout its latest period, but overall, sales came in much closer to expectations relative to other periods, missing our consensus estimate by $220 million vs. a $2.5 billion miss in the previous period.\n\nIn addition, favorable news surrounding iPhone shipments in China has been announced over recent weeks, further easing fears. Investors will also be focused on the company’s Services portfolio, which has been a solid growth driver over recent periods and has helped ease reliance on iPhone results.\n\nAs shown below, Services results have beat our expectations regularly as of late outside of one instance. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon’s AWS in the Spotlight\n\nAMZN was firing on all cylinders throughout its latest period, with operating income of $15.3 billion 220% higher year-over-year. Most importantly, AWS delivered great results, with net sales of $25 billion showing 17% year-over-year growth and snapping a recent streak of negative surprises on the metric.\n\nMany had feared a cloud slowdown, which was present for a few periods, but the recent results overall paint a picture of positivity heading into the upcoming release. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings and revenue expectations for the upcoming release have primarily been muted, but big growth is expected, with EPS expected to be up 63% on 10% higher sales. Easing costs and operational efficiencies have aided profitability in a big way, leading to meaningful margin expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that the chart below is on a trailing twelve-month basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms CapEx Under Scrutiny\n\nMETA’s improved operational efficiencies have boosted its profitability significantly, leading to robust EPS growth over recent quarters.\n\nInvestors will be looking for color on CapEx trends surrounding AI, which was also a focal point in Alphabet’s quarterly release. Earnings expectations for the release have ticked higher over recent months, with the $4.69 per share expected reflecting 45% Y/Y growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning key metrics, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Advertising revenue stands at $37.5 billion, 20% higher than the year-ago period. It’s worth noting here that Alphabet’s Advertising business showed great results, with sales of $64.6 billion climbing 12% year-over-year.\n\nMETA shares plunged following its latest set of quarterly results, with the negativity attributed to a higher CapEx guide for its current fiscal year. As mentioned above, the development will certainly be monitored closely among investors, with peer Alphabet spooking some with its higher than expected CapEx.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe 2024 Q2 earnings season continues to chug along, with a notably stacked reporting docket this week. Another period of positivity is expected, underpinned by another strong showing from Tech.\n\nSeveral Mag 7 members report this week, a list that includes Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, and Apple AAPL. Their results will undoubtedly be scrutinized given the momentum they’ve enjoyed in 2024, perhaps reflecting the most important week of the Q2 cycle overall.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) filed a lawsuit against the NBA on Friday over what it said was the league's \"unjustified rejection\" of the company's matching rights proposal earlier in the week.\n\nThe suit, filed under seal in New York County Supreme Court by WBD and its subsidiary TBS and obtained by Yahoo Finance, states the NBA \"has refused to honor TBS’s match. Not only that, despite TBS’s clear match, the NBA has purported to grant the rights to Amazon in direct breach of the agreement.\"\n\nWarner Bros. reportedly shells out $1.2 billion annually for the rights, which expire at the end of next season. Under the terms of the 2024-2025 season, the company maintains a rights package that includes at least 64 regular-season games and at least 30 playoff games.\n\n\"TBS has a vested interest in maintaining these distribution rights and its carefully developed 40-year brand,\" the complaint read. \"On top of the billions of dollars it pays the NBA for the distribution rights, TBS has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in production and talent, including its award-winning 'Inside the NBA' program.\"\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, NBA spokesperson Mike Bass told Yahoo Finance, \"Warner Bros. Discovery's claims are without merit and our lawyers will address them.\"\n\nWarner Bros. shares closed about 4% down on Friday following the development.\n\nThe news comes less than two days after the NBA officially approved a media rights package that excluded WBD, one of the league's current partners, in favor of two newcomers: tech giant Amazon (AMZN) and Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA). It was able to strike a new agreement with its other current media partner, Disney (DIS).\n\n“Warner Bros. Discovery’s most recent proposal did not match the terms of Amazon Prime Video’s offer and, therefore, we have entered into a long-term arrangement with Amazon,\" the NBA said at the time.\n\nWall Street analysts have said litigation might not go far for the legacy media giant, which has aired NBA games through TNT since 1989.\n\n\"Even if WBD were to win, the costs may be prohibitive,\" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. David Zaslav attends the world premiere of \"The Flash\", in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 12, 2023. (REUTERS/Mike Blake) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe analyst later told Yahoo Finance it's clear the NBA was \"a valuable property for TNT,\" benefiting both its linear TV advertising business and its \"ability to secure carriage fees,\" or the fees pay-TV providers pay to network owners to carry their channels.\n\n\"But more importantly in our minds is the opportunity cost to the Max streaming service because streaming is the present and future of TV,\" he said, adding it will be harder for Max to generate new subscribers and retain existing ones without the NBA.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It's expensive content and maybe it would even be a loss leader to have it. ... But to me, it was an essential property to retain. Not having it is a major blow to advertising and the subscription fees.\"\n\nThe loss of the rights will also impact TNT's NBA-adjacent content, such as \"Inside the NBA,\" the acclaimed show hosted by retired players Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley, and Kenny Smith.\n\nA report from Front Office Sports said ESPN and Amazon are both interested in keeping the show's cast intact, although Barkley has said he plans to retire after next season, which will also be the end of the current media deal.\n\n“Clearly the NBA has wanted to break up with us from the beginning,” Barkley wrote in a statement Friday posted on Instagram. “I’m not sure TNT ever had a chance. TNT matched the money, but the league knows Amazon and these tech companies are the only ones willing to pay for the rights when they double in the future.\"\n\n\"It's a sad day when owners and commissioners choose money over the fans,\" he continued. \"It just sucks.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) recorded its biggest sales event in history this Prime Day weekend. The world's largest e-commerce company sold over 200 million items through independent sellers during the Prime Day event held on July 17 and 18, making it a \"huge success,\" according to Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores.\n\n“We love helping Prime members save money, and Prime Day is the ultimate celebration of the savings, selection, and convenience that Prime membership provides customers looking for shopping, entertainment, food delivery, and more,\" Herrington stated in a news release.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nPrivate markets have historically outperformed stocks in every downturn of the past 15 years — build your diversified portfolio. With returns as high as 300%, it’s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires. Uncover the secret.\n\nAmazon's annual event, a major sales driver, has also had significant ripple effects across the retail sector. Other retail giants like Walmart and Costco also stepped up their game to offer steep discounts.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) created Prime Day in 2015 to celebrate its 20th anniversary and to boost Prime memberships. Since then, it has grown into a massive global event, with millions of deals across virtually every product category.\n\nAdobe Analytics predicted Amazon's sales to hit $14 billion this Prime Day event, up 10% year-over-year. However, total sales in America are estimated to have crossed $14.2 billion. Furthermore, on the first day of the event itself, total sales crossed $7.2 billion.\n\nAmazon's total revenues are expected to amount to $158.19 billion for the current September quarter, marking an 11.9% rise year-over-year. The consensus EPS estimate of $1.15 for the ongoing quarter indicates a 33.7% increase from last year.\n\nAmazon's shares have risen by over 36% over the past year, outperforming the tech-focused Nasdaq composite Index's 14.5% returns.\n\nWalmart\n\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), the retail giant and Amazon’s biggest competitor, has not remained idle despite Prime Day’s success. Walmart has strategically positioned its sales events around the same time, offering competitive deals to attract bargain hunters. The company launched Walmart Deals to compete with Amazon Prime Day, offering an exclusive lineup of discounts across its online and physical stores.\n\nThis comes weeks after the company hosted Walmart+ week, a seven-day event during which Walmart subscription holders received innumerable discounts on a wide range of products. This summer, Walmart has benefited from the increased seasonal demand as consumer spending ramps up.\n\nStory continues\n\nA survey conducted by Numerator found that 35% of respondents shopped from Walmart during the Walmart Deals event. According to Adobe Analytics, consumers spent a record $7 billion on online shopping outside of Amazon on July 17.\n\nDon’t miss out: earn 8-15% expected returns by investing in fractional real estate. Get started with only $10.\n\nAlibaba\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is on track to recover its market share after a brutal past couple of years. It was charged with antitrust allegations and underwent a robust corporate structure overhaul. To bolster shareholder confidence, Alibaba announced an increase in its share buyback program by $25 billion in May, extending through March 2027.\n\nNonetheless, the Chinese e-commerce company is poised for significant growth in 2024, with projections indicating a 20% increase in gross merchandise volume (GMV) to $60 billion, up from $50 billion in 2023. Alibaba's highly coveted Singles Day event in November is often compared with Amazon's Prime Day and Black Friday.\n\nThe retailer launched \"Alibaba Guaranteed\" in June to garner positive consumer sentiment as part of its growth strategy.\n\n\"Alibaba Guaranteed marks an exciting new chapter for SMEs and global sourcing as it will help to redefine the fulfillment standard of B2B cross-border trade,\" Alibaba's president Zhang Kuo said, \"Global sourcing can be a complex process with many moving parts, but Alibaba Guaranteed can help SMEs navigate it with greater ease.\"\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

        "content": "(Reuters) - Amazon MGM Studios has entered a multi-year film partnership with Scott Stuber, the former longtime head of films at Netflix, to finance and release movies from his new production company, it said on Friday.\n\nStuber, who left Netflix in March to start his media company, will produce several films annually under United Artists (UA), a relaunched label that once operated under MGM. The films will be released both theatrically and on Prime Video.\n\nThe agreement with Stuber, who will be involved in all projects released by UA, includes a first-look deal and gives his company a base at Amazon MGM Studios' Culver City lot.\n\nUA was first launched by Charlie Chaplin, among others, in 1919 as a production and distribution company and was acquired by MGM in 1981.\n\nAmazon bought MGM, or Metro Goldwyn Mayer, the fabled U.S. movie studio home to the James Bond franchise, for $8.45 billion in 2021, giving it a huge library of films and TV shows and ramping up competition with streaming rivals Netflix and Disney+.\n\n(Reporting by Juby Babu in Mexico City; Editing by Shreya Biswas)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Hey Alexa, Why Are You Costing Amazon Billions?",
        "content": "Hey Alexa, Why Are You Costing Amazon Billions?\n\nAmazon's artificial intelligence virtual assistant, Alexa, is now in millions of households worldwide, yet the smart technology is costing Amazon billions. Here's why Alexa is a black hole in Amazon's profits.\n\nIn 2014, Amazon launched its first Echo smart speaker with Amazon's innovative virtual assistant, Alexa. But it was in 2017 that the world started to pay attention to this smart speaker, and thanks to the third-party products and integrations, this smart speaker was popular across the globe.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmerica's construction sites are desperate for Robots — here’s how to invest in a house-printing startup who’s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry. Don’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\nFor example, in May 2023, Yahoo Finance reported that the e-commerce giant Amazon had revealed to the public that it had sold more than 500 million Echo devices and continued unveiling four new Echo products. Statista found that out of all the smart speakers available in the U.S. market, an overwhelming 65% of consumers chose the Echo speakers over other brands like Google Home or the Apple HomePod. That's just in the U.S.; in the United Kingdom, around 73% of people own an Amazon Echo. So, with such stellar global sales, appearances on television, star-studded marketing, and a product that is instantly recognizable, why are these smart speakers costing Amazon billions?\n\nSee Also: Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported on the loss using unnamed sources and internal documents that revealed that between 2017 and 2021, the online retail giant had lost over $25 billion in profits from its Echo speakers and Kindles. While these smart speakers may be in millions of households, they are not being used for what Amazon had originally hoped. This is certainly not the case. During the smart speaker's launch in 2014, Amazon took a risk and sold the devices at a pittance, hoping this would move large volumes of stock, which it did. The only problem is that people were not using the devices as the brand had hoped.\n\nTrending:Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nThe hope for these smart speakers was to encourage people to buy more goods on Amazon with the assistance of Alexa because of the \"ease\" of purchase. These hopes were dashed when the retail giant realized that people were using these smart speakers mainly for the free features like setting alarms and checking the weather. A former Amazon employee had candidly told the Wall Street Journal, \"We worried we've hired 10,000 people and we've built a smart timer.\" It wasn't just the Echo speakers and Kindle devices that have caused a financial headache for the online retailer. Other electronic devices like the Fire TV Sticks and video doorbells have also been a financial drain on the company, and the current CEO, Andy Jassy, is determined to fix this problem.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow is Jassy going to fix this problem? By charging a new monthly subscription that is expected to launch this summer. Because Echo devices are sold at or below cost, Jassy hopes that adding a subscription will result in an additional direct revenue stream. Amazon engineers had told the Wall Street Journal that the company is \"focused on the value we create when customers use our services, not just when they buy our devices,\" and added, \"Our Devices & Services organization has established numerous profitable businesses for Amazon and is well-positioned to continue doing so going forward.\"\n\nIn September last year, Amazon announced it was working on the latest Alexa. However, insider reports have revealed that neither the device nor the technology is even close to being ready due to a lack of data. This new Alexa device could be the answer to making a profit off the devices.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWill the surge continue or decline on real estate prices?

        "title": "Why Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) the Best Information Technology Services Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other information technology services stocks.\n\nInformation technology (IT) services are a key component of the broader IT market, which also includes services, devices, enterprise software, and data center systems. By 2023, global IT spending had surged to over $1.3 trillion. Regionally, North America and Asia were projected to account for 66% of global IT expenditure in 2022. Meanwhile, IT services spending in Latin America has consistently held a 6% share since 2019. Cloud computing is one segment of the broader IT market that is experiencing robust growth, with end-user spending anticipated to exceed $590 billion by 2023. Projections from Mordor Intelligence indicate an increase from $0.68 trillion in 2024 to an estimated $1.44 trillion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4%. This upward trend is expected to persist, with the market value approaching $2.5 trillion by 2032. These figures highlight the increasing adoption and utilization of cloud solutions across various industries.\n\nOn another front, the advent of 5G technology has led companies to establish networks on their premises. According to Ericsson, global 5G subscriptions are projected to exceed 5.6 billion by the end of 2029, accounting for 60% of all mobile subscriptions. Set to replace 4G by delivering ultra-fast speeds and significantly reduced latency, 5G is expected to become the leading mobile access technology by 2028. In Q1 2024 alone, 5G subscriptions surged by 160 million, bringing the total to 1.7 billion.\n\nAccording to Gartner's latest forecast, worldwide IT spending will reach $5.06 trillion in 2024, marking an 8% increase from 2023. This revised growth rate is up from the previous quarter's estimate of 6.8%, setting the stage for IT spending to exceed $8 trillion well before the decade's end. Additionally, spending on data center systems is anticipated to experience a significant growth surge, rising from 4% in 2023 to 10% in 2024, largely driven by preparations for generative AI. Speaking on this, John-David Lovelock, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner, said the following:\n\n\"Spending on IT services is projected to grow by 9.7%, surpassing $1.52 trillion and becoming the largest market tracked by Gartner. Enterprises are increasingly unable to compete with IT service firms in attracting talent with critical IT skill sets. As a result, there is a rising need for investment in consulting services over internal staffing. This year marks an inflection point, with more spending on consulting than on internal staff for the first time.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the AI industry has seen significant growth, with global funding doubling to $66.8 billion by 2021. According to a report by Precedence Research, the market will grow to approximately $2,575.2 billion by 2032, reflecting a CAGR of 19% from 2023 to 2032. Additionally, PwC suggests that AI could contribute around $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, surpassing the current combined output of China and India. This contribution is expected to consist of $6.6 trillion from increased productivity and $9.1 trillion from effects related to heightened consumption.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo identify the best information technology services stocks to buy now, we utilized Insider Monkey's extensive database, which tracks 920 hedge funds as of Q1 2024. We selected the information technology services stocks that had the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The findings suggest that Amazon is on course to surpass Walmart as the largest U.S. retailer by 2024, with e-commerce penetration potentially exceeding 40% in the long term.\n\nMoreover, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is rapidly becoming a powerhouse in AI, propelled by its AWS division, which reported operating margins of over 37% in the first quarter.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – July 26, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nBuy Big Tech/AI Stocks Ahead of Earnings, or Wait?\n\nToday's episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks dives into the wave of selling that sent the Nasdaq tumbling to start the heart of big tech earnings season on Wednesday. The episode then explores Meta Platforms and Amazon stock before their upcoming earnings releases to see if investors should buy the top tech stocks before earnings or wait for more selling.\n\nTechnology stocks and other first-half standouts tanked on Wednesday, sending the Nasdaq below its 50-day moving average for only the second time in 2024.\n\nThe selling came as the busy stretch of technology earnings kicked off after the closing bell on Tuesday, with Alphabet and Tesla.\n\nTech stocks and the market could experience more selling and volatility throughout earnings season, especially since big tech set the bar very high.\n\nThankfully, the tailwinds that sent the stock market soaring in the first half remain in place. Any near-term selling represents a healthy recalibration and an opportunity for investors to buy their favorite stocks at discounts.\n\nThe two stocks we explore today are tech giants and AI investments.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. – Q2 Earnings Wednesday, July 31\n\nMeta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, grew its daily active users by 7% in Q1 to 3.24 billion. Meta grew its ad impressions delivered across its family of apps by 20%.\n\nMeta stands to thrive in a world full of smartphone addicts. Meta is also investing heavily in its AI future. Mark Zuckerberg's goal is for Meta to win the AI race by rolling out open source artificial intelligence.\n\nMeta shares have soared roughly 400% off the market's 2022 lows to blow away Alphabet and plenty of tech giants. The stock has also climbed 520% in the past 10 years vs. the Zacks Tech sector's 310%.\n\nThis context helps Meta's valuation look all the more impressive, with Meta trading at a 63% discount to its highs and 20% below the Zacks Tech sector at 22.4X forward 12-month earnings.\n\nMeta stock has fallen 14% from its early July highs heading into its quarterly earnings release. Meta stock is trading below its 50-day and 21-week moving averages. Meta trades at roughly neutral RSI levels on a 10-year timeframe after hitting its most overbought levels of the last decade earlier this year.\n\nMeta's recent cooldown makes the stock a potentially more appealing long-term buy-and-hold candidate for investors who can weather near-term volatility. It is worth remembering that Meta has a robust balance sheet and began paying a dividend earlier this year as it focuses on efficiency and profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon – Q2 Earnings Thursday, August 1\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy took over roughly three years ago with a mission to boost the bottom line while honing in on expansion in key growth areas.\n\nAmazon remains the king of e-commerce and its advertising unit is booming. AMZN also runs the world's largest cloud-computing business, topping rivals Microsoft and Alphabet, helping it thrive throughout the AI supercycle.\n\nAmazon is also diving headfirst into its AI efforts, with plans to devote more capex on its cloud computing and AI infrastructure than e-commerce going forward.\n\nAmazon's steady cloud computing and AI growth, coupled with its focus on boosting earnings is a winning pitch to Wall Street. Amazon's earnings outlook has soared over the last year for FY24 and FY25 to help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nAmazon stock has skyrocketed 1,000% in the last 10 years vs. Tech's 300%, Apple's 800%, and Alphabet's 480%. Yet Amazon stock is down around 1% in the last three years compared to Tech's 25% run.\n\nAMZN failed to break out meaningfully above its 2021 highs. Amazon is currently trading 10% below its highs and 22% below its average Zacks price target.\n\nAmazon trades around its 21-week moving average and near neutral RSI levels on a 10-year timeframe. On the valuation front, Amazon trades 95% below its highs and at a 50% discount to its 10-year median at 35.1X forward 12-month earnings.\n\nOn top of that, Amazon trades near its lowest forward earnings multiple since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Amazon (AMZN) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.08 a share, just six days from its upcoming earnings release on August 1, 2024.\n\nAmazon's Earnings ESP sits at 4.58%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.08 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03.\n\nAMZN is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Texas Roadhouse (TXRH).\n\nTexas Roadhouse is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on October 24, 2024. TXRH's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.28 a share 90 days from its next earnings release.\n\nTexas Roadhouse's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 2.72% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25.\n\nAMZN and TXRH's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks That Are Ready to Beat the Market",
        "content": "Growth stocks give long-term investors the opportunity to outperform benchmarks like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. While some investors believe you have to search for obscure companies to outperform the indices, you can look within any index to find outperforming stocks.\n\nThat’s because indices like the S&P 500 have numerous companies that are generating steady losses. You can find hundreds of S&P 500 holdings in a given year that have lost value for investors. By definition, the top-performing holdings within an index outperform the index.\n\nHowever, past results isn’t enough to gauge if a stock will continue to outperform the broader market. It’s important to look at a company’s financials to determine if revenue and profit margins are expanding. Also, investors should consider each company’s catalysts and risks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTherefore, patient investors should consider monitoring some of these growth stocks that look ready to beat the market.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background.

Shares are up by 23% year-to-date (YTD) and have gained 90% over the past five years. Another solid round of earnings suggests that the gains will continue. Amazon reported 13% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in the first quarter while more than tripling its net income.\n\nRevenue acceleration for Amazon Web Services (AWS) has excited investors as the rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI) impacts Amazon’s financials. That segment delivered $25.0 billion in Q1 of fiscal year 2024 revenue, which is a 17% YOY improvement. Amazon’s advertising business is another notable area that can drive further gains. The tech giant notched $11.8 billion in ad revenue, which was a 24% YOY increase.\n\nAmazon is a regular favorite among Wall Street analysts. It’s rated as a strong buy and has a projected 22% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $250 per share suggests that the stock can gain an additional 36%.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc.

It owns nine of them while the other three are franchises. Those new restaurants raised Texas Roadhouse’s total locations to 753.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A case alleging that Amazon.com Inc. exposed warehouse workers to injuries has been dismissed for lack of evidence, the company said in a statement Thursday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Risks Losing Voters He Needs With Loaded Attacks on Harris Harris Just Showed Why Trump Is So Afraid of Her Stocks Caught in Tug of War Between Tech and Rest: Markets Wrap Markets Tear Up Popular Trades That Reached ‘Stupid Levels’ I Changed My Mind. The Fed Needs to Cut Rates Now.\n\nThe Washington state Department of Labor and Industries cited the e-commerce giant for setting rapid productivity targets that risked hurting employees working at multiple company facilities.\n\nAmazon appealed the citations, which put the matter before the state Bureau of Industrial Insurance Appeals. Judge Stephen Pfeifer, who adjudicated a year-long hearing, issued a ruling this week. The ruling won’t be released to the public until next week because the state agency is reviewing it and redacting non-public information.\n\nAmazon, which received an unredacted version of the ruling since it’s one of the parties involved, said the judge determined the state lacked sufficient evidence to support its allegations that the pace of work in Amazon warehouses is hazardous.\n\n“We appreciate that the court took a close look at the facts about how we prioritize employees’ health and safety, recognized the progress we’ve made, and vacated all the citations at the heart of this case,” Amazon said in an emailed statement. “The judge’s decision reinforces what we’ve said all along: There’s nothing more important than our employees’ health and safety.”\n\nThe state Department of Labor and Industries didn’t return phone calls, emails or text messages left beginning Wednesday afternoon. The state attorney general’s office, which represented the labor department in the hearing, referred questions back to the agency.\n\nThe state’s case was based on investigations that began in 2021. Investigators spent three days observing more than 50 Amazon workers performing 12 tasks and found hazards in nearly every one. Employees surveyed by the inspectors said pushing through pain was the norm, with some 40% saying they’d experienced it in the previous seven days. Of those, two-thirds said they took medication to ease symptoms.\n\nBased on the investigation, the labor department alleged 10-hour shifts with mandatory overtime and a rapid work pace put workers at risk of hurting their backs, shoulders, wrists and knees.\n\nThe ruling is a major victory for Amazon, which for years has been defending the safety of its warehouses in the face of growing government scrutiny. Federal regulators in 2022 cited Amazon for exposing workers to a range of musculoskeletal maladies and for failing to provide adequate medical treatment, which Amazon appealed.\n\nStory continues\n\nCalifornia, New York, Minnesota and several other states have passed or are considering new laws crafted to help prevent industry productivity quotas from interfering with legally required meal and rest breaks. The California Department of Industrial Relations issued two citations against Amazon in May, alleging the company violated the new law that took effect in 2022.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Miseducation of America’s Nurse Practitioners The $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into The US Economy Is Slowing, Which Is Just Fine With the Fed Joe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy’s New Kingmaker Elon Musk Goes All In for Trump\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Given their current popularity, let’s take a quick look at how each company currently stacks up.\n\nNvidia\n\nInvestor-favorite Nvidia has faced some pressure recently amid a broader cooldown in the AI trade. Still, shares are up a staggering 130% year-to-date, and its earnings outlook remains positive across the board. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe $2.69 per share expected for its current year suggests a 100% year-over-year pop in earnings, with sales also expected to see a 90% increase.

        "title": "7 Explosive Growth Stocks Set to Soar in 2024",
        "content": "Wall Street has rewarded certain growth stocks handsomely this year. I believe now may be an opportune time to buy some of these high-flyers, even after the recent tech selloff. Most of the stocks I’ll be discussing today are outside the tech sector. I think they have a great chance to continue their upward trajectory.\n\nThese companies boast impressive top-line growth metrics. Their stocks have also demonstrated remarkable consistency over time. If they keep executing as they historically have, I expect explosive gains ahead.\n\nOf course, past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. However, the businesses I’ve hand-picked have proven track records. They operate in industries with long growth runways. I expect them to harness those tailwinds and turn them into turbocharged gains. Here are seven such explosive growth stocks to look into.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAstraZeneca (AZN) Exterior of the AstraZeneca's manufacturing facility at Snackviken\n\nSource: Roland Magnusson / Shutterstock.com\n\nAstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is a global pharmaceutical giant. The company recently reported strong Q1 2024 results, with revenue growing 19% to $12.7 billion and core earnings per share rising 13% to $2.06. Most people associate AstraZeneca with its COVID-19 vaccine, but I believe the company’s future lies in its robust pipeline of new medicines. AstraZeneca aims to launch 20 new drugs by 2030, many with multi-billion dollar peak sales potential.\n\nThe company is also expanding into hot areas like obesity and vaccines through smart acquisitions and partnerships. Analysts are bullish, with some projecting AstraZeneca can deliver an industry-leading 8% annual sales growth through 2030. As of writing, AZN stock has already risen 19% year-to-date.\n\nI expect this momentum to continue as AstraZeneca executes on its promising pipeline and benefits from favorable industry tailwinds. It also has a 2.5% dividend yield to sweeten the deal.\n\nFTAI Aviation (FTAI) image of a plane flying in the sky representing airline stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFTAI Aviation (NASDAQ:FTAI) maintains and leases commercial jet engines, with a focus on CFM56 and V2500 engines. The company has been on an absolute tear lately, with its stock price more than doubling since January when I first wrote about it. FTAI Aviation just reported Q2 2024 results, beating revenue expectations with $443.59 million in sales, although it did post a net loss of $228 million. That net loss is not due to recurring expenses and the company is actually quite profitable. Net profit margin was 20.8% for all of 2023.\n\nI believe the current valuation is quite lofty, but the aviation industry is booming, and FTAI’s unique business model of providing cost-saving engine maintenance services is paying off handsomely. The company has inducted 20 V2500 engines so far this year and expects to add 30 more by year-end. Its Module Factory now boasts over 50 worldwide customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, analysts remain very bullish, and if FTAI delivers on these high expectations, I think the stock could have a lot more runway ahead. The recent selloff has created some short-term turbulence, but the long-term trajectory looks promising as FTAI rides the strong industry tailwinds.\n\nKKR & Co (KKR) best investments: a hand using the touchpad on a laptop. a concept image of figures and charts is emerging from the laptop screen. overlooked stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nKKR & Co. (NYSE:KKR) is a leading global investment firm that offers alternative asset management solutions across private equity, real estate, credit and infrastructure. I believe this company is on track to become one of the biggest asset managers in the world thanks to its smart investment decisions. KKR has benefited from the recent market rally, which has helped boost its growth.\n\nNevertheless, we may be on the cusp of a market correction, so I’d be a bit careful in the near term. However, I wouldn’t shy away from investing in KKR for the long haul. The stock has been one of the best-performing among publicly traded asset managers, up 90% in the past 12 months.\n\nKKR also reported strong financial results in its latest quarter, with $9.7 billion in revenue and $863.7 million in adjusted net income. The firm also raised its dividend. Ten out of 11 analysts now rate the stock a Buy.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is the leading e-commerce and fintech platform in Latin America. The company reported stellar first-quarter 2024 results that blew past analyst expectations.\n\nI believe MercadoLibre is well on its way to becoming the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of South America, with the added bonus of having a thriving fintech business. Net revenue soared 36% year-over-year to $4.3 billion, while earnings per share jumped 70% to $6.78. Gross merchandise volume hit $11.4 billion, up 20% from a year ago.\n\nMercadoLibre’s growth drivers are firing on all cylinders right now. Mercado Pago, its fintech arm, saw total payment volume surge 35% to $40.7 billion. The company is investing heavily in expanding in Brazil, its largest market, with plans to pour in a record $4.6 billion this year.\n\nSouth American markets have had their challenges, but the overall trajectory is very positive. Argentina, once plagued by hyperinflation, has seen a monthly inflation drop dramatically from its December 2023 peak. Many other markets in the region use the stable U.S. dollar, both officially and unofficially.\n\nDroneShield (DRSHF) Image of soldier's feet dressed with combat boots\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDroneShield (OTCMKTS:DRSHF) is an Australian company that provides counter-drone technologies to military and government customers worldwide. The stock has been very volatile, soaring to all-time highs before plummeting by nearly 50% in just over a week.\n\nI believe the sharp pullback offers an attractive entry point for long-term investors. The rapid increase in drone usage, especially by non-Western countries, is creating a booming market for anti-drone systems. DroneShield is well-positioned to capitalize on this demand.\n\nIn the first quarter, DroneShield achieved record revenues of $16.4 million, a staggering 900% increase year-over-year. The company ended April with a $27 million order backlog and over $519 million sales pipeline. Cash receipts also hit a record $21.4 million in the first half of 2024.\n\nHowever, not everyone is bullish. Some analysts argue that DroneShield is still overvalued compared to its financials. Noted short-seller Rodney Forrest called the valuation “wild” and has bet against the stock.\n\nPersonally, I’m optimistic about DroneShield’s future. The need for counter-drone tech will only intensify as cheap drones proliferate globally. The company has a strong balance sheet with $146 million cash and no debt to fuel its growth. The stock is still up 242% year-to-date, so I still consider it an explosive growth stock.\n\nSPS Commerce (SPSC) A hexagonal grid with different tech-related icons; Tech stocks illustration. Best Tech stocks. tech stocks trading at bargain prices\n\nSource: whiteMocca / Shutterstock\n\nI’ve been cautious with tech stocks lately due to the recent pullback. Many still trade at nosebleed valuations, and the correction could get worse. However, I view SPS Commerce (NASDAQ:SPSC) as a more level-headed play.\n\nThe cloud industry continues to boom with no signs of slowing. I’m particularly bullish on the supply chain automation space. Retailers and logistics companies are rushing to automate as much as possible for the long term. SPS Commerce is well-positioned to capitalize on this megatrend.\n\nThe stock has been one of the most consistent performers over the past five years. It will be difficult for bears to knock it off course. That said, the upcoming earnings report could change things. The stock is still expensive, but the growth trajectory is quite predictable. Analysts expect around 15-16% annual sales and EPS growth, and the stock could follow that growth.

That statement would probably be relevant at any time in the past six years. Its latest earnings report shows exactly why.\n\nLilly’s revenue jumped 26% in Q1 2024, driven by blockbuster sales of the diabetes drug Mounjaro and the new weight loss treatment Zepbound. Its financials are rock-solid, its pipeline is stacked and demand for its products isn’t going away. I expect this stock to keep climbing to new heights. Sometimes investing is simple: Find a great business with years of growth ahead and let it ride. Eli Lilly checks all the boxes right now.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share hit $2.58, blowing past Wall Street estimates. Management is so confident that they raised full-year EPS guidance by $1.30 to $13.50 to $14.00.\n\nI see plenty of runway ahead for Lilly. Obesity and diabetes rates sadly show no signs of abating. An aging population means more patients will need Lilly’s life-changing medicines. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish, and the stock’s relative strength is top-notch. That said, growth is not infinite, and a Harris presidency could spell trouble for healthcare companies with fat margins.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Thursday as heavyweight technology stocks appeared to be easing from bruising losses in recent sessions, with focus turning to key upcoming inflation data.\n\nFutures rose after Wall Street endured another mostly negative session, following some disappointing major tech earnings earlier this week. But the pace of losses in tech stocks now appeared to be slowing.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.3% to 5,456.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 19,049.0 points by 20:16 ET (00:16 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 40,284.0 points.\n\nTech steadies in after-hours trade after bruising losses\n\nHeavyweight technology stocks steadied in after-hours trading after logging steep losses over the past week. Selling in tech intensified this week following underwhelming earnings from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), with the latter potentially setting a precedent for earnings from other internet giants.\n\nTesla, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) all moved in a tight range. But Alphabet saw extended losses after OpenAI unveiled an artificial intelligence search engine aimed to compete directly with Google.\n\nTech earnings are set to continue in the coming week, with Microsoft and Apple due on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. Prints from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) are also due next week.\n\nBut a sustained rout in tech saw the NASDAQ Composite close down 0.9% at 17,181.72 on Thursday- its weakest level since early-June. The S&P 500 fell 0.5% to an over one-month low of 5,399.22 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% to 39,935.07 points, benefiting from some defensive buying.\n\nPCE inflation data on tap\n\nSelling in tech was also driven by increased expectations for interest rate cuts, which saw investors lock profits in the sector and pivot into stocks with more exposure to an economic recovery.\n\nPCE price index data due later on Friday is set to provide more cues on the rates front. The reading is the preferred inflation of the Federal Reserve, and is likely to factor into the central bank’s stance on interest rates.\n\nThe reading comes just days before a Fed meeting next week. The central bank is widely expected to keep rates steady, while investors will be watching for any cues on when it plans to begin cutting rates.\n\nGeneral consensus is for a 25 basis point cut in September.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise as tech rout pauses; PCE data awaited\n\nStory continues\n\nJuniper Networks Falls on Earnings Miss, Q2 Revenue Down 17% YoY\n\nEarnings call: Ameriprise Financial boasts record revenues of $4.2 billion\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Eminence Capital’s Ricky Sandler is Bullish on This Stock Right Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Eminence Capital's Ricky Sandler.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks.\n\nInvesting prowess runs in Ricky Sandler's family. The manager of prominent hedge fund Eminence Capital had a 13F portfolio worth more than $7 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2024. His father was a research analyst at Goldman Sachs, one of the premier investment banks in the world, and later went on to manage a hedge fund. Sandler has had a somewhat similar career trajectory, beginning as a research associate for Mark Asset Management before making his name as a hedge fund manager at Fusion Capital Management. In 1999, Sandler founded Eminence Capital, growing the small fund into a multi-billion dollar investment firm over the course of two decades. The fund focuses on uncovering value in the market through fundamental research, an art that seems to be dying on Wall Street as fast money schemes become more popular.\n\nThe investing philosophy of Sandler has been influenced by his work at Mark Asset Management and Fusion Capital Management. At the former, Sandler learned the importance of focusing on a bottom-up research strategy aimed at picking great businesses. At the latter, Sandler learned that investing in good businesses was not enough. In order to create wealth, money managers had a duty to invest in great businesses at value prices, thereby creating room for future growth. Sandler calls this the “quality value” approach to investing. He made these comments in an appearance on the Equity Mates podcast last year. Sandler, in remarks made during the podcast, stressed that investors should not only buy at good prices but should also not stay invested in equities when they become too expensive. Young investors would do well to pick up on this simple yet effective tip.\n\nAt Eminence Capital, Sandler has developed a long-short equity strategy that has paid huge dividends for clients. Per the hedge fund manager, the Asian debt crisis in the late 1990s was one of the formative events in his life that led him to understand the value of an effective shorting strategy. During the crisis, the International Monetary Fund had to pump in more than $40 billion into large economies in East Asia to contain the spread of the meltdown to the world economy. The company Sandler was a part of at the time owned stakes in many mid-cap Asian firms that were hit particularly hard by the crisis, leading to huge losses for his fund. Sandler now makes sure that his stock pickers spend at least half of their time developing individual stock shorts, a strategy that aims to build up the defenses of his fund should the market take a turn for the worst.\n\nStory continues\n\nSandler believes that in the present economic environment, only investors that have valuation discipline and short selling skills will be able to keep pace with the changing dynamics of the stock market. However, he also underlines that long bets remain equally important. The New York-based manager outlines his long investing philosophy as owning mispriced stocks that have the potential to take a turn for the better in the coming two or three years. Sandler emphasizes the importance of investing in ownable companies — businesses that he describes are well-positioned competitively, sound structurally with trusted management teams, and able to generate solid cash flows. Sandler urges money managers to invest only in firms that they would be comfortable investing in for their family portfolio. A look at the top picks in his latest 13F portfolio illustrates this strategy in action.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned the stock portfolio of Eminence Capital according to the 13F filings submitted at the end of the first quarter of 2024. We selected the top 10 stocks from this portfolio. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) CALL\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nEminence Capital’s Stake: $229,623,740\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a diversified technology firm with core interests in ecommerce. The value proposition of the stock can be understood by looking at a few key financial metrics and strategic moves made public by the firm over the past few months. Over the last twelve months, the company has generated earnings per share of $3.57. This value is expected to grow by 23% in the coming year, from $4.72 to $5.80 per share​. This gives the stock plenty of room for growth and seems consistent with the Sandler strategy of buying good companies at value prices.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is investing heavily in expanding AWS infrastructure and capabilities, with plans to launch new regions and data centers, indicating long-term growth prospects and a commitment to maintaining a competitive edge​. The ongoing innovation in AI and cloud services, exemplified by new AWS capabilities and customer adoption, positions the firm favorably in rapidly growing tech sectors​\n\nIn a recent investor letter, Lakehouse Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered an impressive quarterly result that also came in well ahead of analyst expectations. Net sales increased 13% year-on-year to $143.3 billion and operating profits increased 219% year-on-year to $15.3 billion (vs the high end of guidance at $12.0 billion). As has been the case for several quarters now, the highlight of the result was the significant improvement in profitability metrics, as management continues to drive cost efficiencies across its retail operations and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Bigger picture, we continue to believe that the market underestimates the length of the runway ahead in the core retail business (note that e-commerce sales in the U.S. still only make up 15% of total retail sales) and that there is still significant margin expansion ahead as scale and efficiency benefits continue to come through.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Eminence Capital's Ricky Sandler. You can visit 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Eminence Capital's Ricky Sandlerto see the other stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Before investing in Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock, it is essential to analyze varying viewpoints in order to soundly decide. Oracle is one of the major companies in the cloud computing and software for enterprise markets.\n\nThe financial performance of Oracle has been good with strong revenues and earnings. It has also paid great attention to the cloud services and enterprise software solutions as its main business strategies. The price targets set by the analysts paint a positive picture for Oracle stock with the shares possibly rising by 5% to 6%.\n\nHowever, Oracle is a direct cloud rival to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, investors should ask themselves this question. Is Oracle stock a good value right now?\n\nI personally believe that it’s a hold. But, I will also explore alternative points of view as I believe its valuation is not so straightforward.\n\nWhy ORCL is a Hold\n\nI have come up with a recommendation of hold for the stock. Recent financial performances are good with Q1 revenue up 9% to $12.5 billion. And cloud services revenue grew by 30%. Yet, I’m concerned about some underlying issues.\n\nWithin a highly competitive market, Oracle’s 66% growth in the infrastructure services is impressive. But it still has Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud ahead of them. It concerns me most about their failed $10 billion deal with xAI which makes me question their ability to land and retain major clients in this space.\n\nThe company’s insiders are selling their stakes, with many prominent insiders selling their shares over the last twelve months. This makes me worry if there are some things that we are not aware of about the company.\n\nFurthermore, Oracle stock’s valuation gives me some concern. At a P/E of about 36x earnings, one has to suspect that a lot of positive expectation is being reflected in the share price. However, while their cloud transition is progressing, I’m not convinced it justifies this premium yet.\n\nCloud and AI Transition Turbulence\n\nSeveral potential issues are at hand along with its many positives. Thus, based on the analysis of the company’s position, one could recommend selling Oracle stock.\n\nWhile the most recent artificial intelligence (AI) deals made by Oracle are substantial, I believe in an inevitable general stagnation of the AI industry that could subsequently affect the growth of Oracle.\n\nThe AI revolution is booming. However, it’s crucial to note that we are working from the lowest baseline possible since it is brand new technology. Incremental growth then looks like giant leaps forward, and its growth is expected to slow down exponentially as time progresses. If CPU and GPU development is reflective of the trajectory of the AI market, due to the failure of Moore’s law, an inflection point will be reached. Then, diminishing returns will start to kick in, making each iteration and improvement of AI models comparatively less impressive and powerful.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, this is more a broader criticism of the AI industry as a whole. But I think if investors were banking on Oracle to be a “picks and shovels” stock to enable pipedreams like artificial general intelligence (AGI) in the near future, then they might be sorely disappointed with our slow, realistic progress.\n\nConcepts like AGI are either going to come within reach during the next few years or not at all. Yet, no evidence suggest we’re even close to it.\n\nCloud Dominance and AI Synergy\n\nDespite market inability to hold rational expectations for potential, overall disruption, Oracle’s current focus on AI and cloud infrastructure is a prime reason to invest.\n\nSome of the strategic partnerships that the company has made, especially with OpenAI, make it a tactical play in the AI revolution. Oracle reports a 30% increase in the company’s cloud services revenues. And the infrastructure services revenue increases at an even higher rate of 66% annually. This trend is expected to continue as management estimates mid teen revenue growth for fiscal year 2025.\n\nThe core business gives a steady cash flow, and the cloud and AI business lines provide much room for growth.\n\nHowever, I still think that Oracle stock is a hold. The cloud and AI industries are now one and the same, with AI being a major predicted growth driver. More evidence and progress are needed in order to definitively rule on the impact upon society.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Universal Music Group stock plunges 20% after streaming, subscription revenue disappoints",
        "content": "Hollywood's top music label is struggling to grow in the ultra-competitive streaming market.\n\nShares of Netherlands-based Universal Music Group (UMG.AS), which represents A-list artists like Taylor Swift, Drake, Justin Bieber, and Adele, dropped 20% shortly after the opening bell on Thursday. The sharp decline came after the company unveiled sluggish results for its streaming and subscription businesses.\n\nThe stock is currently on track for its biggest one-day loss ever.\n\nThe company's second-quarter subscription revenue slowed to 6.9% growth year over year, excluding foreign exchange (FX). That's down from 12.5% in the first quarter—and a miss compared to Bloomberg consensus estimates of 11% growth.\n\nStreaming revenue, meanwhile, decreased 3.9% ex-FX in the second quarter, a significant reversal from the 10.3% growth it recorded in Q1. The company blamed the decrease on \"a deceleration in growth at key advertising-based platform partners as well as shortfalls on certain platforms related to the timing of deal renewals.\"\n\nDeals with social media platforms, a popular option for music distribution, have become more of a headache for the company in recent months.\n\nIn May, UMG ended its partnership with Meta Platforms (META), which was licensing premium music videos for Facebook. Management said that the product offering \"was less popular with Facebook's user base than other music products.\"\n\nUMG also revealed it lost a month's worth of revenue amid its high-profile battle with TikTok over a new licensing agreement, which the pair eventually resolved.\n\nCiti analyst Thomas Singlehurst, who downgraded shares to Neutral from Buy, said although the volatility \"may prove to be temporary,\" he expects \"disappointment to weigh on sentiment\" in the near term. Slow growth? Taylor Smith at the 2019 American Music Awards in Los Angeles. (Photo: REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nOn the earnings call, UMG vice president and CFO Boyd Muir said the year over year deceleration in subscription growth was \"partially due to the timing of price increases\" from its partners.\n\nUMG's partners include audio streaming giants like Spotify (SPOT), Amazon Music (AMZN) and Apple Music (AAPL) — all of which have raised prices in recent years, which has helped UMG bring in additional revenue for its subscription business.\n\n\"The other factor impacting our subscription revenue growth this quarter is the slowdown in subscriber growth at certain platforms, which is occurring while the overall subscription marketplace continues to experience significant growth in subscribers globally,\" Muir added.\"While Spotify, YouTube and many regional and local platforms have continued to exhibit healthy growth in subscribers, other large partners who have been less successful in driving global adoption have seen a slowdown in new subscriber additions.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe executive did not specifically call out which platforms were seeing a downtick in subscribers, but did say the company is \"engaged with all of our key partners\" in dialogue regarding product innovation.\n\nHe highlighted Spotify's comments from Tuesday around its yet-to-be announced \"super premium\" offering, which Spotify said \"consumers are really asking us to do.\"\n\nMuir backed Spotify's thesis, adding, \"Our research and analysis indicate that as many as 20% of the current subscriber base could upgrade to a super-premium tier at a meaningfully higher price point for a compelling product configuration, one which offers enhanced features and exclusive access to content.\"\n\nDespite the disappointments, the company still saw strong growth in divisions like merchandising revenue, which jumped 44% in Q2 thanks to artists like Taylor Swift. Other top sellers for the first half of 2024 included Morgan Wallen, Noah Kahan, Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande.\n\nTotal revenue rose for the twelfth consecutive quarter to 2.93 billion euros ($3.18 billion), representing roughly 9% year over year growth—and ahead of consensus estimates. Adjusted EBITDA increased more than 11% from the prior-year period (excluding foreign exchange) to 649 million euros, or $705 million.\n\nEarlier this year, UMG launched a restructuring plan in an effort to generate 250 million euros in annual savings by 2026, which included job cuts.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Dip Buying Opportunity: 3 Leading Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Yesterday, the S&P 500 experienced its first 2% selloff in nearly two years, after trading lower five of the previous six days. Is this the end of the bull market? I think probably not.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the market is going to rally immediately back to new all-time highs though either. There is a real possibility that stocks chop around for a few months leading up to the presidential election, but that doesn’t mean you should wait until then to start buying.\n\nIn this situation, I think there are three good options out there; buy shares in what has been working like mega cap tech stocks, buy shares in more defensive names, or buy shares of uncorrelated stocks.\n\nHere I am going to share my favorite pick from each of these options. Amazon (AMZN) represents the tech stock, International Paper (IP) the defensive and Newmont (NEM) the uncorrelated. Each of them enjoys top Zacks Ranks and two of them are outperforming the market year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon: Tech Giant Trading at a Historical Discount\n\nAmazon, a leading force in the technology sector and an unparalleled giant in the e-commerce and cloud computing spaces, presents a compelling investment opportunity. Despite the market's recent volatility, Amazon has demonstrated resilience and strength, making it an attractive option for investors seeking both growth and value. Additionally, Amazon currently boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.\n\nAmazon's performance during the recent market sell-off has been notable. The company has maintained the best relative strength among the mega-cap technology stocks, reflecting its ability to withstand market pressures better than its peers in the current environment.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of Amazon's investment case is its robust earnings growth prospects. Analysts project Amazon's earnings per share (EPS) to grow at an annual rate of 29.6% over the next three to five years.\n\nThis forecasted growth rate is particularly impressive given Amazon's size and maturity. For a company of Amazon's scale, such rapid growth underscores its ability to continually innovate, expand its market presence, and drive profitability across its various business segments.\n\nAmazon's current valuation presents a unique buying opportunity. The stock is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 38.4x, which is significantly below its five-year median of 71.9x. To provide further context, this valuation is the lowest Amazon has experienced in the past decade, making it a historically attractive entry point for investors.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNewmont: Riding the Trend Higher in Gold\n\nNewmont stands out as an attractive investment opportunity, particularly for those looking to capitalize on the strong upward trend in gold prices and the often-uncorrelated returns they offer. The company's robust fundamentals and favorable market conditions make it a compelling addition to any portfolio.\n\nNewmont currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions and improving the odds of near-term strength.\n\nNewmont is also effectively riding the wave of increasing gold prices, which have recently reached new all-time highs. The company’s performance is closely linked to the price of gold, and as gold continues to outperform the S&P 500, Newmont benefits significantly. Investors seeking exposure to the precious metals market can find Newmont to be an attractive option, as it stands to gain from any further appreciation in gold prices.\n\nNewmont's earnings per share (EPS) growth forecasts are particularly noteworthy. Analysts project EPS to grow at an impressive annual rate of 47.9% over the next three to five years.\n\nDespite its strong growth prospects, Newmont is trading at an appealing valuation. The company has a forward earnings multiple of 18.1x, which is relatively low compared to its industry peers. Additionally, Newmont boasts a PEG ratio of just 0.38, indicating that the stock is undervalued relative to its expected growth.\n\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, Newmont's chart setup is also quite promising. The stock is currently forming a bull flag pattern, a continuation pattern that typically precedes further upward movement. If Newmont can hold this pattern and break out above the $47.30 level, it would confirm a technical breakout, potentially leading to significant gains. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nInternation Paper: Strong Performance During Market Correction\n\nInternational Paper has proven its resilience and defensive nature during the recent market volatility, emerging as a standout performer. While the broad market has experienced a 3% decline over the past two weeks, International Paper has gained 7%.\n\nInternational Paper holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting its strong fundamentals and positive outlook from analysts. The company's earnings estimates have been consistently revised upward across various timeframes, with FY25 earnings estimates seeing a notable 13.6% increase over the past two months.\n\nInternational Paper offers a substantial dividend yield of 4%, making it an attractive choice for income-focused investors. The company's commitment to returning cash to shareholders is further evidenced by its steady share buyback program over the last decade, which has reduced shares outstanding by 20% in that time.\n\nDuring periods of market correction, defensive stocks like International Paper often shine. The company's strong performance amidst market volatility highlights its ability to provide stability and relative safety for investors.  TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nBottom Line\n\nIn this uncertain environment, I offer investors three options: investing in high-performing mega-cap tech stocks, shifting to more defensive names, or diversifying with uncorrelated stocks. Each of these strategies has its merits, and choosing the right mix depends on individual risk tolerance and investment goals.\n\nWhile market volatility can be unsettling, it also presents opportunities for strategic investment. Amazon, Newmont, and International Paper each offer unique advantages, whether through growth potential, defensive stability, or uncorrelated returns. By carefully selecting stocks from these categories, investors can navigate the choppy waters leading up to the presidential election and position themselves for long-term success.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The New York Post reports that TNT had attempted to match Amazon's offer, but the NBA claimed TNT \"did not match the terms.\" In contrast, TNT argued that the NBA had \"grossly misinterpreted our contractual rights\" and might contest the deal.\n\nFinancial Implications for Amazon: The financial commitment from Amazon is substantial, with the New York Times reporting an annual payment of approximately $1.8 billion over the 11-year period.\n\nBofA projects Amazon will spend $21 billion on Prime Video and Music content by 2024, showing a 12% year-over-year growth. This growth rate is expected to accelerate as the NBA season approaches in Q4 2025.\n\nThis NBA deal represents Amazon's largest content agreement to date, surpassing the roughly $1 billion annually paid for their NFL deal, per Forbes.\n\nMaking Prime Video Profitable: Amazon aims to make Prime Video profitable as a standalone entity. BofA analysts identify three revenue streams that could help Amazon cover the NBA licensing costs:\n\nStory continues\n\nPrime Subscription Fees: Amazon has over 200 million global Prime subscribers. With the NBA's significant international appeal, Amazon could leverage this content to drive global Prime subscriptions and increase annual subscription fees. Advertising Revenue: Amazon is enhancing its advertising capabilities, and with superior targeting compared to traditional television, it should be able to generate significant ad revenues. Prime Shopping Activity: Prime members typically spend 2-3 times more than non-Prime shoppers. This deal could help reduce Prime churn during crucial holiday months, thereby boosting shopping gross profit.\n\nBofA maintains a \"Buy\" rating on Amazon, with a price objective of $220.00 per share, currently trading at $180.83 as of July 25, 2024. The firm believes that Amazon's consistent successes with its NFL deal make the new NBA partnership an attractive and strategic venture.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBofA analyzes Amazon's 11-year deal to stream NBA games on Prime Video\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court upholds Prop 22: Effects on Uber, Lyft, DoorDash\n\nGoogle AI systems make headway with math in progress toward reasoning\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Companies Gearing Up for a Stock Split",
        "content": "Sometimes, the success of a company can take the stock so high that it pushes investors away. It is due to this reason that the management announces a stock split.\n\nWhile a stock split does not change anything in terms of the fundamentals of the company, it makes it easier for investors to own the stock. 2024 has been the year for stock splits and there are many stock split candidates that could make the big announcement.\n\nRight from the tech darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to the popular Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), they have all gone through splits this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRetail investors pounce on the opportunity of a stock split and make the most of the opportunity.\n\nA lower price means the stock becomes easily affordable and usually gets a boost after it starts trading at the new price. Here are three companies that are ideal stock split candidates for the year. Let’s take a look at them.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nUp 41% year-to-date, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock is exchanging hands for $834 and is one of the top pharma stocks to own. The company has reported impressive revenue growth, driven by the obesity drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro.\n\nIt hit the 52-week high of $960 earlier this month and has seen a pullback lately. Besides weight loss, the company also has a solid portfolio of drugs used in cancer and it was recently granted FDA approval for donanemab, its Alzheimer’s drug.\n\nAfter receiving the FDA approval for Mounjaro in 2023, the company has seen steady sales growth. It generated $1.8 billion in revenue in the first quarter while Zepbound generated $517 million.\n\nThese are two blockbuster drugs in the market that have seen massive demand and Eli Lilly has invested $9 billion in a new manufacturing facility to boost production.\n\nThe company’s upcoming quarterly results could push the stock toward $1,000 and make it difficult for investors to own it. It is clear that the demand for weight loss drugs is high and Eli Lilly is in the position to make the most of it.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been on a rally for 18 months and is up 147% YTD. Exchanging hands for $705, the stock has been steadily moving higher since the beginning of the year and now would be the ideal time for a split.\n\nIts partnership with Nvidia has given the stock a boost and as Nvidia grows, SMCI follows. The company got a first-mover advantage and as the AI market expanded, it showed tremendous growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt makes servers that help run AI processors and microchips and the company has seen impressive demand across the world. The future is AI and with the demand steadily rising, SMCI is at the right place at the right time. Super Micro Computer added three new facilities this year to meet the demand.\n\nThe company was recently added to the Nasdaq 100 index which will give it more exposure as mutual funds and ETFs that track this index will buy the shares.\n\nFundamentally, SMCI has become a hot property. In the third quarter, it saw a 200% jump in revenue to hit $3.85 billion and it is aiming for a revenue of $14.7 billion for the full year.\n\nWhile a stock split does not change anything fundamentally for the company, it can make the stock cheaper for investors. As SMCI inches closer to $1,000, a stock split could be on the cards.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) debuted in 2007 and the company has never split its stock. This year could be different. Trading at $1,650, the stock is valued at a premium and is up 8% YTD. It is up 40% in the past 12 months and the company doesn’t pay dividends either.\n\nThe Latin American e-commerce company is very similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and operates in a market where it has seen tremendous growth. It has diversified into fintech and focuses on digital payments. The biggest benefit that the company has is its location.\n\nIt operates in Latin America where fintech is still in the growth stage and there is minimal competition. In the first quarter, it saw a 36% YOY jump in revenue to $4.33 billion and 59% of the total revenue came from Brazil. Even its advertising revenue grew 64% YOY.\n\nAs a business, MercadoLibre is a lucrative undertaking and generates adequate cash to keep investing in new opportunities. Its e-commerce segment saw massive growth and the business reported an EPS of $6.78 per share.\n\nMELI stock could keep moving higher, driven by the strong fundamentals and market expansion. MercadoLibre is in a very strong position to benefit from the growing popularity of e-commerce and digital payments. The company will report results next week and could keep the momentum going.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Microsoft’s MSFT fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results, scheduled to be reported on Jul 30, are likely to be driven by the consistent growth in its cloud platform, Azure. (Read Now: Should You Buy, Sell or Hold Microsoft Before Q4 Earnings?)\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft expects Intelligent Cloud revenues (Azure falls under the segment) between $28.4 billion and $28.7 billion. \r\n\r\nOur model estimate for this segment is pegged at $28.54 billion, indicating growth of 19% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-eps-surprise | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nAzure's Continued Growth to Propel MSFT's Top Line in Q4\n\nMicrosoft is witnessing robust demand for its cloud infrastructure monitoring, web-based application performance management and human capital management solutions. This demand is fueled by the increasing migration of workloads to the cloud.\r\n\r\nDuring the fiscal third quarter, Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% (up 31% at cc), including roughly 7 points from AI services, which was higher than the previous quarter's 30% (28% at cc). \r\n\r\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft expects Azure revenue growth at cc between 30% and 31%, with increasing contributions from all Azure AI services. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft is witnessing an acceleration of revenues from migrations to Azure. MSFT has become the hyperscale platform of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads, with Conduent and Medline moving their on-premises Oracle estates to Azure, and Kyndryl and L’Oreal migrating their SAP workloads to Azure.\r\n\r\nThe company is seeing an acceleration in the number of large Azure deals from leaders across industries, including billion-dollar-plus multi-year commitments announced recently from Cloud Software Group and The Coca-Cola Company. In the fiscal third quarter, the number of 100 million dollar-plus Azure deals increased more than 80% year over year, while the number of 10 million dollar-plus deals more than doubled.\r\n\r\nAzure's increased availability in more than 60 announced regions globally is expected to have strengthened the tech giant's competitive position in the cloud computing market, dominated by Amazon’s AMZN cloud division, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), and Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud.\r\n\r\nIn the last reported quarter, AWS revenues (18% of sales) rose 17% year over year to $25.04 billion. The expansion of AWS' portfolio has been helping Amazon maintain its dominance in the cloud domain by gaining more customers.\r\n\r\nAlphabet's Google Cloud revenues rose 28.4% year over year to $9.6 billion, accounting for 11.9% of the quarter’s total revenues. Google Cloud reported operating income of $900 million compared with $191 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAzure AI Gives MSFT Competitive Edge in Generative AI Market\n\nMSFT’s AI innovation continues to build on its strategic partnership with OpenAI. More than 65% of the Fortune 500 now use Azure OpenAI Service. The company also continues to innovate and partner broadly to bring customers the best selection of frontier models and open-source models, LLMs and SLMs.\r\n\r\nThe number of Azure AI customers and average spend continue to grow. More than half of Azure AI customers also use the company’s data and analytics tools. Customers are building intelligent applications running on Azure PostgreSQL and Cosmos DB, with deep integrations with Azure AI.\r\n\r\nIn the quarter under review, Microsoft announced an expanded strategic alliance with ServiceNow NOW, combining its industry-leading generative AI capabilities to enhance employee choice and flexibility.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft announced a $3.3 billion investment designed to strengthen the role of Southeast Wisconsin as a hub for AI-powered economic activity, innovation and job creation. The company also invested $1.5 billion in G42, a leading UAE-based AI technology holding company, to enhance the country's position as a global AI hub.\r\n\r\nDespite these cutting-edge AI moves, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 18.3% year to date compared with the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 23.8% growth amid intensifying competition from Amazon and Alphabet as they are all making aggressive moves to expand their generative AI capabilities. Shares of AMAZN and GOOGL have returned 22.7% and 30.1%, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe launch of enterprise capabilities of Azure OpenAI and Copilots across Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 and Power Platform is expected to be a game changer. New Azure AI Studio is becoming the tool of choice for AI development in this new era, helping organizations ground, fine-tune, evaluate and deploy models, and do so responsibly.\r\n\r\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Amazon (AMZN) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "content": "The market expects Amazon (AMZN) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis online retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +63.5%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $148.63 billion, up 10.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amazon?\n\nFor Amazon, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +4.58%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Amazon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Amazon would post earnings of $0.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.13, delivering a surprise of +36.14%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nAmazon appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nEtsy (ETSY), another stock in the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.46 for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -44.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $632.2 million, up 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Etsy has been revised 0.9% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -4.81%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Etsy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential",
        "content": "Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) still has some scenarios where an attractive upside is possible, even after its shares rose more than 160% year to date. However, this scenario is only possible if optimistic assumptions come true, since in more reasonable scenarios, it is possible to find a fair price close to the current one or even a downside.\n\nCombining the possibility of a more modest scenario materializing at some point in the future (even if the next few quarters remain strong and above expectations), with the fact earnings should be cyclical, I believe the stock currently has a narrow margin of safety.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nIf we consider the company will continue to benefit from this secular trend, there is an upside of just over 20% (bullish scenario). On the other hand, the downside could be of the same intensity (or even worse) if the growth discount rate is slightly reduced and the discount rate increases.\n\nNvidia has great prospects, but should be cyclical\n\nIt is very easy to find studies that show the bullish prospects for Nvidia. The company itself provides a vision of the $1 trillion long-term available market opportunity, divided between $300 billion in data center systems, $300 billion in autonomous machines and the remainder in other complementary lines such as omniverse, artificial intelligence enterprise and gaming. Just considering this total addressable market, where Nvidia is the leader and has competitive advantages and technological barriers, we would already have justification for drawing up a bullish scenario. Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential\n\nSource: Nvidia Investor Presentation\n\nBut we do not need to consider only this information. According to P&S Intelligence, the data center market size by 2030 should reach $622.40 billion, with a compound annual growth rate of 10.10%. Grand View Research believes the U.S. Data Center Market should reach a CAGR of 10.70%, while the global market size will grow at a rate of 10.90% per year over the same period. The Autonomous Robots Market, according to Fact.MR, should have a CAGR of 9.20% by 2033. An even more bullish view is that of Skyquestt, which projects the GPU Market size should reach a CAGR of 33% in the period from 2024 to 2031 due to its diverse application possibilities in a range of sectors, including automotive, aerospace and cryptocurrency, among others.\n\nIn short, the increased need for GPUs has become a secular trend. But at the same time, these massive purchases should be cyclical, and this needs to be reflected in the company's projections. In recent years, companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have substantially increased their capital expenditures. Because they are developing artificial intelligence technology and have relevant cloud infrastructure, they end up being a big part of Nvidia's revenue. In the earnings call, it was mentioned that \"public-cloud hyperscalers\" still represented close to 50% of all data center revenue.\n\nStory continues Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential\n\nSource: Koyfin\n\nTo illustrate this further, Meta continues to invest billions to buy Nvidia's GPUs and develop its generative AI initiatives. Even if this continues in the short and medium term, at some point the company will have had enough and will want to reduce this capex to increase its free cash flow. In my opinion, this is where Nvidia's main point of doubt lies: after the bulk of capex from the big companies, will occasional technology updates (during card swaps) and penetration into new industries be enough to sustain this level of multibillion-dollar revenue and sustainable growth?\n\nBullish scenario - 20% upside\n\nFor the bullish scenario, let's consider a high but still feasible growth rate for Nvidia. For example, in revenue for this year, there is similar growth to that seen in previous quarters, and that is indicated in next quarter's guidance. This higher pace starts in 2025 (calendar year) at 20% and gradually declines to 10% in 2030. We might think this revenue CAGR, although high, is achievable, but it would be necessary for the Data Center segment to remain strong for a few more years, capturing new industries and with Nvidia unlocking new revenue lines to sustain this growth.\n\nIn this scenario, we also consider margins to be high, with a slight normalization of the gross margin, which falls to 76%, a level that is still very robust. This correction in the gross margin is more than offset by possible (even greater) gains in scale and efficiency, with selling, general and administrative as well as research and development costs gradually reducing compared to revenue, so that the Ebitda margin continues to expand. With this, we have the following projected income statement for the coming years: Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential\n\nSource: Nvidia and Author's projections\n\nIn addition, the cash flow assumptions considered a capex of -2% of revenue, decreasing to -1.50% in 2027 and a variation in working capital that reduces cash generation by about $800 million per year. Assuming a growth rate of 5% in the terminal stage of this cash flow, we have a fair price of $156 for Nvidia. But note this fair price, in addition to all these optimistic assumptions, still depends on a discount rate of 8.41%, implying an equity risk premium of 2.50%. Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential\n\nSource: Nvidia and Author's projections\n\nBase scenario - 24% downside\n\nSlightly modifying the assumptions to make the scenario more reasonable, revenue growth from 2026 onwards was slightly reduced, with the company achieving 8% growth per year from 2030 onwards. The other margin assumptions with gradual progress were maintained. As a result, 2030 Ebitda falls from $184 billion to $168 billion. Based on this, we have the following projected income statement for the coming years: Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential\n\nSource: Nvidia and Author's projections\n\nMaintaining the other cash flow assumptions, but reducing terminal stage growth from 5% to 4.50% and increasing the equity risk premium from 2.50% to 3.50%, we have a discount rate of 9.40% and a fair price of $98 for Nvidia, which would imply a downside of 24%.\n\nIn my opinion, a 24% downside seems very pessimistic, but the assumptions that justify this fair price are not so bad since, in reality, a relevant growth in revenue has been maintained, the high margins have been maintained, a certain perpetuation of growth has been maintained and a discount rate consistent with the reality of the market has been applied.\n\nOf course, being a premium company and one that the market rewards a lot, a lower discount rate may make more sense given the possibility of positive surprises in conjunction with Nvidia's relevance to today's technology segment. But the opposite is also true since the current valuation leaves little room for negative surprises.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAs shown above, in a DCF model with optimistic assumptions, it is still possible to find an interesting upside for Nvidia. This, coupled with the quality and competitive advantages, can serve as a bullish argument to justify exposure to the stock.\n\nI believe the company deserves a premium valuation, rewarding not only its recent high growth and competitive advantages, but also its very interesting prospects, which are one of the most robust trends today.\n\nBut this also comes at a price: Nvidia should be able to continue surfing the growth of its markets, but this does not leave it immune from a cyclicality that may eventually arise, especially if the big tech and cloud companies reduce their capex without compensation from new industries.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia's shares are currently at a level where there is a strong dependence on this momentum continuing to justify the rich valuation since a good part of the thesis' value lies in the growth it will have over the years.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Warner Bros. stock falls after losing 'key' NBA rights as league secures $77 billion deal with Disney, Comcast, and Amazon",
        "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) lost a key media rights deal with the NBA, the league confirmed in a statement on Wednesday. The news sent shares of the company down about 7% in early trading on Thursday.\n\nIt's a gut punch for the legacy media giant, which has aired NBA games through its TNT network since 1989. It reportedly shells out $1.2 billion annually for the rights, which expire at the end of next season.\n\nThe loss of the rights will also impact TNT's NBA-adjacent content, such as \"Inside the NBA,\" the acclaimed show hosted by retired players Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley, and Kenny Smith.\n\nUltimately, Warner Bros. was unable to secure a new deal during a months-long negotiating period that expired on April 22. That set off a race to secure the media rights to air NBA games, which ended up ballooning their value even more.\n\nOn Monday, Warner Bros. revealed it had matched Amazon’s media rights bid to continue airing NBA games, a move which was widely viewed as a last-ditch effort to secure the games. But the league confirmed Wednesday that it had denied the offer.\n\n“Warner Bros. Discovery’s most recent proposal did not match the terms of Amazon Prime Video’s offer and, therefore, we have entered into a long-term arrangement with Amazon,\" the NBA said in its statement.\n\nWarner Bros. fought back with a statement of its own, writing, “We have matched the Amazon offer, as we have a contractual right to do, and do not believe the NBA can reject it.”\n\n“We think they have grossly misinterpreted our contractual rights with respect to the 2025-26 season and beyond, and we will take appropriate action,” the company warned.\n\nCNBC reported Thursday the company plans to sue the NBA. Both entities did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.\n\nBut Wall Street analysts say any potential litigation might not go far for the company.\n\nMacquarie analyst Tim Nollen, who downgraded shares of WBD to Neutral from Outperform over the loss of the rights, wrote on Thursday: \"WBD evidently intends to litigate the NBA's decision, which it may be entitled to do, but it's hard to see an amicable endgame. Even if WBD were to win, the costs may be prohibitive.\"\n\nIn total, the NBA secured a media rights package worth around $77 billion over 11 years with new partners that include tech giant Amazon (AMZN) and Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA). It was also able to strike a new agreement with its other current media partner, Disney (DIS).\n\n“Our new global media agreements with Disney, NBCUniversal and Amazon will maximize the reach and accessibility of NBA games for fans in the United States and around the world,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “These partners will distribute our content across a wide range of platforms and help transform the fan experience over the next decade.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon, NBCU, Disney: The NBA's $77 billion deal\n\nAmazon (AMZN) struck a streaming rights package through its Prime Video service for a reported $1.9 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal. The NBA said the package includes both regular-season and playoff games, plus the play-in tournament and a share of conference finals, which would rotate between the media partners.\n\nComcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA) submitted a reported bid worth $2.5 billion. The network will show about 100 games per season, with half airing exclusively on its streaming service Peacock.\n\nDisney (DIS), the NBA's other current major broadcast partner, will retain its share of the league's media rights after reportedly agreeing to increase its payment of $1.5 billion a year to $2.6 billion in order to renew the deal, per the Journal.\n\nThe company will carry fewer games compared to its current package, although ABC will remain the exclusive home of the NBA Finals, which it has broadcast since 2003, the league said. It will also have one of the conference finals for 10 of the 11 years of the deal. Kristaps Porzingis of the Boston Celtics (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nSports rights have become increasingly important for legacy media giants as more consumers cut the cord. The content is viewed as \"sticky,\" meaning loyal audiences are more willing to fork over their monthly cable package or streaming service fee to access sports over other types of content.\n\nBut the field has become more competitive, with tech giants like Amazon, Apple (AAPL), and YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL) committing heavily to sports streaming deals over the past year. That's inflated the overall costs of sports as traditional media giants struggle to keep up amid steep streaming losses and major declines in linear advertising revenue.\n\n\"There are more choices than there ever have been in the media landscape,\" Mark Tatum, deputy commissioner of the NBA, told Yahoo Finance in June, prior to the deal's confirmation. \"So that requires going out and having partnerships with many more people in that space, whether it's social and digital media partners, streaming partners, and traditional media partners as well.\"\n\nMacquarie's Nollen, who also cut his price target on shares to $9 from $13, said the loss will impact the future success of its streaming service Max and will likely \"hasten\" the demise of its linear networks.\n\n\"We have held onto our WBD rating in hopes that it would retain the NBA; losing these key rights means it now loses a core content asset for both its linear networks and its Max streaming service,\" he said. \"The former is bad enough – ad revenues will now drop sharply starting in Q4 2025, and bargaining leverage on cable affiliate renewals now falls.\"\n\n\"But it’s the lost opportunity for the Max streaming service that worries us the most over time. We have viewed Max as a broad and deep streaming service with content spanning the Warner Bros. studio, HBO, and Discovery’s lifestyle networks, plus children’s shows and sports – but Max’s sports offering will now be weaker without the NBA.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Bruised Retail Stocks to Play a Consumer Comeback",
        "content": "Wednesday was a brutal day for the broader markets, with the tech sector experiencing the most pain following yesterday’s unimpressive slate of big-tech earnings. A number of consumer stocks were also caught up in the downdraft, as the S&P 500 shed 2.3% of its value. Though it’s far too early to call a consumer spending comeback, I do think it makes a lot of sense to get into some of the well-run, low-cost retail stocks today before the consumer feels the impact of lower inflation, and, perhaps in a year from now, lower interest rates.\n\nOf course, tough sledding for retail comeback stocks and the rest of the market could continue going into September, a historically rough month for broader markets. So, be ready to ride with the volatility as the market looks to surrender some of the gains it had posted in a red-hot start to the summer.\n\nNike (NKE) The swoosh logo for Nike Inc (NKE) is displayed on a wall made of wood panels.\n\nSource: pixfly / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) is a footwear and apparel juggernaut that has seen better days. With NKE stock plunging more than 3% on Wednesday, adding to its brutal multi-year decline, shares have now shed around 60% from their all-time highs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith the Paris Olympic Games just days away, Nike may be able to get a hand raised at the racetrack as it seeks to remind us that it’s still the undisputed king of sporty apparel and, perhaps more importantly, a maker of innovative gear that can perform on the world’s biggest stage.\n\nThe company’s recent Olympic ad is quite inspirational, but as to whether it’ll convince shoppers to start buying sneakers again remains to be seen. As consumers get into the Olympic spirit these coming weeks, perhaps consumers will wish to dawn the same gear as their national Olympian heroes again.\n\nAnalysts over at Bernstein also view NKE stock as a compelling retail rebound play.\n\nAs the company’s previous strategic initiatives begin to pay off while it seizes the biggest marketing opportunity—it doesn’t get bigger than the Olympics—in many years, if not decades, NKE stock definitely looks like a laggard to buy on weakness, even if there’s still a way to go before the bottom is in.\n\nTarget (TGT) Image of the Target (TGT) logo on a storefront.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nTarget (NYSE:TGT) is another retail laggard with a plan to return to its former glory. With TGT stock down 2.5% on Wednesday, putting it off 18% from 52-week highs, perhaps it’s time to give the name the benefit of the doubt while it’s going for 16.1 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). That’s cheap for a company with a decent management team and a credible turnaround plan that could hit the bullseye.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) held its Prime Day, Target kicked off its Target Circle Week, offering a slew of deals for inflation-pained consumers. The week of sales, which was exclusive to its Circle loyalty program, could be a big deal for the firm as it looks to not only clear inventory but drive customer loyalty.\n\nAs Target better positions itself for the new age for the big-box retailers, with its Circle 360 subscription, a new line of cheap private-label brands called dealworthy, and a collab with Canadian e-commerce firm Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), perhaps TGT stock is the ultimate consumer comeback play.\n\nCasey’s General Stores (CASY) Image of Casey's General Store logo on side of a store\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nCasey’s General Stores (NASDAQ:CASY) is a convenience retailer that new large-cap-focused investors have probably never even heard of if they live outside of the U.S. Midwest. The $13.9 billion company is one of the mid-cap-flavored names that I praised in prior pieces for its ability to create value via M&A and smart comparable sales-driving efforts.\n\nSo, what sets Casey’s apart from other big-name convenience firms? Its specialty is hot food (pizza and chicken burgers), prepared foods, and an impressive selection of grocery items, which make the convenience store a great place to shop, even for those who don’t need to fuel up at the attached gas station.\n\nTo put it simply, Casey’s has a high-growth business model that works. As Casey’s pursues tuck-in acquisitions, it’ll be tough to stop the relatively small convenience store chain from continuing its growth. After dipping around 2% from its recent highs, CASY stock looks like a great mid-cap growth retail play for investors willing to pay the premium price tag.\n\nAt 27.8 times trailing P/E, CASY stock isn’t a steal. But, then again, you’ve got to pay up for high-quality growth stories. Furthermore, Casey’s is one that’s more than worth its premium multiple, even if a 2% discount to highs is hardly a “bruise” on the stock.

        "content": "GE HealthCare selects AWS as its strategic cloud provider to deliver entirely new, purpose-built foundation models designed to fast-track the development of innovative healthcare applications GE HealthCare plans to train and deploy clinical foundation models on AWS’s machine learning and generative AI technologies to help healthcare providers expedite clinical and operational workflows to improve delivery of care\n\nCHICAGO, July 25, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GE HealthCare (Nasdaq: GEHC) and Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (Nasdaq: AMZN), today announced a strategic collaboration to develop purpose-built foundation models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications designed to help clinicians improve medical diagnostics and patient care. GE HealthCare has selected AWS as its strategic cloud provider and plans to use its healthcare and generative AI services to build and implement new, versatile foundation models to transform the future of healthcare. These new generative AI-powered workflows are intended to fast-track the delivery of innovations to streamline healthcare operations, increase diagnostic and screening accuracy, enhance outcomes, lower access hurdles, and promote equitable care, thereby easing provider workload and accelerating industry innovation.\n\n\"GE HealthCare has been pioneering medical technology for more than a century. With more than one billion patients around the world touched by our products, we play an important part in improving the quality of care and have a responsibility to continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible to enable precision care,\" said Peter Arduini, President and CEO, GE HealthCare. \"This new collaboration with AWS allows us to build on our legacy of innovation by embracing the power of AI to expedite the creation of medical technologies that we expect will redefine clinical workflows and the delivery of care.\"\n\nGE HealthCare intends to utilize Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that provides secure access to the industry's leading foundation models, to create and deploy bespoke generative AI applications, amplifying the advantages of generative AI for their customers. Leveraging Bedrock’s enterprise-grade security and privacy along with a broad selection of industry-leading foundation models, GE HealthCare plans to build and scale its own proprietary generative AI applications for healthcare use cases with an aim to enhance efficiency, care delivery, and the patient experience.\n\n\"With AWS, GE HealthCare plans to use the cloud to deliver more personalized, intelligent, and efficient care,\" said Matt Garman, CEO of AWS. \"GE HealthCare is putting generative AI at the heart of their innovation, accelerated by the investments we have made in healthcare-specific cloud services and generative AI capabilities that provide best-in-class security, data privacy, and access to the latest state-of-the-art foundation models. With AWS as their strategic cloud provider, GE HealthCare can build transformative clinical foundation models and applications for the healthcare industry.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGE HealthCare’s internal developers are planning to use Amazon Q Developer, a generative AI–powered assistant to accelerate software development by generating real-time code suggestions, securely completing tasks, and more. The company also expects to use Amazon Q Business to explore the intersection of multi-modal clinical and operational data with an aim of reducing the cognitive burden on physicians, enabling personalized care, and increasing efficiency. Leveraging AWS's generative AI technology, GE HealthCare expects to reduce clinical application development cycles from years to months and to accelerate the delivery of new healthcare solutions.\n\n\"By combining generative AI with our deep expertise, we're igniting a new era in healthcare,\" said. Dr. Taha Kass-Hout, Global Chief Science and Technology Officer at GE HealthCare. \"Our work with AWS is a big step towards helping clinicians make medical care simpler, more efficient, and deeply personalized. It's about advancing the way we care for people everywhere, one innovative solution at a time.\"\n\nAdditionally, GE HealthCare plans to modernize its suite of applications with its own foundation models developed on Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed service to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models. By developing its own foundation models specialized for medical use cases, GE HealthCare intends to accelerate the development and deployment of web-based medical imaging applications and integrating these foundation models to drive efficiency, interoperability, and improve user experiences across the company’s equipment and software solutions. Customers could use GE HealthCare's generative AI-powered applications, that will integrate with AWS HealthLake and AWS HealthImaging, to quickly and securely analyze various types of patient data, leading to improved clinical efficiency and better patient care.\n\n\"We are optimistic about the ways in which generative AI will be able to transform healthcare for the better, and we look forward to seeing the new tools and applications that result from collaborations across industry and health care,\" said Dr. Keith Dreyer, Chief Data Science Officer, Mass General Brigham and leader of the Mass General Brigham AI business. \"As healthcare systems like Mass General Brigham lean into AI to accelerate their work, we see great potential for new foundation models that utilize advanced technologies.\"\n\nThe healthcare sector is responsible for about 30%1 of the world's data generation, however, 97%2 of this data goes largely untapped due to its unstructured nature. This collaboration will focus on the development of multi-modal foundation models designed to analyze a vast array of unstructured medical data (e.g., records, reports, and images) and provide precise, adaptable insights for a multitude of healthcare applications. Unlike traditional ML, these models can be built to interpret data across various diseases and tasks simultaneously.\n\nGE HealthCare has been investing in AI for years. For the third year in a row, GE HealthCare topped a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) list of AI-enabled device authorizations, with 72.3 Its recent foundation model work includes a project focused on an advanced ultrasound image segmentation tool. Utilizing foundation model technology, this research tool has demonstrated great proficiency in isolating and identifying anatomical structures with over 90% accuracy, requiring little human input.4 Its key feature is its generalization capability, which can segment anatomical structures, including fetal heads and breast lesions, which were not part of the foundation model’s initial training set. This advanced feature demonstrates the model’s ability to be applied to uses cases beyond what it was originally trained for.\n\nTo learn more about GE HealthCare’s digital solutions and healthcare transformation, visit here.\n\n1 RBC: https://www.rbccm.com/en/gib/healthcare/episode/the_healthcare_data_explosion 2 Deloitte 2023.

        "title": "3 Top Retail Stocks to Consider to Ring Up Big Gains",
        "content": "On July 23, CNBC’sJim Cramer said that U.S. consumers, on the whole, are tired of the elevated prices being charged by some firms. As a result, “They are pushing back on high prices, they are demanding bargains,” he stated.\n\nSince Cramer keeps a close eye on what many companies, including retailers, are saying, I believe that his assertion is probably correct. Moreover, after a few years of high inflation that have depleted the savings of many consumers, it makes sense that they would be looking for bargains.\n\nIn light of the consumers’ mindset, I believe that retailers which offer quality products at fairly low prices are very well-positioned to increase their market share and deliver big gains over the longer term. With that said, here are three of the best retail stocks to buy in the current, value-oriented U.S. retail environment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon.com (AMZN) Logistics activity on the Amazon (AMZN) site of Vélizy-Villacoublay in France. Packages are sorted by workers on conveyors.\n\nSource: Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.com\n\nCNBC’s Jim Cramer mentioned Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) as one of three retailers that are succeeding in the current environment in which many U.S. consumers are looking for bargains. (Costco (NYSE:COST)and Walmart (NYSE:WMT)were the other two names that he cited).\n\nAs a frequent user of Amazon.com and a Prime member, I can understand why Amazon is thriving at this point. With Prime, I can use the company’s Subscribe and Save feature, which delivers products that I use at regular intervals, to often save 15% on my orders. And quite frequently, I am able to avoid paying the 8.25% sales tax on items that I would have to pay in the stores in Garland, Texas where I live. So that works out to savings of nearly 25% on many items. What’s more, with the many retailers selling products on Amazon, I believe that I can usually find very low prices on items. The company’s ability to save its customers a great deal of money helps make it one of the best retail stocks to buy.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon plans to launch a new section of its website featuring very low-cost goods from China. The latter initiative should enable the e-commerce giant to obtain many more American shoppers looking for bargains.\n\nTJX (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.\n\nSource: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe owner of discount retail chains TJ Maxx and Marshalls, TJX (NYSE:TJX) appears to be thriving in the current, bargain-oriented environment. In my experience, TJX’s stores offer quality products at low prices.\n\nIn Q1, the retailer’s comparable sales climbed a solid 3% versus the same period a year earlier after logging the same year-over-year comp-sales gain in Q1 of 2023. Moreover, its revenue climbed 6% year-over-year, while its earnings per share soared 22% YOY to 93 cents. The retailer increased its full-year earnings per share outlook to $4.03-$4.09 from $3.94-$4.02.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, analysts, on average, now expect the firm’s EPS to jump to $4.56 in 2025 from $4.14 this year and $3.86 in 2023. That’s very impressive growth on the bottom line. Also noteworthy is that the company, unlike the vast majority of retailers at this point, pays a significant dividend, as it offers a dividend yield of 1.3% at this point.\n\nTJX is successfully defying the conventional wisdom which says that brick-and-mortar retailers not named Costco and Walmart cannot succeed in the modern age. As a result, it’s one of the top retail stocks to buy.\n\nRoss Stores (ROST) Retail Stocks to Buy for the Long Run: Ross Stores (ROST)\n\nSource: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoss Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) is very similar to TJX, since both retailers, in my own experience, specialize in offering relatively high-quality products at affordable prices.\n\nAnd like TJX, Ross is obviously succeeding tremendously in the current, value-oriented environment. In Q1, the firm’s top line jumped 9% versus the same period a year earlier to $4.9 billion while its comparable sales increased by a solid 3% year-over-year. And for its full fiscal year, the retailer projects that its earnings per share will come in at $5.79 to $5.98, up from $5.56 in its prior fiscal year. Moreover, an extra week in the previous fiscal year did add about 20 cents to its EPS in that period.\n\nAlso importantly, Ross has a significant share repurchase program as it repurchased 1.9 million shares of ROST stock in Q1. And the company also throws in a dividend yield of 1%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in AMZN.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- With a cash hoard that’s expected to top $100 billion this year, conditions have never been more favorable for Amazon.com Inc. join its megacap peers in returning cash to shareholders, including by potentially breaking the seal on a dividend.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHarris Just Showed Why Trump Is So Afraid of Her I Changed My Mind. The Fed Needs to Cut Rates Now.

Any hint of a change on this front could drive fresh gains in the stock, which has risen 19% this year, outperforming the 13% gain of the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nAn announcement may not come on Aug. 1, when Amazon reports second-quarter results. But many, including Andrew Zamfotis, portfolio manager at Ami Asset Management, reckon it will happen within the next few quarters.\n\n“A dividend might be inevitable, and would really signal that it is going to be more focused on spending and profitable growth,” Zamfotis said. “Amazon can certainly afford it, and because of its reluctance to do capital returns even in boom times, I think it would be very meaningful if it followed its peers with a dividend or picked up the pace with buybacks.”\n\nA spokesperson for the firm pointed to last quarter’s earnings call, when Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said Amazon would continue to prioritize capex and paying down debt over capital returns.\n\nBut with free cash flow projected to nearly double this year, many investors think the company could start doing more for shareholders. Adding to the company’s anemic buyback authorization would be one venue for capital returns, but some are speculating about the prospect of Amazon’s first-ever dividend, especially as other tech giants have done so of late.\n\nRewarding shareholders has been a trend among megacaps this year. Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. both introduced dividends this year, as did Salesforce Inc. and Booking Holdings Inc. The AI-focused chipmaker Nvidia Corp. raised its dividend by 150%, to 10 cents per share.\n\nWhile tech dividend yields tend to be low, they are a signal that companies are confident about their long-term cash generation and business outlooks. Buybacks, meanwhile, are a way to boost earnings per share, and many of the dividend announcements were accompanied by hefty share buybacks. Meta announced a $50 billion program in February, while Alphabet followed suit by authorizing $70 billion. Apple Inc. approved a $110 billion repurchase, the biggest in history.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon’s $10 billion buyback program, approved in early 2022, was less than half complete as of the end of March, and it has not repurchased any shares in the past 21 months.\n\nThe lack of a dividend now increasingly stands out; Tesla Inc. is the only other Magnificent Seven company without one, and among the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, planemaker Boeing Co. is the only other firm to not pay one, having suspended its own at the onset of the pandemic.\n\nAmazon had more than $86 billion in cash at the end of 2023, and it generated $32.2 billion in free cash flow last year; analysts expect that to rise to $61.2 billion this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nHowever, aside from pouring cash into AI initiatives, the company could struggle to find other uses for its money in this environment. Greater regulatory scrutiny of tech-sector M&A, means takeover options are limited. So without a more aggressive capital-return program, Amazon’s cash balances “could soar to an inefficient excess,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nStill, there’s one crucial factor that could deter Amazon from offering a dividend in the near term — its margins are lower than those of other megacaps because of its retail business.\n\n“To start a dividend, Amazon would have to pay a higher percentage of its cash flow than the peers that have already started paying one, which means doing one right now is premature and wouldn’t be good stewardship,” said Brian Szytel, managing director and partner at Bahnsen Group.\n\n“They will get to that place,” said Sytel, who expects margins to keep improving. For now, he added, “we are in a will-they-won’t-they place.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 sank 3.7% on Wednesday, its biggest one-day percentage drop since October 2022. The selloff came in the wake of disappointing results from both Alphabet Inc. and Tesla Inc. The index is down 8% off a recent peak, though it remains up 13% this year.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. has participated in new financing of 5 billion yuan ($691 million) for Chinese startup Baichuan, inking its third major AI deal this year as the e-commerce firm looks beyond its core business for growth. Shares of Renesas Electronics Corp. plunged by their biggest intraday decline in more than 12 years, hit by a broader tech selloff and investor disappointment over the Japanese chipmaker’s profit miss.

        "content": "Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks dives into the wave of selling that sent the Nasdaq tumbling to start the heart of big tech earnings season on Wednesday. The episode then explores Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) stock before their upcoming earnings releases to see if investors should buy the top tech stocks before earnings or wait for more selling.\n\nTechnology stocks and other first-half standouts tanked on Wednesday, sending the Nasdaq below its 50-day moving average for only the second time in 2024.\n\nThe selling came as the busy stretch of technology earnings kicked off after the closing bell on Tuesday, with Alphabet and Tesla. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTech stocks and the market could experience more selling and volatility throughout earnings season, especially since big tech set the bar very high.\n\nThankfully, the tailwinds that sent the stock market soaring in the first half remain in place. Any near-term selling represents a healthy recalibration and an opportunity for investors to buy their favorite stocks at discounts.\n\nThe two stocks we explore today are tech giants and AI investments.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (META) Stock – Q2 Earnings Wednesday, July 31\n\nMeta (META), the owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, grew its daily active users by 7% in Q1 to 3.24 billion. Meta grew its ad impressions delivered across its family of apps by 20%.\n\nMeta stands to thrive in a world full of smartphone addicts. Meta is also investing heavily in its AI future. Mark Zuckerberg’s goal is for Meta to win the AI race by rolling out open source artificial intelligence. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta shares have soared roughly 400% off the market’s 2022 lows to blow away Alphabet (GOOGL) and plenty of tech giants. The stock has also climbed 520% in the past 10 years vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s 310%.\n\nThis context helps Meta’s valuation look all the more impressive, with Meta trading at a 63% discount to its highs and 20% below the Zacks Tech sector at 22.4X forward 12-month earnings. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta stock has fallen 14% from its early July highs heading into its quarterly earnings release. Meta stock is trading below its 50-day and 21-week moving averages. Meta trades at roughly neutral RSI levels on a 10-year timeframe after hitting its most overbought levels of the last decade earlier this year.\n\nMeta’s recent cooldown makes the stock a potentially more appealing long-term buy-and-hold candidate for investors who can weather near-term volatility. It is worth remembering that Meta has a robust balance sheet and began paying a dividend earlier this year as it focuses on efficiency and profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Stock – Q2 Earnings Thursday, August 1\n\nAmazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy took over roughly three years ago with a mission to boost the bottom line while honing in on expansion in key growth areas.\n\nAmazon remains the king of e-commerce and its advertising unit is booming. AMZN also runs the world’s largest cloud-computing business, topping rivals Microsoft and Alphabet, helping it thrive throughout the AI supercycle. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon is also diving headfirst into its AI efforts, with plans to devote more capex on its cloud computing and AI infrastructure than e-commerce going forward.\n\nAmazon’s steady cloud computing and AI growth, coupled with its focus on boosting earnings is a winning pitch to Wall Street. Amazon’s earnings outlook has soared over the last year for FY24 and FY25 to help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nAmazon stock has skyrocketed 1,000% in the last 10 years vs. Tech’s 300%, Apple’s 800%, and Alphabet’s 480%. Yet Amazon stock is down around 1% in the last three years compared to Tech’s 25% run.\n\nAMZN failed to break out meaningfully above its 2021 highs. Amazon is currently trading 10% below its highs and 22% below its average Zacks price target. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon trades around its 21-week moving average and near neutral RSI levels on a 10-year timeframe. On the valuation front, Amazon trades 95% below its highs and at a 50% discount to its 10-year median at 35.1X forward 12-month earnings.\n\nOn top of that, Amazon trades near its lowest forward earnings multiple since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The recent tech sell-off, sparked by results from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), has caused significant anxiety on Wall Street. However, Wedbush analysts are confident this downturn will be brief and see it as the beginning of a significant tech bull run driven by a massive AI capital expenditure cycle.\n\nAccording to Wedbush, \"We believe this tech sell-off will be short-lived as the Street better digests results and commentary from the broader tech sector over the coming weeks during earnings season.\"\n\n\"This is the start....not the end of this tech bull run in our view fueled by this AI tidal wave of spending on the doorstep,\" they argue.\n\nThe firm highlights that the sell-off, although unsettling, confirms the robust cloud and AI build-outs fueling what they describe as the \"4th Industrial Revolution.\"\n\nWedbush estimates that over $1 trillion will be spent on AI capex in the coming years by companies, utilities, and governments, which will drive this AI Revolution.\n\nAlphabet's increased spending on AI, highlighted in their recent earnings, is seen as a precursor to similar announcements from other major tech players. This substantial investment wave is not viewed as a risk but as a necessary step in building the AI ecosystem globally.\n\nDespite investor concerns about the delayed materialization of top-line growth and margins from these investments, Wedbush strongly disagrees, asserting that this confirms the AI Revolution.\n\n\"This is not Meta/Zuckerberg head scratching spending on metaverse from 2 years ago, instead this is an AI arms race taking place in the US, China, and around the globe,\" the analysts emphasize.\n\nWedbush remains optimistic about a multi-year tech bull run, especially with a potential Fed rate cut creating a favorable risk-on environment.\n\nThey foresee tech stocks rising another 15%-20% this year, driven by strong 2Q earnings expected from companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), and Meta (NASDAQ:META), as well as key cybersecurity firms such as Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS), Palo Alto, CyberArk, Checkpoint, and Tenable.\n\nIn conclusion, Wedbush says that massive sell-offs like yesterday spark Street nervousness, but the pullbacks have previously \"created the golden opportunities time and time again to own Big Tech and the winners.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech sell-off to be short lived; this is start of tech bull run: Wedbush\n\nBofA payments app for businesses handled record $500 billion by mid-year\n\nFutures pare losses after GDP, durable goods data\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet’s earnings set the stage for tech’s AI question",
        "content": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) kicked off Big Tech’s earnings season on Tuesday, giving Wall Street its first look at digital ad and cloud spending in the quarter. The company reported better than expected earnings and revenue, on the strength of Search ads and continued cloud growth, but fell short on YouTube ad sales.\n\nAlphabet also continues to spend billions building out its AI infrastructure. CFO Ruth Porat, who is transitioning to a new role as CIO, told analysts during the company’s earnings call that capital expenditures in the second quarter topped out at $13 billion, up from $12 billion in Q1. And the vast majority of that is going toward servers and data centers for AI capabilities.\n\nThe report sets the tone for the rest of the tech industry, as it prepares to provide Wall Street with the latest on not just AI spending, but also how much that spending is paying off in actual revenue.\n\nSo far, Alphabet says it’s seeing an uptick in cloud revenue with some of that coming from interest in AI products. But CEO Sundar Pichai sidestepped a more direct question about when analysts can expect to start seeing a return on capital investments related to AI, saying that the spending is necessary for a long-term bet like AI, adding that in situations like this it’s better to overinvest rather than underinvest and fall behind.\n\nUBS Global Research’s Stephen Ju wrote in an investor note following Google’s earnings call that it still isn’t entirely clear when Google will start to reap the benefits of its AI investments. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., May 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“The benefits [Google] is seeing in [Google Cloud Platform] on AI productization still seems difficult to discern, as is the full payoff that Google should see (we do not think potential revenue benefits will arrive until [the first half of 2025] at the earliest),” Ju wrote.\n\n“So as far as we are concerned, the [return on invested capital] debate remains only partially resolved, especially as we are now contemplating what is a higher [capital expenditure] estimate for 2025 and 2026,” he added.\n\nOther analysts were more upbeat on Google’s AI efforts, with William Blair’s Ralph Schackart pointing to Pichai’s comment that some 2 billion users are accessing its Gemini AI model and that the company is building the model into its own products.\n\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt, meanwhile, pointed to Google’s AI Overview for search helping to drive better customer engagement and creating more monetization opportunities as a positive in the company’s report.\n\nStill, the one thing missing from all of this is a definitive number pointing to how much Google’s AI investments are actually helping its bottom line. Pichai says investments will make a difference, but when exactly is still rather vague.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet is just the first of the Big Tech names set to report their earnings this quarter, and you can all but guarantee investors will be searching for clues as to how those other companies’ AI moves are paying off as well.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) are slapping AI features onto their various products and services. Now we just have to see if they’ll give any more insight than Alphabet had to offer. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) lost a key media rights deal with the National Basketball Association (NBA), the league confirmed in a statement on Wednesday. The news sent shares of the company down more than 2% in after hours trading.\n\nIt's a gut punch for the legacy media giant, which has aired NBA games through its TNT network since 1989. It reportedly shells out $1.2 billion annually for the rights, which expire at the end of next season.\n\nThe loss of the rights will also impact TNT's NBA-adjacent content like \"Inside the NBA,\" the acclaimed show hosted by retired players Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley, and Kenny Smith.\n\nUltimately, Warner Bros. was unable to secure a new deal during a monthslong negotiating period that expired on April 22. That set off an arms race to secure the media rights to air NBA games, which ended up ballooning their value of the rights even more.\n\nWarner Bros. revealed Monday it had matched a media rights bid to continue airing NBA games, a move which was widely viewed as a last ditch effort to secure the games. But the league confirmed Wednesday that it has denied the offer.\n\n“Warner Bros. Discovery’s most recent proposal did not match the terms of Amazon Prime Video’s offer and, therefore, we have entered into a long-term arrangement with Amazon,\" the NBA said in its statement.\n\nIn total, the NBA secured a media rights package worth around $77 billion over 11 years with new partners that include tech giant Amazon (AMZN) and Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA). It was also able to strike a new agreement with its other current media partner, Disney (DIS).\n\n“Our new global media agreements with Disney, NBCUniversal and Amazon will maximize the reach and accessibility of NBA games for fans in the United States and around the world,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “These partners will distribute our content across a wide range of platforms and help transform the fan experience over the next decade.”\n\nAmazon, NBCU, Disney: The NBA's $77 billion deal\n\nAmazon's (AMZN) struck a streaming rights package through its Prime Video service for a reported $1.9 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. The NBA said the package includes both regular season and playoff games, plus the play-in tournament and a share of conference finals, which would rotate between the media partners.\n\nComcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA) submitted a reported bid worth $2.5 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal. The network will show about 100 games per season with half airing exclusively on its streaming service Peacock.\n\nStory continues\n\nDisney (DIS), the NBA's other current major broadcast partner, will retain its share of the league's media rights after reportedly agreeing to increase its payment of $1.5 billion a year to $2.6 billion in order to renew the deal, per the Journal. The company will carry fewer games compared to its current package, although it will be able to stream games on its upcoming ESPN streaming platform, set to launch in the fall of 2025.\n\nABC will also remain the exclusive home of the NBA Finals, which it has broadcast since 2003, the league said. Kristaps Porzingis of the Boston Celtics (AP Foto/Charles Krupa) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nSports rights have become increasingly important for legacy media giants as more consumers cut the cord. The content is viewed as \"sticky,\" meaning loyal audiences are more willing to fork over their monthly cable package or streaming service fee to access sports over other types of content.\n\nBut the field has become more competitive, with tech giants like Amazon, Apple (AAPL), and YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL) committing heavily to sports streaming deals over the past year. That's inflated the overall costs of sports as traditional media giants struggle to keep up amid steep streaming losses and major declines in linear advertising revenue.\n\n\"There are more choices than there ever have been in the media landscape,\" Mark Tatum, deputy commissioner of the NBA, told Yahoo Finance in June, prior to the deal's confirmation. \"So that requires going out and having partnerships with many more people in that space, whether it's social and digital media partners, streaming partners, and traditional media partners as well.\"\n\nBank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich previously described the NBA rights renewal as \"critical\" to Warner Bros.' future given that TNT boasts the highest carriage fees, or fees pay-TV providers pay to network owners to carry their channels, out of all of the company's cable networks at an estimated $3 per subscriber.\n\n\"Should they lose these rights, there is a real risk WBD will not be able to maintain these affiliate fees in upcoming negotiations,\" she said at the time.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "If You Invested $1000 In Amazon Stock 20 Years Ago, How Much Would You Have Now?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is set to report its Q2 2024 earnings on Aug. 1, after the market closes. Wall Street analysts expect the e-commerce giant to post an EPS of $0.95, up from $0.63 in the year-ago period. According to data from Benzinga Pro, quarterly revenue is expected to be $137.58 billion, up from $134.38 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nDon't Miss Out: Can you guess which type of investments Morgan Stanley says will reach $2.7 trillion by 2027? It even offers up to 20% APY potential to accredited investors. Get up to $500 — just for making your first investment.\n\nIf You Bought Amazon Stock 20 Years Ago\n\nThe company's stock traded around $2 per share 20 years ago. If you had invested $1,000, you could have bought 500 shares of Amazon stock. Shares are currently trading at $187.88, meaning your investment's value could have soared to $93,940. This translates to a return of 9,294%. The S&P 500 total return for the same period is 570.01%.\n\nWhat Could The Next 20 Years Bring?\n\nAmazon has a consensus rating of Buy and a price target of $216.90 based on the ratings of 41 analysts. The price target implies a more than 15% potential upside from the current stock price.\n\nAccording to our Benzinga Pro report, two analysts raised their price targets on Amazon earlier this week. Bernstein increased its target from $210 to $215, reiterating its Outperform rating, while Truist Securities raised the target from $220 to $230, maintaining its Buy rating.\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market. This platform allows accredited investors to invest in commercial real estate, invest today for a 1% boost.\n\nAmazon has beaten consensus estimates for EPS and revenues for the last six quarters. In its most recent earnings report, released on April 30, the company posted an EPS of $0.98 and revenues of $143.3 billion, above the consensus estimates of $0.78 and $133.09 billion, respectively.\n\n\"The combination of companies renewing their infrastructure modernization efforts and the appeal of AWS's AI capabilities is reaccelerating AWS's growth rate (now at a $100 billion annual revenue run rate); our Stores business continues to expand selection, provide everyday low prices, and accelerate delivery speed (setting another record on speed for Prime customers in Q1) while lowering our cost to serve; and our Advertising efforts continue to benefit from the growth of our Stores and Prime Video businesses. It's very early days in all of our businesses, and we remain excited by how much more we can make customers' lives better and easier moving forward,\" said Andy Jassy, Amazon’s President and CEO.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn summary, growth-focused investors may find Amazon stock attractive, given the historical stock price appreciation and expected upside potential in e-commerce, AWS, and advertising.\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

        "title": "Broadcom Stock Alert: Is Now the Best Time to Buy AVGO Shares?",
        "content": "Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is well-known as a leader in 5G semiconductors, but it’s also a chip stock that lags behind many of the top names in this sector — most notably Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe company powers the sort of data throughput and connectivity we all rely on with its advanced chips and RF solutions. In 2023, the company’s 5G and AI revenues hit $5.9 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, out of $28.2 billion total income.\n\nNotably, Broadcom stock has been on a tear of late, nearly doubling over the past year on strong investor demand. Some of this is due to the company’s recent 10-for-1 stock split on July 15, which reduced its share price from $1,600 to $170. Market analysts like those at JPMorgan believe Broadcom has strong growth potential in the semiconductor space due to AI. Aside from that, its cybersecurity capabilities are also strong due to the merger with Symantec and Carbon Black. Of 46 analysts, 83% rate Broadcom stock a buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe question is whether now is the right time to build a position in this chip name, particularly after its recent run. Let’s dive into what to make of this move, and where AVGO stock could be headed from here.\n\nTalks with OpenAI\n\nOpenAI has explored developing its own AI chip, discussing plans with chip designers like Broadcom. The aim of this strategic review is to integrate hardware and software efficiently and address AI chip shortages. The company is recruiting former Google employees for their expertise in Tensor processors. However, the report notes that matching Nvidia’s AI server chips would require years of R&D.\n\nOpenAI aims to expedite AI chip development by leveraging former Google experts. CEO Sam Altman wants to raise as much as $7 trillion to transform the semiconductor industry and advance AI, boosting global services and value.\n\nIf this deal does go through, and Broadcom does play a pivotal role in driving chip design for various AI players, the narrative could completely shift in this sector. That’s more of an outsized probability but it’s one I think investors are starting to at least price in right now.\n\nBroadcom Has Strong Growth Potential\n\nBroadcom excels in data-center networking chips, with an 80% market share, leading in providing high-end ASICs for AI players. The company co-designs custom machine learning chips with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and could add Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a third major client.\n\nBroadcom’s Q2 revenue surged 43% to $12.5 billion, driven by record AI sales, with net income rising 20% to $5.4 billion. Analysts view Broadcom, alongside Nvidia, as essential to AI infrastructure, expecting 21% annual earnings growth through 2026. Despite a valuation of 36 times adjusted earnings, long-term investors might find it worthwhile to consider this chip name, particularly if its growth rate remains high or accelerates further from here.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Broadcom’s ASICs rival Nvidia’s GPUs in AI data centers. Analysts view this as a matchup of different strengths, with Broadcom’s open standards competing against Nvidia’s mixed approach. Broadcom’s strategy is favored by hyperscaler cloud firms, network equipment makers and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThe 10-for-1 Stock Split Difference\n\nGood investments often feature competitive advantages and growth potential, leading to significant share-price gains and stock splits. Research from Bank of America shows that stocks typically outperform the S&P 500 by 13% in the year after a split announcement. Broadcom’s stock price did drop following its 10-for-1 stock split briefly but certainly could have more upside if these trends hold.\n\nI’m of the view that as Broadcom’s investor base widens and more institutional investors add to their positions, this is a stock that could ride its tailwinds higher through the end of the year. While a stock split does nothing to affect a company’s underlying fundamentals, it is something long-term investors should pay close attention to over the near term.\n\nAs a trade, I think Broadcom stock is well-positioned for more upside from here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why",
        "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this online retailer a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon is 10.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 58.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 17.9%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Amazon is 59.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -4.1%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 25.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 7.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Amazon. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.2% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Amazon a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Amazon is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Will Amazon (AMZN) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Amazon (AMZN), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry.\n\nThis online retailer has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 30.42%.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Amazon was expected to post earnings of $0.83 per share, but it reported $1.13 per share instead, representing a surprise of 36.14%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.81 per share, while it actually produced $1.01 per share, a surprise of 24.69%.\n\nPrice and EPS Surprise\n\nFor Amazon, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nAmazon currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.58%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on August 1, 2024.\n\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 5.7 million Macs, thereby grabbing a market share of 8.8% compared with 7.5% in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nMoreover, AAPL shares have been gaining attention from investors thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, at WWDC.\r\n\r\nAAPL beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 4.14%.\n\nApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nLastly, NVIDIA is likely to report its second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug 28. It has been benefiting from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s GPUs are rapidly benefiting from the proliferation of AI. By applying its GPUs in AI models, the Zacks Rank #3 is expanding its base in other untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing, which will support its earnings and revenues. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVIDIA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space, thereby driving top-line growth. \r\n\r\nNVDA beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 18.43%.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Spotify's Q2 Results Sound Good Although It Still Does Not Have The Quality Sound Of Amazon And Apple\n\nSpotify Technologies S.A. (NYSE: SPOT) reported its second quarter results that show its turnaround efforts, including cost savings, are already bearing fruit. But with a high-resolution audio tier still in the works, Spotify is still behind Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) who already have this feature. CEO Daniel Ek addressed this issue during the earnings call, stating that the plan is to offer a much better version of Spotify. Meanwhile, Spotify continued to improve its financials throughout the second quarter.\n\nThe Year Of Monetization Is Going As Planned\n\nSecond quarter results show that the audio giant is effectively executing its turnaround strategy, reducing its costs through layoffs and other saving initatives, improving margins, and growing subscribers while developing strong loyalty with existing ones.\n\nA Sensible Growth Market Strategy\n\nSpotify raised its prices, but accompanied the hikes with new offerings to boost top line growth, including a music-only streaming and audibooks only plan, along with a higher-priced audio bundle of all of its offerings, including music, podcasts, as well as audiobooks.\n\nSecond Quarter Highlights\n\nRevenue grew 20% YoY to 3.81 billion euros which is about $4.14 billion, while ad-supported revenue alone grew 13%, recording double-digit growth across all regions.\n\nDue to a lower marketing spend and lower personnel costs, operating income of 266 million euros or $289 million is a great improvement from last year’s loss of 247 million euros. The figure surpassed even Spotify's own guidance of 250 million euros.\n\nNet income amounted to 274 million euros or $298 million, resulting in earnings per share of 1.33 euros or $1.44 per share, compared to last year’s comparable quarter when Spotify reported a loss of 302 million euros or $327.77 million, or more precisely, a loss per share of 1.55 euros or $1.68. Gross margin came in stronger than expected at a record 29.2%, also surpassing even Spotify’s own guidance of 28.1%.\n\nTotal monthly active users grew 14% YoY to 626 million, but were below Spotify’s guidance of 631 million. Premium subscribers jumped 12% YoY to 246 million, topping Spotify’s own guidance of 245 million.\n\nThird Quarter Guidance\n\nFueled by YoY improvements in music and podcasts, Spotify guided for revenue to grow 19% YoY to 4 billion euros, while expecting an operating income of 405 million euros and margin to hit 30.2%. Monthly active users are expected to grow to 639 million and premium subscribers to 251 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough user growth softened, Spotify overall showed progress in expanding its margins, monetization, posting its second consecutive quarterly profit and record free cash flow.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "The Worst of the Worst: 7 Meme Stocks to Avoid at all Costs",
        "content": "There’s a rotation going on the stock market.\n\nThe magnificent seven tech stocks and various AI names have started to dip in recent weeks. Meanwhile, long-forgotten smaller-capitalization and value stocks have begun to rally.\n\nThis shift in the market forces has reinvigorated a great number of meme stocks, with many names posting sharp rallies in July. But traders shouldn’t get carried away with this move. These seven meme stocks to avoid remain on incredibly uneven footing and are likely to slump again later this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC theater in Manhattan, New York City. AMC stock. APE stock\n\nWhen thinking of meme stocks to avoid, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) springs to mind.\n\nThe movie theater chain has been a leading arena for traders since 2021. AMC’s bulls continue to hope for a tremendous short squeeze to lift shares to the heavens.\n\nUnfortunately, the company’s poor fundamentals have squashed those hopes. Specifically, AMC’s revenues only rebounded to $4.8 billion in 2023, leaving them well short of the $5.5 billion that the company brought in back in 2019. Factoring in the high level of inflation in the ensuing period, that’s an especially poor result.\n\nAMC remains unprofitable and analysts see the company losing money in 2024 and 2025. And from 2023’s relatively low revenue level, analysts see sales slipping this year amid a weak movie slate and lackluster consumer spending.\n\nWorst of all, shareholders have had to endure incredible dilution to fund AMC’s operating losses. AMC’s share count (adjusted for reverse splits) has risen from just 24 million shares in 2019 to 189 million shares now. It’s hard for meme stock buying to offset that level of new share issuance in a company.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) can’t hold a charge. The struggling hydrogen power firm has been in business since the 1990s. Despite having many chances to prove itself, the hydrogen fuel cell company seems farther from profitability than ever.\n\nPLUG stock has plunged more than 99% from its all-time highs. Despite a steady stream of press releases and new developments, little of it ever seems to amount to profitable business expansion. In fact, Plug Power lost money each of the past 10 years. Recently, the results have worsened. Plug Power lost more than $1 billion in 2023, and losses are continuing to mount in 2024.\n\nTraders keep coming back to PLUG stock, seemingly in hopes of a short squeeze. The issue is, however, that Plug Power needs to unleash an unending stream of dilution on the market to keep funding its operating losses.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo that point, Plug Power’s outstanding share count has soared from 159 million in 2014 to 595 million as of the most recent report. And it’s about to go up yet again; PLUG stock sunk recently on news of another stock offering to raise money.\n\nServe Robotics (SERV) a robotic hand reaching out to a human hand against a black background, with the pointer fingers touching. robotics stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/sdecoret\n\nServe Robotics (NASDAQ:SERV) is a small technology company which is attempting to commercialize delivery robots.\n\nThe company is most known for its partnership with Uber’s (NYSE:UBER) food delivery operation. The framework is in place for Serve to produce as many as 2,000 delivery bots for Uber to serve the Los Angeles market.\n\nHowever, SERV stock was not cooking up much excitement this year, with the stock lingering in the $2 range recently.\n\nAll that changed this week. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) disclosed that it purchased 62,500 SERV shares for $4 each, adding to a prior stake that it had obtained via a promissory note.\n\nIt’s exciting that Nvidia involved, of course. But this transaction is chump change for a company of Nvidia’s size, and the semiconductor company is known for taking equity positions in a variety of small start-ups. Investors should be exceedingly cautious with SERV stock given that shares have already quadrupled from recent levels and are now trading at a massive valuation.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) SoundHound Inc.'s (SOUN) Headquarters exterior. The company develops voice-recognition, natural language understanding, sound-recognition and search technologies.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ve been a long-time skeptic on SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN).\n\nThe technology firm develops independent voice-driven artificial intelligence solutions. It has some exciting plans, and SoundHound signed up a credible client list.\n\nHowever, the issue is that SOUN stock doesn’t appear to be particularly tied to its fundamentals. Rather the valuation has run far ahead of the underlying business. Like with Serve Robotics, it seems that traders are buying SoundHound primarily because Nvidia is an investor.\n\nSoundHound AI may eventually become a compelling business. But the firm generated just $11 million in revenues last quarter and is running large losses. That’s nowhere near what’s necessary to support the company’s current $1.6 billion market cap.\n\nQuantumScape (QS) QuantumScape (QS) is an American company that develops solid state lithium metal batteries for electric cars.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nQuantumScape (NASDAQ:QS) is a company that is attempting to commercialize a new solid-state battery model.\n\nYears ago, QS stock was one of the biggest winners of the SPAC boom, with shares rising tenfold at one point. However, a new battery technology takes a long time, from prototype to recurring revenues. Meanwhile, short sellers raised pointed questions about the company’s underlying technology.\n\nThe latest issue for QuantumScape comes from politics. Former President Donald Trump has taken the lead in the polls, and his pick for vice president, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, has proposed policies that could have massively negative ramifications for the battery and electric vehicle industries.\n\nQuantumScape popped higher recently on news of a further partnership with Volkswagen. But with analysts seeing minimal revenues through at least 2025 and QuantumScape being unprofitable for years, QS stock is a sell on all rallies.\n\nLucid Group (LCID) Lucid Air Touring sedan display at the Service Center. Lucid Motors (LCID) is a manufacturer of luxury EV Electric Vehicles.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nQuantumScape isn’t the only meme stock facing issues with a potential Trump presidency.\n\nIn fact, with Trump reportedly making an anti-electric vehicle stance a cornerstone of his campaign, the whole EV sector could come under fire.\n\nBigger players like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may already have enough of a balance sheet, brand, and recurring cash flow base to endure an anti-EV administration. For a small struggling outfit like Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID), however, this could be a crippling blow.\n\nIn Q1, Lucid generated a modest $173 million in revenues, which rose only slightly from the $149 million it brought in during the same period of 2023. That growth rate simply isn’t going to cut it, given that Lucid lost an eye-watering $730 million from operations last quarter alone.\n\nLCID stock popped 40% in recent weeks. It’s time to dump this meme stock before a potential Trump presidency further weakens this EV firm’s already tenuous competitive positioning.\n\nJumia Technologies (JMIA) Jumia (JMIA) logo on a cellphone with a flower\n\nSource: farzand01 / Shutterstock.com\n\nJumia Technologies (NYSE:JMIA) has long been pitched as the so-called Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Africa.\n\nIn theory, that could be a highly appealing business. In practice, Jumia has struggled to turn that promise into reality. That are significant structural challenges in building an African e-commerce giant, such as lack of delivery infrastructure, limited free trade regions, and major language and cultural differences between countries.\n\nLong story short, Jumia’s revenues were essentially dead flat between 2019 and 2023, almost entirely missing out on the recent e-commerce boom. Jumia continues to lose significant sums of money.\n\nJMIA stock has popped sharply following positive analyst coverage. That’s not a bad thing, of course. But with Jumia shares up 300% year-to-date despite its middling fundamentals, this is a meme stock to sell now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon (AMZN) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Amazon (AMZN).\n\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.07, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 46 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.07 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 46 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 43 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 93.5% and 6.5% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AMZN Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for AMZN\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Amazon, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs AMZN a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $4.59.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Amazon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Amazon may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

During the quarter, the strategy returned -1.9% net of fees compared to the S&P 500’s 4.3% return.

In addition, you can check the fund's top 5 holdings to determine its best picks for 2024.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy highlighted stocks like Amazon.com, Inc.

The one-month return of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was -3.72%, and its shares gained 45.46% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On July 23, 2024, Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.\"\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) reported strong results in the first quarter and delivered $143.3 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year.  While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc.

        "title": "3 Stocks Doing Even Better Than Superstar Super Micro (SMCI)",
        "content": "With a bull market barely showing signs of slowing down, one of the best outperforming stocks this year is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). The premier provider of AI-optimized computers, servers, networks, storage solutions and data center workstations is up 176% year-to-date. That follows its shares more than tripling in value in 2023.\n\nWhile artificial intelligence has been behind the gains made in the semiconductor industry, most notably Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is up 148% so far this year (it rose 239% last year too), many stocks have done even better.\n\nImportantly, it wasn’t AI pushing them along either. There are other great investing themes out there that you would have missed if you only focused on the headline names.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three outperforming stocks that are beating Super Micro Computer in 2024. While they have been star performers in the front half of the year, do they have what it takes to enjoy similar gains in the back half and beyond? Let’s dig in and find out!\n\nAvidity Biosciences (RNA) Avidity Biosciences logo on their headquarters building in San Diego, CA, USA. Avidity Biosciences Inc (RNA) is an American biotechnology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nBiotech stock Avidity Biosciences (NASDAQ:RNA) has risen over 400% this year. But it wasn’t a sudden spike that caused it to be one of the top outperforming stocks on the market. Rather, the biotech stock is on a long, steady climb higher. From its low point last October, RNA stock is up 844%. Yowser! But why?\n\nAvidity Biosciences is taking an innovative approach to delivering a new class of RNA therapeutics called antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates, or AOCs. According to the biotech, its proprietary platform combines “the specificity of monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, with the precision of RNA therapeutics to target the root cause of diseases previously untreatable with RNA therapeutics.”\n\nYet Avidity is a clinical-stage biotech. It doesn’t have any drugs on the market. It does generate some revenue due to collaborations and partnerships to study how its AOC platform can target specific indications, and they totaled $3.5 million in the first quarter.\n\nAvidity’s lead candidate is del-desiran (AOC 1001), a therapy for myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a form of muscular dystrophy. It plans to initiate Phase 3 trials, and in May the Food & Drug Administration granted AOC 1001 breakthrough therapy designation. That declaration expedites the development and review of drugs submitted.\n\nBiotechs are a risky field to invest in, but Avidity Biosciences seems to be on the right path for additional growth. The path to approval, though, is still a long one.\n\nStory continues\n\nJumia Technologies (JMIA) The Jumia logo on a laptop.\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfrica is a huge, untapped market, and Jumia Technologies (NASDAQ:JMIA) is looking to, well, tap into it. The startup e-commerce platform is seeking to become the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Africa and one of the outperforming stocks.\n\nIt generates revenue primarily through commissions from third-party sellers on the pan-African marketplace. Sales soared 19% in the first quarter but were up 57% on a currency-neutral basis. Perhaps most importantly, it is finally on the path to profitability. It hasn’t gotten there yet, but first-quarter losses narrowed significantly, down to $8 million from $28 million a year ago.\n\nAlthough analysts don’t foresee it operating in the black for some time yet, it may have shortened the window considerably.\n\nJumia stock is up 291% this year but more than 360% over the past six months. The problem for the e-commerce stock is the political instability of the continent. It also notes it faces significant currency devaluations in some of its largest markets. However, it is seeing stability return in some markets and both Nigeria and Ghana are enjoying order growth.\n\nBecoming the next Amazon won’t be an easy path, but as Africa modernizes, Jumia could become a long-term outperforming stock. If you invest, however, expect significant volatility in the share price.\n\nMicrostrategy (MSTR) In this photo illustration, the MicroStrategy (MSTR) Incorporated logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe investment thesis behind Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) these days has less to do with with its AI-driven enterprise analytics software and more to do with Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The stock follows the broad strokes of the cryptocurrency’s price movements, though it doesn’t walk lockstep with them.\n\nWhere Bitcoin’s price is up 56% year-to-date, Microstrategy is sitting 173% higher than where it started the year.\n\nThat is because the company views buying the crypto as equally as important as selling its analytics software. Indeed, read a Microstrategy earnings release and you will see more about Bitcoin than you do about software sales.\n\nTo that point, Microstrategy bought 25,250 Bitcoin in the first quarter and held 214,400 BTC at the end of the period. The total cost of the crypto was $7.5 billion, or $35,180 per bitcoin at the time of the release. However, the company updated its holdings on June 20 to say it now held 226,331 Bitcoin, meaning it added almost 12,000 more to its portfolio. Bitcoin currently trades north of $65,900.\n\nTo buy all that crypto, Microstrategy has taken on boatloads of debt. Long-term debt now stands at over $3.5 billion, a 63% increase just from the end of last year. If Bitcoin goes into a steep decline again, Microstrategy could be seriously impaired. The cryptocurrency may be an exciting investment on its own, but there are better ways to acquire it than betting on the one-time analytics software developer.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy if There Is No Interest Rate Cut This Year",
        "content": "While we’re eagerly waiting for an interest rate cut, one must remember that there is no certainty when it comes to government decisions. Several factors come into play, and the policymakers will not announce a rate cut until they are certain about the inflation level. If a rate cut happens, the economy will improve and we could see higher consumer spending. It will certainly benefit investors in multiple ways but if there is no rate cut, how do you pick stocks to buy then?\n\nIf you want to rebalance your investment portfolio and prepare yourself for the best and the worst that could happen, pick stocks that can thrive even in a high-interest environment. These companies have a global presence and will continue to see growth despite high interest rates. Remember, they’ll do even better if a cut is announced but they can also thrive without one. Here are three stocks to buy if an interest rate cut is not announced this year.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has come a long way from its humble beginnings as a bookseller. The company is not restricted to the e-commerce business, but has a strong presence across multiple industries. A household name today, Amazon makes the majority of its revenue from the cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and advertising.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company recently had a Prime Day and boosted sales of $14.2 billion across the U.S. in only 48 hours. Through this two-day sales event, Amazon turns a slow retail period into a record sales period, with online sales growing by 11% on the two days. I believe Amazon will report another stellar quarter and see the stock surge.\n\nFor the second quarter, the management is aiming for net sales in the range of $144 and $149 billion and an operating income between $10 to $14 billion. Rate cut or not, Amazon will continue thriving in the industry even if consumer spending is low. However, looking at the Prime Day sales numbers, I can safely say that consumer spending has significantly improved. It is one of the best stocks to buy.\n\nUp 21% year-to-date, Amazon stock is trading for $182 and it is one of the top tech stocks to own. Buying the stock below $200 can be a very smart move. Wells Fargo analysts believe that Amazon is the “most favored long among mega-caps” as tech companies start reporting earnings. The analyst expects an 18% rise in AWS revenue for the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nMy InvestorPlace colleague Joel Baglole considers the stock a buy before its earnings.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building. NVO stock\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nPharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is on a roll this year. Driven by the growing demand for the obesity drug, Ozempic and Wegovy, the company has seen impressive revenue growth, and this has led the stock to rally.\n\nUp 30% YTD, NVO stock is exchanging hands for $133 and I believe it is one of the best pharma stocks to own. People may cut down on discretionary spending but will continue to budget for essential drugs.\n\nThe company has generated billions from the sale of weight loss drugs and given the massive market, it could continue generating strong revenue over the decade. Even if we maintain a conservative approach to the weight loss drug market, Novo Nordisk could be a winner. Aiming for $100 billion in annual sales is no small number and could put the company at the top of the industry.\n\nIts financials are equally impressive with a 28% jump in net profit to $3.65 billion where the sales of Wegovy more than doubled. The management has raised its outlook for the year and is aiming for sales growth between 19% to 27% and an operating income growth of 30%. Despite competition in the industry, Novo Nordisk remains one of the best industry players with ample room to run.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nFintech company Visa (NYSE:V) is a legacy player with a global presence and caters to millions of merchants. With over 4 billion cards in circulation, Visa makes money every time you swipe the card and make a purchase. This allows the company to keep operating costs low while ensuring steady revenue growth.\n\nA rate cut could benefit the company as consumer spending can improve but even if there is no rate cut, Visa will keep winning. It managed to thrive even in high inflationary periods and has reported impressive fundamentals. In the second quarter, it saw a 10% net revenue jump and an 11% jump in processed transactions.\n\nDespite the market volatility, Visa is a safe stock that steadily moves upwards. It is up 3% YTD and is exchanging hands for $267. The company dominates the payment industry and despite competition, it remains at the top. In terms of financial health, the company is strong and has the flexibility to increase dividends. It offers a dividend yield of 0.78%.\n\nAll of us own at least one card, and Visa is one of the top four card issuers, making it the biggest beneficiary of the transition from cash to digital payments.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nTesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) kicked off Big Tech earnings on Tuesday with mixed results. Each fell in after-hours trading.\n\nBut for all the hand-wringing about the concentration of outsized gains in the hands of a magnificent few, stock bulls have two reasons to cheer as earnings season intensifies.\n\nFirst, markets just completed a violent rotation that shifted winnings from the seven largest US stocks — Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla, and Alphabet — to small-cap stocks and interest rate-sensitive names.\n\nSectors like real estate, homebuilders, and regional banks are among those now leading the way.\n\nThe severity of the move — which accelerated with the latest weak inflation numbers — shouldn't be discounted.\n\nLiz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, wrote that June was the Russell 2000's worst month versus the Nasdaq in over a year. Yet, she notes that July is already tracking the best since 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, in the land of giants, the Magnificent Seven lost $1.25 trillion in market cap value over seven sessions recently — just as the small-cap stocks started asserting strength.\n\nThe trillion-plus drop in valuation by the Mag Seven represented an 8% fall in price — yet the overall market (the S&P 500) was off only 2% over the same time. Timing is everything.\n\nThe other tailwind favoring bulls is a game of earnings catch-up.\n\nThe S&P 493 (the S&P 500 minus the Mag Seven) is finally climbing out of an earnings recession, as noted by the BofA US Equity & Quant Strategy team. S&P 493 EARNINGS GROWTH TURNING POSITIVE\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) for the S&P 493 have been \"flat to down for the past five quarters,\" wrote BofA, even as EPS growth for all 500 names turned positive three quarters ago.\n\nThis newfound strength for the rest of the market comes just as earnings growth is \"expected to slow for the Magnificent Seven for the second straight quarter and again in the [third quarter].\"\n\nIt appears that even earnings growth is rotating on a higher time frame.\n\nThe very fact that overall market volatility remains subdued despite these tectonic shifts taking place under the market's hood is a testament to the resilience of the bull market itself.\n\nAnd BofA expects the rally to continue through breadth expansion.\n\n\"Given the high correlation between Tech's outperformance in stocks vs. earnings,\" the bank wrote, \"we expect the narrowing growth differential to be the catalyst for the market to broaden out.\"\n\nStory continues morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments()",

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF.Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nOver the past few months the market has seen a massive influx of AI-related ETFs as investors look to ride the bandwagon of AI investing. A report from Wall Street Journal in June said that all ten AI ETFs tracked by website ETF.com saw inflows this year. One major AI ETF, launched by Roundhill, saw its assets grow to $35 million from under $1 million in just two weeks.\n\nAmid the craze of AI ETFs, does it make sense to start investing in every new ETF? Analysts offer some guidance. A Wall Street Journal report quoted Morningstar analyst Kenneth Lamont, who said that we should look for “thematic purity” while investing in AI ETFs. The ETF you choose, according to the analyst, must be investing in “bellwether” stocks positioned to benefit from the AI industry trends.\n\nThere is a new AI ETF in town. KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), launched earlier this month, tracks the Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index, which captures the performance of AI tech companies. The index seeks exposure to three main AI categories: hardware, infrastructure, and applications. The index picks companies by assigning  AI Exposure Score, which assesses each company’s relevance to AI tech. You can get exposure to AI companies focusing on data centers, LLMs, AI tech to reduce costs and improve customer experience.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the top 10 holdings of this new AI ETF and see whether they have the potential to rise in the coming months and weeks. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Best AI Stock to Buy Based on New AI ETF?\n\nAlexander Supertramp / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nAmazon is one of the biggest holdings of KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to gain on the back of its AWS business which is set to benefit from the rise in AI spending. Mizuho recently cited a survey conducted by one of its partners which shows that AWS sales cycle is seeing acceleration. Mizuho analyst James Lee reiterated his Outperform rating on the stock and gave a $240 price target.  The survey shows that spending on AWS is expected to rise about 22% year over year in 2024, up from the previous estimate of 20%, as generative AI projects are seen at an “inflection point” with external models about six months away from commercial deployment.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Dan Ives of Wedbush thinks have the potential to grow based on the AI revolution.\n\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\n\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn’t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled “chatbot recommendations” as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strength in the application layer of AI.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now come in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the fourth-biggest holding of KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX).\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported better-than-expected results in the quarter, notably showing a re-acceleration in revenue growth in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment for the first time in several quarters. Equally impressive, the AWS segment saw margins increase significantly compared to the prior quarter and year, as it’s growing into a more structurally profitable business. In addition, Amazon’s profit margin is expanding rapidly as its e-commerce business has been re-aligned to produce real profits. Meanwhile, the ongoing mix shift to faster-growing and higher-margin businesses, like AWS and Advertising, are contributing more to the company’s bottom line.\n\nWe trimmed our position in Amazon purely as a function of risk management, limiting the position size from growing beyond a 15% weighting. Our ongoing analysis underpins our optimism for the business, its competitive advantages, growth runway, management team, and valuation relative to its long-term growth prospects, hence why it remains our largest position.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Drone Delivery Stocks Ready for Takeoff",
        "content": "Considering the number of businesses using drone deliveries after successful use cases surfaced during the COVID-19 epidemic, drone delivery stocks are climbing up the ladder of investment choices.\n\nIn 2022, drones brought around 80% more goods than in 2021, totaling nearly 875,000 deliveries around the globe. Given that the technology behind the idea is improving, the trend will probably continue far beyond 2023, increasing the appeal of drone delivery stocks.\n\nMoreover, drones are being used in fresh, creative ways. Drones have tracked and helped in search and rescue during Icelandic volcanic eruptions. For environmental preservation, solar panels are being cleaned and animals are being observed using drones.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGiven a CAGR of 25%, the size of the commercial drone industry is predicted to rise from $8.77 billion in 2022 to $54.81 billion by 2030, so drone delivery stocks become a must-buy.\n\nExamining the uses and favorable legislative actions, like the FAA’s clearance of beyond-visual-line-of-sight activities, let’s investigate three buy-rated drone delivery stocks with healthy potential upside.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlways leading the way in fresh transportation concepts, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is equally committed to drone technology. Under Prime Air, the drone delivery system seeks to carry items to consumers in 30 minutes or less using robotic flying vehicles.\n\nThe FAA has approved Amazon’s delivery drones to go beyond operators’ visual line of sight. With this milestone, Amazon may increase its drone delivery operations and reach more U.S. consumers. Previously, Amazon had to make sure drone pilots could see their drones, restricting efficiency and delivery range.\n\nThe Amazon MK30 is the firm’s newest drone, replacing the MK27. Modern “sense and avoid” technology lets the MK30 safely pass through highly congested suburban areas and around obstacles. It can fly in mild rain and is lighter and quieter.\n\nIn addition, Amazon has a new service in College Station, Texas. Customers can now have their medicines delivered by drone from Amazon Pharmacy within an hour.\n\nBy 2024, Amazon wants to have drone flights to more U.S., Italian and U.K. towns. To expedite delivery, Amazon will bring drone delivery to its Same-Day Delivery sites.\n\nAmazon envisions drones delivering 500 million goods annually by the end of the decade. These developments and licensing approvals set Amazon on a path to alter last-mile delivery. AMZN’s potential upside is 22.8%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Google’s parent company, is also investing heavily in drone transport through its Wing division, working to bring things like food and medicines.\n\nNearly double the capacity of its previous models, Wing recently launched a new drone capability of carrying up to five pounds. This advancement solves the problem of many flights needed for bigger payloads.\n\nWing is adding more delivery services with drones in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Part of this growth is relationships with big stores like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) that make it possible to send a wide range of things quickly, such as food and home items.\n\nStarting with delivery in Christiansburg, Virginia, Wing has also expanded its cooperation with DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) to the United States. This service offers to provide meals from Wendy’s fast, usually within 30 minutes.\n\nApart from improving delivery efficiency, the new, bigger drones help reduce environmental impact. Wing’s simplified delivery system guarantees the speedy delivery of goods with less influence on the environment.\n\nDesigned to fly at speeds up to 65 miles per hour and with a 12-mile range, Wing’s drones combine horizontal and vertical rotors and use sophisticated automation systems for better-flying stability and economy. Shares of the tech conglomerate hold a potential upside of around 11%.\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) has started using drones to improve its transport services, especially for healthcare operations. Subsidiary UPS Flight Forward, or UPSFF, started employing drones to transport medical supplies and samples.\n\nUPS and German drone company Wingcopter are developing multipurpose transport drones. The drones launch vertically and then transition to fixed-wing flight for more payload space and increased range. This partnership covers transportation needs in retail, healthcare and emergency medical supply distribution.\n\nDuring the pandemic, together with CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), UPS started a home drone delivery service in The Villages, Florida, the biggest retirement community in the United States. UPSFF also extended services to additional healthcare institutions and transported hundreds of medical samples to WakeMed’s Raleigh hospital via drone.\n\nWith the FAA’s permission, UPSFF may fly drones beyond the operator’s line of sight, allowing UPSFF to make drone deliveries much farther and quicker. This important legal step will let UPS increase the scope of its drone operations and include them more broadly in its service network.​​\n\nUPS stock offers a potential upside of around 10%. It’s trading at an attractive entry point among drone delivery stocks, especially after Q2 earnings failed to meet analyst expectations, giving investors a chance to purchase a quality stock. It offers a 4.5% yield, which is above the 1.4% sector average.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Broadcom To Challenge Nvidia Dominance? Analyst Says Jensen Huang-Led Chip Giant's Competitor Is 'Catching Up'\n\nIn a recent development, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is making significant strides in the AI stock market, posing a challenge to Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nWhat Happened: The report, based on recent interactions with investors in New York and Connecticut, indicates that Broadcom’s specialized AI business is gaining traction, Business Insider reported on Tuesday. The company has been assisting cloud giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in developing customized AI chips for internal use.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. America's construction sites are desperate for Robots — here’s how to invest in a house-printing startup who’s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry.\n\n“AVGO is catching up to NVDA as the top holding as AVGO has more AI customers joining (OpenAI and Bytedance) and accretion from VMware,” Citi noted. However, Broadcom’s stock still lags behind Nvidia’s, with a 79% gain in a year compared to Nvidia’s 177%.\n\nThe shift in investor sentiment towards Broadcom is significant, given Nvidia’s dominance in the AI stock market. Other semiconductor companies, including NXP Semiconductors and Advanced Analog Devices, are also seeing increased investor interest due to expected inventory replenishments.\n\nSee Also: General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50 per share.\n\nDespite a mixed sentiment, Citi maintains a positive outlook on the semiconductor sector, stating, “We remain wildly bullish on semis.”\n\nWhy It Matters: Broadcom is targeting a massive artificial intelligence (AI) silicon market opportunity, worth over $150 billion in the next five years. This positions the tech giant for significant growth, both in the near term and long term.\n\nBroadcom’s dominance in the $5-7 billion data center/AI Ethernet switching and routing chipset market, with a commanding 80% market share. This dominance is largely due to its relentless innovation.\n\nDespite Broadcom’s progress, Nvidia could achieve a market capitalization of nearly $50 trillion within the next decade, according to tech investor James Anderson.\n\nPrice Action: On Tuesday, Broadcom was trading 0.11% lower in the pre-market after closing at $161.06 on Monday, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next:\n\nRory McIlroy’s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 — here’s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100 Gen Z and Millennial millionaires couldn't care less for stocks and bonds — Here's what they're buying instead.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Broadcom To Challenge Nvidia Dominance?

        "title": "Alphabet earnings top estimates as cloud business gains steam, AI losses grow",
        "content": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) reported its fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, beating analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines, as its cloud businesses continue to pick up steam, topping the $1 billion mark for operating profit for the first time.\n\nFor the quarter, the company saw earnings per share of $1.89 on revenue of $84.7 billion. Analysts were anticipating earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue of $84.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That's a jump from the same period last year of 31% and 14%, respectively, when the company reported earnings per share of $1.44 on revenue of $74.6 billion.\n\nAdvertising revenue topped $64.6 billion versus analysts' expectations of $64.5 billion, and up from $58.1 billion last year. YouTube ad revenue, however, fell short, with the segment bringing in $8.66 billion versus expectations of $8.95 billion.\n\nShares of Alphabet were flat immediately following the announcement.\n\nGoogle saw cloud revenue of $10.35 billion and operating income of $1.17 billion. That's better than analyst expectations of $10.1 billion and operating income of $982.2 million, and higher than the $8 billion in revenue and $395 million in operating income the company reported in Q2 2023.\n\nAlphabet shares are up 30% year to date. Shares of rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are up 18% and 22% year to date, respectively. All three companies are pouring money into building out their generative AI capabilities, spending lavishly on data centers capable of powering the AI models they offer via their cloud service platforms.\n\nIn the second quarter, Alphabet reported spending $2.2 billion building AI models across its DeepMind and Google Research organizations. That's up from $1.1 billion in Q2 2023. When exactly AI starts to generate revenue for Google’s Cloud business, let alone its ad segment, is still up in the air.\n\n“It is still too early to count on AI benefits as most [companies] remain in pilot mode, and material AI [revenue] is more likely a 2025-26 event,” Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a recent client note ahead of Alphabet's earnings announcement.\n\nGoogle is still trying to find its footing with AI Overview, the generative AI feature that shows up at the top of Google Search results pages. In May, the company rolled out the search function, only for users to quickly discover that its answers weren’t always accurate, with now famous responses telling users to put glue in their pizza or to eat a rock every day. Google responded by pulling back some of the gen AI features.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it spends on AI, Alphabet has been cutting in other areas including headcount. In Q2, the company reported having 179,582 employees, down from 181,798 in the same period last year. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Put on the Chopping Block if Trump Wins the Election",
        "content": "As of July, political analysts are forecasting a red wave in November and Donald Trump’s return to the Oval Office. If you remember, from his first stint as President, Trump implemented several different economic policies. Much of his focus is on returning employment and manufacturing to the United States.\n\nSo, as investors, which companies can we target if Trump wins in November? That will depend on which policies Trump and his administration can implement. From the platform he is campaigning on, we know that Trump wants to reduce President Biden’s focus on clean energy and electric vehicles. Let’s look at three stocks to avoid if Trump wins the election in November.\n\nRivian (RIVN) The front of a Rivian (RIVN) storefront is seen lined up with Rivian R1T and R1S model trucks out in front.\n\nSource: Michael Berlfein / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) has often been seen as one of the true challengers to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). One positive for Rivian is that it manufactures its vehicles in America at its factory in Georgia. However, Trump has repeatedly stated that he is pulling EV tax credits and incentives, which will be a major blow to an unprofitable startup like Rivian.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTrump has been notably anti-EV, recently calling it a green scam. Any reduction in EV funding and consumer subsidies would be detrimental to U.S.-based companies like Rivian. Tesla would suffer, too, but Musk’s announcement that he will be donating $45 million per month to Trump’s campaign seemingly has the EV maker in Trump’s good books.\n\nRivian is far from profitable even after major investments from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Volkswagen. Shares of RIVN have gained nearly 60% over the past month but are still down by 18% in 2024. The stock is trading at 3.2x sales and has an Enterprise Value/Revenue (EV/Revenue) of 2.8, which is a fraction of the valuation of Tesla. Still, with Trump’s negative sentiment surrounding EVs, I’d steer clear of Rivian until there is more regulatory clarity.\n\nEnphase (ENPH) mobile phone screen with Enphase Energy (ENPH) logo on it to represent renewable energy stocks\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) is an American solar equipment and infrastructure company. It has been a popular stock among clean energy investors and has provided stellar returns in recent years. Although it was down by about 20% in 2024, it has returned more than 400% over the past five years.\n\nThe solar industry faces problems similar to those of EV-makers like Rivian. Trump and Biden have polarizing opinions on clean energy. If Trump is victorious, he will likely reduce government funding for clean energy infrastructure. In the past, he has also imposed tariffs on some of the components and parts of solar equipment made outside the United States.\n\nStory continues\n\nRepealing Biden’s clean energy bills will be an uphill battle for Trump. He will need the support of both the Senate and the House before anything is significantly changed. Trump has threatened to cancel the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and to eliminate the Solar Tax Credit (ITC) for businesses and consumers. Trump’s support of the fossil fuel industry, particularly coal and oil, leaves little room for companies like Enphase to flourish under his watch.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) The META backed Threads app as a compelling alternative to Twitter. Social media application technology concept.\n\nSource: Cat Box / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is one of the most successful companies in history and the seventh largest in the world by market cap. However, Trump’s disdain for Meta and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been well documented and could again rear its ugly head if he wins the Presidency again.\n\nOne of the bullish arguments for Meta is that TikTok’s days as a competitor are numbered in the United States. Trump himself has tried to ban TikTok on multiple occasions. It’s also no secret that Trump is vehemently against China’s government and its documentation of American user data. Recently, Trump has changed his tune on TikTok. He said he favors TikTok staying in America because otherwise, it is just Facebook and Instagram.\n\nPerhaps as a peace offering, Zuckerberg and Meta have reinstated Trump on their platforms. It hasn’t done much to convince Trump or Biden to be a fan of Zuckerberg. Trump has been known to get personal, and being on his hit list as the sitting President might not fare well for Meta. Still, some might argue that Meta is relatively cheap at just 24x forward earnings and 9x sales.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 ‘Forever Hold’ Stocks for Generational Wealth: July 2024",
        "content": "Time is an asset when investing in the stock market, so finding the best forever stocks can lead to higher long-term gains. After all, investing icon Warren Buffet once famously said, “our favorite holding period is forever.”\n\nHolding on to stocks for the long haul provides several advantages. For one, you’re not affected by the day-to-day price swings and get to sit back while the compounding effect reigns and works its magic. Moreover, overtrading can drive up fees and transaction costs or result in underperformance.\n\nThe task then comes down to finding these ‘forever hold’ stocks for generational wealth. My philosophy here is simple: focus on the fundamentals of the business. That is, the company’s growth opportunities and consistent top — and bottom-line growth. These elements serve as good indicators of a stock’s future performance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn that note, here’s a look at three forever stocks to buy for the long haul.\n\nWalmart (WMT) An image of a Canoo, Inc. (GOEV) Walmart electric delivery vehicle\n\nIn the era of e-commerce dominance, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is one of the top forever stocks on the market. The retail giant, known for its affordable products, has seen its stock rise 33% this year. Despite trading at a premium, several signs point to stronger gains ahead. The company relies on two key growth drivers: attracting wealthy customers and its e-commerce business.\n\nAmidst rising inflation, Walmart drew in several high-income earners looking to stretch their dollars. In its recent earnings report, the company stated sales in grocery and merchandise were primarily driven by high-income households. Whether this is a long-term trend remains to be seen, but Walmart is revamping its stores to retain its wealthy customer base.\n\nA second tailwind for long-term growth is Walmart’s growing e-commerce business. Despite intense competition in the space, sales in this segment grew 21% in the previous quarter. The company is making active efforts to sustain this growth. Walmart recently signed a deal with Roblox (NASDAQ:RBLX) to sell its physical products to users in the virtual realm.\n\nLooking at the financials, total revenue was up 6% from the prior year, and earnings per share (EPS) was up 200% from last year. In the next quarter, Walmart anticipates a 4.5% increase in net sales and operating income. The impressive financials and growth opportunities make a strong bullish case for WMT stock’s wealth-generating potential.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\n2024 is shaping to be a solid year for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company joined the $2 trillion club last month. Its stock is up 22% this year. However, Amazon’s long-term prospects appear even stronger,r making AMZN a strong contender as a forever-hold stock for generational wealth.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at its current performance, Amazon leads the charge in two major areas: e-commerce and cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing business, holds a 31% market share. Amazon is leveraging AI to enhance its offering and has introduced several AI cloud innovations to cater to its wide customer base.\n\nAmazon’s e-commerce business is also seeing a major boost from AI. The technology helped improve delivery speed and efficiency, leading to a new delivery record this year. In March, nearly 60% of its Prime orders were delivered within the same or the next day at the top 60 metropolitan locations.\n\nAs Amazon continues developing its AI-driven enhancements, it will catapult its cloud and e-commerce business to new heights. Building on its optimistic growth prospects, Amazon anticipates stronger growth with a 7% to 11% increase in net sales in the second quarter.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe third pick on this forever stocks list is Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). Unlike Amazon, which sells directly to consumers, Shopify allows businesses to set up storefronts on its platform. Since its inception, the company has found plenty of success, attracting high-profile brands such as Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Red Bull. This has enabled the company to lead the e-commerce segment with a 23% market share.\n\nLooking ahead, SHOP’s growth potential alludes to its wealth-generating solid capabilities. One driver of this growth is Shopify’s successful partnerships. The company recently signed a deal with Target (NYSE:TGT) to enable Shopify’s merchants to join Target’s third-party marketplace, Target Plus. As part of the deal, merchants on SHOP’s platform can sell their goods in Target’s physical stores. This will enhance brand visibility for existing brands while enticing companies to join Shopify’s platform.\n\nOn the e-commerce front, Shopify’s growth will be amplified by AI. The company plans to integrate AI at the heart of its platform and introduce a range of AI tools to provide a seamless shopping experience. As Shopify continues to develop its AI innovations, its market position will only strengthen.\n\nIn its recent earnings, Shopify reported a 23% rise in revenue year over year (YoY) and a 33% increase in gross profit. For the second quarter, Shopify expects revenue growth in the high teens.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDivya has a background in finance and accounting and has worked in FP&A roles at Fortune 500 companies.

        "title": "Top 3 Digital Advertising Stocks for Your July Buy List",
        "content": "As companies allocate more of their marketing budgets to digital platforms, digital advertising stocks show promise for future expansion.\n\nIn 2024, the digital advertising market is valued at close to $670 billion. It accounts for approximately 69% of total media ad expenditure – an impressive 10.9% increase from the previous year. This upward trend is expected to continue, with projections suggesting the market will reach $870 billion by 2027. The rise of mobile and data-driven advertising, along with innovations like generative artificial intelligence (AI), is driving this expansion.\n\nGiven this growth potential, here are the top three digital advertising stocks for your July buy list.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntegral Ad Science (IAS) a programmatic ad is served up on a smartphone\n\nSource: shutterstock.com\n\nIntegral Ad Science (NASDAQ:IAS) focuses on digital ad verification and optimization. Its cloud-based platform, IAS Signal, ensures ads reach real audiences in safe environments with insights and independent measurement across various formats.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, IAS reported $114.53 million in revenue, a 7.9% increase from the previous year. Management highlighted a 40% rise in social media revenue and new industry-first partnerships. Despite this growth, the company posted a net loss of $1.3 million, or 1 cent per share, reversing from a prior-year profit of 2 cents per share.\n\nLooking ahead, Integral Ad Science anticipates strong demand for AI-driven solutions in the latter half of 2024. The company recently introduced deepfake measurement capabilities. It also expanded collaborations with industry giants such as Microsoft(NASDAQ:MSFT), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), Reddit (NYSE:RDDT), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Its partnership with Microsoft includes improved campaign measurement, brand safety, and invalid traffic verification across ad platforms.\n\nDespite these developments, IAS stock declined over 28% so far this year. The shares are trading at 58 times forward earnings and 3.4 times sales. Meanwhile, analysts’ 12-month median price forecast for IAS stock stands at $16, presenting an upside potential of 52% from current levels.\n\nInvesco Next Gen Media and Gaming ETF (GGME) Invesco logo in blue with mountain image\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInvesco Next Gen Media and Gaming ETF (NYSEARCA:GGME) deserves a spot on today’s list of digital advertising stocks. This exchange-traded fund gives access to companies at the forefront of media and gaming innovation, including those heavily involved in digital advertising. Its diversified investment approach helps mitigate risks while capturing sector growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nGGME was launched in June 2007 and currently holds 89 stocks. The fund’s portfolio is top-heavy. The top 10 largest holdings comprise 60% of its $37.5 million net assets. Several of the leading names include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The fund’s sector allocation is predominantly large-cap growth stocks (42%), followed by large-cap blend stocks (30%), providing a blend of stability and high growth potential.\n\nSo far in 2024, GGME has delivered a 21% return. The fund’s expense ratio is 0.6% or $60 annually per $10,000 invested, which is competitive for a specialized fund. Currently trading at 17.1x trailing earnings and 2.1x book value, GGME stands out as a strong investment in the digital advertising space.\n\nTaboola.com (TBLA) TBLA stock: Taboola company website with logo close up\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nTaboola.com (NASDAQ:TBLA) is a rising force in the sector. Leveraging its AI-powered platform, Taboola drives content recommendations across the web, helping websites and apps connect with targeted audiences.\n\nIn its first-quarter report, Taboola posted $414 million in revenue, marking an increase of 26% from a year ago. The net loss was $26.2 million, or 8 cents per diluted share, an improvement from a loss of 9 cents per share last year. The company repurchased $28 million in shares during the quarter, with $92 million remaining under a buyback authorization, set to continue through 2024.\n\nTaboola recently launched Taboola Select, a premium editorial partnership for large advertisers. It also secured exclusive deals with major partners like Foundry and a360media. Furthermore, Taboola has been selected by Apple to sell ads on Apple News and Apple Stocks apps. This global ad management role will enhance the company’s market presence and revenue potential.\n\nHowever, TBLA stock has dropped over 22% so far this year. As a result, the shares are trading at attractive valuations of 11x forward earnings and 0.8x sales. Finally, analysts are bullish, projecting a 12-month median price target of $6, implying a potential 75% upside. As Taboola prepares its earnings report on Aug. 7, its growth prospects offer an enticing risk/reward opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The Nasdaq 100 is a list of the 100 most valuable companies traded on the Nasdaq index as measured by market capitalization. The Nasdaq index is generally associated with the technology sector. However, the Nasdaq 100 spans all industries and sectors. And, like all other indexes, the Nasdaq 100 includes many undervalued stocks that are not to be ignored.\n\nThere’s a wide diversity of sectors represented in this article including everything from tech to healthcare to utilities and more. The firms discussed here are undervalued and offer a lot of  upside to investors.\n\nIdentifying undervalued opportunities is primarily about understanding why a company is currently undervalued and why it should rise moving forward. All of the stocks discussed below exhibit positive factors suggesting that they are strong investments.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese are not get-rich quick opportunities for the most part. Instead, these stocks represent firms with what look to be sustainable competitive advantages.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper (KDP) Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) sign on the front of a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP) is clearly undervalued at the moment. A cursory look at the target prices assigned to its shares shows as much. This source indicates that KDP shares are underpriced by approximately 10% and this one indicates potential returns are closer to 30%. Neither of those scenarios includes the positive effects of the dividend that KDP shares provide. It boosts returns by 2.6% at the moment.\n\nSome readers may be with Keurig Dr Pepper as an investment because it is getting a lot of attention lately. Some analysts are even beginning to compare it favorably to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). The thrust of that argument hinges on the notion that KDP shares are undervalued and thus have more upside. Although KO outperforms KDP in multiple key metrics KDP remains underpriced. I also like the argument that Keurig Dr Pepper benefits from a strong coffee business that somewhat shields it from the negative potential of declining carbonated drink consumption.\n\nBeyond all of those generalities is the fact that KDP’s earnings are steadily rising and its business rock solid overall. It’s undervalued and steady which is a combination most any investor can appreciate.\n\nWorkday (WDAY) Workday Layoffs. A close-up view of a Workday (WDAY Stock) sign in Pleasanton, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWorkday (NASDAQ:WDAY) CEO Carl Eschenbach offered a succinct summary of why its stock is highly attractive when he stated that:\n\n“With the emergence of Generative AI, the shifting talent landscape, and pressure to realize operational efficiencies, Workday has never been more relevant. Our strong value proposition, investments in key growth initiatives, and leadership in AI are paying off as more organizations turn to Workday to manage their two most important assets – their people and money.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe application of generative AI to enterprise scale software is one of the biggest growth opportunities today. Companies like Workday are well positioned to grow rapidly as AI transforms operational efficiency both within the firm itself and for its external clients.\n\nThat’s the high level catalyst investors should consider overall. Drill down into current financials and there’s plenty to like otherwise. Revenues are growing at approximately 18% and Workday has dozens of AI use cases in development. The company should be able to upsell those AI applications into its recurring revenue base and find new partners as well. Workday is particularly attractive based on its high gross margins in a software sector already known for particularly high margins. That will remain a key driver of its business and a prime reason to invest.\n\nMonster Beverage (MNST) Grocery store shelf with 16 ounce cans of Monster brand energy drinks.\n\nSource: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com\n\nMonster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) stock represents a company that is easy to appreciate: The company sells an in-demand product that has become a household name while maintaining strong business fundamentals.\n\nThere’s absolutely nothing wrong with investing in a company that projects roughly 10-12% top line growth annually into the near future with moderately quicker earnings growth. Yet Monster Beverage remains undervalued nonetheless. I think the reasons for that are easy to understand. For one, MNST shares don’t include a dividend unlike other popular beverage stocks like KO and KDP. So, there’s no income potential, only upside appreciation potential. Second, other energy drink stocks like Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) are arguably more exciting with their early growth narratives. Neither of those arguments invalidates Monster Beverage’s steady fundamentals, though.\n\nThat’s where it shines and will continue to shine.  Monster Beverage has a strong history of creating highly positive cash flows from its investments. I personally am a big fan of companies that can create profit over the long term and Monster Beverage is one of them.\n\nAnalog Devices (ADI) Analog Devices (ADI) sign outside of building\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany AI stock plays like Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) can simultaneously appear overvalued and undervalued. Analysts either believe that the continued emergence of AI provides a catalyst for substantial upside or that prices are too high relative to historical multiples. Analog Devices is far from the only AI stock currently being viewed in that light.\n\nThe company managed to deliver results above the midpoint of guidance during the most recent quarter. Analog Devices did so even as inventory issues continue to work against it. The company managed to produce $3.1 billion in free cash flows and returned $675 million to shareholders during the quarter. So, while the markets continue to be concerned that AI is overblown, ADI continues to outperform.\n\nThe biggest positive sign for Analog Devices is that inventory levels are stabilizing after the massive buying frenzy over the past few years. The company expects a return to sequential growth in Q3. That suggests investors who buy now will be rewarded near the end of the year. That should create a profit taking opportunity or provide reason to hold on and await further growth.\n\nGE Healthcare Technologies (GEHC) GE Healthcare (GEHC) sign. GE Healthcare is an American company founded in 2014 and spun off from GE in 2023.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nGE Healthcare Technologies (NASDAQ:GEHC) is a young stock spun off from its parent company in early 2023. GE wanted to concentrate on the industrial businesses that make up its core. That meant spinning off a healthcare unit that produces complex imaging machinery while focusing on aviation and power production.\n\nThat’s where the company stands today: An independent business and stock that has appeal investors should understand. GEHC shares are undervalued at the moment. Those shares currently trade for $82 which is near the low analyst target price. The consensus price target sits at $94 and GEHC includes a very modest dividend yielding 0.15%.  There’s obvious upside for investors willing to risk it.\n\nThose investors should remain confident because per share earnings are expected to boom by more than 43% in 2024. GE Healthcare is still finding its way following the spin off but there’s plenty to like fundamentally. None of that mentions the fact that AI is highly applicable to healthcare imaging providing a real growth opportunity to GE Healthcare to consider.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) stock represents a company that is part Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), part Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL), and part Visa (NYSE:V). It has emerged as the eCommerce and fintech leader for a maturing Latin American economy that it dominates.\n\nWhether LATAM customers are ordering goods online, paying for those goods, or simply becoming banked, there’s a good chance MercadoLibre is involved. The company’s Q1 earnings report is pretty much par for the course: 36% revenue growth combined with similar payment volume growth.\n\nTopline growth is expected to fall to approximately 20% in 2025 and level out thereafter for several years. However, EPS growth is going to approach 40% during that period and that alone will continue to make MELI shares highly sought after.\n\nMercadoLibre is undervalued by approximately 20% based on analyst opinion from this metrics-based site. The company continues to Garner favorable comparisons to Amazon with the caveat that it is much more profitable earlier and also has distinct fintech advantages.\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) is a cloud application security platform software stock that offers a lot to investors at present. The shares also have between 12 and 30% upside depending on whether you consider the consensus price or the high target price.\n\nDatadog may very well reach that latter growth rate if AI security software takes off in the same way that hardware has in 2023 and 2024. That’s what some analysts anticipate will happen. Those same analysts expect that the importance of security at the enterprise scale will drive sales for firms including Datadog.\n\nThe application of AI to security software at the Enterprise level is a huge untapped opportunity. The point here is relatively simple: Hardware firms like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) represent the greatest AI investments so far. The implementation of that hardware will create new opportunities for software as AI matures. Datadog is well positioned in that sense.\n\nThe company is also growing rapidly and is expected to experience massive EPS growth during this fiscal year. In short, there’s a lot to like about Datadog.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Cautious Optimism for Alibaba",
        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) has reported a mix of performance outcomes for fiscal year 2024. While the company's international commerce segment, under the Alibaba International Digital Commerce (AIDC) division, has shown remarkable growth, it continues to face challenges within its core markets.\n\nDespite these challenges, Alibaba retains durable competitive strengths in Chinese e-commerce through its leadership in mobile payments, social commerce and consumer logistics. The company's strategic investments in emerging segments like cross-border commerce, cloud computing and customer management software for retailers are promising, though their success is not guaranteed given the challenging macroeconomic environment and execution risks.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with BABA.\n\nIn the near term, the stock is likely to remain volatile, reflecting the growth struggles witnessed recently. However, if Alibaba can demonstrate consistent market share gains in China while resuming steady earnings growth, its valuation multiple may expand again. For investors with a higher risk tolerance, shares could potentially return over 30% within 12 months, according to analyst forecasts.\n\nAlibaba's path to growth: International success\n\nAlibaba posted 7% year-over-year revenue growth for the March quarter, but income from operations fell by 3%. Overall net income climbed for the entire 2024 fiscal year by 9%, but results have had to be more consistent recently.\n\nIndeed, it does not feel like stiff competition dented Alibaba's cross-border e-commerce operations. Its international retail division posted solid momentum driven by robust order growth on platforms such as AliExpress. Other initiatives, such as the AliExpress Choice initiative, further boosted performance, which improved the customer experience with better product selection. Cautious Optimism for Alibaba\n\nSource: Alibaba\n\nIn the wholesale space, Alibaba has enjoyed the benefit of delivering value-added services across borders. The Chinese wholesale commerce area is expanding. International commerce net revenues shifted back and forth for the group at $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter. This reflected staggering year-over-year growth of 45%, which says a lot about the strong momentum of the company's international businesses recently.\n\nAs a final point, the company has increased its focus on the growth of its AliExpress platform through logistic integration with its Cainiao network. Alibaba aims to increase AliExpress' brand awareness and user experience globally by increasing investments in key markets across Europe and Southeast Asia.\n\nStory continues\n\nA $5 billion buyback plan: A bold move amid investor concerns and market challenges\n\nIn May, Alibaba announced plans to raise $5 billion through a convertible bond offering. The company said proceeds would fund share buybacks at $80.80 per share. This suggests management sees value in repurchasing stock at current levels.\n\nHowever, some investors needed clarification on the deal's complex structure. There are also worries over how accessible the new cash on Alibaba's balance sheet will be for general corporate purposes.\n\nAnalysts see the potential for the stock to increase in value, but point to risks that limit the upside or lead to further declines. For instance, Hargreaves Lansdown notes some \"green shoots\" of improvement in Alibaba's business, but progress overall remains sluggish.\n\nSimilarly, Morningstar recently raised its price target for Alibaba by 2% to $96 per share, implying undervaluation. This target is based on expectations that consumer discretionary spending in China will rebound, allowing the company to regain market share and resume earnings growth. However, competition and regulatory hurdles remain top concerns.\n\nThe road ahead: Opportunities abound amid economic and competitive hurdles\n\nWhile Alibaba has promising opportunities in areas like international expansion and artificial intelligence, the company faces an uphill battle with numerous challenges impacting its business.\n\nThe country's gross domestic product growth has slowed to an estimated 3% to 4% annually from the 6% to 7% in earlier years. This slowdown, together with the impacts of Covid-19, weakened consumers' confidence and theatrically trimmed discretionary spending. Less demand among consumers is the last thing a company with a heavy dependence on Chinese retail, like Alibaba, would be concerned with.\n\nTogether with macroeconomic concerns, Alibaba is being competitively squeezed by some business lines. Within Chinese e-commerce, Alibaba has been losing market share to JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and PDD Holdings' (NASDAQ:PDD) Pinduoduo. The company's operations in this segment are growing only at single-digit rates year over yearpretty slow compared to the hypergrowth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud businesses have attained.\n\nAlibaba Cloud faces uphill competition from dominant players like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. These Western tech giants have far greater global brand recognition and trust than Alibaba Cloud.\n\nBetween economic struggles and fierce competition, there are legitimate concerns about Alibaba's ability to execute its growth strategy. The company's core commerce segment makes up most of the total revenue, so any deeper slowdown here would be very impactful.\n\nAlibaba is trying to expand into new frontiers in China and abroad, but execution risks are elevated given the challenging macro environment. More specifically, the Chinese retail landscape looks particularly challenging in the near term. Given economic uncertainties, consumer discretionary spending remains under pressure. This weighs heavily on Alibaba's massive e-commerce platforms like Taobao and Tmall, which rely on Chinese consumers' willingness to shop.\n\nOnly when broader consumer confidence rebounds will it be easier for the stock to recapture previous highs. Markets will watch closely for signs of stabilization in China's commerce trends. But the environment is likely to remain cloudy in the short term.\n\nThe takeaway: Cautious optimism\n\nDespite the challenges, there are still reasons for optimism if investors take a long-term view. While the stock has struggled recently, Alibaba retains competitive strengths in Chinese e-commerce through its mobile payments, social commerce and consumer logistics leadership. As China's economy expands over time, Alibaba is poised to benefit.\n\nThe company also has promising initiatives in emerging segments like cross-border commerce, cloud computing and customer management software for retailers. Significant investments in these areas could potentially pay off.\n\nHowever, Alibaba's growth trajectory remains unclear. Much depends on how successfully the company can execute new growth drivers while shoring up its core Chinese e-commerce operations. Investors need more evidence these investments will translate into profits.\n\nIn the near term, Alibaba's stock will likely remain volatile. The valuation reflects the growth struggles witnessed recently. However, if the company can demonstrate consistent market share gains in China while resuming steady earnings growth, its valuation multiple may expand again.\n\nAccording to analyst forecasts, the stock could potentially return over 30% within 12 months for investors with a higher risk tolerance. However, ongoing economic and regulatory headwinds in China make this a far from sure bet.\n\nUntil China's business climate stabilizes, investors may want to approach the stock cautiously. Consider waiting for clarity on Alibaba's growth rebound before making major positions, but keep it on your watchlist for when Chinese consumption trends improve.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "People spend a lot of time on their devices, but the actual number may surprise you. The average American spends 4.5 hours on their smartphone each day, and that’s not even including laptops and tablets.\n\nOur digital devices give us access to many perks that are more difficult to obtain in the real world. The digital world makes it easy for people to buy any product, access various entertainment options, and communicate with people from anywhere.\n\nInvestors can generate sizable returns by observing others. People spend a lot of time on their phones but also a lot of money. Some leaders in the digital world generate billions of dollars in quarterly revenue. These same businesses have delivered impressive long-term returns for their shareholders.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAre you wondering which companies make sense for capitalizing on the digital world? These digital stocks offer plenty of potential for patient investors with lengthy time horizons.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) someone using the Facebook (FB stock) app on their phone in front of a laptop that also has the Facebook webpage on it\n\nSource: Chinnapong / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s no secret that most people spend hours online and use the web to make purchasing decisions. They read online reviews, look at advertisements, and read detailed articles to determine which products to buy.\n\nMany businesses want to show up in front of the right people more often, and they turn to companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to make it happen. Facebook’s parent company has 3.24 billion daily active users across its social networks, offering plenty of prospects for advertisers.\n\nThe company is still growing at a torrid pace despite being well-known. Revenue increased by 27% year-over-year in the first quarter while net income was up by 115%. Meta Platforms has been boosting its profits during its year of efficiency, which led to meaningful returns. Shares are up by 38% year-to-date and have gained 140% over the past five years. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.5x and offers a 0.4% dividend yield.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon building at night time with logo light up on building\n\nSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s hard to think of a company that has done better in the digital world than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The tech giant released its online marketplace more than 30 years ago, and it’s still bringing in billions of dollars every quarter. Amazon redefined how people shop for products and services and expanded into high-growth industries like cloud computing, advertising, gaming, groceries, and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe tech conglomerate reported 13% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter, demonstrating that growth is still strong after so many years. Net income more than tripled as well. Amazon enjoyed a 22% year-to-date gain and is up 86% over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile those gains are good, Wall Street believes the stock has more to give. The stock is rated as a “strong buy”, and the average price target implies a 22% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $250 per share suggests the stock can gain an additional 37%.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Meta Platforms is an advertising leader in its own right, one tech giant surpasses it. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) makes billions each quarter from ad placements on Google, YouTube, and websites that use Google AdSense. The tech giant surpassed a $2 trillion market cap earlier this year and logged a 29% year-to-date gain. Shares are also up by 217% over the past five years.\n\nAlphabet presents a healthy mix of growth and value. On one hand, the stock has a 28x P/E ratio and a 0.4% yield. On the other hand, Alphabet delivered 15% year-over-year revenue growth and 57% net income growth in the first quarter. Alphabet is also looking at cost-cutting measures that can increase value for long-term investors. The company’s recently announced dividend further highlights leadership’s commitment to shareholders.\n\nWall Street analysts like what they see and have rated the stock as a “strong buy.” The average price target suggests the stock can gain an extra 14%.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe digital world has enabled many possibilities but has also created many risks. One key concern is how much data hackers can access if they infiltrate a company’s database. Cyberattacks can cost millions of dollars and hurt brand loyalty.\n\nCorporations and small businesses turn to cybersecurity giants like Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) to keep their data safe. Cybersecurity stocks also generated impressive long-term returns for investors. For instance, Fortinet has more than tripled over the past five years.\n\nWhile any investor would be happy with those five-year gains, Fortinet had a rough 2023. Revenue and net income growth decelerated, slamming the brakes on stock gains. However, the tide appears to be changing. Fortinet reported 7.2% year-over-year revenue growth and 20.8% net income growth in the first quarter. Service revenue was a big highlight that jumped by 24.8%. Fortinet is currently rated as a “hold” with a projected 18% upside.\n\nUpwork (UPWK) The logo for Upwork (UPWK) is displayed on a cellphone.\n\nSource: Funstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe internet doesn’t only offer ways for people to find entertainment and buy products from anywhere in the world. It has created many career opportunities and made it easier for people to work remotely. Investors hoping to capitalize on this trend may consider Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK).\n\nThe online freelance marketplace hasn’t had the best year as a stock. It’s down by 20% year-to-date, but that dip has resulted in a P/E of 34x. Furthermore, revenue and net income are both on the upswing. Upwork reported 18.7% year-over-year revenue growth and 7.4% net income growth in the first quarter. The freelance marketplace’s advertising revenue continued to soar and recorded a 93% gain from a year ago. Revenue from Freelancer Plus subscriptions increased by 76% as the platform surpassed 100,000 active members.\n\nUpwork is also making investments into artificial intelligence that enhance the user experience. Uma, Upwork’s Mindful AI, helps match employers and freelancers for optimal positions.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Close up hand holding mobile with Digital Advertising and icons, Digital Marketing concept. digital ad stocks\n\nSource: weedezign via Shutterstock\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) serves business owners and influencers who want more people to know about their businesses. Instead of offering ad placements, Semrush offers tools that help people with keyword research and ad campaign optimization. The company has attracted nearly 112,000 paying customers to several subscription plans. Semrush also has 1.12 million registered free customers on its email list.\n\nThe company successfully raised the average revenue per customer while attracting more customers. This dynamic should help Semrush deliver enticing long-term returns for its investors. Shares are up by 5% year-to-date and gained 38% over the past year. The firm delivered 21% year-over-year revenue growth and 122% net income growth in the first quarter.\n\nWall Street analysts are confident that the company will continue to gain market share and reward patient investors. It’s rated as a “moderate buy” among five analysts and has an average price target that suggests a 15% upside. The highest price target of $18 per share implies that Semrush can gain an additional 30% from current levels.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) The Duolingo (DUOL) logo on a smartphone screen with a map in the background.\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock.com\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is a leading educational app that helps people learn new languages. The company has also expanded to offer verbal and written lessons for math, music, and other subjects. Although it looks attractive in the long run, it has endured an 18% year-to-date loss.\n\nThe company’s substantial net income growth is a key reason for confidence. Duolingo reported $27 million in profits in the first quarter, compared to a $2.6 million net loss in the same period last year. Duolingo also reported 45% year-over-year revenue growth to reach $167.6 million in sales.\n\nDuolingo’s financials weren’t the only positive development. The firm is rapidly expanding its user base. About 31.4 million people use the app daily, a 54% improvement from a year ago. Meanwhile, monthly active users totaled 97.6 million people, marking a 35% improvement. A soaring user base that’s very active should pave the way for more gains. Recent stock price movements don’t align with the company’s long-term potential.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AMZN and GOOG.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – July 23, 2024 – Stocks in this week’s article are Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. HALO, Tenet Healthcare Corp. THC and Atmos Energy Corp. ATO.\n\n4 Stocks with Impressive Interest Coverage Ratios to Buy Now\n\nWe often judge a company based on its sales and earnings. These metrics, however, may not be sufficient on their own. A stock might get a boost if these figures rise year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter, offering a lucrative opportunity for short-term investors to cash in. However, relying solely on sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired long-term returns. For those seeking sustainable investment growth, a deeper dive into the company's financial health and stability is essential.\n\nA critical analysis of a company's financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Coverage ratios, which assess whether a company is robust enough to meet its financial obligations, play a crucial role in this analysis. A higher ratio generally indicates a stronger financial position. This article focuses on the interest coverage ratio, a key indicator used to evaluate a company's ability to pay interest on its debt, ensuring that the company is not over-leveraged and can comfortably meet its interest obligations from its operating earnings.\n\nInterest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.\n\nWhy Interest Coverage Ratio?\n\nThe interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.\n\nDebt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.\n\nInterest coverage ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.\n\nAn interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. One should also track the company's past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com, Inc., Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc., Tenet Healthcare Corp. and Atmos Energy Corp. boast an impressive interest coverage ratio.\n\nHere are four of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nAmazon, a multinational technology company focusing on e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of A. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Amazon's current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 11% and 57.9%, respectively, from the year-ago period's levels.

The stock has rallied 42.2% in the past year.\n\nHalozyme Therapeutics, a biopharma technology platform company, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of B.

        "title": "Whole Foods settles ex-worker's lawsuit over Black Lives Matter masks",
        "content": "By Nate Raymond\n\nBOSTON (Reuters) - Whole Foods has reached an agreement to settle a lawsuit accusing it of illegally firing a worker who refused to remove her Black Lives Matter facemask and complained about racism at the Amazon.com-owned upscale grocery chain.\n\nA lawyer for Whole Foods said in a filing on Monday in federal court in Boston it had reached an agreement in principle to resolve the case with Savannah Kinzer, an outspoken critic who had worked in a Cambridge, Massachusetts, store.\n\nHer claims were the last that remained in a lawsuit that began as a proposed class action when it was filed in 2020 over a Whole Foods dress code that barred workers from wearing attire related to Black Lives Matter, a racial justice movement. A trial was set for Aug. 19.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSettlement terms were not disclosed. The company and Kinzer's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit stemmed from nationwide racial justice protests that followed the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, a Black man, under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer.\n\nDuring those protests, Whole Foods began disciplining employees who wore facemasks during the pandemic supporting Black Lives Matter.\n\nWhole Foods cited its dress code, which it said was meant to foster a welcoming, safe and inclusive shopping environment. Kinzer and some other employees resisted, saying the company's dress code previously went unenforced.\n\nKinzer said she was then fired for protesting outside her store, rejecting demands to stop wearing a mask and talking to the press. She had also filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nKinzer and other employees sued in July 2020 shortly after her firing, arguing on behalf of other Whole Foods workers that the mask ban was racially discriminatory.\n\nWhile courts rejected those discrimination claims, the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in April revived Kinzer's individual claim that her firing constituted illegal retaliation and said a jury should resolve the dispute.\n\n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Rod Nickel)",

        "title": "4 Solid Tech Stocks to Buy as S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq Resume Rally",
        "content": "Wall Street rallied on Jul 22 after suffering for over a week as investors rotated out of mega-cap tech stocks and rushed toward small-cap and cyclical stocks, hoping that the Federal Reserve would soon start its rate cuts.\n\nSmall-cap stocks are still holding up with the Russell 2000 closing 1.7% higher on Monday. However, tech stocks rebounded Monday as investors rotated back into the growth stocks. This saw the S&P 500 closing up 1.1% on Monday to settle at 5,564.41 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed 1.6% higher at 18,007.57 points.\n\nThis was the S&P 500’s best day since Jun 5. Tech stocks have been responsible for the broader rally in 2023, which has also continued this year.\n\nThis year’s rally has primarily been fueled by the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI, led by the industry darling NVIDIA Corporation NVDA.\n\nExperts believe that AI has immense potential that has yet to be fully realized. NVIDIA's remarkable success in the past year has inspired many tech companies to explore AI's possibilities to gain long-term business advantages.\n\nThe progression of various smart devices is crucial in this field, as they require powerful computing and learning capabilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition and video analysis. These tasks need high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and better graphics processors, which is benefiting the semiconductor industry.\n\nAlso, the Federal Reserve is gearing up for the first rate cut this year, which will mark the beginning of the easing cycle. Market participants are pricing in a 25 basis point rate cut in September. Lower interest rates reduce borrowing costs, which is favorable for growth stocks.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in mega-cap tech stocks such as Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Netflix, Inc. NFLX, QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM and Apple, Inc. AAPL whichhave strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN’s online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company’s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish its footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. AMZN also enjoys a dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service space, thanks to Amazon Web Services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com has an expected earnings growth rate of 57.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last 60 days. AMZN currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nNetflix, Inc. is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. NFLX has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping Netflix sustain its leading position despite the launch of new services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video.\n\nNetflix’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 57.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 3.7% over the past 60 days. NFLX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated designs, manufactures and markets digital wireless telecom products and services based on the Code Division Multiple Access (“CDMA”) technology. QCOM’s products include CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications as well as global positioning system products. QUALCOMMalso offers development and other product-related services to U.S. government agencies and their contractors.\n\nQUALCOMM’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 17.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the past 60 days. QCOM currently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nApple Inc.’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone. However, the Services portfolio of AAPL, which includes revenues from cloud services, the App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services, has now become the cash cow. Moreover, non-iPhone devices like Apple Watch and AirPod have gained significant traction.\n\nApple has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.5% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 60 days. APPL currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Thinks Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Can Benefit if Donald Trump Wins Election 2024",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Top 11 Trump Trades: Winners and Losers. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program talked about the consequences of the failed assassination attempt on Donald Trump and mentioned a few stocks that could benefit if the former President comes to power again.\n\n“You are sticking your head in the sand if you think nothing has changed after the failed assassination attempt on the now-official Republican nominee for President.”\n\nCramer said that the “frightening moments” of the assassination attempt have indeed “cut in the favor” of Trump’s win and he was “already leading in the polls.”\n\nCramer recalled the days when he was the anchor of Kudlow & Cramer show and Biden was a senator from Delaware. Cramer said Biden once told him that he was the “poorest senator out of one hundred because he owned no stocks.”\n\n“He was actually bragging about it,” Cramer said.\n\nCramer said that Joe Biden is not the “champion” of stocks and he’s “on board with labor.”\n\nJim Cramer’s Thoughts on Donald Trump\n\nHere’s what Cramer said about Trump\n\n“In the many years I’ve known Trump and I have known him fairly well, he’s been wildely pro stock market, always watching it like a hawk. He loves bantering about the stock market.”\n\nCramer said that even though Trump was in “real estate, he enjoyed stocks.”\n\nJim Cramer added that Trump always thought there was too much regulation and was also “wildly” pro-oil and gas.  The CNBC host said since Trump cannot see the stock market going down and sees the market gains as a positive factor even for his presidency, his arrival in the White House could boost stock portfolios.\n\n“Hate him or like him, he’s good for your portfolio.”\n\nFor this article watched the latest programs of Cramer where he mentioned stocks that could benefit from a Trump presidency. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) among Jim Cramer’s Top 11 Trump Trades: Winners and Losers?\n\nKen Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nJim Cramer thinks Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) could benefit from a Trump presidency amid regulatory factors. The CNBC host said Amazon has been in the “crosshairs” with the FTC.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to gain on the back of its AWS business which is set to benefit from the rise in AI spending. Mizuho recently cited a survey conducted by one of its partners which shows that AWS sales cycle is seeing acceleration. Mizuho analyst James Lee reiterated his Outperform rating on the stock and gave a $240 price target.  The survey shows that spending on AWS is expected to rise about 22% year over year in 2024, up from the previous estimate of 20%, as generative AI projects are seen at an “inflection point” with external models about six months away from commercial deployment.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Dan Ives of Wedbush thinks have the potential to grow based on the AI revolution.\n\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\n\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn’t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled “chatbot recommendations” as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strength in the application layer of AI.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates the world’s leading e-commerce marketplace and the largest public cloud platform and has a burgeoning advertising business. We expect to see sustained margin improvement as Amazon’s retail regionalization efforts are bearing fruit and as its advertising business continues to scale ahead of peers. We believe the profitability ramp is still in the early innings as the company turns its attention to improving costs. One area will be inbound shipping, where faster delivery times through reduced freight, miles and packaging can reduce waste. We also see generative AI tailwinds and infrastructure modernization driving re-acceleration in growth at AWS, further enhancing Amazon’s free cash flow compounding potential. In addition, following our early 2024 ESG engagements with Amazon (after multiyear engagements) we were positively inclined to see continued improvements in labor relations (health and safety metrics, benefits and wages), as well as in environmental stewardship (climate targets, reducing packaging materials, electric delivery trucks) and innovation (commitments to responsible AI and data privacy). One of the newly announced initiatives on the retail side is consolidating deliveries into fewer boxes, which reduces packaging.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer’s Top 11 Trump Trades: Winners and Losers. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Despite the sector’s explosive growth over recent years, not all cloud companies are primed to keep soaring.\n\nThe cloud computing market is projected to grow significantly from $0.68 trillion in 2024 to $1.44 trillion by 2029, with a CAGR of 16.40%. This growth is expected to be driven by the integration of emerging technologies such as AI, big data and machine learning across various sectors, which should enhance customer-centric applications and operational efficiencies.\n\nThe landscape of cloud computing is evolving with new technological advancements and regulatory changes. Therefore, it is imperative for investors to stay vigilant. As we approach the end of July, certain cloud computing stocks are showing troubling signs that could warrant a rapid retreat from investors’ portfolios. These issues range from operational inefficiencies and high burn rates to increasingly competitive pressures and disappointing earnings reports.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nC3.ai (AI) AI Artificial Intelligence.

AI stocks\n\nSource: Tapati Rinchumrus / Shutterstock.com\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) is a provider of enterprise AI applications. The company has come under scrutiny as it faces significant operational and financial challenges.\n\nThe company’s financial health has shown signs of strain, with revenue growth not keeping pace with the industry. In the last fiscal quarter, C3.ai reported a modest year-over-year (YoY) revenue increase of 20%, which is less robust compared to its peers in the AI sector. Moreover, the company reported a GAAP operating loss of $82.3 million. This trend highlights inefficiencies and possibly an unsustainable cost structure in its business model.\n\nC3.ai has made a strategic pivot from a subscription-based to a consumption-based pricing model. While this transition aims to align costs with customer usage, it introduces uncertainty about revenue stability and customer retention.\n\nInvestor confidence seems to be waning, as evidenced by the company’s stock performance. Over the past year, C3.ai’s stock has not performed well compared to the general uptick in technology stocks. The market’s lukewarm response can be attributed to the growing skepticism about C3.ai’s profitability path and its high burn rate in the face of aggressive competition.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is a renowned player in the cloud-based data warehousing sector. Despite its potential to capitalize on the growing demand for AI, the company needs to overcome significant hurdles.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the critical challenges for Snowflake stems from its customer base composition, which predominantly includes smaller companies and startups. These segments are particularly vulnerable to the tightening economic conditions characterized by rising interest rates and a reduction in venture capital funding. Moreover, Snowflake’s technology, while advanced, faces the critical challenge of integrating AI capabilities in a way that clearly differentiates it from competitors.\n\nSnowflake’s recent financial performance has reflected the operational challenges faced by the company. While the company continues to report growth, there is a noticeable deceleration in its revenue increments. This decline suggests difficulties in upselling and retaining existing customers — key indicators of a company’s health in the SaaS industry.\n\nMoreover, Snowflake’s stock has reacted negatively to these trends. After peaking in late 2021, the stock has seen a downward trajectory.\n\nDigitalOcean (DOCN) A laptop screen displays the logo for DigitalOcean (DOCN).\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nDigitalOcean (NYSE:DOCN) has long been recognized as a user-friendly cloud service provider for developers and small to medium-sized businesses. The company faces significant headwinds that could impede its future growth and profitability.\n\nDigitalOcean’s financial performance has been less than stellar, with revenue growth showing a marked deceleration in recent quarters. The company’s revenue growth slowed down notably, failing to keep pace with the broader industry growth rates. The company’s forward-looking guidance also suggests a continuation of this trend, with expected growth rates lagging significantly behind the sector’s average.\n\nMoreover, DigitalOcean operates in a highly competitive sector dominated by giants such as Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud. These competitors not only have deeper financial resources but also extensive R&D capabilities that allow them to innovate rapidly and scale efficiently.\n\nAlongside its underwhelming growth trajectory, DigitalOcean’s valuation remains a concern. The company’s stock trades at a premium relative to its peers, which is hard to justify given its slower growth rate and smaller scale. This mismatch raises flags about the sustainability of its stock price, especially if the company continues to underperform in a highly competitive market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohammed Saqib did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Stocks That Can Help You to Get Richer in 2024",
        "content": "The stock market has fluctuated greatly this year. The S&P 500 is up 15% since January yet has dipped 3% since mid-July after a slight sell-off in the tech market.\n\nTech stocks became a haven for many investors amid economic uncertainty in recent months. However, easing inflation has seen Wall Street reshuffle its investments and venture outside the long-term security of tech. As a result, now could be an excellent time to take advantage of the dip and make an investment in some of tech's best performers.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are two attractive stocks, dipping 5% and 4%, respectively, since mid-July. These companies have made promising inroads in their respective markets this year and could see significant stock growth as we head into earnings season next month. They're both stocks that can help you get richer in 2024.\n\n1. Amazon: Trading at one of its best values over the last decade\n\nIt seemed as if Amazon could do no wrong over the last year. The company has delivered multiple quarters of impressive earnings growth alongside significant investments in some of the fastest-growing markets. Amazon has benefited from a long list of cost-cutting measures that brought its retail business back to profitability and a steady expansion in the budding artificial intelligence (AI) market.\n\nThe company's revenue increased 13% in the first quarter of 2024, beating Wall Street forecasts by $750 million. Meanwhile, operating income spiked 220% to more than $15 billion. The solid gains came from key parts of its business, such as third-party seller services, selling ads on its streaming platform Prime Video, subscription services, and its cloud business with Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAmazon has delivered an impressive turnaround in its business after suffering a market downturn in 2022 that led to steep profit declines. The company's free cash flow has risen 170% in the last 12 months, illustrating its ability to successfully navigate unexpected headwinds.\n\nThe e-commerce giant has used its boosted cash reserves to reinvest in its business, expanding AWS' reach by building data centers in new regions, enhancing its AI offerings, and venturing into chip development. Amazon will report its Q2 2024 earnings on Aug. 3, which will likely follow recent trends in beating estimates. MSFT PS Ratio Chart\n\nMoreover, the above chart shows Amazon is potentially the best-valued stock among its AI rivals. Not only does it have the lowest price-to-sales ratio (P/S) among these companies, but its figure for the metric is also the closest to its 10-year average. As a result, Amazon's stock is a bargain right now, compared to its potential, and could make you rich in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Apple: Carving out a lucrative role in AI\n\nApple's stock didn't rally many investors in the first half of 2024, with its share price dipping about 1% from Jan. 1 to the start of June. However, recent announcements have made Wall Street bullish again, boosting the stock by 17% since last month.\n\nApple was largely left out of the rally many tech stocks enjoyed thanks to AI last year. The iPhone maker initially struggled to find its function in the market as companies like Amazon and Microsoft found their AI niches in cloud computing. However, while many of the company's peers are focused on providing businesses with AI services, Apple is prioritizing the consumer market.\n\nThe company hosted its annual Worldwide Developer Conference in June, where it announced Apple Intelligence, with the apt tagline, \"AI for the rest of us.\" Apple Intelligence is a range of generative features coming to the company's products, including writing tools with enhanced language capabilities, image generation, access to OpenAI's ChatGPT, and a complete overhaul to Siri.\n\nApple Intelligence will launch this fall and coincide with the September release of Apple's newest iPhone, its first smartphone designed with a focus on AI. The coming iPhone is among just a few products with access to Apple Intelligence, as the generative features will be reserved for the company's newest devices. Apple's AI strategy is designed to encourage consumers to upgrade their current devices, which could lead to a significant earnings boost in its next quarter.\n\nIn addition to potential stock growth from AI, Apple will release its Q3 2024 earnings at the beginning of August. Recent reports have indicated a possible jump in iPhone and Mac sales this quarter, which could lead to a turnaround for the company's product segments after a recent slump.\n\nAs a result, it could be worth investing in Apple's stock now before earnings season and the launch of its next iPhone. The company's shares are trading at 35 times its earnings, indicating they're not exactly a bargain. However, that figure has come down over the last week. Meanwhile, Apple's long-term potential suggests its stock is worth its premium price, making it worthy of buying this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Stock (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q2 Earnings Preview: Expect Another Exceptional Quarter",
        "content": "The second-quarter earnings season is here, and on July 25, Big Tech giant Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report its financial results. As a long-term AMZN stock bull, I’m confident the company’s positive momentum will persist in Q2, driven by its shift to higher-margin services, advancements in AI, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), its crown jewel.\n\nIn this article, I’ll focus on expectations for the June quarter, and I’ll answer the following questions: how strongly has Wall Street projected Amazon’s top and bottom-line growth? What are the main topics investors should be paying attention to? And finally, is the stock a buy before earnings day?\n\nAmazon’s Q1 Recap and Wall Street’s Outlook\n\nOver the past few quarters, it’s become clear that under CEO Andy Jassy, Amazon has shifted its focus to higher-margin services like cloud computing and advertising, moving away from first-party retail sales.\n\nSince taking over, Jassy has been dedicated to reducing costs, streamlining operations, and restructuring Amazon’s fulfillment network by eliminating thousands of jobs. He has also maintained a strong focus on AWS, which remains a crucial and highly profitable segment of Amazon’s business. Over the last year, these segments have become significantly more profitable, and Q1 2024 was no different.\n\nIn the last quarter, reported in April, Amazon impressed the market by beating expectations for EPS by 18.6% and revenues by $764 million.\n\nComparing Q1 2023 to Q1 2024, Amazon’s operating margins have greatly improved. AWS was the highlight, as Amazon managed to improve its operating margin to 10.7% from 3.7% in Q1 2023, with the cloud segment reporting operating margins going from 24% to 37.6% (although this was partly due to changing the estimated useful life of their servers). In North America, the operating margin jumped from 1.2% to 5.8%. The International segment went from -4.3% to 2.8%.\n\nFaced with this shift in margins, Wall Street has raised the bar, especially regarding Amazon’s bottom line. The e-commerce giant is expected to report annual EPS growth of 56% in the second quarter, with 29 analysts revising their projections upwards and only 6 downwards in the last three months.\n\nRegarding revenues, Amazon is expected to increase them by 10.6% to $148.64 billion compared to Q2 last year. However, this figure reflects greater skepticism, as only four analysts have revised their projections upwards, and 34 have revised them downwards.\n\nAccording to Amazon’s management, net sales for Q2 are expected to grow between 7% and 11%, already accounting for unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Additionally, weaker consumption trends in Europe compared to the U.S. could prove to be a headwind.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompared to the consensus revenue estimate of $148.7 billion, Amazon guided net sales to be between $144 billion and $149 billion. Analysts seem to be betting on the high end of the range, possibly signaling that the company’s top-line projections are too conservative.\n\nBut even with the bar set high, Amazon has beaten Wall Street’s EPS estimates seven times in the last 10 quarters. If it beats them again in Q2, it will be the sixth consecutive quarter topping estimates.\n\nKey Areas for Investors to Focus On\n\nIt’s highly likely that analysts and investors will focus heavily on AWS’s performance. Amazon has been significantly growing AWS in recent quarters, consistently beating expectations. The company’s plans to ramp up capital expenditures (CapEx) highlight the robust demand for generative AI within its cloud computing segment. In Q1 alone, Amazon spent $14 billion on CapEx, with total investments reaching $48.4 billion last year.\n\nA key point of interest will be how AWS defends its market share against competitors like Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google Cloud, both of which have been strong performers with proprietary models.\n\nThere’s also interest in whether enterprises are favoring open-source models, potentially benefiting AWS more than its competitors. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized that customers prefer to bring their models to their data instead of the other way around, differing from Azure and Google Cloud’s approach.\n\nTwo other critical areas for investor satisfaction will be demonstrating AI’s impact on revenue growth beyond AWS, particularly in Advertising, where last quarter saw a strong 24% year-over-year increase in ad sales.\n\nAlso, investors will closely watch Amazon’s ability to execute its strategy of fast and efficient deliveries for Prime members, which aims to improve consumer experience and drive higher margins.\n\nLast quarter, Amazon guided that it expects operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, up from $7.7 billion a year ago, including seasonal stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nIn my view, if Amazon delivers growth in AWS bolstered by AI, expands Advertising revenue, and improves operating income through efficient Prime deliveries, it should report a stable quarter. Historically, Amazon guides investors conservatively to avoid overpromising, suggesting little chance of disappointment this quarter. This also increases the likelihood of positive surprises. Looking back at the last five quarters, AMZN shares have typically shown a positive reaction the day after earnings results.\n\nIs AMZN Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street is extremely bullish on Amazon stock, and it seems that the Q2 results are set to please investors. Every analyst on Wall Street covering AMZN has given it a Buy recommendation, forming a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average AMZN stock price target among the 44 bullish analysts is $223.76 per share, suggesting upside potential of 22.6%.\n\nSee more AMZN analyst ratings\n\nKey Takeaway: Bullish on Amazon Ahead of Earnings\n\nAlthough analysts have set high expectations for Amazon to achieve the upper end of its Q2 guidance, given the company’s conservative track record, I believe this shouldn’t pose a problem. If Amazon shows investors strong AWS growth, robust revenue trends from AI investments, and a solid performance in Advertising revenue, it’s likely to have a strong Q2.\n\nAt present, I don’t foresee any obstacles that could contradict these points, making me bullish on AMZN stock before its earnings report. In fact, management’s tone last quarter was overly optimistic about the company’s growth trajectory in AI, particularly with AWS, suggesting its growth story is still in its early stages.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Amazon (AMZN) Stock Drops Despite Market Gains: Important Facts to Note",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) closed at $182.55 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.32% move from the prior day. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 1.08% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.32%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 1.58%.\n\nShares of the online retailer have depreciated by 3.15% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 0.31% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.43%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Amazon in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on August 1, 2024. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.02, up 61.9% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $148.54 billion, up 10.54% from the year-ago period.\n\nAMZN's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.58 per share and revenue of $638.24 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +57.93% and +11.04%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Amazon. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Amazon has a Forward P/E ratio of 39.97 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.16.\n\nWe can also see that AMZN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.35. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The Internet - Commerce industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.04 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 60, positioning it in the top 24% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nTo follow AMZN in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery's (WBD) TNT network said Monday that it has matched a media rights bid to continue airing NBA games amid investor concern it would lose key sports content for viewers.\n\nThe company has aired a portion of games through its TNT network since 1989. It reportedly shells out $1.2 billion annually for the rights, which expire at the end of next season. According to various media reports, the company has been set to lose them to newcomers Amazon (AMZN) and Comcast (CMCSA).\n\n\"Regrettably, the league notified us of its intention to accept other offers for the games in our current rights package, leaving us to proceed under the matching rights provision, which is an integral part of our current agreement and the rights we have paid for under it. We have reviewed the offers and matched one of them,\" TNT said in a statement sent to Yahoo Finance Monday afternoon. \"Our matching paperwork was submitted to the league today. We look forward to the NBA executing our new contract.”\n\nIt's not clear that the NBA will allow WBD to match the offer. In a statement to Yahoo Finance, the league simply said: “We just received WBD’s proposal and are in the process of reviewing it.”\n\n\"At the last possible moment, WBD played its matching rights hand,\" Emarketer senior analyst Ross Benes wrote in reaction to the development. \"It's a risky move that could anger the NBA and sour WBD's reputation among other sports leagues that it may be interested in doing business with. However, the NBA is so valuable to the company that desperate measures may be warranted.\"\n\nThe league has previously expressed interest in having a presence on streaming.\n\nAlthough the company did not name which package it has matched, multiple reports say the company has matched Amazon's offer after the tech giant struck a deal with the NBA for a streaming rights package that will be offered through its Prime Video service for a reported $1.8 billion.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the package includes both regular season and playoff games, plus the play-in tournament and a share of conference finals, which would rotate among the media partners.\n\nAmazon and Warner Bros. did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.\n\n\"Relying entirely on linear TV audiences would be a death knell for modern sports leagues. The NBA realizes young people prefer streaming. Partnering with Amazon will modernize NBA distribution and pull in cord-cutters,\" Benes said.

(Lucas Peltier-USA TODAY Sports) (USA TODAY Sports via Reuters Connect / Reuters)\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery stock, which traded flat on the news after hours, has been under pressure as analysts and investors debate the future of the media giant without the NBA.\n\nStory continues\n\nComcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA) submitted a reported bid worth $2.5 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal. The network will reportedly show about 100 games per season, with half airing exclusively on its streaming service Peacock.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney (DIS), the NBA's other major broadcast partner, is expected to retain its share of the league's media rights after reportedly agreeing to increase its payment of $1.5 billion a year to $2.6 billion, per the Journal. The company will carry fewer games than in its current package, although it will be able to stream games on its upcoming ESPN streaming platform, set to launch in fall 2025.\n\nIn total, the NBA has reportedly secured a media rights package worth around $76 billion over 11 years — a bullish sign when it comes to the importance of sports to both streamers and traditional broadcast and cable providers.\n\n\"Ultimately, this NBA renewal is just another example of the growing importance — and thus ever inflating costs — of sports rights,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Google parent Alphabet to report Q2 earnings Tuesday with AI, ad spending front and center",
        "content": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) will report its fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, giving Wall Street a closer look at the state of the digital advertising market and whether generative AI hype is translating to revenue growth. The tech giant is coming off of an impressive first quarter during which it announced it initiated its first dividend of $0.20 per share and authorized stock repurchases of $70 billion.\n\nAlphabet shares are up 30% year to date. Shares of rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are up 18% and 22% year to date, respectively. All three companies are pouring money into building out their generative AI capabilities, spending lavishly on data centers capable of powering the AI models they offer via their cloud service platforms.\n\nFor the quarter, analysts are anticipating earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue of $84.35 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would be a major jump from the same period last year when the company reported earnings per share of $1.44 on revenue of $74.6 billion.\n\nWall Street expects advertising revenue to top $64.5 billion, up from $58.1 billion last year. That includes year-over-year increases in Google Search & other, YouTube ads, and Google Network revenue, pointing to a positive advertising environment. A beat by Alphabet could also buoy shares of ad business rival Meta (META).\n\nIn an investor note, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said he expects advertising spending to be similar to or better than Q1, with Google paid search growth in the mid-teens.\n\n“Fundamentals remain healthy, with solid ad spend, potential benefits from Olympics and elections,” Thill wrote.\n\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt struck a similarly upbeat tone in his investor note. “We think the setup remains positive heading into 2Q results with our ad survey and agency commentary pointing to continued strength for Google Search,” he wrote. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai speaks during the tech titan's annual I/O developers conference on May 14 in Mountain View, Calif. (Photo by GLENN CHAPMAN/AFP via Getty Images) (GLENN CHAPMAN via Getty Images)\n\nOn the cloud front, Wall Street is anticipating Google Cloud revenue of $10.1 billion and operating income of $982.2 million. That would mark an increase from the $8 billion in revenue and $395 million in operating income the company reported in Q2 2023.\n\nGoogle still trails both Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud space, with its rivals capturing the number one and two spots, respectively. However, the segment continues to grow, and Alphabet is banking on its investments in generative AI to help power stronger revenue and customer acquisition in the future.\n\nBut when exactly AI starts to generate revenue for Google’s Cloud business, let alone its ad segment, is still up in the air.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It is still too early to count on AI benefits as most [companies] remain in pilot mode, and material AI [revenue] is more likely a 2025-26 event,” Thill wrote.\n\nAs for Google’s search business, Devitt says AI search overviews could create “incremental engagement and may become a tailwind for Search monetization over time.”\n\nGoogle is still trying to find its footing with AI Overview, the generative AI feature that shows up at the top of Google Search results pages. In May, the company rolled out the search function, only for users to quickly discover that its answers weren’t always accurate, with now famous responses telling users to put glue in their pizza or to eat a rock every day. Google responded by pulling back some of the gen AI features.\n\nWhile generative AI is sure to be a major theme this earnings season, it’s still unclear how much it will boost companies' bottom lines. But with Google the first among Big Tech companies to report earnings, it should give us some indication of whether the technology is generating meaningful revenue or not.

        "title": "Top Research Reports for Amazon.com, Prologis &amp; Infosys",
        "content": "Monday, July 22, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Prologis, Inc. (PLD) and Infosys Limited (INFY), as well as a micro-cap stock Blue Dolphin Energy Company (BDCO).  The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nAmazon.com shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+20.7% vs. +14.6%). The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive.\r\n\r\nStrong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings are tailwinds. Robust advertising business is also contributing well. The company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain a plus.\r\n\r\nGrowing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. However, macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Prologis have outperformed the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry over the past three months (+18.9% vs. +13.0%). According to the company’s recent estimate revision trend for third-quarter 2024 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook, with estimates moving north over the past week. Its second-quarter results reflected a rise in rental revenues, though higher interest expenses played a spoilsport.\r\n\r\nPrologis is well-poised to gain from its portfolio of strategically located industrial facilities in some of the world’s busiest distribution markets. Strategic buyouts and development activities appear promising. A solid balance sheet strength aids its growth endeavors.\r\n\r\nDespite the choppiness in the industrial real estate market, demand is improving and this trend is expected to continue. Also, the shrink in the construction pipeline augurs well. However, high interest rates remain a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Prologies here >>>)\r\n\r\nInfosys shares have outperformed the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry over the year-to-date period (+17.3% vs. +3.7%). The company is gaining from large deal wins and fast-growing digital services. Its sustained focus on Agile Digital and AI-driven Core services is a tailwind. The strong demand for its services in the cloud, the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber security and data and analytics is a key driver.\r\n\r\nHigher investments by clients in digital transformation, AI and automation are an upside. The solid traction of its Cobalt cloud portfolio is another positive. The latest forecast for worldwide IT spending by Gartner is an upside for Infosys as well.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company is suffering from increasing anti-outsourcing sentiments in certain countries. Higher subcontractor costs and compensation revision with higher variable pay and incentives are weighing on its margins. Further, currency volatility between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Infosys here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Blue Dolphin Energy have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry over the year-to-date period (-2.8% vs. +5.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $62.67 million is facing risks include heavy reliance on refining margins, which saw first-quarter 2024 revenues drop to $91 million from $116.7 million the previous year, and high customer concentration, with 89% of 2023 revenues from two main customers.\r\n\r\nMoreover, persistent debt issues, significant default amounts, and concerns over affiliate transactions further cloud its financial stability. Blue Dolphin, operating in the strategic Eagle Ford Shale region, offers a robust investment option with its established market presence and considerable infrastructure, including a 15,000-barrel-per-day refinery and more than 1.25 million barrels of storage.\r\n\r\nFinancially, it managed costs effectively, reducing goods sold from $96.2 million in first-quarter 2023 to $79.2 million in first-quarter 2024, and secured a $5-million credit facility for liquidity.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Blue Dolphin Energy here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. (AMX), Moderna, Inc. (MRNA) and Discover Financial Services (DFS).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "content": "The U.S. presidential election is heating up. After months of relative stability, there has been a ton of breaking news in the past few weeks, and the betting markets and prediction models are swinging toward former President Trump.\n\nThe Economist’s forecast, for example, shows that Trump has a roughly 83% chance of winning the election as of July 18th. There are still months before election day and a lot can happen. Regardless, investors are understandably considering the possibility of a major Republican victory in November.\n\nIn addition, last week, Trump announced that he had selected Ohio senator J.D. Vance as his vice-presidential pick. Vance is known for being a China skeptic and supporter of American manufacturing initiatives.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nParticularly now that Vance is on the ticket, investors should consider the possibility of an American manufacturing boom over the next four years. These American automation stocks should enjoy supercharged results in the future.\n\nRockwell Automation (ROK) A Rockwell Automation building in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor investors betting on American automation solutions, Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) should be near the top of their shopping lists.\n\nIn fact, Morningstar’s Brian Bernard recently wrote, “We view Rockwell as the highest-quality automation player on the west side of the Atlantic based on quality, breadth of offerings and shrewd strategic partnerships.”\n\nBernard is particularly enthusiastic about the company’s Logix platform, which offers programmable controllers that support Rockwell and third-party automation solutions.\n\nLogix is broadly applicable and can serve several different industrial processes, making it easy for large companies to control multiple discrete applications within one system. The platform’s support for cloud analytics also makes it easier for companies to deploy predictive maintenance solutions, which reduces costs and improves efficiency.\n\nROK stock has dropped more than 20% over the past year as investors fret about a potential economic slowdown and reduced capital expenditures due to high interest rates. However, a Trump/Vance presidency could quickly reverse those trends. In the meantime, Bernard believes shares are attractively priced at a 14% discount to fair value today.\n\nColumbus McKinnon (CMCO) An image of the flow of automation; robot pushing a button, automated assembly line, AI brain, AV delivery, robotics. best manufacturing stocks\n\nSource: elenabsl/Shutterstock\n\nColumbus McKinnon (NASDAQ:CMCO) is another great American automation stock to buy now.\n\nThe firm offers a wide array of equipment and components needed to build automated factories and warehouses. Since the onset of the pandemic, companies have spent a tremendous amount as they rush to deploy improved logistics systems to support e-commerce.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, that trend has abated a bit due to macroeconomic concerns and the higher cost of borrowing money. However, there is little doubt that e-commerce will continue to grow in the long term, driving a greater need for smart warehouses. Additionally, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has invested heavily in warehouse robotics, forcing the whole industry to build automation solutions to keep up.\n\nWith a potential Trump presidency, smart factories could gain momentum to help deliver on the “Made in America” theme. That would further lift demand for Columbus McKinnon’s conveyor belts, hoists, rigging tools and motion control systems, which improve manufacturing process efficiency.\n\nCMCO stock bounced over the past two weeks as traders started accounting for the shifting political winds. Still, the company is more than reasonably priced at just 12 times forward earnings.\n\nCognex (CGNX) Cognex (CGNX) logo displayed on smartphone with pink and blue background behind, symbolizing CGNX stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rafapress\n\nCognex (NASDAQ:CGNX) is an intriguing pick within the American automation space, as it has multiple ways to win against current trends.\n\nThe company is heavily involved in smart factories and warehouses. It’s a leader in the fixed-mount barcode reader market, which allows retailers to scan items and check customers with fewer human cashiers. Cognex also has a small but fast-growing business providing machine vision solutions for semiconductor fabrication.\n\nCognex delivers both organic growth and an ambitious mergers and acquisitions strategy. Last year, it bought Japanese machine vision optics firm Moritex for about $275 million. This was the largest deal in Cognex’s history, building on the firm’s prior purchase of Sirius Advanced Cybernetics.\n\nCGNX stock has had a volatile ride over the past year. Amazon, a key customer, dramatically slowed down spending on its logistics operations as it adjusts to new post-pandemic economic conditions. Cognex’s sales in the auto market decelerated as the market struggled due to high interest rates.\n\nHowever, given Cognex’s multiple exciting business opportunities, any improvement in sentiment — such as a potential Trump win this fall — could get shares moving once again.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in CMCO stock.

        "title": "Jeff Bezos To Sell Another $5 Billion In Amazon Shares: How Could He Spend It?",
        "content": "Jeff Bezos To Sell Another $5 Billion In Amazon Shares: How Could He Spend It?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nWhenever the billionaire founder of a company sells off some shares, eyebrows are raised. What could it mean? Is it a sign of trouble? SEC filings recently revealed that Jeff Bezos, the former CEO and current executive chair on the board of directors at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), plans to sell 25 million shares worth approximately $5 billion. Investors may wonder if that’s a bad sign, and Bezos watchers may be curious about where the money might go next.\n\nCheck it out: Bezos' favorite real estate platform launches a way to cash in on the private credit boom — get started for just $100.\n\nThe good news for investors is that Bezos isn’t jumping out of Amazon. These 25 million shares represent just a tiny part of his stake in the company, which is around one billion shares. That works out to around $220 billion. Bezos might just be taking advantage of an opportunity. Amazon stock was down in 2023 and has spent much of the spring and summer on a steady upward climb, hitting a 52-week high recently. Why not celebrate by taking a little off the top? And with another successful Prime Day event under Amazon’s belt, it seems like a good time to sell a little with the confidence that the rest will keep going up. Where might Jeff Bezos put $5 billion to good use?\n\nLet's Get Spending\n\nBezos may have earned his billions through Amazon, but he’s not shy about spending them elsewhere. Aside from yachts, travel, and luxury goods, there are two main areas where we have seen Bezos devote a lot of money: real estate and investing.\n\nHe could always buy more real estate. He has spent $237 million on three properties on Indian Creek Island, the elite Florida area known as the Billionaire Bunker. Bezos and his fiancee, Lauren Sanchez, have decided to make the Miami area their home base. For a billionaire, no property is perfect. Like his neighbor Tom Brady, Bezos plans to make major renovations, tearing down two of the mansions he owns on the island and living in the third while he plans what is likely to be another incredible home.\n\nHe still owns his custom-built home on Lake Washington in Seattle and several other properties in the Washington area. And he enjoys the other Washington as well. When he bought the Washington Post, he picked up two homes in the Kalorama neighborhood, including a former textile museum, which he is completely remodeling. His New York City holdings include multiple prime Fifth Avenue building floors. No tech billionaire is caught without a Hawaii hideaway, and Bezos has one of those, too, a pristine estate in Maui. What's missing? A pied-à-terre in Paris, perhaps? A ski home in Jackson Hole, WY? The possibilities, like Bezos's wallet, are nearly endless.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe could and probably will invest again. Bezos doesn't just bet on himself and Amazon. He has made dozens of investments through his Bezos Expeditions investment firm, including the Washington Post and his space exploration company, Blue Origin. One of the reasons Bezos stepped down from his CEO role at Amazon was to spend more time at Blue Origin. That move paid off and accelerated the company's growth even as Bezos battled with space rival Elon Musk. Blue Origin recently filed a complaint to curb the number of rockets that SpaceX can launch from Cape Canaveral.\n\nBezos doesn't have to own a company to invest in it. Bezos Expeditions has strategically invested in now-public companies like Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Uber (NYSE:UBER). He is also an active venture capitalist supporting various private companies from Arrived to Wildtype. We can only imagine how many pitch decks and presentations he receives regularly, but his existing investments show he has many interests beyond space travel.\n\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate.\n\nShould You Sell, Too?\n\nSelling a stock is always a personal decision. If you need the money or spot a more compelling investment, this isn't a bad time to sell Amazon, especially if you have held it for a while and are ready to put those gains elsewhere. However, you should remember that, like Bezos, you may be subject to some capital gains taxes.\n\nAn argument could also be made that this isn't a great time to sell Amazon because it may continue to go up from here. With a thriving e-commerce empire, the power of the AWS cloud business, and Amazon's forays into generative AI, it could be argued that Amazon is just getting started. Analysts agree. According to Benzinga data, Amazon is a buy with a consensus price target of $216.7 based on the ratings of 40 analysts. Recently, Wolfe Research initiated coverage with an Outperform rating.\n\nWhile Amazon's next earnings results on August 1 won't give us insights into how well the latest Prime Day event did, it will provide key updates on the growth of the cloud and e-commerce businesses and other segments, including media and advertising. In Amazon's shareholder letter earlier this year, CEO Andy Jassy laid out the opportunities for Amazon, noting that even as Amazon has created a $500 billion consumer business, about 80% of the worldwide retail market segment still resides in physical stores. He also sees a massive advantage in cloud migration, growing media and advertising, and generative AI, which he said “may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet.” No stock is a sure thing, but those are some reasons that Amazon may be a hold for more than just Jeff Bezos.\n\nCheck Out One Of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\n\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\n\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over a 2-year period starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

        "content": "More than halfway through the year and the stock market is not done setting new all-time highs. With inflation ticking lower for the first time in four years possibly paving the way for interest rate cuts to arrive sooner than expected, investors are bidding up shares.\n\nBut the market leaders might not be the same ones who carried us higher over the first six months of 2024. The tech stock rally could be headed to the backseat. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) is down nearly 9% since peaking at a record high last week.\n\nGoldman Sachs expects the market to rotate away from tech stocks. In April, the investment banking firm cautioned that it was time to begin looking elsewhere for investment ideas. Although the sector proved resilient for months afterward, now might be the time to follow the analyst’s advice.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three stocks Goldman Sachs analysts give a “buy” rating. They also assigned price targets that indicate they are poised for double-digit returns over the next year. Let’s see if the investment banker is early again with its call or right on the money.\n\nExact Sciences (EXAS) EXACT Sciences Corporation office exterior. EXAS stock.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nCancer testing and diagnostics outfit Exact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS) is forecast to grow 50% over the next year. Goldman analysts lowered their price target from $88 a share to $75 but reiterated their buy rating. The stock is down 36% year-to-date as concerns about competing tests coming to market have weighed on shares.\n\nExact Sciences is a leader in stool-based colon cancer testing. Although a colonoscopy is still the gold standard for accuracy, the invasive nature of the test makes it suboptimal. The diagnostic firm’s stool test is the next best option. Yet Guardant Health (NYSE:GH) is developing a blood test for colon cancer that a Food & Drug Administration advisory committee recommended approval.\n\nHowever, stool tests are seen as more accurate, particularly for early screening purposes, even if blood tests are more convenient. Exact Sciences’ Cologuard test has an opportunity for substantial growth and margin expansion. Goldman Sach’s lowered price target may be appropriate until the blood test competitive fears subside, but EXAS stock should eventually hit the previous higher target.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) just wrapped up its latest Prime Day sales extravaganza, which it says sold more merchandise than during any prior event. As always, Amazon is big on superlatives but short on actual numbers. Still, analysts forecasted it would sell some $14 billion worth of goods over the two-day event.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe better performance underscores one of the reasons Goldman Sachs raised its price target on Amazon to $250 and reiterated its buy rating. One primary reason was overall consumer health, as exhibited by the retailer’s second-quarter results. Even though Amazon saw some softness in a few markets, e-commerce remains resilient.\n\nMoreover, Amazon is also seeing higher retail margins and growing operating income. In addition to the ongoing growth in its cloud services business, the investment banking firm sees Amazon as a solid growth vehicle.\n\nIt is hard to argue with the analysis. The retailer should also benefit from the boom in digital advertising. Ad revenue soared 23% in the first quarter to $11.5 billion. Because most people start their search for a product on Amazon’s website, it is a natural destination for marketers to seek out.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nEarlier this month Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan reiterated his firm’s buy rating on data warehousing provider Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) and its $220 per share price target. The stock was added to the investment banking firm’s conviction buy list.\n\nUnfortunately, that was before the massive hack of AT&T (NYSE:T) data hosted on Snowflake’s servers was revealed. Virtually all of the wireless carrier’s 90 million cellphone subscribers were affected. AT&T learned of the hack back in April and subsequently paid the hackers over $370,000 to retrieve the data. Other Snowflake customers have also been hacked including Live Nation Entertainment’s (NYSE:LYV) Ticketmaster and Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP).\n\nSnowflake’s stock is down 33% this year as worries about competitive pressures weigh on shares. A Barron’s report notes investors are concerned “Snowflake was less confident of the growth it gets as customers deploy artificial intelligence models.”\n\nSnowflake’s customer retention rate has declined over the past two years, coming in at 128% in the first quarter. Although the number of customers with over $1 million in product revenue sold to them grew to 485, this time two years ago, the retention rate was 168%.\n\nWall Street still has a bullish outlook for Snowflake stock. Analysts have a consensus one-year price target of  $197 per share, implying there is 47% upside. Goldman Sachs believes it is worth a bit more than that.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in T stock.

        "content": "Nvidia Could Be Worth Nearly $50 Trillion In A Decade, Says Early Tesla, Amazon Investor: Nearly 2X That Of US Or 3X Of China's Current GDP\n\nA prominent tech investor predicted that NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) could achieve a market capitalization of nearly $50 trillion within the next decade.\n\nWhat Happened: James Anderson, an early investor in companies like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), expressed his bullish outlook on Nvidia’s future potential, reported the Financial Times on Sunday. He suggested that the chipmaker’s market cap could potentially surpass the combined value of the current S&P 500.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmerica's construction sites are desperate for Robots — here’s how to invest in a house-printing startup who’s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry. General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50 per share.\n\nAnderson’s optimism stems from Nvidia’s role in the burgeoning demand for AI chips, which are crucial for training and running advanced generative AI models. This demand has propelled Nvidia’s shares to soar by 168% since the beginning of the year, pushing its market value above $3 trillion.\n\n\"The potential scale of Nvidia in the most optimistic outcome is both way higher than I've ever seen before and could lead to a market cap of double-digit trillions. This isn't a prediction but a possibility if artificial intelligence works for customers and Nvidia's lead is intact,\" Anderson said.\n\nFor context, Anderson’s prediction of Nvidia hitting $50 trillion market capitalization would be nearly twice as much as the U.S.’s current gross domestic product (GDP), which stands at $27.36 trillion, or nearly thrice as much as China’s GDP of $17.79 trillion, according to data from the World Bank.\n\nDespite this remarkable growth, Anderson views Nvidia’s potential as even greater, provided that artificial intelligence continues to deliver for customers and Nvidia maintains its lead in the industry.\n\nSee Also: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nAnderson, who now runs a $650 million fund at Lingotto Investment Management, believes that Nvidia’s “persistent exponential progress, the competitive advantages in hardware and software, and the culture and leadership are exactly what we look for.”\n\nHe also acknowledged that the path to this potential valuation would be volatile, with possible drawdowns of 35-40%. However, he expressed confidence in Nvidia’s long-term prospects, stating that the company is at the forefront of solving serious problems in areas like autonomous driving, robotics, and drug discovery.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnderson projected that the actual growth in demand for data center AI chips was currently around 60% annually. Looking forward over the next decade, he estimated that sustained 60% growth in data center revenue alone, with unchanged margins, could lead to earnings of $1,350 per share and free cash flow of approximately $1,000 per share.\n\nTrending:Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield.\n\nAssuming a 5% free cash flow yield, this analysis suggests that Nvidia shares could potentially be valued at $20,000 in 10 years, implying a market capitalization of $49 trillion. Anderson assigned a probability of 10-15% to achieve this scenario, according to the report.\n\nWhy It Matters: The prediction from Anderson comes amid a broader context of excitement and caution in the market. The U.S. stock market has experienced a significant rally, largely driven by the promise of AI. This surge has drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, with the S&P 500 index hitting new highs and the Nasdaq Composite index rising by 70% since the end of 2022.\n\nSee Also: This Income Stock Has Outperformed The S&P 500 For Over A Decade\n\nHowever, not everyone is optimistic. Craig Johnson, a managing director and chief market technician at Piper Sandler, has pointed out “warning flags” in the market, suggesting that Nvidia might be in “bubble-ish territory” and hinting at a potential market pullback.\n\nEven Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, has acknowledged Nvidia’s exceptional performance but forecasts “short-term indigestion” for the company’s business as customers reassess their AI strategies.\n\nDespite these concerns, some analysts remain bullish. Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, has a price target of $200 on Nvidia stock, citing the company’s pivotal role in the AI space.\n\nAnderson gained prominence during his nearly four-decade tenure at Baillie Gifford. He oversaw its flagship Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which initially invested in Nvidia in 2016. His leadership played a pivotal role in transforming the Edinburgh-based private partnership into an unexpected standout in the tech investment sector.\n\nRead Next:\n\nRory McIlroy’s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 — here’s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100 Gen Z and Millennial millionaires couldn't care less for stocks and bonds — Here's what they're buying instead.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Nvidia Could Be Worth Nearly $50 Trillion In A Decade, Says Early Tesla, Amazon Investor: Nearly 2X That Of US Or 3X Of China's Current GDP originally appeared on Benzinga.com",

        "title": "4 Stocks With Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio to Buy Now",
        "content": "We often judge a company based on its sales and earnings. These metrics, however, may not be sufficient on their own. A stock might get a boost if these figures rise year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter, offering a lucrative opportunity for short-term investors to cash in. However, relying solely on sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired long-term returns. For those seeking sustainable investment growth, a deeper dive into the company’s financial health and stability is essential.\r\n\r\nA critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Coverage ratios, which assess whether a company is robust enough to meet its financial obligations, play a crucial role in this analysis. A higher ratio generally indicates a stronger financial position. This article focuses on the interest coverage ratio, a key indicator used to evaluate a company's ability to pay interest on its debt, ensuring that the company is not over-leveraged and can comfortably meet its interest obligations from its operating earnings.\r\n\r\nInterest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.\n\nWhy Interest Coverage Ratio?\n\nThe interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt. \r\n\r\nDebt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision. \r\n\r\nInterest coverage ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.\r\n\r\nAn interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. One should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.\r\n\r\nAmazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. HALO, Tenet Healthcare Corporation THC and Atmos Energy Corporation ATO boast an impressive interest coverage ratio.\n\nThe Winning Strategy\n\nApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.\r\n\r\nInterest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry Median\r\n\r\nPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\r\n\r\n5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.\r\n\r\nProjected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential. \r\n\r\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\r\n\r\nVGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential. \r\n\r\nHere are four of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:\r\n\r\nAmazon, a multinational technology company focusing on e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of A.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks That Could Be Worth More Than Nvidia 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Nvidia is significantly larger than almost every company in the world. However, that doesn't mean it will necessarily stay that way. A lot can happen over five years, and I think two companies will pass Nvidia in size over the next five years: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Both happen to be involved in artificial intelligence (AI) as well, and I think they make for better buys than Nvidia right now.\n\nNvidia's lead over these two isn't insurmountable\n\nFirst, let's figure out how much of a head start Nvidia has on these two companies. While Nvidia is third in the world's largest company race, Alphabet and Amazon are fourth and fifth, respectively. So, predicting these two will be larger than Nvidia isn't an outlandish bet. Alphabet's and Amazon's stocks would need to rise by 29% and 48%, respectively, to surpass Nvidia. Over five years, this isn't too much of a gap to close.\n\nBut what makes these two better picks than Nvidia? For the record, Nvidia is the best AI company right now. That doesn't mean it will stay in that position over the next five years. Any company involved in the AI arms race is currently loading up on graphics processing units (GPUs) made by Nvidia. This is to equip themselves with the most powerful computing devices available on the market so they can create accurate AI models quickly.\n\nEventually, this demand will be satisfied, and Nvidia's revenue may retract as fewer companies create new AI-dedicated servers and replace them when they are worn out. After this phase, much of the demand will center around who can provide AI models or infrastructure to run them on.\n\nAlphabet and Amazon are massive players in the cloud computing industry, so this sets them up well for the next phase of AI investing. Cloud computing is a vital platform in AI proliferation because it allows companies that don't have the means or the need for a supercomputer at all times to run heavy workloads like AI models. By outsourcing these workloads over the cloud to platforms like Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services (AWS), more companies have access to the computing power they need to run AI models.\n\nAdditionally, each has AI development tools and generative AI models that developers can access through these cloud platforms. Cloud computing will be the next primary beneficiary of the AI gold rush, and it's already seeing strong demand.\n\nCloud computing business had a strong Q1\n\nEven before AI became a huge draw to these platforms, cloud computing excelled. However, each company has been doing phenomenally recently. In the cloud computing world, three stand out: AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud (ranked in terms of market share).\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS has a massive market lead over its competitors due to its first-mover advantage, and the mature business unit produces some outstanding numbers. In the first quarter, AWS had sales of $25 billion, with an operating income of $9.4 billion. That equates to an outstanding 38% operating profit margin, which shows how profitable these platforms can get when they have reached a mature state.\n\nGoogle Cloud is much smaller. Its revenue was $9.6 billion in Q1, growing at a 28% pace, and its operating margin was 9%. This shows how much room Google Cloud has to expand its margins, so this could become a large profit driver over the next few years.\n\nCloud computing will be the next primary beneficiary of the AI movement. As a result, I think the big three in cloud computing will be worth more than Nvidia five years from now (even though Microsoft is already larger than Nvidia).\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Millionaire-Maker Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "A historic bull run in the artificial intelligence (AI) market has made many millionaires since the start of 2023, with the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 spiking 72% and 46%, respectively. Companies across tech have profited from the rally, making Wall Street bullish about new AI software and hardware offerings.\n\nBut despite recent growth, developers have barely scratched the surface of what's possible with the technology. Consumer tech brands have only just begun enhancing their products with AI. Meanwhile, chipmakers are gradually increasing the power of their products, allowing developers to create more responsive and intelligent software.\n\nAs a result, it's not too late to invest in AI and profit from its long-term development as the technology is applied to smartphones, self-driving cars, productivity platforms, advertising, e-commerce sites, cloud platforms, and much more. So, here are two potential millionaire-maker artificial intelligence stocks to consider in July.\n\n1. Intel\n\nShares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have risen 131,000% since the company went public in 1971, making many people rich over that time.\n\nBut years of dominance in the chip market saw the company grow complacent, leaving it vulnerable to more innovative competition. As a result, the shares have tumbled 28% over the last five years, alongside lost market share and declines in earnings.\n\nRecent changes in its business model suggest Intel will be a millionaire maker again as it expands full force into AI. The company is attacking the sector from two angles: design and manufacturing.\n\nOver the past year, Intel has unveiled a series of AI-capable chips, including its Xeon 6 processors and Gaudi 2 and 3 accelerators. These were designed to compete with similar products from Nvidia and AMD and are priced significantly lower than their rivals' chips.\n\nIntel has also announced its upcoming Lunar Lake processors, developed for AI PCs, which will offer the company exposure to a high-growth sector of the industry.\n\nBut the most promising part of Intel's AI push so far is its priority on taking back the top spot in manufacturing. The company is working to steal share from market leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing by building chip plants throughout the U.S., a move that has boosted Intel's stock 5% since July 12.\n\nRising tensions between the U.S. and China could threaten access to TSMC's services and make Intel's domestic factories a vital resource as chip demand continues to soar in the AI market. The company has begun construction on its Ohio factory, with plans to make it the largest AI chip fab in the world. Intep has received $8.5 billion in grants from the U.S. government as part of President Biden's CHIPS Act, as well as $11 billion in loans.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel is playing the long game, steadily diversifying its position in AI to potentially see major gains over the next decade. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just under 3 is well below the same metric for Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC, making it a bargain by comparison -- and a millionaire-maker stock worth considering right now.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a leading beneficiary of the recent AI rally, with its shares up 119% since the start of 2023. The company's dominating cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has earned it a powerful role in the industry, becoming the go-to for many businesses seeking ways to integrate AI into their daily workflows.\n\nAs a result, the company has spent billions in recent months to expand AWS' capabilities. If you google \"Amazon invests in data centers,\" you'll find a long list of reports from the last two years illustrating the company's spending spree. It's building or expanding AWS data centers in Indiana, Mississippi, Virginia, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and India.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is gradually expanding AWS' library of AI solutions and has announced a venture into chip design.\n\nBesides cloud computing, Amazon's diverse business model gives it several other opportunities to boost earnings with the generative technology. For instance, in February, the company unveiled Rufus, an AI shipping assistant created for shoppers on its e-commerce site. According to Amazon, Rufus can \"answer customer questions on shopping needs, products, and comparisons, make recommendations based on this context, and facilitate product discovery.\"\n\nOver the past year, Amazon's free cash flow and quarterly operating income have climbed 170% and 37%, respectively, strengthening its ability to keep reinvesting in its business. With a P/S multiple of about 3, well below the same metric for cloud rivals Microsoft and Alphabet, Amazon is an AI stock to buy this July.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "A Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity: Why I Think This Warren Buffett and Cathie Wood Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Be the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Opportunity for Decades to Come",
        "content": "When it comes to institutional money managers, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett are two of the most closely followed. Despite their notable reputations, Wood and Buffett have very little in common.\n\nBuffett built his fortune primarily investing in blue chip businesses that generate steady cash flow. Conversely, Wood has a knack for making higher-risk bets in emerging technologies.\n\nNevertheless, there is one thing that Wood and Buffett have in common: They both own shares in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nWhile Amazon is not a core position for either Wood or Buffett, I find it interesting that the e-commerce and cloud computing specialist is the only Magnificent Seven stock that both investors own.\n\nLet's dig into what makes Amazon such a unique opportunity right now as excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) continues to play out.\n\nIs Amazon getting any love?\n\nFor the last couple of years, I'd argue that the majority of AI chatter has revolved around Microsoft and Nvidia. In a way, this makes sense.\n\nMicrosoft kicked off the AI revolution with its $10 billion investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Moreover, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are being rapidly deployed by some of the world's largest companies around the globe.\n\nAlthough I understand why Wall Street analysts and financial media pundits have covered Microsoft and Nvidia endlessly, I think opportunities such as Amazon have gone largely overlooked.\n\nPiles and piles of cash\n\nThe chart below illustrates Amazon's operating cash flow on a trailing-12-month basis over the last several years. For the quarter ended March 31, Amazon's operating cash flow rose 82% year over year to $99.1 billion. AMZN Cash from Operations (TTM) Chart\n\nFurthermore, the company's free cash flow has soared to $50 billion for the trailing-12-month period ended March 31. Considering Amazon was burning cash just a year prior, the rapid turnaround to such a robust financial position is impressive.\n\nLet's take a look at how Amazon is investing some of its newfound profits, and why I think the company is building the foundation for long-term success.\n\nShortly after Microsoft invested in OpenAI, Amazon followed with a move of its own -- a $4 billion investment into an AI start-up called Anthropic.\n\nAs part of the deal with Anthropic, the start-up will be using Amazon's cloud infrastructure, AWS, as its primary provider. This is a game changer for AWS, and I see it as a major catalyst for the company's cloud growth -- from new products such as Amazon Bedrock as well as Amazon's homegrown Trainium and Inferentia semiconductor chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to its partnership with Anthropic, Amazon is also committing $11 billion to build out data centers in Indiana.\n\nIt's clear that AI represents an entirely new frontier for AWS. Amazon is making some aggressive investments as it looks to outmaneuver Microsoft and Alphabet in the cloud computing space, as well as make a move on Nvidia in the chip arena.\n\nAlthough these investments are both pricey and ambitious, Amazon clearly has enough financial horsepower to double down on its AI vision and compete with its megacap peers at scale. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon looks primed to thrive for the long run\n\nThe chart below shows Amazon's valuation as measured by price to free cash flow (P/FCF). AMZN Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nWhat sticks out the most in the chart above is that Amazon's current P/FCF of 42 is about half of the company's average P/FCF multiple over the last 10 years.\n\nHowever, the more subtle idea here is looking at how normalized Amazon's valuation has become over the last decade in light of so many dramatic changes at the company. For starters, AWS is now a $100 billion revenue run rate business. Considering the majority of Amazon's operating profits come from AWS, it's encouraging to see this business segment thrive.\n\nMoreover, as generative AI continues to witness more demand, I think AWS' revenue growth and profits have the potential to exponentially accelerate.\n\nOutside of AWS, Amazon has also quietly built a multibillion-dollar advertising business -- an area where it can further compete with Alphabet and make inroads on Meta Platforms as well.\n\nI think many investors view Amazon through a narrow lens and are missing the broader theme as it relates to AI. Unlike many of its Magnificent Seven peers, Amazon is so diversified as a business that it has the ability to compete with all of its peers and do so in a highly profitable way.\n\nI think it's only a matter of time before these AI investments begin to show up in concrete results in the company's financials, at which point investors will begin to see Amazon emerging as a major force in AI. Of course, this could ignite some newfound enthusiasm for the stock and it could see an outsize run.\n\nTo me, Amazon stock looks like a bargain compared to other big tech stocks right now and its long-term potential should not be underappreciated.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Polen Capital, an investment management company, released its “Polen Focus Growth Strategy” second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, the fund returned -0.11% (gross) and -0.31% (net) compared to 8.33% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and 4.28% for the S&P 500 Index. Generative AI (GenAI) remains the dominant market narrative in the second quarter. The portfolio does not own NVIDIA or other Semiconductor companies that are presently benefitting from the demand for AI hardware. However, with the portfolio’s extensive investment in software and IT services, the firm anticipates that GenAI's long-term economic gains will go to these industries. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy highlighted stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides consumer products, advertising, and subscription services through online and physical stores. The one-month return of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was 1.31%, and its shares gained 42.18% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On July 19, 2024, Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported better-than-expected results in the quarter, notably showing a re-acceleration in revenue growth in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment for the first time in several quarters. Equally impressive, the AWS segment saw margins increase significantly compared to the prior quarter and year, as it's growing into a more structurally profitable business. In addition, Amazon's profit margin is expanding rapidly as its e-commerce business has been re-aligned to produce real profits. Meanwhile, the ongoing mix shift to faster-growing and higher-margin businesses, like AWS and Advertising, are contributing more to the company's bottom line.\n\nWe trimmed our position in Amazon purely as a function of risk management, limiting the position size from growing beyond a 15% weighting. Our ongoing analysis underpins our optimism for the business, its competitive advantages, growth runway, management team, and valuation relative to its long-term growth prospects, hence why it remains our largest position.\"\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.

        "content": "The consensus call for narrowing the earnings gap between Magnificent 7 stocks and the rest of the S&P 500 may still be overly optimistic, JPMorgan strategists said in a Monday note.\n\nThe bank highlighted that this recurring expectation has not materialized in the last five reporting seasons, with the Mag-7 consistently delivering larger positive earnings per share (EPS) surprises compared to the broader market.\n\nIn the current quarter, consensus projections estimate that the Mag-7 will continue to post significant earnings growth, albeit at a decelerated rate of 29% year-over-year, down from 53% in the previous quarter. The rest of the S&P 500 is projected to see a positive earnings growth of 5% year-over-year for the first time in five quarters.\n\nJPMorgan points out that the Mag-7 stocks, which include tech giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), have been the primary contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth for several quarters. However, the market's high valuation and extreme concentration leave little room for any disappointments.\n\n“The consensus is yet again betting on the convergence in earnings between Mag-7 and the rest, but that was disappointed on each of the past 5 occasions,” the note states.\n\n“This could be the case in the current reporting season, yet again,” it added.\n\nMore broadly, the Q2 reporting season is gaining momentum, with sequential activity improvements pointing to better earnings delivery, JPMorgan strategists said.\n\nConsensus estimates for Q2 EPS have seen minimal cuts, just 1% compared to the usual 5% three months prior to results. Analysts forecast a 15% EPS acceleration for the S&P 500 from Q1 to Q4, significantly above historical norms.\n\nSpecifically, Q2 EPS is expected to grow 9% year-over-year. Meanwhile, recent weak consumer data, including a decline in consumer confidence and ongoing weakness in China, suggest mixed company guidance ahead.\n\n“There has been a raft of profit warnings in consumer space in the past weeks, with poor stock reaction, but also in other areas,” strategists wrote.\n\nThey also said defensive sectors are projected to outperform cyclicals in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., Q1 2024 marked the first quarter since Q4 2020 where cyclical EPS growth lagged behind defensives. That trend is expected to continue, supported by falling bond yields and improving relative EPS trends for defensives, which have driven lower-beta leadership in recent months.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJPM: Consensus call for EPS narrowing between Mag-7 and rest may be lacking\n\nStory continues\n\nKorean Air set to order about 20 Boeing 777X jets, sources say\n\nRepublican senator urges defense firm CEOs to safeguard Spirit work",

        "title": "MSFT, AMZN, or GOOGL: Which Cloud Computing Player is the Best AI Stock?",
        "content": "The generative artificial intelligence (AI) wave has boosted the prospects for various categories of companies within the tech sector, including semiconductor makers, cloud computing providers, and cybersecurity players. In particular, cloud computing companies are witnessing solid demand for their services that are required to support enterprises and developers in building their generative AI models.\n\nBearing this favorable backdrop in mind, we used TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool to place Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) against each other to find the cloud computing company that is the best AI stock and could offer the highest returns from the current level, as per Wall Street analysts.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nWhile Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the market leader in the cloud infrastructure market, rival Microsoft Azure is catching up rapidly. In the March quarter (Q3 FY24 for MSFT), revenue from Azure and other cloud services increased 31% compared to AWS’ sales growth of 17% in the comparable quarter.\n\nDuring the Q3 FY24 earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that Azure is grabbing market share, with customers using the company’s platforms to build AI solutions. The CEO added that the company provides a diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the most recent offerings of Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and MSFT’s own AI chip.\n\nMicrosoft claims that over 65% of the Fortune 500 companies are using Azure OpenAI service, thanks to continued AI innovation that is backed by the company’s strategic partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Overall, Microsoft’s cloud business is seen as one of its key growth drivers.\n\nIs Microsoft a Buy or Sell?\n\nMicrosoft is scheduled to announce its Q4 FY24 results on July 30. Analysts expect the company’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to rise 9% year-over-year to $2.93.\n\nAhead of the results, TD Cowen analyst Derrick Wood reaffirmed a Buy rating on MSFT stock and boosted the price target to $495 from $470. The analyst expects the company to deliver another upbeat quarter of growth and margins. He is optimistic about Azure’s potential, with data points indicating continued growth acceleration trends. Overall, MSFT remains “best-positioned for AI monetization,” according to Wood.\n\nWith 34 Buys versus one Hold recommendation, Microsoft stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average MSFT stock price target of $504.12 implies 15.3% upside potential from current levels. Shares have advanced more than 16% so far this year.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nDespite rising competition, Amazon’s AWS unit continues to maintain a dominant position in the cloud computing market. According to Synergy Research Group, AWS commanded a 31% market share of the cloud infrastructure services market in Q1 2024, while Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud had market shares of 25% and 11%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, AWS’ sales grew 17% year-over-year to $25 billion. This growth rate marked an acceleration compared to the 13% increase experienced in Q4 2023. It is worth noting that AWS is a vital growth engine for Amazon and is highly profitable. In Q1 2024, AWS accounted for 17.5% of the overall sales but contributed more than 61% of the company’s operating income.\n\nAmazon is optimistic about the robust potential of its AWS business. CEO Andy Jassy stated during the Q1 2024 earnings call that the company is seeing notable momentum on the AI front, which is accumulating a “multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already.”\n\nWhat is the Target Price for Amazon Stock?\n\nAhead of Amazon’s Q2 results scheduled to be announced on August 1, analysts at Morgan Stanley reaffirmed a Buy rating on the stock, with a positive near-term outlook. Morgan Stanley expects AMZN to report a notable EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) beat in the second quarter and issue favorable guidance for the third quarter.\n\nIn particular, Morgan Stanley’s EBIT estimate is 17% higher than the Street’s consensus for Q2 and 10% more than the Q3 forecast. The optimistic outlook is based on AMZN’s North America Retail profitability and accelerating AWS growth.  Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Amazon’s EPS to increase to $1.02 from $0.65 in the prior-year quarter.\n\nAmazon stock earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 44 unanimous Buys. At $223.05, the average AZMN stock price target implies about 22% upside potential. Shares have risen 21% year-to-date.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nTech giant Alphabet is well known for its Google search engine. That said, the company’s Google Cloud business is grabbing Wall Street’s attention with its rapid growth. Alphabet impressed investors with its solid first-quarter results, which were driven by a major jump in Google Cloud’s profitability.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Google Cloud’s revenue increased 28.4% year-over-year to $9.57 billion, while its operating income surged to $900 million from $191 million in the prior-year quarter. The results reflected Alphabet’s increased investments in the Cloud business. Interestingly, during the Q1 2024 earnings call, management highlighted that the company introduced over 1,000 new products and features in its Cloud business over the past eight months.\n\nThe company believes that one of the aspects that differentiates its Cloud business from rivals is its AI Hypercomputer, which offers cost-effective and efficient infrastructure to train and support AI models.\n\nIs it a Good Time to Buy GOOGL?\n\nOn July 18, analysts at Jefferies reaffirmed a Buy rating on GOOGL stock with a price target of $220. They expect Alphabet to report strong Q2 results, supported by resilient customer spending and consistent Cloud business. However, Jefferies cautioned investors about slightly tougher comparisons in Q2, mainly in the ad business.\n\nAfter a solid year-to-date rally in GOOGL stock (up 27.2%), Jefferies expects continued rise but at a gradual pace due to high expectations following robust Q1 performance and above historical average valuation levels.\n\nAlphabet will announce its Q2 2024 results on July 23. Wall Street expects Alphabet’s Q2 EPS to rise 27% to $1.83.\n\nWall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on GOOGL stock based on 33 Buys and six Holds. The average GOOGL stock price target of $202.89 indicates 14.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion\n\nWall Street is bullish on the long-term growth potential of the top three cloud computing players, driven by the continued transition of enterprises to the cloud and AI-related tailwinds. Currently, they see slightly higher upside potential in Amazon stock than in Microsoft and Alphabet shares. Aside from the attractive growth potential of the AWS business, analysts’ optimism about Amazon is also backed by the company’s leadership in e-commerce and its growing advertising business.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "Prime Day is always a big shopping event for Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), as the e-commerce giant lures shoppers to its site with deals. This year's shopping event set a record for the company, with Adobe Analytics projecting shoppers spent approximately $14.2 billion on its platform during the two-day event.\n\nLet's look at the strong showing Amazon is seeing with Prime Day and what that could mean for the stock.\n\nA record Prime Day\n\nApproximately $14.2 billion in sales on Amazon's platform would be about an 11% increase from 2023 levels, according to Adobe. That would represent a nice acceleration from the 6% growth Adobe estimated that consumers spent on its platform during its Prime Day event last year. Amazon does not disclose its actual Prime Day event sales, but did say it was a record.\n\nSpending per order, meanwhile, saw a nice uptick, according to Numerator. It noted that the average order on Amazon was $57.97 compared to $54.05 last year. That's an over 7% increase.\n\nBack-to-school spending was particularly strong, up 216% according to Adobe. This is good news for Amazon and other retailers, as it shows the consumer is back. Outside of Christmas and the winter holidays, back-to-school shopping is one of the most important shopping periods for retailers.\n\nThe Amazon Prime Day shopping event is estimated to represent about 1% to 2% of the company's global sales, according CFRA Research.\n\nFor its first quarter, Amazon saw a 7% increase in its online store sales to $54.7 billion. Meanwhile, it forecast overall revenue to grow by 7% to 11% in the second quarter. As such, a successful Prime Day, which is part of its third quarter, could help the company see accelerating growth in the back half of the year, if this is a sign of a strengthening consumer.\n\nIt is notable that the other parts of Amazon's business outside of online sales are growing more quickly. For example, AWS revenue grew 17% in Q1 to $25 billion, while advertising services revenue jumped 24% to $11.8 billion and third-party services climbed 16% to $11.8 billion. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs now a good opportunity to buy the stock?\n\nAmazon trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 41 times. While not cheap per say, it is below where the stock has typically traded at over the past few years. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt the same time, Amazon has not seen a strengthening consumer environment in quite some time. Record Amazon Prime Day sales don't necessarily by themselves mean the consumer is strengthening, but year-over-year retail sales for June were the strongest since last fall, according to the National Retail Federation. Meanwhile, containership port volumes saw their biggest jump in two years in May, which is an indication that retailers are expecting sales to increase.\n\nStory continues\n\nA strengthening consumer environment combined with the opportunity the company has with artificial intelligence (AI) within its Amazon Web Services cloud computing business and other businesses should bode well both for continued and potentially accelerating growth for Amazon. If this proves to be the case, and there are certainly hints that this is occurring, then now looks like it could be a very good time to buy the stock before other investors catch on.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon has proven to be willing to make big bets and spend money to come out on top. With AI being a huge opportunity and the company still the dominant player in e-commerce, the stock is a solid option for investors over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other profitable stocks.\n\nThe stock market has a long history of generating wealth for investors. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, studying successful companies can provide valuable insights. By understanding the factors that drive these companies' growth, we can potentially make better investment decisions in the future. It's important to remember that investing involves risk, and conducting thorough research is crucial before making any investment decisions.\n\nInvestors frequently overlook revenue in favor of profitability when evaluating stocks. Profit is what's left over after all costs are paid. Revenue is the total amount of goods and services sold. Because it is essential to determine if a business is a growth stock or a value one, profitability is important. To learn more about growth stocks, see 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024. You can also discover some undervalued value stocks by reading 11 Oversold Value Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThe U.S. stock market has seen several major events since 2000, including the dot-com boom and fall, the 2008 financial crisis, a tech boom with trillion-dollar values, and the 2020 pandemic crisis. The S&P's broader market index produced double-digit yearly returns thirteen times between 2003 and 2023. This strong performance can be largely attributed to the phenomenal returns generated by technology stocks, which significantly boosted the overall return of the large-cap market.\n\nAccording to a recent estimate, the aggregate market value of the top seven S&P 500 corporations is almost double that of the Japanese market. The head of topical research and global economics, Jim Reid, cautions that this is the most concentrated the US market has ever been.\n\nAs interest in growth stocks increases due to the hype surrounding AI and the prospect of rate cuts, these companies' fortunes are expected to soar. To satisfy market demand, businesses are making significant investments in AI. AI's impact on altering work patterns was highlighted by Satya Nadella du. According to them,:\n\n“A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo identify the most profitable stocks, we looked at the 20-year annualized returns of publicly traded companies in the US market from 2004 to 2024 and selected and ranked those with the highest 20-year annualized returns.\n\nStory continues\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\n20-Year Annualized Return: 23.84%\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has emerged as one of the most profitable stocks of the last 20 years, transforming from an online bookstore to a global e-commerce and technology giant. The company operates in various sectors, including e-commerce, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and digital streaming. An investment of $1,000 in Amazon stock 20 years ago would be worth approximately $90,500 today, representing an annualized return of 24%.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) achieved a 13% increase in net sales to $143.3 billion in Q1 2024 compared to $127.4 billion in Q1 2023. Key growth drivers included AWS, which saw a 17% revenue increase to $25.04 billion driven by expanding cloud adoption and AI capabilities. Advertising revenue surged 24% to $11.8 billion, bolstered by sponsored ads and integration into Prime Video. Retail net sales grew 13%, benefiting from enhanced delivery speeds and product variety. The company's profitability also soared, with net income reaching $10.4 billion in Q1 2024, up from $3.2 billion which was fueled by effective cost management and growth in high-margin segments like AWS and advertising.\n\nAWS achieved a $100 billion annual revenue run rate, underscoring its dominance in cloud computing. Amazon anticipates Q2 2024 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, reflecting continued investment in AI infrastructure to sustain customer demand and drive long-term expansion.\n\nIn Q1 2024, there were around 302 hedge fund holders in the company, up from 293 in the previous quarter.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) recently topped $2 trillion in market cap for the first time. It wasn't that long ago that it surpassed $1 trillion, and it might not be too long before it gets to $3 trillion. That implies a gain of 50% on Amazon's current stock price, which is already up 27% this year, and it has strong growth drivers.\n\nHere are three reasons investors should consider buying shares right now.\n\n1. Its opportunities in cloud computing\n\nWhen ChatGPT burst onto the scene almost two years ago, Amazon didn't take too long to follow up with announcing its own investments in generative artificial intelligence (AI). It has since launched a blitz of AI services taking its cloud services division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), to a whole new level.\n\nAmazon's generative AI falls into three categories that are meant to target the full gamut of AWS clients. Large companies with tons of their own data and resources can create their own foundation models (FM), which are the foundation of generative AI. They're trained on so much data that they begin to \"generate\" and appear creative, hence the name.\n\nCompanies that don't have as much of a need for customization can use Amazon's FMs and large-language models (LLM). And clients that rely on tech software or support instead of on-site developers can use several applications that Amazon has built for smaller companies.\n\nFor example, many clients, including big names like Datadog and Toyota Motor, are using Amazon Q, which creates and tests codes, transfers code between languages, and generally follows coding instructions.\n\nThe opportunities here look endless. Management has said that customers are finally nearing the end of their cost-optimization efforts, which have led to a deceleration in AWS sales growth.  And between larger budgets and Amazon's cutting-edge AI developments, AWS should be able to grow its lead in cloud computing. Expect more exciting developments in this area.\n\n2. A shift in advertising\n\nAdvertising is going through some major shifts away from traditional media like print and broadcast television toward digital media and ad-supported streaming.\n\nA modern iteration of advertising is the company's work with third-party vendors. Not only do they pay a slice of their earnings to Amazon for hosting their products and often fulfilling their deliveries, but they can also increase their chances of being found and making a sale by paying Amazon even more money to feature their products in different ways.\n\nThis is another way Amazon is benefiting from its investments in AI. It offers third-party vendors the unmatched opportunity to leverage its platform and data to reach buyers for their products. Amazon recently joined Netflix and Walt Disney in launching an ad-supported streaming tier, and it's using the same advertising model that it uses on its website to make money through streaming.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvertisers are clearly buying in. Advertising has been Amazon's fastest-growing segment for a while, even though advertisers as a group have been pulling back on spending in general. Ad sales increased 24% year over year in the 2024 first quarter. It's also a high-margin business that contributes to profitability.\n\n3. Don't forget e-commerce\n\nWith all the talk about generative AI, it could be easy to forget that e-commerce still accounts for the bulk of Amazon's business. And it's not taking that lightly.\n\nManagement continues to upgrade its delivery and logistics system with improved fulfilment capabilities, like its new regional fulfillment network, which it changed from a national network last year, and robotics that can handle quick and precise activity.\n\nIt's also using its large data stores and AI to improve speed. In the first quarter, almost 60% of orders in the top 60 U.S. metropolitan areas were delivered within 48 hours, and that number reached up to 75% for some international locations like London and Tokyo.\n\nIt's still working out best plans for the new regional network and expects it to become even more efficient over the next few years. As customers get more orders faster, they turn to Amazon for more of their essentials, reinforcing and expanding its lead in global e-commerce.\n\nThe future looks very bright right now for Amazon in both the near term and the long term. Don't think too long about how much the stock will grow this year or whether it can reach a $3 trillion market capitalization. Buy and hold -- and thank yourself later.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Costco: Buy This Unstoppable Growth Stock Instead",
        "content": "Costco Wholesale's (NASDAQ: COST) stock price is up roughly 203% over the last five years, a result that puts this retailer on par with some of the most prominent names in tech. That's especially impressive considering that direct retail rivals like Walmart(NYSE: WMT) and Target saw share price gains of just 82% and 79% over that same period. While this established company operates relatively conservatively and gives off the impression of being a value stock, it's more accurate to label Costco as a growth stock.\n\nIt's probably also fair to say Costco is a relatively expensive growth stock at the moment. While its five-year stock price run-up has been excellent for long-term shareholders, it has also raised Costco's valuation to the point where would-be new buyers might want to be wary. COST PE Ratio Chart\n\nCostco's price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios are significantly higher than their 10-year averages, suggesting the stock isn't cheap on an investment basis (although I could just as well argue the stock price and company performance still warrant the expensive valuation). If you are on the side who thinks it's not a good buy right now, it might be worth considering alternative investment options.\n\nInvesting in growth is kinda cheap right now at Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) might just be that alternative. Amazon's business is back in growth mode and investor interest has exploded over the last year, with its share price up 39%. Amazon delivered multiple quarters of impressive earnings, boosted by easing inflation, successful cost-cutting measures, a thriving cloud business, a growing digital ad business, and an expanding role in artificial intelligence (AI). AMZN PE Ratio Chart\n\nA look at Amazon's basic metrics shows its P/E is well below its 10-year average, while its P/S is just a bit higher than average. Admittedly, Amazon has had some outlier quarters (especially regarding P/E) that skew the long-term average somewhat, so it's understandable that some might consider this an unfair comparison. But even at shorter intervals, these metrics suggest Amazon's stock might be considered a bargain compared to Costco.\n\nOne metric that might offer a more fair comparison is the PEG ratio. The PEG ratio tells you how expensive a stock is relative to its growth rate. The PEG takes the P/E and divides that by the expected EPS growth rate over a set number of years (often five years). A PEG ratio of 1 indicates a stock trades at a fair price. Anything figure under 1 suggests a bargain, the higher the figure is above 1, the less of a bargain a stock is. Looking at the chart below, Amazon is the clear bargain here.\n\nStory continues AMZN PEG Ratio Chart\n\nBetter exposure to high-growth markets\n\nCostco is exceptionally good at the retail aspects of its business. It has differentiated itself in the market with wholesale pricing and its membership model. But that part of its business tends to be low-margin and it can be affected by macroeconomic headwinds. Meanwhile, Costco's fastest-growing segment of late is e-commerce. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended in May), its online retail division posted revenue gains of 21% year over year, while its other segments delivered growth of between 6% and 8%. So e-commerce has the potential to be a growth market for Costco.\n\nBut if e-commerce is where the growth is, what better way to invest in that space than Amazon? The company holds a dominant 38% share of the U.S. e-commerce sector. Walmart is No. 2 for share with just 6% of the market.\n\nAmazon is working to maintain (and potentially even grow) its share of e-commerce by investing in artificial intelligence (AI) to create a smart shopping assistant for its site, to better track shopping trends, to better target advertising for itself and its third-party sellers, to improve recommended products for shoppers, and to optimize shipping logistics. It is well-equipped to do this because the various investments Amazon has made over the years to help its e-commerce business have turned into huge businesses all their own.\n\nDiversifying its business to maintain growth\n\nThanks to its now highly diverse business, Amazon is tapping into some of the most lucrative areas of tech. In addition to e-commerce, Amazon has a highly profitable cloud division with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Among its various services, AWS operates data centers worldwide, delivering cloud solutions to a long list of clientele. Given the projected growth in AI, which relies on data centers to do what it does, AWS will continue to see outsized demand for its services.\n\nAWS already contributes the most of any of its segments to Amazon's bottom line. Amazon has been using those funds to invest heavily in the budding AI market and to expand its growing digital advertising segment. These complimentary business segments keep the growth engine running.\n\nIn the first quarter, AWS' revenue increased 17% year over year. That strong growth was topped by the Advertising services segment, which saw 24% year-over-year growth. Despite accounting for just 17.5% of net sales last quarter, AWS was responsible for over 61% of the company's Q1 operating income.\n\nRecent reports point to Costco potentially expanding into digital advertising, using its shopper data to offer targeted ads on its e-commerce site and elsewhere. Amazon is already thriving in the digital ad market. As mentioned, advertising services revenue jumped 24% in Q1. Part of that jump can be attributed to the introduction of ads on its streaming platform Prime Video. Streaming advertising is a relatively new market, but with 22% of the video-on-demand market, Prime Video is well positioned to continue boosting earnings and attracting new advertisers.\n\nAmazon is far outpacing Costco in financial growth\n\nAs the table below illustrates, Amazon's financial metrics performed well over the last five years, delivering triple-digit growth in quarterly revenue and operating income. Costco's comparable metrics trended up at a respectable rate over that time, and it even beat Amazon on free cash flow growth. AMZN Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe difference between the two, including Amazon's faster growth rate, is tied to the tech giant's more diverse business model. Cloud computing and digital advertising (and eventually its AI efforts) are fueling Amazon's next stage of growth and will likely continue to do so well into the future as these industries develop.\n\nBecause Amazon's business keeps growing at double-digit rates, it's not too late for long-term investors to get in on the action and profit from its sizeable opportunities. Given its better valuation, Amazon is a growth stock worth considering instead of Costco right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Computers around the world failed on Friday, crippling businesses and shutting down everything from airlines and television networks to emergency and hospital services.\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike (CRWD) said an error in one of its software updates for Microsoft’s (MSFT) Windows knocked systems offline.\n\nThe incident sent companies and government agencies across the globe into chaos, as they were unable to access the computer programs necessary for continued operations.\n\nNew York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center announced it was pausing the start of any new procedures that required anesthesia while airlines, including Delta (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL), were forced to ground flights. The UK’s Sky News network couldn’t broadcast live news, bankers at JPMorgan couldn’t log into their systems, and 911 services in Alaska went offline.\n\nThe cascade of failures at such a wide array of organizations left some questioning how a single update could topple so many businesses and agencies in such a short amount of time.\n\nThe problem, however, is a direct result of the way our current internet infrastructure operates. Travelers wait during an outage at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday, July 19, 2024, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Jason Dearen) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe web is powered by a handful of major players including Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL). But beyond those are smaller but no less important companies that plug their software into those tech giants' platforms. CrowdStrike offers, among other things, cybersecurity programs for Windows that companies access via the cloud.\n\nBecause so many organizations rely on Windows — and because CrowdStrike has become such a mega player in the cybersecurity space — a massive number of key businesses, government organizations, and financial institutions use both companies' software platforms.\n\nWhen CrowdStrike released an update for its software, companies using Windows systems began experiencing errors, leading to the outage.\n\n“Updates happen an amazing amount of times each day,” explained Gregory Falco, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and systems engineering at the Sibley School Program at Cornell University. “Most of them you don't notice. Some of them are annoying, when things get slower or you have to restart your computer.\n\n“But then,” he added, “sometimes these updates do not play as expected.”\n\nCybersecurity is an integral part of any company that does business over the internet. Hackers are constantly looking for flaws in systems, and cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike continuously release updates to address any potential cracks those hackers can slip through.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompanies, meanwhile, will apply updates as soon as possible to ensure their systems are as safe as possible from potential attacks. And because CrowdStrike’s update went out so quickly, every organization that uses its software was hit by the same error at once. A digital board is down due to the global communications outage caused by CrowdStrike. (Photo by Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images) (Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nSaid Benjamin Lee, a professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania: “Any computer system that does not install the update will be at risk of attack with a known vulnerability. This is why so many businesses, financial firms, and other organizations have — at the exact same time — installed this CrowdStrike software update and suffered the consequences.”\n\nIt’s that combination of a small number of companies running the internet and businesses needing to keep their cybersecurity software updated at all times that pushed millions of computers to their breaking points on Friday.\n\nCrowdStrike has released a fix for its software and is actively pushing it out to customers. But that doesn’t mean every company will get back online right away.\n\n“Because of the way in which the update has been deployed, recovery options for affected machines are manual and thus limited,” explained Forrester principal analyst Andras Cser. “Administrators must attach a physical keyboard to each affected system, boot into Safe Mode, remove the compromised CrowdStrike update, and then reboot.”\n\nIn other words, it could be some time before the entire outage is fully resolved.\n\nFor now, IT administrators around the world will be working around the clock to get their systems back up and running. As for the average person, there’s nothing to do but sit back and wait. And unless internet companies dramatically change how they operate, something like this will inevitably happen again.

Parent company Softbank Group Corp (OTC:SFTBF) (OTC:SFTBY) aims to invest significantly in data centers using its AI chips and renewable energy.\n\nAMD CFO Jean Hu recently suggested a potential entry into next-generation AI PCs.\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic about Arm Holdings, citing strong licensing interest and royalty potential as essential growth factors. They also highlight Arm’s opportunities in the AI and data center sectors.\n\nArm Holdings stock rose by 158% over the past 12 months as AI integrated into smartphones. The ARM (Acorn RISC Machine) architecture powers 99% of the world’s smartphone CPU cores. Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of Arm’s major customers.\n\nArm’s clients choose the company over Intel Corp’s (NASDAQ:INTC) x86 technology primarily for its efficiency and widespread adoption. Arm’s architecture enables chips to consume less power compared to x86, making it ideal for mobile devices and other power-sensitive applications, CNBC reported in 2023.\n\nKey clients like Apple, Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, MicrosoftCorp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NvidiaCorp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and QualcommInc (NASDAQ:QCOM) leverage Arm’s technology to build custom silicon tailored to their specific needs.\n\nARM Holdings has a consensus price target of $112.17 based on the ratings of 25 analysts.\n\nARM Price Action: Arm shares traded higher by 3.47% at $163.83 at the last check on Friday.\n\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article What's Going On With Arm Stock On Friday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Netflix is doubling down on India as its competitors back away",
        "content": "Netflix (NFLX) is all in on a country that's been historically difficult for its competitors: India.\n\nThe country brought in the second-highest net subscriber additions for Netflix in the second quarter and was also the third highest in terms of revenue growth, the company said on Thursday.\n\nThe streaming giant credited its localized content strategy and product mix as key drivers to attracting, retaining, and monetizing members in the area.\n\nAlthough Netflix did not disclose exact subscriber or revenue figures for the Indian market, revenue for its Asia-Pacific region jumped to $1.05 billion in the quarter from $919 million in the year-ago period.\n\n\"What's going on in the quarter has been this ongoing build,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the company's earnings call. He called out the success of shows like \"Heeramandi,\" which was created and directed by celebrated Indian filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali.\n\n\"It's our biggest drama series to date in India,\" Sarandos said, adding original films and licensed films like Kiran Rao’s \"Laapataa Ladies\" and Vikas Bahl's \"Shaitaan\" have also outperformed in the country.\n\n\"We pick [the content] well, we program well, we improve the product mix, the market fit. We improve engagement. We grow members. We grow revenue. It's the same formula everywhere else,\" he said. \"There's certainly plenty of room to grow in India, as long as we keep thrilling our audiences there.\" A woman stands next to a logo of Netflix during an event in Mumbai, India, Feb. 29, 2024. (REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nIndia, which boasts a population of more than 1.4 billion, has become a media hotspot, with projected TV and streaming-related revenue growth of 11% in 2024. That compares with much more muted growth in other developing countries, according to analytics firm Ampere Analysis.\n\nBut the market has been a hard one for US media companies to crack. First, it’s difficult for companies to create a direct relationship with Indian consumers, who largely rely on mobile operators to gain access to streaming services due to limited broadband infrastructure.\n\nIndian consumers also have a relatively low willingness to pay for streaming platforms thanks to free, ad-supported models from local content providers and rampant piracy.\n\nRecently, two of Netflix's competitors scaled back on ambitions there. Disney (DIS) said in February that it would effectively give up its ownership of the network Star India by merging it with Indian telecom giant Reliance Industries. It will hold a minority stake in the entity.\n\nTwo weeks later, Paramount Global (PARA) said it was selling its 13% stake in Indian media company Viacom18 to Reliance for about $517 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Netflix and even fellow tech giant Amazon (AMZN) — both of which boast significantly higher free cash flow levels compared to their legacy media counterparts — have been able to make inroads with higher-income Indian consumers by offering localized content.\n\n\"The real story in India has been the growth of the middle- to higher-income consumer,\" said Mihir Shah, vice president of research firm Media Partners Asia, told Yahoo Finance in March. \"That's a segment which many of the tech platforms [like] Netflix and Prime Video are really dominating.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon",
        "content": "As the second-quarter earnings season approaches, key companies worldwide will provide insights into sector performance. Investors will be particularly focused on updates from some of the 'Magnificent Seven', which will reveal whether the artificial intelligence (AI) trend continues.\n\nThe Mag 7 stocks have endured a challenging period, with the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) major players—Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and AmazonAJa (AMZN)—experiencing a dramatic decline in market capitalisation. Over recent sessions, these tech giants have collectively shed $1.128tn in market value, marking the largest such loss since May 2022.\n\nWill the upcoming earnings reports show strong performance or a lack of momentum? Here’s what to watch for:\n\nTesla (TSLA) — Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nTesla shares have experienced a dramatic surge this month, with the company's stock price surging by 33%. This increase has propelled Tesla's market valuation by $209bn in the first eight trading days of the month alone, surpassing the combined market value of European automotive giants Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Stellantis, which stands at $198bn.\n\nThis surge cannot be attributed to Tesla’s first-quarter financial results, which revealed the lowest quarterly profits since Q2 2021, diminishing cash flow, and rising inventory levels. The second-quarter production and delivery figures, released earlier this month, indicated a 14% year-on-year decline in vehicle production and a 5% drop in unit sales, although this may have contributed to reducing some of the inventory backlog.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“Quite what inspired this romp is hard to divine, barring ongoing investor enthusiasm for companies that are perceived as AI (and autonomous driving) plays, Elon Musk’s courtroom victories at Tesla and X and ongoing hopes surrounding the Cybertruck, the supercharger network and the ride-hailing app,” Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: How to invest in AI as the rally continues\n\nFor the third quarter, the current consensus is sales of $25.7bn and that would signify a return to growth in the top line of some 10% year-on-year.\n\nAnalysts and investors are also paying close attention to Tesla’s revenue composition. In the first quarter of 2024, energy storage, energy generation, and other business lines contributed 19% to total revenues, up from 10% in the same period in 2022.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) fell to $0.37 in Q1, but analysts expect a rebound to $0.62 in Q2, though this still marks a one-third decrease compared to the same period last year. The consensus EPS forecast for Q3 stands at $0.63.\n\nAJ Bell also highlighted Tesla's strong financial position, with a net cash reserve of $21.5bn. Although a few quarters of weak cash flow are not overly concerning, shareholders will be looking for improvements in this area as an indicator of higher profitability and a more streamlined balance sheet through inventory reduction.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) — Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July*\n\nMicrosoft Corp is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, July 30, with analysts from Bank of America (BofA) forecasting potential revenue upside for the period.\n\nWall Street's consensus projects Microsoft to announce revenue of $64.2bn and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.90 for Q4. However, BofA analysts anticipate a 1% increase from their estimate of $64bn, indicating a 14% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by the robust performance of Azure, a premium mix in Office E3/E5, Copilot’s initial success, and a stabilising PC/Windows market.\n\nAzure’s growth is expected to remain balanced across sustained AI and core workloads, translating into a projected growth rate of 31.5%, slightly above the base expectation of 30.5%. The early traction of Copilot is also anticipated to bolster Office growth, maintaining its current valuation multiple.\n\nIn the more personal computing (MPC) segment, analysts foresee a $50m increase over the $15.5bn estimate, attributed to stronger-than-expected PC shipments.\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, BofA analysts predict continued double-digit revenue growth fuelled by ongoing strength in Azure and Office. However, they anticipate a 100 basis point decrease in margins due to increased capital expenditures driving higher cost of sales.\n\n“In an upside scenario, we believe the Office business could achieve 20% growth by Q1 fiscal 2026,” the analysts noted.\n\nBofA has reiterated its ‘buy’ rating for Microsoft and raised the price target to $510 from $480, citing the potential for higher Office growth in fiscal 2025. They acknowledge that the current share price reflects a considerable amount of near-term upside.\n\n\"Microsoft is set to deliver fourth quarter results at some point next week. Investors will be hoping to see another strong showing from the cloud business, Azure. Analysts are looking for top line growth of 19.5% from Azure, which looks very achievable. Back in April, management said cloud-AI demand was outstripping supply. Despite a mammoth effort to build out compute, that supply/demand imbalance is likely to help underpin Azure growth for some time yet,\" Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\n*Date not confirmed\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) — Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nThe parent company of Google (GOOGL), is set to announce its second-quarter earnings, with analysts predicting robust performance driven by its Android platform and continued momentum in its search and cloud businesses. The company's expanding generative AI capabilities are also anticipated to have significantly contributed to its positive results.\n\nFor Q2, the Zacks Consensus Estimate places Alphabet's revenues at $70.55bn, reflecting a 13.7% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at $1.85 per share, marking a 28.5% rise from the previous year's reported figures. This estimate has seen a slight upward revision of 0.5% over the past week.\n\nHowever, rising litigation issues and associated expenses remain areas of concern for the tech giant.\n\nOne key risk is the US Department of Justice's so-called adtech trial, in which the government charges that Google monopolises key digital advertising technologies, collectively referred to as the adtech stack. Website publishers depend on that stack to sell ads and advertisers rely on it to buy ads.\n\n\"As Alphabet’s second quarter earnings approach, the M&A rumour mill is swirling. If reports are true and Alphabet is in talks to buy cybersecurity firm Wizz for $23bn, it would mark a major move to beef up its security offering. Wizz has successfully taken on the likes of Microsoft and Palo Alto in the cyber space, taking market share over the past couple of years. Perhaps the biggest hurdle could be a regulator that’s been a blocker for many large-scale deals – though a new team in the White House later this year could help things in that regard,\" Britzman said.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\nBank of America Securities analyst Justin Post remains bullish on the integration of Google’s AI chatbot.\n\n“We remain positive on growing Gemini integration across [the] Google ecosystem and think [the] broader rollout of AI overviews will likely help drive higher usage, while AI integration can increase monetisation across Google,” Post said. “Moreover, with a focus on expense management, we think year-over-year margin growth in 2024 will be a bright spot and potential EPS upside driver.”\n\nPost affirmed a buy rating and $200 price target for Alphabet.\n\nBMO Capital Markets raised its their price target from $215 to $222, driven by potential gains in YouTube revenue.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) — Reports second-quarter results on Thursday 25 July*\n\nAmazon is in the spotlight with a \"positive\" near-term view, as Morgan Stanley anticipates the e-commerce giant to significantly outperform in its Q2 earnings and provide optimistic guidance for Q3.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts project that Amazon will exceed consensus estimates for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by 17% for Q2 and 10% for Q3. This optimistic forecast is driven by enhanced profitability in North America tetail and accelerating growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"North America retail profitability and the accelerating growth of AWS are key factors behind our projections,\" the analysts noted.\n\nAs Amazon continues to leverage its robust retail operations and expand its cloud computing dominance, investors are looking forward to a strong financial performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIt is also a top pick for JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth both in the near and long term.\n\nHe anticipates a near-term acceleration in AWS, forecasting a 20% growth in Q4 2024. This growth is expected to be driven by easing optimisations, new workload migrations, and the ramping up of GenAI monetisation.\n\nRead more: UK to lose half a million millionaires by 2028\n\nAnmuth also projects a 190 basis point expansion in Amazon's North America operating income (OI) margin in 2024, supported by enhancements in shipping and inventory placement, increased automation, and stronger advertising revenue. Amazon's free cash flow is expected to reach $66bn in 2024 and $86bn in 2025.\n\nFor Q2, investors are looking for net sales to fall between $148bn and $150bn, with operating income ranging from $14bn to $15bn or more.\n\n\"There was also a strong showing from both the e-commerce and advertising segments over the first quarter, something investors will be keen to see continue. But markets were a little unhappy with the second quarter profit guidance of $10-14bn, anything toward the top end of that range will likely be met with a positive reaction,\" Britzman said.\n\n* Date not confirmed as the company might decide to announce results on 1 August.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 22 July\n\nMONY (MONY.L)\n\nAscential (ASCL.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nNXP Semiconductor (NXPI)\n\nTuesday 23 July\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nCompass (CPG.L)\n\nMitie (MTO.L)\n\nSK Hynix (HY9H.MU)\n\nLVMH (MC.PA)\n\nASM International (ASM.AS)\n\nThales (HO.PA)\n\nLindt (LISN.SW)\n\nAlfa Laval (ALFA.L)\n\nLogitech (LOGNE.SW)\n\nNorsk Hydro (NHY.OL)\n\nAkzo Nobel (AKZOY)\n\nRandstad (RSH.DU)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nCoca-Cola (KO)\n\nSpotify (SPOT)\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\n\nGE Aerospace (GE)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nMondelez (MDLZ)\n\n3M (MMM)\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\nMattel (MAT)\n\nWednesday 24 July\n\nReckitt Benckiser (RKT.L)\n\nUNITE (UTG.L)\n\nRHI Magnesita (RHIM.L)\n\nBreedon (BREE.L)\n\nAston Martin Lagonda (AML.L)\n\nPrimary Health Properties (PHP.L)\n\nFresnillo (FRES.L)\n\nEasyJet (EZJ.L)\n\nOxford Nanopore (ONT.L)\n\nIberdrola (IBE.MC)\n\nBNP Paribas (BNP.PA)\n\nEquinor (EQNR)\n\nBanco Santander (BNC.L)\n\nUniCredit (UCG.MI)\n\nKering (KER.PA)\n\nDeutsche Boerse (DB1.DE)\n\nOrange (ORA.PA)\n\nMichelin (ML.PA)\n\nRepsol (REP.MC)\n\nMoncler (MOV.F)\n\nJerónimo Martins (JMT.LS)\n\nCarrefour (CA.PA)\n\nSSAB (SSAB-A.ST)\n\nKindred (UNBA.MU)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nFord (F)\n\nNewmont (NEM)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nInternational Paper (IP)\n\nThursday 25 July\n\nRELX (REL.L)\n\nLloyds (LLOY.L)\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nRentokil Initial (RTO.L)\n\nInforma (INF.L)\n\nCentrica (CNA.L)\n\nCentamin (CEY.L)\n\nHowden Joinery (HWDN.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nITV (ITV.L)\n\nHammerson (HMSO.L)\n\nVodafone (VOD.L)\n\nBT (BT-A.L)\n\nBritvic (BVIC.L)\n\nWorkspace (WKP.L)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nNestlé (NESNE.SW)\n\nHermès (RMS.PA)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nChristian Dior (CDI.PA)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nEssilorLuxxotica (EL.PA)\n\nStellantis (STLA)\n\nENI (ENI.F)\n\nSt. Gobain (GOB.MU)\n\nRenault (RNO.PA)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nLinde (LIN)\n\nHoneywell (HON)\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC)\n\nKeurig-Dr Pepper (KDP)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV)\n\nBaxter (BAX)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nLiberty Global (LBTYK)\n\nHarley-Davidson (HOG)\n\nFriday 26 July\n\nSEGRO (SGRO.L)\n\nIMI (IMI.L)\n\nRightmove (RMV.L)\n\nDrax (DRX.L)\n\nNEC (6701.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nAir Liquide (AI.PA)\n\nMercedes Benz (MBG.HA)\n\nHolcim (HOLN.SW)\n\nBASF (BASA.BE)\n\nCapGemini (CGM.HM)\n\nAlstom (ALO.PA)\n\nVallourec (VK.PA)\n\nKone Cranes (KNCRY)\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nBristol Meyers Squibb (BMY)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Are Retail-Wholesale Stocks Lagging  Amazon.com (AMZN) This Year?",
        "content": "Investors interested in Retail-Wholesale stocks should always be looking to find the best-performing companies in the group. Has Amazon (AMZN) been one of those stocks this year? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Retail-Wholesale peers, we might be able to answer that question.\n\nAmazon is one of 210 individual stocks in the Retail-Wholesale sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #11 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proven model that highlights a variety of stocks with the right characteristics to outperform the market over the next one to three months. The system emphasizes earnings estimate revisions and favors companies with improving earnings outlooks. Amazon is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nOver the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMZN's full-year earnings has moved 15.1% higher. This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend.\n\nBased on the latest available data, AMZN has gained about 20.9% so far this year. At the same time, Retail-Wholesale stocks have gained an average of 11.8%. This means that Amazon is outperforming the sector as a whole this year.\n\nOne other Retail-Wholesale stock that has outperformed the sector so far this year is Groupon (GRPN). The stock is up 31.9% year-to-date.\n\nFor Groupon, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 106.5% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nLooking more specifically, Amazon belongs to the Internet - Commerce industry, a group that includes 36 individual stocks and currently sits at #52 in the Zacks Industry Rank. Stocks in this group have gained about 16.7% so far this year, so AMZN is performing better this group in terms of year-to-date returns. Groupon is also part of the same industry.\n\nGoing forward, investors interested in Retail-Wholesale stocks should continue to pay close attention to Amazon and Groupon as they could maintain their solid performance.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned -1.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has gained 0.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.02 per share, indicating a change of +61.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.58 points to a change of +57.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.80 indicates a change of +26.6% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for AMZN _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $148.54 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $638.24 billion and $709.91 billion estimates indicate +11% and +11.2% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $143.31 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.5%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $0.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $142.53 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +36.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nAmazon.com's estimated fair value is US$309 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Amazon.com is estimated to be 40% undervalued based on current share price of US$184 Our fair value estimate is 40% higher than Amazon.com's analyst price target of US$221\n\nHow far off is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nThe Model\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$77.7b US$103.9b US$121.0b US$140.8b US$155.6b US$168.1b US$178.7b US$187.9b US$196.0b US$203.3b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x20 Analyst x10 Analyst x6 Analyst x4 Est @ 10.45% Est @ 8.03% Est @ 6.33% Est @ 5.15% Est @ 4.32% Est @ 3.74% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1%  US$72.5k US$90.5k US$98.4k US$106.9k US$110.2k US$111.1k US$110.3k US$108.2k US$105.4k US$102.1k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.0t\n\nStory continues\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$203b× (1 + 2.4%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.4%) = US$4.4t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.4t÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$2.2t\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.2t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$184, the company appears quite good value at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.034. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Amazon.com\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\nThreat\n\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

        "content": "Amazon is getting more serious about its return-to-office mandate—and it’s now having one-on-one chats with employees who haven’t spent enough time in the building.\n\n“Over a year ago we asked employees to start coming into the office three or more days per week because we believe it would yield the best long-term results for our customers, business, and culture. And it has,” Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement.\n\nMunoz added that since the tech giant announced its return-to-office policy in February last year most employees are “in the office more frequently.” However, it’s having words with those who are not.\n\n“Now that it’s been more than a year, we’re starting to speak directly with employees who haven’t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues,\" the statement concluded.\n\nA coffee badging crackdown?\n\nAccording to leaked Slack messages viewed by Business Insider, Amazon employees across different teams have been set a minimum-hour obligation on in-office days. Some teams have reportedly been told that a minimum of two hours per visit is required to count as office attendance, others six.\n\n\"Remember when we were measured on metrics that actually mattered?\" one employee reportedly complained on Slack.\n\n\"Could I badge into this door 3 days per week and save myself from having to commute to the office?\" another person reportedly wrote on Slack, in reference to a back room door which doesn’t track a persons exit.\n\nThe toughened stance comes as research shows that workers are increasingly dodging in-office mandates by scanning their badge so it looks like they came to the office, before swiftly returning home—a practice known as coffee badging.\n\nAmazon refused to confirm where coffee badging was an issue when asked by Fortune.\n\nHowever, the recent crackdown comes after a year of tug-of-war with Amazon employees over where they work.\n\nLast year, around 30,000 employees signed a petition protesting the company’s in-office mandate, and more than 1,800 pledged to walk out from their jobs to take a stand.\n\nBut the tech giant has since retaliated by warning workers that if they don't start showing up, they'll be shipped out: Amazon managers have been given the green light to block promotions and even fire employees who fail to show face three days a week in the office.\n\n“If you can’t disagree and commit, it’s probably not going to work out for you at Amazon,\" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompanies are cracking down on RTO mandates\n\nAmazon is not the only firm to take a tougher stance on its in-office policy: Dell and Google have both started proving they aren’t all talk when it comes to their RTO mandates by formally tracking badge swipes.\n\nWhat’s more, a recent WFH Research study co-authored by workplace guru Nick Bloom found that frustrated managers are increasingly likely to take action against insubordinate remote workers.\n\nNearly a quarter of managers revealed that employees face being fired for not following RTO mandates—up from 11% in 2022. Meanwhile, about 17% of respondents they’ll do “nothing” to punish non-compliant employees—down from 34% in 2022.\n\nHowever, firms who issue commute or quit ultimatums to staff risk being left empty-handed if remote-loving employees call their bluff.\n\nAs a result of its aggressive RTO order, the dating platform Grindr lost almost half of its workforce in two weeks, including most of its engineering team, causing the company to reckon with technical issues.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter’s (now X) operations were once put at risk when more workers than expected chose the latter option in Elon Musk’s call to go “hardcore” or quit.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Retailers' early US back-to-school sales hasten peak ocean shipping season",
        "content": "By Lisa Baertlein\n\nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Retailers Walmart, Target and Shein kicked off back-to-school sales early to stop Amazon.com's Prime Day event from siphoning U.S. sales of backpacks and laptops, helping advance the peak ocean shipping season by two months and boost already-high freight rates.\n\n\"It looks like this year, July is in fact the peak of peak (season), instead of the beginning,\" said Stephanie Loomis, Rhenus Logistics' head of ocean freight for the Americas.\n\nRetailers account for roughly half of U.S. container import volumes. The ocean shipping industry handles about 80% of global trade.\n\nGoods are moving earlier than normal since late last year, when Houthi rebel attacks near the Suez Canal trade shortcut forced cargo vessels to take the longer route around Africa. Denmark's A.P. Moller-Maersk, a top container shipping provider, said on Wednesday that Red Sea disruptions have cascaded beyond the hard-hit Far East and Europe trade routes to its entire global network.\n\nNike executives have said they imported to the U.S. shipments of athletic shoes and apparel during the March-May quarter that they originally planned for the June-August quarter. Members of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, who account for 95% of U.S. footwear sales, are among the importers who have accelerated shipments, said Matt Priest, the industry group's CEO.\n\nSome importers have also sped up timelines to beat higher costs from new tariffs on computer chips and electric-vehicle batteries, or to avoid upheavals during labor talks covering dockworkers on the U.S. East Coast and Gulf of Mexico, industry experts said.\n\nThe early demand surge helped propel the off-contract cost of sending a standard 40-foot (12-metre) container of toys, T-shirts or auto steering wheels from Shanghai to New York to nearly $10,000, double the cost in February, according to the Drewry World Container Index.\n\nThat has stoked worries that an extended period of elevated rates could translate into more price increases for inflation-squeezed U.S. shoppers.\n\nHALLOWEEN IN JULY\n\nYear-over-year U.S. container imports grew 11.9% in May and 10.4% in June, according to supply-chain software provider Descartes Systems Group.\n\nThose increases came as major retailers scheduled back-to-school sales earlier to counter Amazon's Prime Day event on Tuesday and Wednesday this week, which the e-commerce giant said was its biggest ever. Amazon pushes its sellers to position inventory for sales events at least a month in advance.\n\n\"Now we're seeing fall fashion, Halloween and year-end holiday products moving through the supply chain,\" said Gene Seroka, executive director of the nation's busiest seaport in Los Angeles.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of those goods are already in stores. Home Depot this week begins selling its outdoor Halloween decor lineup, including \"Skelly\" a 12-foot (3.7-meter) robotic skeleton.\n\nSeroka expects robust imports in July, noting that there are 63 ships en route to the Los Angeles and Long Beach port complex, versus 52 to 55 typically.\n\nLogistics executives are trying to avoid a repeat of the supply-chain upheavals that followed former President Trump's China tariffs, the pandemic's start and the Red Sea attacks, Priest said.\n\n\"These last few years have really created, for lack of a better term, PTSD,\" Priest said, referring to post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nThe early start to peak ocean shipping could also mean an early end to soaring rates that have some shippers fearing a return of record container freight prices.\n\n\"It's possible that we'll see peak demand in July and August, and some easing of demand starting in September,\" said Judah Levine, head of research at Freightos, an international freight booking and payments platform.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Arriana McLymore and Siddharth Cavale in New York; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Rod Nickel)",

        "title": "This Billionaire Founder Sold Over $13 Billion of His Company's Stock This Year Alone. Should Investors Be Worried?",
        "content": "Some numbers are so big that they're hard to grasp. For example, $13 billion. How do average people understand a figure so immense?\n\nOne way to put this number in context is to view it from a different angle. For example, spending $1 million daily, it would take over 35 years before the total spending topped $13 billion.\n\nAccordingly, $13 billion in stock sales in just one year is an unbelievably gigantic figure. So why is Jeff Bezos selling so much Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock, and should investors be worried? Let's dive into what's going on. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat's happening with Bezos and Amazon stock?\n\nBefore delving into why Bezos is selling, we should first examine how we know about his sales. We know Bezos is selling so much Amazon because the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that people defined as company insiders file forms disclosing transactions in a stock where they have beneficial ownership. Bezos, who owns more than 900 million shares of Amazon, or roughly 9% of Amazon's total outstanding shares, is listed as a beneficial owner in the company's filings.\n\nIn February, Bezos disclosed a series of Amazon stock sales totaling roughly 50 million shares, worth about $8.5 billion. Then, in July, another filing revealed that Amazon's founder and former CEO plans to sell a further 25 million shares worth roughly $5 billion, bringing his yearly total to over $13 billion.\n\nWhy is Bezos selling so much Amazon stock?\n\nTo put Bezos' stock sales into perspective, it's important to consider his net worth. While estimates of his wealth vary, it's likely around $200 billion, making him one of the richest people in the world. So, while his stock sales this year are significant, they still represent less than 10% of his overall net worth.\n\nAs for what Bezos is planning to do with all that cash, there's no way to really know. Some reports indicate Bezos may plan to purchase a professional football team. Others speculate that he will use the money to fund other businesses like his Blue Origin space company. He could simplybe raising cash to diversify his investments or to pay personal expenses.\n\nFor investors, it's important to note that these stock sales are not a sudden or alarming development. On the contrary, they're pretty routine for Bezos.\n\nBezos' stock sales are not a recent trend. He sold $10.2 billion worth of Amazon shares in 2020 and $6.6 billion in 2021. Going back to 1997, Bezos sold or given away about $40 billion worth of Amazon stock.\n\nWhat has evolved over the last 27 years is Bezos' ownership stake in Amazon. Back in 1997, following Amazon's initial public offering (IPO), Bezos controlled about 43% of the company's outstanding shares. As of this writing, he now controls 9%. It's also worth remembering that when Bezos and his former wife Mackenzie Scott divorced in 2019, she received 25% of their Amazon shares with a valuation of $38 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should remember that while large stock sales from company insiders can be eye-popping due to the huge dollar figures involved, they aren't always what they seem. The fact that Bezos' sales have grown so large over the years is a testament to the success of the business he started, which should instill confidence -- not fear -- for Amazon investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

The company operates in 18 countries.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S.-based Amazon ships to customers in over 100 countries and regions and provides a web platform called Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides computing, storage, database, and other web services.\n\nShares of MercadoLibre are up 3.5% year-to-date and 32% over the last 12 months, while Amazon stock has jumped 21% year-to-date and gained 35% over the last year.\n\nWith such a different year-to-date performance that has Amazon outperforming MercadoLibre stock, it may come as a surprise that Amazon is the one trading at a discount to its Latin American counterpart. We’ll compare their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other.\n\nWhile both companies are profitable, the broader online retail industry is not, so an industry comparison of P/E is unhelpful. However, the industry is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.9x, slightly higher than its three-year average of 3.1x.\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI)\n\nAt a P/E of 74.9x and a P/S of 5.6x, MercadoLibre is trading at a premium to Amazon and the online retail industry. However, on a forward basis, the company’s value improves to a P/E of 45.8x. Thus, a bullish view seems appropriate.\n\nThe company has been putting up some tremendous revenue growth, with sales rising 36% year-over-year in the latest quarter to $4.3 billion. Net income rose 76% on a comparable basis on the back of “outstanding results” in Mexico and Brazil, which offset below-inflation growth in its home market of Argentina.\n\nGross merchandise volume rose 30% in both Mexico and Brazil year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. Meanwhile, assets under management increased 90% year-over-year while user count was three times higher year-over-year in Mexico, two times higher in Argentina, and double in Brazil. MercadoLibre’s credit portfolio also grew 46% year-over-year to $4.4 billion, driven by the strong adoption and performance of its credit card offerings.\n\nAll of these trends are truly excellent, as is the company’s long-term share-price growth. MercadoLibre stock is up 167% over the last five years and 1,791% over the last 10, making it one to consider buying and holding for the long term. With the company’s stock starting to slow, this is beginning to look like the early stages of an attractive buy-the-dip opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for MELI Stock?\n\nMercadoLibre has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys, two Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $1,905, the average MercadoLibre stock price target implies upside potential of 17.4%.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAt a P/E of 52.8x and a P/S of 3.3x, Amazon’s valuation looks attractive, especially considering that it’s trading at the lower end of its valuation range since at least 2019. Thus, a bullish view seems appropriate for the long term.\n\nOn a P/E basis, Amazon is trading toward the lower end of its usual range of about 50x to 110x during its profitable periods over the last five years, making it too cheap to ignore. The company continues to rake in the money, although its growth is decelerating because it’s coming on top of a larger and larger base.\n\nIn the latest quarter, Amazon’s revenue rose 12.5% to $143.3 billion, while its net income surged 228.9% to $10.4 billion. The company continues to post thin margins, but its net profit margin nearly tripled to 7.28% in the latest quarter.\n\nFinally, Amazon’s per-share price growth makes it look like one to buy and keep in a portfolio for as long as possible. The stock is up 91% over the last five years and 942% over the last decade. While that’s nowhere near as high as MercadoLibre’s share-price growth because the company is priced as a growth stock, Amazon’s long-term share-price increase should not be ignored, especially at its current valuation.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for AMZN Stock?\n\nAmazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 44 Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $223.05, the average Amazon stock price target implies upside potential of 21.2%.\n\nConclusion: Bullish on MELI and AMZN\n\nE-commerce has long been a popular space on Wall Street, and that’s unlikely to change anytime soon, as industry growth seems virtually endless based on Amazon’s results. Importantly, MercadoLibre is priced like a growth stock, while Amazon is slipping into value territory.\n\nHowever, Amazon is unlikely to fall out of favor in the near term, making it one to buy and hold, in my view. Similarly, MercadoLibre is putting up impressive growth that should keep it a Wall Street darling for quite some time.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Wealthiest Person in Spain",
        "content": "We recently compiled a report on the 29 Wealthiest People in Spain, and in this article, we will be looking at the richest person in Spain.\n\nSpain’s Booming Economy\n\nSpain is the 15th-largest economy in the world and the 6th-largest economy in Europe, with a population of 48.38 million. According to the IMF, the country's GDP is projected to reach $1.65 trillion as of 2024, driven by services, manufacturing, and agriculture sectors. The major driver, however, is the services sector due to Spain's large tourism and financial services industries.\n\nOn July 3, the Ministry of Industry and Tourism for Spain reported that the country received 33 million international travelers in only the first five months of 2024. This was 13.6% higher than tourists received in the same period last year. In May, it was reported that tourists were spending an average of 1,263 euros, which was 7.3% higher than what they spent in May 2023. The daily spending by tourists also averaged 204 euros, which was 8.6% higher than last May. This increased tourism spending suggests a thriving local economy which implies stable economic growth for Spain.\n\nOn June 11, Reuters reported that the strong performance of the tourism sector resulted in the bank of Spain raising its economic growth forecasts to 2.3% for 2024, up from the prior estimate of 1.9%. Simultaneously, IMF also updated its GDP growth projections for Spain to 1.9% from 1.5% for this year.\n\nThe Financial Sector\n\nSpain's financial services industry is also a top contributor to the country's GDP and growth. In 2021, the finance and insurance services industry of Spain contributed about 3.8% to the country's GDP, according to estimates by iBerotech. As of 2022, Banco Santander S.A. ADR (NYSE:SAN) is one of the largest banks in the eurozone. In Europe, it has four banks – in the UK, Portugal, Poland, and Spain, with headquarters in Spain. It also has branches in the Americas. The bank offers private banking, investment banking, and asset management, among other financial services. The annual revenue for Banco Santander S.A. ADR (NYSE:SAN) in 2023 was $49.4 billion and it had $48.39 billion in net interest income.\n\nBanco Santander S.A. ADR (NYSE:SAN) is working on strengthening its consumer finance business and offerings. On June 21, Bloomberg reported an upcoming consumer-finance partnership between Banco Santander S.A. ADR (NYSE:SAN) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) across Europe, citing unnamed sources. The partnership would entail offering easy financing options to its European customers to facilitate consumer purchases. A similar digital consumer-finance partnership was signed with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) on June 10, however the Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) partnership is expected to be bigger than that.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn June 25, Bloomberg also reported that Banco Santander S.A. ADR (NYSE:SAN) found a way to use Spain’s tourism industry to clear its debts and improve its financial health. Due to increased property prices, the bank is looking to sell some of its commercial property assets, which are present in tourist areas of the country. Banco Santander S.A. ADR (NYSE:SAN) already sold hotel loans valued at around $321 million to credit investor Polus Capital Management. The bank is also considering selling other commercial real estate assets, including office buildings and hotels, which is expected to be of a similar size to the hotel loan sale.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon saw record sales for Prime Day this week as Prime members purchased more items than ever before, the company announced Thursday.\n\nThe Seattle e-commerce giant, which does not disclose how much it earns during the popular discount event, also said “millions” of customers joined Prime in the past three weeks to take advantage of the discount event, which ended right before midnight Pacific Standard Time on Thursday.\n\n“Prime Day 2024 was a huge success thanks to the millions of Prime members globally who turned to Amazon for fantastic deals,” Doug Herrington, an Amazon executive who leads the company’s Prime and online shopping business, said in a statement included in the announcement.\n\nData from some third-party groups also indicated shoppers spent more this year during the two-day event.\n\nAdobe Analytics, which tracks online sales, said consumers spent $14.2 billion on Tuesday and Wednesday, up 11% compared to last year.\n\nAdobe noted the growth was driven partly by back-to-school shopping with big spikes in spending for products such as backpacks, lunchboxes and other stationary supplies. Consumers also spent more on electronics and home appliances, it added.\n\nAdobe's numbers are not adjusted for inflation. However, it said consumer spending this year has not been driven by higher prices, but new demand. It pointed to its own data, which shows online prices have fallen for 22 months and were down 4.2% year-over-year in June.\n\nLast week, the Labor Department reported overall consumer prices declined 0.1% from May to June after having remained flat the previous month.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Robotics Stocks That Could Be Multibaggers in the Making: July Edition",
        "content": "As the field of robotics progresses and enters more and more industries, robotics stocks are becoming increasingly promising investments.\n\nAI machine learning (ML) are some of the critical aspects that have formed the basis of robotics today. The advancements in these technologies are allowing the robots to do more and work more efficiently.\n\nThe application of robotics technology is on the rise in various industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, supply chain and even in sales. Some of them include industrial robots that are required to carry out various operations in manufacturing industries, managing materials, and increasing production turnover. In the healthcare sector, the robotic-assisted surgical systems are transforming surgical operations and cutting down the surgery time as well as the time taken to recover.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe point is, robotics stocks are intersecting with many aspects of society and I believe that this trend will only strengthen and continue. When one takes a long-term view, these robotics stocks could be seen to trade at attractive valuations.\n\nSo here are three robotics stocks for investors to consider adding to their portfolios.\n\niRobot (IRBT) In this photo illustration the iRobot Corporation (IRBT) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\niRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) specializes in robotic vacuum cleaners. I think that iRobot is a good investment opportunity even when taking into consideration its current problems. In fact, its problems boost its investment appeal if one takes a contrarian view of the company.\n\nAlthough the merger of iRobot with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was called off due to some issues from the European Commission, I remain optimistic on its trajectory.\n\nHowever, it is a big advantage that iRobot has a large number of connected Roomba devices and the collected data, which can be an interesting acquisition or licensing target for other companies that develop robots and AI.\n\nIRBT has a small market cap of just 331.28 million at trades at just 0.3x sales. It could be a potential multibagger, especially if acquired by a company with an interest in IoT or robotics.\n\nUiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) is a leader in robotic process automation (RPA). The company has faced some issues recently, which has contributed to its stock price falling 31.17% over the past year.\n\nNevertheless, I think UiPath is a good investment prospect even with the company’s current issues in sales execution. UiPath’s Q1 2025 revenue guidance was lower than expected given macroeconomic conditions and alterations in the sales compensation plan.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these setbacks, UiPath kept on enhancing its position as a market leader in the RPA solutions as reflected in its positioning in the Gartner Magic Quadrant. This is further fortified by the company’s ability to incorporate its RPA platform with emerging technologies that I think will give it some multibagger potential.\n\nAnalysts remain bullish on PATH despite its difficulties, given double-digit growth forecasts for PATH’s revenue and EPS for the foreseeable future. I think it’s conceivable it could at least double its stock price over this time period. This then makes it one of those robotics stocks for investors to pay attention to closely.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) is a leader in medical technology and robotics.\n\nI do think Medtronic is a good investment despite the dip in the company’s stock price. In its core business areas of cardiovascular, neuroscience, medical surgical, and diabetes therapies, Medtronic is the global leader in medical therapies.\n\nDespite its market cap, I think that MDT has a decent chance of becoming a multibagger when one factors in expected stock price appreciation as well as reinvested dividends.\n\nFirst, Medtronic is the market leader in many of the fastest-growing markets, consistently ranking first, second or third place. It has one of the largest R&D budgets of $74 billion per annum and this contributes to a steady stream of product approvals which stood at 130 in the fiscal year 2024.\n\nUnlike IRBT or PATH, I think that holding MDT for a decade or longer could see its value soar. It currently trades near a new five-year low, so the timing at present could be attractive for investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon is sitting on a Gen-Z goldmine that could be worth $46 billion – and it’s not movies or Prime",
        "content": "Amazon is quietly sitting on a $46 billion product, Laura Martin, an analyst from Needham, wrote to investors Wednesday.\n\nIt’s not Prime Day; it’s not the Ring; it’s not even AWS, its tremendously profitable cloud computing division.\n\nInstead, investors should start paying attention to Amazon’s live streaming platform, Twitch, which may be relatively unknown to older generations, but has become a live-streaming staple among Gen-Z and Gen-Alpha.\n\nTwitch is best known for video-game streaming and is “the largest streaming platform for video gamers, by far,” Martin wrote. Yet the service has expanded far beyond the gaming world.\n\nGaming and beyond\n\nTwitch, Martin noted, allows Amazon access to an advertising market the company wouldn’t otherwise have. Nearly two-thirds of Twitch users are men, and nearly three-quarters of them are under 34, Martin wrote. For Amazon as a whole, only 45% of its customer base is under 34, and most of them are female.\n\n“Endemic advertisers (ie., video games & accessories) that advertise on Twitch also buy ads on AMZN as well, and many of these advertisers would not be clients of AMZN without Twitch,” she adds. “Similarly, brands can buy ads in Twitch to access hard-to-reach young men, most of whom do not watch traditional TV.”\n\nIt’s not just men, however. At any given moment, over 2.5 million people are watching someone stream on Twitch. The service boasted 35 million average daily users in 2022, and 1.3 trillion minutes watched on the platform that same year, according to its advertising page.\n\nThose startling numbers don’t just come from video games: Martin likens Twitch’s market dominance to that of Google’s YouTube.\n\n\"YouTube has carved out the VOD (video on demand) space and Twitch has carved out the live-streaming space,\" Martin wrote.\n\nTwitch has boosted the careers of ultra-popular Gen-Z comedians: most famously,  22-year-old Kai Cenat (who has the most followers on the platform, at 12 million), gained popularity on Twitch for his 24-hour streams and pranks. Celebrities from Drake to IceSpice have sat down on Twitch to joke with Cenat; once, Drake bet $121,000 on Cenat beating rapper 21Savage in a game of NBA 2K (Cenat lost, then broke his streaming set-up out of rage).\n\nThe platform has also become popular among young political commentators, such as Hasan Piker, better known as Hasanabi on Twitch, where he espouses left-wing political takes to his 2.1 million followers. On one pandemic evening in 2020, Piker streamed with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to play Gen-Z-favorite Among Us and nearly broke the platform as 400,000 viewers scrambled to watch. As Ocasio-Cortez played, she also chatted about health care policy and bantered with the constant stream of comments from viewers.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I think the lack of predictability on a stream is what makes it compelling,” Ocasio-Cortez, who still occasionally streams on Twitch, previously told the Washington Post. “Being able to be comfortable in the chaos of inviting so many people in the conversation … you need to be okay with that.”\n\nCreator revenue\n\nThose who embrace the mayhem, and get popular off it, can reap sizable rewards: A data leak from 2021 suggests that the platform’s top creators make $8 to $9 million a year from the platform.\n\nStreamers get paid through a subscription model: viewers can subscribe to their favorite content creators for a minimum of $4.99 a month to gain access to perks like access to emotes – moving emojis – badges, and ad-free viewing.  However, the platform has undergone controversy with creators over their payouts.\n\nSome creators rebelled against Twitch last year after it decreased the amount of subscription revenue it allotted to Partners (content creators who meet certain criteria). The current split is 50/50, a significant decrease from the original 70/30 split that allowed creators to build livelihoods and businesses on the platform.\n\nTwitch later announced the Partner Plus Program, restoring the 70/30 split for only the first $100,000 earned by top-tier creators, a group that includes just the 1,066 most popular creators on Twitch’s 14 million-person platform.\n\nSome creators still complained about the limited number of people eligible for the new Partner Plus program and the various terms and conditions. “This is so unobtainable right now based off individual and reoccurring subs…this doesn’t help the streamers at all,” Twitch partner PaladinAmber said in response to the new program.\n\nSince then, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy has been working overtime to restore relations with creators. In January, Clancy announced a new system: anyone with more than 100 paid subscribers would now receive 60% of the money fans pledge.\n\n“Twitch has made some good moves to help creators make money, but it's still tough to make a living just from streaming alone,” Jerome Aceti, a Minecraft Twitch streamer, told Fortune. “A lot of us have to rely on ads, product promotions, and other ways to bring in income.”\n\nAceti has only recently expanded to Twitch from Youtube, where many of his 5.41 million followers know and love him as JeromeASF.\n\n“Twitch is about being in the moment and engaging with viewers live,” Aceti said. “It used to feel more like a small, tight-knit community, but now it’s this huge platform with all kinds of content and different ways to engage your fans.”\n\nDespite its popularity, the platform has struggled with profitability, laying off 35% of its staff in January to help pay the prohibitive costs associated with supporting 1.8 billion hours of live video content monthly.\n\nAmazon first acquired Twitch in 2014 for about $970 million, when Twitch had a revenue of about $72 million, Martin wrote. In 2023, the website generated approximately $3 billion in revenue, according to Martin. She upgraded Amazon’s price target to $210 from $205 while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. Martin’s new price target is “based on the upside we calculate from Twitch.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Forget Apple: These Unstoppable Stocks Are Better Buys",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is once again the world's largest company (as measured by market cap) right now. It's also one of the most profitable (as measured by total profits generated).  But that wasn't always the case. It earned its way to these accolades with sustained growth largely set in motion by 2007's debut of the iPhone.\n\nHowever, investors know that past performance is no guarantee of future results. What got Apple to where it is today doesn't seem to be working quite as well lately. Sales of its top products have been stagnant for a couple of years, in fact. While the stock's been soaring since May 1 (up 38%), it's currently sitting just 6% above analysts' consensus price target. Weakness may well be on the horizon. That has some investors considering other options.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a new pick, there are three better options than Apple to consider.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nThere's no sense in not beginning with the market's most fruitful stock pick of this century so far. That's Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), of course. Shares of the e-commerce giant are up an amazing 257,000% since the company's 1997 initial public offering, soaring in step with the expansion of the then-nascent internet.\n\nThe company's fastest growth and the stock's fastest gains are likely in the past, of course, as the e-commerce market is mature even if it's not yet at its peak potential But there's still plenty of growth in store given Amazon's more nascent business lines.\n\nOne of these young ventures is cloud computing. Although Amazon Web Services only accounts for about 16% of the company's revenue, this revenue grew 13% year over year in 2023. Given that cloud computing services already drive roughly two-thirds of the company's operating income, even merely modest growth on this front could remain impactful. That's what makes Mordor Intelligence's outlook for the global cloud computing market so compelling for Amazon shareholders. The research outfit expects an annualized growth rate of 16% through 2029.\n\nThe company's e-commerce platform is also evolving. Although it still generates revenue and earnings on every item sold at Amazon.com, it's generating much more higher-margin revenue as an advertising platform. Sellers paid a total of nearly $47 billion last year to more prominently feature their products at the well-trafficked website, monetizing it in a way that wasn't even an afterthought just a few years back.\n\nAgain, neither Amazon nor Amazon stock will repeat the feat achieved during the first 30 years of the company's existence. The next 30 years, however, could still be pretty darn rewarding.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Broadcom\n\nYou've almost certainly heard of the company. You may not know, however, a single thing Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) manufactures. That's because nearly everything it makes is found on the inside of the electronics you regularly rely on. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, fiber-optic connection components, data-storage device boards, and a wide range of automation software are just a sampling of its offerings. Without Broadcom's tech, the world would look considerably different.\n\nMore important to interested investors, the need for Broadcom's technologies isn't going away anytime soon, if ever. Consumers and corporations alike are far too reliant on mobile phones, wireless networking, data centers (for artificial intelligence), and cybersecurity -- all markets that Broadcom serves -- to simply cease using them now.\n\nAlso know that Broadcom's technology remains well protected by patents. It holds more than 45,000 of them, with roughly one-third of them in active use right now, according to Insights by GreyB. Just late last year the company successfully enforced a key patent against streaming powerhouse Netflix.\n\n3. Coca-Cola\n\nFinally, add Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) to your list of unstoppable stocks to buy instead of Apple.\n\nIt's obviously a very different outfit than either Amazon or Broadcom. It operates a slow-growth, cash-driving business that generates tons of reliable cash. Indeed, the beverage behemoth hasn't just been able to pay a dividend like clockwork for decades now. It's raised its annual payment every year for the past 62 years; the most recent increase was a 5.4% improvement, extending a long streak of inflation-beating payout growth. Coke shares are also up a hefty 26,400% for that time frame, bolstering the gains stemming from its reliable dividend payments.\n\nIt's a tough act to follow to be sure. In fact, the next 62 years aren't apt to be nearly as fruitful for shareholders as the past 62 have been. There's just too much competition in the well-developed and highly competitive beverage business these days.\n\nThat doesn't mean the next six decades, however, still can't be amazingly rewarding.\n\nSee, while Coca-Cola's business isn't complicated, the company handles the most crucial aspects of it brilliantly. That's marketing, mostly. It's been able to use lifestyle-oriented advertising to create brand names and product logos that consumers readily recognize. Purchasing its products has become a habit for many of its customers.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that operating in the consumer staples space makes it easier for the company to continue selling goods to a crowd that might occasionally rethink purchases of more cyclical products and services like automobiles, vacations, or home improvements. More to the point, this competitive edge within a resilient business should keep The Coca-Cola Company's stock reliably chugging along.\n\nIt will never be a growth stock, to be clear. What the company lacks in growth firepower, however, it more than makes up for in consistent forward progress.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Why Amazon workers rejected the trade unions",
        "content": "Amazon workers rejected unionisation by a margin of half a percent - Claudia Greco/Reuters\n\nAmazon workers in Coventry have rejected a landmark deal to form a trade union, in a blow to campaigners who called for the tech giant to recognise collective bargaining rights in the UK.\n\nOf those who voted, 49.5pc of votes were in favour of a proposal put forward by the GMB union, which has vowed to launch a legal challenge against the result. This was below the 50pc threshold to pass.\n\nUnion officials accused the US company of “union-busting” activities in the run up to the poll, claiming bosses had targeted workers with an “unrelenting campaign” of anti-union messaging. According to one source, the union lost by a margin of just 28 votes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor months, Amazon’s Coventry warehouse has been the site of a bitter campaign between unions and bosses, with 3,000 workers at its fulfilment centre caught in the middle.\n\nUnion members have joined picket lines outside Amazon’s site to persuade workers unhappy with pay and conditions to join them, following similar successful attempts in the US.\n\nHundreds of workers have taken part in strike action at Coventry so far this year. The warehouse has proved a hub of union activity and was the epicentre of earlier “wildcat” strikes in 2022 – which culminated in a mass sit-in.\n\nWhile GMB placards have often lined the road to the Coventry site, inside, Amazon has launched a charm offensive – with free snacks and team meetings during typically labour-intensive shifts – to convince workers that voting for recognition may not be in their best interests.\n\nThe union has characterised this effort as an “unrelenting campaign” of anti-union messaging. The GMB is now considering a legal challenge on the basis of an “Inducement Claim”, alleging Amazon pressured workers to quit the union.\n\nStuart Richards, a GMB senior organiser, said: “From day one, Amazon have been relentless in their attacks on their own workforce.”\n\nAmazon’s strategy included posters, seen by The Telegraph, with QR codes that generated emails for workers to cancel their union membership. Lawyers for the workers argue Amazon’s QR codes were unlawful and may have influenced more than 50 staff members to quit the union in the run up to the ballot. Amazon was also accused of having pressured workers to attend “anti-union seminars”.\n\nStory continues Amazon's use of QR to encourage union members to quit have prompted allegations of unfair tactics in advance of the vote\n\nRosa Curling, director of non-profit law firm Foxglove, said it was supporting 900 workers in the inducement claim against Amazon. “Attention must now turn to Amazon’s behaviour before and during this ballot process – they have not played fairly.”\n\nIt is understood the GMB will raise the issue with the new Labour Government, which is planning a new employment rights law to make it easier for workers to access union rights. Curling, of Foxglove, says the vote “squeaked under the line ... just before a new Labour Government”.\n\nHowever, an Amazon spokesman denied that the company had acted improperly.\n\n“Throughout the ballot process, attendance at Amazon employee meetings was entirely voluntary,” the spokesman said. “Employees were informed of this when they were invited to a meeting and also at the start of each meeting. The GMB held similar meetings with our employees on site, which were also voluntary.”\n\nSources said the union drive had been met with an effective counter-campaign. Workers were given information about the ballot in 26 languages by Amazon, while senior managers held multiple briefings with staff.\n\nIn a recording from an “associate forum”, viewed by The Telegraph, an Amazon staff member warns: “If the GMB is recognised, this means we cannot give you any increases to pay, any one-off payments or bonuses, we cannot make changes to your hours of work, your shift arrangements or holidays – including those changes that you like and you asked for – without the GMB agreeing.”\n\nThey also warned that if workers failed to vote, they could find decisions being made by the union without their input.\n\n“The GMB is a business and will prioritise its own members’ voice over those of you that choose not to pay,” they said.\n\nIn the meeting, the Amazon staff member also extolls the company’s associate forum system, where employee-elected representatives can bring complaints and concerns to executives. An Amazon spokesman said: “We value that direct relationship and so do our employees.”\n\nDespite union anger over its counter offensive Amazon insists its QR codes were neutral in tone, a spokesman said its seminars and QR codes aimed to ensure workers made an “informed decision when they voted in the ballot”, pointing to official government information about union rights. One QR poster seen by The Telegraph reads: “You decide what’s best for you.”\n\nWhile union leaders have called for a pay rise to £15 per hour for Amazon workers, in the leaked audio, the senior staff member warns Coventry could be left behind other warehouses by union wrangling when pay reviews conclude in October this year.\n\n“The pure reality of the situation is the union knows it cannot force a pay rise of £15 an hour,” the Amazon staff member warns. They add: “This back-and-forth could go on for a long, long time, while everybody else is already getting the pay rise.”\n\nThe staff member adds that Amazon would not be under pressure to award back pay for striking workers or come to a deal, unlike the NHS.\n\n“What we’re not doing is educating children and performing brain surgery,” they say.\n\nTom Vickers, an associate professor at Nottingham Trent University who has been documenting the GMB campaign, says that the information provided to workers “skewed heavily” in favour of Amazon, which flooded the site with external managers and experts to ward off the GMB. Fears on the shop floor that workers could face delayed pay rises appeared to have hit home. Turnout in the vote was 86pc.\n\n“Many Amazon workers are from a migrant or refugee background and have family in their country of origin who rely on the money they send home,” says Vickers. “The wider precariousness workers face because of the cost of living, temporary contracts ... all need to be taken into account.”\n\nIn a second recording, another Amazon worker heatedly disputes the company’s official narrative, arguing workers in France and Germany – who are unionised – get a better deal. “They have more than us,” he says.\n\nAmazon pay currently starts at between £12.30 and £13 per hour, depending on location, above the National Living Wage. Insiders believe this compares favourably to other warehouse or supermarket roles.\n\nThe defeat for the GMB comes amid a wider challenge to the union movement – even in a Labour stronghold such as Coventry. Nationwide, union membership is close to its lowest levels since 1995. In 2023, there were 6.4m union members in Britain, down on 13m in the 1970s.\n\nIn part, this is down to a decline in traditionally unionised jobs, such as in manufacturing, and a rise in the number of private sector roles overall. An increase in self-employment and casual work has also led to a decline in the percentage of workers paying union subscriptions.\n\nThe Trades Union Congress has bemoaned its struggle to attract younger members, who do not see the movement as “relevant”. According to official data, union membership often skews towards more highly paid public sector workers, rather than low-paid shift workers like those in Coventry.\n\nThe defeat at the Coventry warehouse “is a significant blow for the GMB,” said Sarah Harrop, an employment lawyer at Addleshaw Goddard. The union will not be able to apply for statutory recognition for another three years after Wednesday’s failure, she adds.\n\nAmazon, meanwhile, will hope victory can head off further union agitation across the country. It could also seek to bring the playbook that helped eke out a victory in Coventry to other sites.\n\nIn the leaked recording, the Amazon worker taking issue with the company’s handling of the dispute says widespread action is what the tech giant truly fears. They said: “You’re scared because it’s here, because tomorrow maybe in Birmingham and another day London.”",

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Amazon, Burlington Stores Walmart and Wholesale",
        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – July 18, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Burlington Stores, Inc. BURL, Walmart Inc. WMT and Wholesale Corp. COST.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n4 Stocks to Invest In as Retail Sales Hold Steady in June\n\nIn June, U.S. retail sales showed remarkable resilience, holding steady at $704.3 billion, according to the latest report from the U.S. Census Bureau, defying expectations of a 0.3% decline. This stable performance follows a revised 0.3% increase in May. Amid economic uncertainties, consumer spending remains a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, driving two-thirds of its activity. Retail sales grew 2.3% year over year last month.\n\nDespite persistent challenges such as elevated inflation and sustained high interest rates, Americans have shown cautious yet resilient spending habits. Savings accumulated during the pandemic have largely been depleted, prompting a shift toward essential purchases over discretionary spending. This strategic approach reflects consumers' efforts to navigate a volatile economic landscape.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is closely monitoring these developments, particularly as unemployment edges up and consumer caution grows apparent. The latest inflation data and signs of economic slowdown reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve may soon lower interest rates. Market expectations are leaning toward a potential rate cut during the Sep 17-18 Federal Reserve meeting.\n\nBreaking Down the Sales Number\n\nFurniture and home furnishing stores led with a 0.6% increase in sales, while electronics and appliance stores experienced a modest 0.4% rise. Building material and supplies dealers saw a significant 1.4% jump, while food and beverage stores saw a slight 0.1% increase. Health and personal care stores reported a 0.9% rise, and non-store retailers, predominantly online, showed a robust 1.9% increase.\n\nClothing and accessories stores also saw positive momentum with a 0.6% increase, alongside miscellaneous stores at 0.3% and general merchandise stores at 0.4%. Food services and drinking places saw a modest 0.3% uptick in sales.\n\nConversely, motor vehicle and parts dealers experienced a notable 2% decline in sales, while gasoline stations faced a more pronounced drop of 3%. Sales at sporting goods, hobbies, musical instruments and bookstores also decreased slightly by 0.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\n4 Prominent Picks\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. is a potential pick. The company’s robust e-commerce platform, renowned for its vast product selection and efficient delivery services, continues to be a primary driver of revenue growth. Prime membership, a cornerstone of Amazon's success, not only fosters customer loyalty but also drives recurring revenues through subscription fees, offering members exclusive access to a myriad of services, such as expedited shipping.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Amazon’s current financial-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 11% and 57.9%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure. AMZN, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 48.2%, on average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nBurlington Stores, Inc. is worth considering. The company has adeptly responded to the challenges in the retail landscape by strategically emphasizing recognizable brands, implementing the best pricing strategy and targeting trade-down shoppers. The implementation of strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing merchandising capabilities, operational efficiency and store optimization is likely to support revenue growth. By focusing on initiatives such as store relocations and downsizing, Burlington Stores aims to improve store productivity. The ability to quickly respond to evolving market dynamics and adjust inventory levels based on real-time data insights has enabled the company to seize opportunities.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Burlington Stores’ current fiscal sales and EPS suggests growth of 9.5% and 25.4%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure. This Zacks Rank #1 company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 21.7%, on average.\n\nInvestors can count on Walmart Inc. This omnichannel retail giant has been diligently working to strengthen its already formidable presence in the market. The company has embarked on a series of strategic e-commerce initiatives, encompassing acquisitions, partnerships and significant improvements in its delivery and payment systems. Simultaneously, Walmart is committed to elevating its merchandise offerings, ensuring a diverse and appealing product assortment. Innovation extends to its supply chain, wherein the company is enhancing capacity and introducing cutting-edge solutions.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Walmart’s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 4.3% and 9.5%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.3%, on average.\n\nCostco Wholesale Corp. is worth betting on. The discount retailer’s growth strategies, better price management and decent membership trends have been contributing to its performance. Cumulatively, these factors have been aiding this Issaquah, WA-based company in registering decent sales numbers. The company's distinctive membership business model and pricing power set it apart from traditional players. We believe a favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing strength and strong liquidity should benefit Costco.\n\nThis Zacks Rank #2 company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.3%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current financial-year revenues and EPS suggests growth of 5.2% and 10.3%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia? Billionaires Are Buying These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Hand Over Fist.",
        "content": "Nvidia created a staggering amount of value for investors over the last 18 months. It was a $360 billion company at the beginning of 2023, and today its market capitalization stands at a whopping $3.2 trillion. That's a ninefold increase, and it's only natural to feel disappointed if you missed the run.\n\nBut it's important to keep looking forward, and watching what Wall Street's top investors are doing can be one way to find the next big opportunity. In the first quarter of 2024, billionaire fund managers piled into two artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that weren't Nvidia:\n\nCitadel Advisors, which is run by billionaire Ken Griffin, bought 352,453 shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). It represented a 5.6% increase to the fund's total position in Amazon, which is now worth almost $1.3 billion. Appaloosa Management, which is run by billionaire David Tepper, bought 975,000 shares of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). It represented a whopping 73% increase to the fund's original stake which it established at the end of 2023.\n\nBoth Amazon and Oracle have inserted themselves into the AI industry with a substantial amount of conviction. I'm not suggesting their respective stocks are about to stage an Nvidia-style rally, but here's why they could deliver strong returns for investors who buy them today.\n\n1. Amazon: A multifaceted AI play\n\nAmazon stock is up almost 30% this year, and the company was catapulted into the exclusive $2 trillion club just last month. Investors are bullish on the efficiency measures Amazon has adopted in its e-commerce segment to boost profits, but the company's growing presence in AI is also attracting lots of positive attention.\n\nAmazon uses AI across all of its businesses. AI powers the recommendation engine on amazon.com, which drives sales by showing customers products they are likely to buy. The Prime Video streaming platform also uses AI during the NFL's Thursday Night Football programming. It autonomously compiles highlights for the viewer on demand, shows them advanced stats like the running speed of each player, and gives the viewer data-driven insights into the next potential play.\n\nBut the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform is home to the company's heavy-hitting AI projects. AWS designed its own data center chips, which can train AI models at 50% of the cost of Nvidia's industry-leading GPUs. Plus, the Amazon Bedrock platform offers AWS customers a library of pre-built large language models (LLMs), which they can use to accelerate the development of their own AI applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe tech giant recently invested $4 billion in leading AI start-up Anthropic. As part of the deal, Anthropic agreed to make AWS its primary cloud platform, and it will train its future models using Amazon's chips. Plus, it agreed to make those models available on Bedrock so AWS customers can use them to build their own apps. This partnership could entice aspiring developers to choose AWS over competing clouds like Microsoft Azure.\n\nAmazon generates more revenue than every other company in the $2 trillion club, and yet it trades at the cheapest price-to-sales (P/S) valuation of the bunch. Plus, Wall Street thinks Amazon will deliver $4.18 in earnings per share this year, which would represent a whopping 44% growth compared to 2023.\n\nAWS remains the company's most profitable segment, but its e-commerce business is benefiting from improvements to its fulfillment network that are driving down its cost-to-serve metric (the cost of fulfilling orders). Considering e-commerce remains Amazon's largest source of revenue, those shrinking costs could lead to sustained long-term growth in the entire organization's profitability.\n\nAmazon stock might be trading near an all-time high right now, but I'm not surprised Citadel was a buyer recently because there could be plenty of upside in the tank.\n\n2. Oracle: Industry-leading AI data center infrastructure\n\nTech giants (including Amazon) are racing to build more data centers to meet the surging demand for computing capacity from AI developers. Oracle operates some of the best AI infrastructure in the industry, which is cheaper and faster than the competition.\n\nOracle's Supercluster technology allows developers to scale up to 32,768 of Nvidia's GPUs, and that will soon increase to 65,536. More GPUs can translate to bigger AI models, which leads to more advanced capabilities in finished AI applications like chatbots and virtual assistants. For context, some of Amazon's best AI infrastructure offers clusters of just 20,000 GPUs, and even Meta Platforms' latest data centers have clusters of around 24,000 GPUs.\n\nPlus, Oracle's unique random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology can move data between servers and devices much faster than traditional Ethernet networks. Since AI developers typically pay for computing capacity by the minute, faster processing can significantly drive down costs. Last year, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said the company's latest Gen2 infrastructure can train AI models at twice the speed and for half the cost of competing data centers.\n\nOracle is building new data centers right now to meet demand from leading developers like OpenAI, Cohere, and Elon Musk's xAI. In the recent fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended May 31), the company's remaining performance obligations (order backlog) surged 44% year over year to a record $98 billion. That included $12.5 billion in new AI deals from 30 different customers who are waiting for more capacity to come online.\n\nOracle's total revenue came in flat during Q4, but the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) segment brought in $2 billion, which represented 42% growth. Given the size of the order backlog I mentioned above, that figure looks poised for substantial growth in the coming years.\n\nOracle stock is up 39% this year and it's trading at a record high, yet it's still cheap. It trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 26, which is a 20% discount to the 32.7 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index. Oracle is also a whopping 65% cheaper than Nvidia right now, which trades at a P/E ratio of 76.\n\nTherefore, investors who missed Nvidia's incredible run can still find value in the AI space through Oracle stock. It appears David Tepper and his team have spotted a bargain given how quickly Appaloosa is accumulating shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Bull of the Day: Spotify Technology S.A. (SPOT)",
        "content": "Spotify Technology S.A. (SPOT) changed the music industry forever. Spotify has remained the streaming music powerhouse despite competition from Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet, closing last quarter with 615 million monthly active users, up 19% YoY.\n\nSpotify’s newfound commitment to efficiency and profits, mixed with a string of price hikes are leading to soaring earnings growth. SPOT is also set to double its revenue between 2020 and 2025.\n\nSpotify shares have soared roughly 300% off their 2022 lows. Yet, the recent big-tech pullback has Spotify trading 20% below its all-time highs, with enticing valuation levels.\n\nSpotify’s Bullish Basics\n\nSpotify kickstarted the paid streaming music industry in 2008. The firm was the vanguard of paid streaming, reshaping the music industry as much as Netflix forever altered TV and movies. Spotify is thriving despite streaming music competition from Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), as users flock to the service for music, podcasts, and more recently, audiobooks.\n\nSPOT nearly doubled its revenue between 2019 and 2023. Spotify grew its monthly active users by 19% YoY in the first quarter of 2024 to 615 million across 184 markets, expanding its paid Premium Subscribers by 14% to 239 million. Spotify grew its Premium Subscribers by 84% between Q1 FY20 and Q1 FY24, while monthly active users surged 115%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSpotify in the summer of 2023 raised its monthly prices for its ad-free Premium plans to match competitors such as Apple and Amazon. The streaming music firm announced in June 2024 another price hike to help keep up with inflation and boost profits. Spotify raised the price for its individual Premium subscriptions by a dollar to $11.99 a month, while Duo plans climbed by $2 to $16.99 a month. Meanwhile, family plans were hiked by $3 to $19.99 a month.\n\nSpotify is focused on efficiency, having trimmed its workforce among other efforts. The company boosted its ad-supported gross margin to 6% last quarter vs. -3% in the year-ago period, as revenue growth outpaced rising content costs. Premium gross margin climbed to 30% vs. 29%, primarily driven by sales growth outpacing music royalty costs.\n\nLooking ahead, some Wall Street analysts project Spotify will grow its total user base by almost 50% by 2028 to 900 million. Spotify’s user growth expansion is key to helping it continue to negotiate favorable rights deals with artists. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth Outlook\n\nSpotify grew its revenue by 21% last quarter and swung from an adjusted loss of -$1.24 a share to +$1.05, crushing our bottom line estimate. The company is now firmly committed to profits amid the new interest rate environment, alongside the likes of Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nSPOT’s adjusted earnings outlook has skyrocketed over the past 12 months, up 723% for FY24 and 215% for FY25. The streaming music firm’s upbeat EPS outlook helps it land its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Spotify’s most accurate/recent EPS estimates came in slightly below consensus, but SPOT stock's recent pullback will help account for that. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nZacks estimates call for SPOT to grow its sales by 18% in 2024 and another 15% next year to soar from around $14 billion in FY23 to nearly $20 billion next year—doubling revenue between FY20 and FY25.\n\nSpotify is projected to swing from an adjusted loss of -$2.95 a share last year to +$5.02 per share in 2024 and then surge another 44% next year. The earnings expansion is driving the stock, with Wall Street convinced that Spotify has reached an inflection point on profits.\n\nPerformance, Technical Levels, and Valuation\n\nSpotify stock has climbed around 100% since its 2018 IPO, lagging the Zacks Tech sector’s 190% run. But Spotify shares have soared roughly 300% off their 2022 lows (around the stock market’s 2022 bottom), including a 55% YTD climb, blowing away Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet during those stretches.\n\nSPOT has faced some selling pressure recently, alongside plenty of other first-half big tech winners. Spotify is down around 11% from its early June highs, putting it 20% off its 2021 peaks. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSpotify is trading below its 21-day and 50-day moving averages and at some of its most oversold RSI levels over the last five years. Any pullback to SPOT’s 200-day moving average (around $240 per share) would mark a screaming buy opportunity.\n\nSpotify is trading at 48.1X forward 12-month earnings, which is hardly cheap. But it has traded as high as 175X earnings over the last year. SPOT’s PEG ratio, which factors in its long-term EPS growth outlook, comes in at 0.6, offering a 67% discount to the Tech sector.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSpotify’s recent downturn could set up SPOT stock for a potential break out in the coming weeks, especially if it impresses Wall Street with strong guidance on Tuesday, July 23.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Morgan Stanley analysts are setting a bullish tone for the upcoming earnings season, with specific companies expected to outperform. According to the analysts, investors should watch Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) closely, as these companies are anticipated to deliver strong results.\n\nAmazon is highlighted with a \"Positive\" near-term view. Morgan Stanley expects Amazon to deliver a significant EBIT beat in Q2 and guide positively for Q3.\n\n\"We are 17% above Street EBIT\" for Q2 and 10% above for Q3, the analysts noted, driven by North America Retail profitability and accelerating growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nApple also holds a \"Positive\" near-term outlook. For the first time in over a year, Morgan Stanley sees a favorable setup, expecting Apple to post better-than-expected results.\n\n\"Street estimates are 4-5% too low for the September quarter,\" the analysts stated. They forecast Apple will achieve $96.9 billion in revenue for the September quarter, which is 4% above the consensus. Driving this optimism are strong iPhone builds, improvements in the Mac outlook, and robust growth in Services.\n\nEli Lilly is another key player with a positive outlook. Morgan Stanley anticipates that upcoming data from the Phase 3 SUMMIT trial of Tirzepatide/Zepbound in patients with obesity and heart failure will be a catalyst for the stock. The data, expected in Q3, could demonstrate significant benefits beyond weight loss, potentially broadening Medicare coverage and strengthening Tirzepatide's competitive profile.\n\nThe analysts noted, \"We would expect positive data from SUMMIT (a statistically significant benefit on CV outcomes) to move LLY shares up ~2-3%.\"\n\nOverall, Morgan Stanley's analysts are keen to see how companies manage margins in a challenging pricing environment and whether high expectations for the second half of 2024 will hold.\n\nThey also highlighted that earnings revisions for the S&P 500 have been less negative than average heading into the reporting season, suggesting cautious optimism for the broader market.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAmazon, Apple, Eli Lilly: Here's Morgan Stanley's earnings playbook\n\nAbbott posts Q2 earnings beat, lifts full-year outlook\n\nCiti sees further S&P 500 upside during 2H24\n\nView comments",

        "content": "“We see impacts to logistics even before [Prime Day],” Kristen Kelly, Loop Returns vice president of product, told FreightWaves. “As Amazon is increasing their inventory and their fulfillment, you’ll see backups at their warehouses because they’re trying to get all those goods in there. …” (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nWith Prime Day coming to an end Wednesday night, online businesses big and small are capitalizing on Amazon’s largest summer sale of the year to see a spike in profits.\n\nBut increased product promotion and sales at discount prices aren’t just handed to e-commerce businesses on a silver platter. Those gaining most advantage from the big sale had to do their homework and prepare their logistics capability to handle the high influx of order traffic.\n\nIt all comes back to the customer experience, which demands speedy deliveries and simple return policies, among other factors.\n\nReturns and the customer experience\n\nKristen Kelly is vice president of product at Columbus, Ohio-based returns software company Loop Returns. She says merchants begin planning for Prime Day long before the actual sale starts, and slowdowns are to be expected.\n\n“We see impacts to logistics even before [Prime Day],” Kelly told FreightWaves in a virtual interview. “As Amazon is increasing their inventory and their fulfillment, you’ll see backups at their warehouses because they’re trying to get all those goods in there. So merchants that might use Amazon fulfillment services or warehouses are already seeing the slowdowns on the days leading up to this.”\n\nKelly said it’s difficult to hire more manpower to help move things along more efficiently during Prime Day compared to other holiday sales that may last for several months. Because it’s such a short time period for this sale, it doesn’t really justify bringing on new employees when compared to hiring part-timers for holiday sales in late November or December.\n\nWhile merchants may be unable to do much about speed during this time, one way they can still prepare for Prime Day is making returns a simple and easy process for customers.\n\nThat first requires a solid return policy. Most businesses outline those policies upfront when selling goods online. Kelly said return policies vary between retailers.\n\n“It really depends on the behaviors that they are trying to incentivize with those customers,” Kelly said. “You’ll see somebody that really wants exchanges to happen might offer a free exchange, whereas they might charge for a refund.”\n\nItem and freight costs also factor into return policies, with rising return fraud possibly being one of the biggest challenges merchants are facing.\n\n“Returns fraud and abuse has definitely been on the rise over the last couple of years,” Kelly said. “It used to be that most merchants had it in their return policies that as soon as it was scanned at the carrier they would issue their refund. That would be well before they received it back at the warehouse.”\n\nStory continues\n\nSome customers have gotten really good at exploiting that.\n\n“Warehouses started receiving a box of rocks or a can of soup,” Kelly said. “Yes, the label got scanned and [customers] got that money, but then [the merchants] were without that item. We see more and more merchants going to the method where they need to actually receive the item at the warehouse and inspect it before they issue that refund. Or implementing something like a boxless, labeless drop-off where somebody actually physically accepts that item and validates that it’s the correct SKU and the correct quantity before they get that refund.”\n\nShe added that Amazon has an advantage dealing with fraud compared to other retailers because the company can shut down the accounts of fraudsters.\n\nHer advice to merchants is to make the returns process clear for customers.\n\n“Nothing will frustrate a customer more than thinking they understand the return policy and then being caught off guard,” Kelly said. “We’re also seeing returns cost a lot of money to merchants: from the postage that it costs to get those returns shipped back to them, the processing at the warehouse and then if they have to do any refurbishment. And we’re seeing that customers are tolerating fees by merchants, so merchants should be looking at ways that they can save on the cost by shifting some of that to consumers.”\n\nKelly said 60% of Loop Returns’ merchants are charging for returns and exchanges now, and consumers are willing to pay for this.\n\n“They should also be thinking about returns as part of the customer experience,” Kelly said. “If a customer has a bad returns experience, that does impact whether they come back and shop with that brand. So you want to look at things that are convenient for them, that are cost-effective for them and the merchant themselves.”\n\nDHL weighs in on e-commerce\n\nOther key challenges retailers face during this time come from higher shipping costs and inflation.\n\nAccording to a 2024 e-commerce survey by Bonn, Germany-headquartered logistics company DHL, online sellers are keeping high hopes despite some challenges. The survey states that 40% of respondents view shipping costs as the biggest threat to their business, while 38% identify inflation as their primary challenge.\n\n“While shipping costs are certainly a concern, we’re also seeing speed and quality gaining prominence over cost,” said Lexi Lopez, a media contact for DHL, in an emailed statement to FreightWaves. “This shift can be attributed to online merchants looking to expand their businesses this year and their increased focus on time-definite delivery options.”\n\nAdditionally, 65% of respondents said that the U.S. presidential candidates’ stances on international trade will affect their vote, with 23% strongly agreeing.\n\n“This underscores the importance of international trade policies in shaping the business environment, as e-commerce businesses seek to navigate and capitalize on global market opportunities,” Lopez said. “The focus on trade views highlights the interconnectedness of politics and business strategies in the current economic climate.”\n\nDuring the previous election year in 2020, 78% of respondents said the U.S. presidential candidates’ views on international trade would affect the way they vote in the election year.\n\nThe post Prime Day: Quick deliveries, easy returns key for retailers appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Cloud-enabled quantum computing will alter industries by providing unprecedented processing speeds for difficult problem-solving and enhancing quantum capabilities via cloud platforms. As a result, cloud computing stocks will continue to rise, and astute investors will avoid them at their peril.\n\nThe cloud computing industry is still expanding, with a market size growth of $76 billion in the first quarter of 2024 alone. With an annual growth rate of around 20.4%, the industry is predicted to reach $678.8 billion by 2024 from its current size. Looking ahead, the market will possibly reach $1.44 trillion by 2029, showing a compound annual growth rate of around 16.40% throughout the projected period.\n\nNorth America continues to lead in market share, mostly due to big cloud stocks with headquarters here. Still, the Asia-Pacific area shows notable development, particularly in China, with a fast increase in cloud infrastructure investment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe three “Strong Buy” cloud stocks we’ll explore come from these fast-growing regions. All of these cloud stocks have double-digit upside and are aggressively building out their cloud computing portfolios.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon‘s (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is up 44% over the last year, thanks partly to its comeback in its cloud business, recovery in online shopping and push for artificial intelligence. Analysts do not expect the party to end for AMZN anytime soon, forecasting a 15.5% upside from the current price, making it a quality pick among cloud stocks.\n\nAmazon Web Services leads the global cloud infrastructure services market with a 31% market share and an annual revenue run rate approaching $100 billion. AWS’s first-quarter 2024 revenue was $25 billion, up 17%.\n\nIn 2024, Amazon will undertake various division projects to boost its cloud computing products and market position. Additionally, AWS’s capital spending on infrastructure development, including generative AI, will “meaningfully increase” in 2024.\n\nAWS is giving $50 million to the Generative AI Impact Initiative, which is aimed at groups in the public sector. This two-year program aims to help these companies speed up their growth by using AWS’s creative AI services and infrastructure.\n\nAWS released Amazon Bedrock in October 2023. This managed service provides a single API for large language models from major AI organizations. Amazon Bedrock allows model tweaking, multistep generative AI tasks and safeguards.\n\nAWS also introduced five capabilities to manage the machine learning service Amazon SageMaker. The new SageMaker capabilities support AWS’s aim to provide high-performance machine learning technology at a reasonable price.\n\nStory continues\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) is up around 14% this year thanks to its growing client base and profit margins. Analysts forecast DDOG to grow further from here, with a consensus 12-month price target of $147.13, indicating a potential upside of 12.5%.\n\nDDOG announced strong financial results for the first quarter of 2024, with $611 million in sales, a 27% year-over-year rise. The company also saw a big surge in bigger customers. There are now about 3,340 customers with annual recurring revenue of $100,000 or more, up from about 2,910 a year ago.\n\nDatadog debuted new cloud and application security features in June 2024, covering production and development settings. This improvement seeks to provide complete security monitoring and control.\n\nDatadog developed the Live Debugger using real-time production data to simplify issue fixing and troubleshooting. A unified OpenTelemetry collector and agent interface is another important upgrade that streamlines data collection and handling observability.\n\nIn addition, Datadog won Appdev’s and Marketplace’s Google Cloud Technology Partner of the Year honors. With over 35 integrations with Google Cloud, Datadog can better handle services like Google Vertex AI, Security Command Center and Google Cloud SQL.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA), despite its reputation as the Amazon of China, is up just 5% in the year thus far, as the markets reflect the regulatory and competitive challenges BABA is facing. In addition, the growing US-China trade tensions are also dampening interest in Chinese stocks, but ignoring BABA is folly, especially when considering its potential upside of 32%.\n\nReaching RMB 25.60 billion, Alibaba Group’s Cloud Intelligence Group noted a 3% quarterly sales rise. Public cloud services and income connected to artificial intelligence drove the expansion. Furthermore, over 90,000 companies have embraced Alibaba Cloud’s proprietary large language model, attesting to the division’s explosive expansion.\n\nWith discounts of up to 59% for overseas clients, Alibaba Cloud also revealed a significant price drop for its main public cloud offerings.\n\nMeanwhile, Alibaba opened its first Product Innovation Center and Partner Management Center outside China. This center in Singapore aims to improve customer service and help the world’s digital change by creating solutions tailored to each market and keeping an eye on product updates.​\n\nAt the Paris 2024 Olympics, Alibaba Cloud and OBS will use AI-enhanced multi-camera replay technology. First demonstrated during the Olympic Qualifier Series in Shanghai, this technology employs machine learning and deep neural networks to rebuild competitive scenes in great detail, making viewing more immersive and putting more eyeballs on Alibaba’s cloud product.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "The NBA has reportedly agreed to terms for its next media rights deal — and it looks like Warner Bros. Discovery's (WBD) TNT Network could lose out.\n\nIf true, it will be a gut punch for the legacy media giant, which has aired NBA games through its TNT network since 1989. It reportedly shells out $1.2 billion annually for the rights, which expire at the end of next season. But Comcast's NBCUniversal is set to take over its current rights package at a much higher price.\n\n\"The big outstanding question that we hope to find some clarity on in the coming days is whether Warner Bros. Discovery will look to exercise its matching rights, which were built into its prior NBA contract, after the league formally approves and presents the offers in writing to [TNT],\" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a new note on Wednesday.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav acknowledged the matching rights to reporters last week at the annual Sun Valley conference, noting that negotiations are still in progress and \"we'll see how it plays out.\"\n\nBut some Wall Street watchers say it is unlikely WBD will match at this point.\n\n\"I don't believe Warner Bros. really wants to spend $1.8-plus billion on a rights package for a much smaller package and with less playoff games than they have now,\" LightShed media analyst Rich Greenfield told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"There is a pretty vicious debate among investors: Is losing the NBA catastrophic for WBD because they're at risk of getting dropped by distributors, whether it's a YouTube TV or a Comcast? Will this sort of be the end of carriage for this company, or at least a significant haircut to carriage? Or is saving a billion-plus dollars a year [actually] going to be a positive financial transaction?\"\n\nGreenfield said the answer largely depends on what other sports rights WBD is able to acquire.\n\n\"You've seen them do some small deals, like college football playoffs, nothing terribly meaningful so far,\" he said. \"But there are rights like UFC coming available. There are other things coming available over the next few years. It'll be interesting to see how aggressive they are if they do, in fact, as we believe, stand down from the NBA.\" Warner Bros. Discovery has aired NBA games through its TNT network since 1989. (Getty Images) (hapabapa via Getty Images)\n\nComcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA) is reportedly taking over WBD's portion of the rights after submitting a reported bid worth $2.5 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal. The network will show about 100 games per season, with half airing exclusively on its streaming service Peacock.\n\nStory continues\n\nDisney (DIS), the NBA's other major broadcast partner, is expected to retain its share of the league's media rights after reportedly agreeing to increase its payment of $1.5 billion a year to $2.6 billion, per the Journal. The company will carry fewer games than in its current package, although it will be able to stream games on its upcoming ESPN streaming platform, set to launch in fall 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) struck a deal with the NBA for a streaming rights package that will be offered through its Prime Video service for a reported $1.8 billion. The Journal said the package includes both regular season and playoff games, plus the play-in tournament and a share of conference finals, which would rotate among the media partners.\n\nIn total, the NBA has reportedly secured a media rights package worth around $76 billion over 11 years — a bullish sign when it comes to the importance of sports to both streamers and traditional broadcast and cable providers.\n\n\"Ultimately, this NBA renewal is just another example of the growing importance — and thus ever inflating costs — of sports rights,\" MoffettNathanson's Fishman said. \"Further, with the creation of a digital-only package at Amazon, more sports than ever before will be available outside of the Pay TV bundle as the distribution ecosystem continues to evolve.\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver.

        "title": "4 Stocks to Invest In as US Retail Sales Hold Steady in June",
        "content": "In June, U.S. retail sales showed remarkable resilience, holding steady at $704.3 billion, according to the latest report from the U.S. Census Bureau, defying expectations of a 0.3% decline. This stable performance follows a revised 0.3% increase in May. Amid economic uncertainties, consumer spending remains a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, driving two-thirds of its activity. Retail sales grew 2.3% year over year last month.\r\n\r\nDespite persistent challenges such as elevated inflation and sustained high interest rates, Americans have shown cautious yet resilient spending habits. Savings accumulated during the pandemic have largely been depleted, prompting a shift toward essential purchases over discretionary spending. This strategic approach reflects consumers' efforts to navigate a volatile economic landscape.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Reserve is closely monitoring these developments, particularly as unemployment edges up and consumer caution grows apparent. The latest inflation data and signs of economic slowdown reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve may soon lower interest rates. Market expectations are leaning toward a potential rate cut during the Sep 17-18 Federal Reserve meeting.\n\nBreaking Down the Sales Number\n\nFurniture and home furnishing stores led with a 0.6% increase in sales, while electronics and appliance stores experienced a modest 0.4% rise. Building material and supplies dealers saw a significant 1.4% jump, while food and beverage stores saw a slight 0.1% increase. Health and personal care stores reported a 0.9% rise, and non-store retailers, predominantly online, showed a robust 1.9% increase.\r\n\r\nClothing and accessories stores also saw positive momentum with a 0.6% increase, alongside miscellaneous stores at 0.3% and general merchandise stores at 0.4%. Food services and drinking places saw a modest 0.3% uptick in sales.\r\n\r\nConversely, motor vehicle and parts dealers experienced a notable 2% decline in sales, while gasoline stations faced a more pronounced drop of 3%. Sales at sporting goods, hobbies, musical instruments and bookstores also decreased slightly by 0.1%.\n\nPast-Year Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\n4 Prominent Picks\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. AMZN is a potential pick. The company’s robust e-commerce platform, renowned for its vast product selection and efficient delivery services, continues to be a primary driver of revenue growth. Prime membership, a cornerstone of Amazon's success, not only fosters customer loyalty but also drives recurring revenues through subscription fees, offering members exclusive access to a myriad of services, such as expedited shipping.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Amazon’s current financial-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 11% and 57.9%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure. AMZN, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 48.2%, on average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nBurlington Stores, Inc. BURL is worth considering. The company has adeptly responded to the challenges in the retail landscape by strategically emphasizing recognizable brands, implementing the best pricing strategy and targeting trade-down shoppers. The implementation of strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing merchandising capabilities, operational efficiency and store optimization is likely to support revenue growth. By focusing on initiatives such as store relocations and downsizing, Burlington Stores aims to improve store productivity. The ability to quickly respond to evolving market dynamics and adjust inventory levels based on real-time data insights has enabled the company to seize opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Burlington Stores’ current fiscal sales and EPS suggests growth of 9.5% and 25.4%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure. This Zacks Rank #1 company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 21.7%, on average.\r\n\r\nInvestors can count on Walmart Inc. WMT. This omnichannel retail giant has been diligently working to strengthen its already formidable presence in the market. The company has embarked on a series of strategic e-commerce initiatives, encompassing acquisitions, partnerships and significant improvements in its delivery and payment systems. Simultaneously, Walmart is committed to elevating its merchandise offerings, ensuring a diverse and appealing product assortment. Innovation extends to its supply chain, wherein the company is enhancing capacity and introducing cutting-edge solutions.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Walmart’s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 4.3% and 9.5%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.3%, on average.\r\n\r\nCostco Wholesale Corporation COST is worth betting on. The discount retailer’s growth strategies, better price management and decent membership trends have been contributing to its performance. Cumulatively, these factors have been aiding this Issaquah, WA-based company in registering decent sales numbers. The company's distinctive membership business model and pricing power set it apart from traditional players. We believe a favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing strength and strong liquidity should benefit Costco.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #2 company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.3%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current financial-year revenues and EPS suggests growth of 5.2% and 10.3%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe Biden administration has tried to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries, from healthcare to groceries to tech.\n\nBut a second Trump administration may not be much friendlier, especially with the giants of Silicon Valley.\n\nWhen Trump was president last decade, his administration launched antitrust investigations into Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Alphabet's Google. His administration also filed a lawsuit against Google, targeting its dominance as a search engine.\n\nThat search engine case, which the Biden administration decided to continue, wrapped up earlier this year, and a decision from a judge is expected soon.\n\nTrump suggested in an interview with Bloomberg Tuesday that major tech companies do need some reining in to limit hazards to children, though he added that he didn't want to go after them violently because the approach could destroy them.\n\nAnd Trump’s new vice-presidential candidate, Sen. J.D. Vance, has called for the breakup of Google while also expressing admiration for Lina Khan, the Federal Trade Commission boss who has led the scrutiny of a number of merger attempts in the tech world.\n\n\"I guess I look at Lina Khan as one of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is doing a pretty good job,\" Vance said in February.\n\nA former FTC official who spoke with Yahoo Finance and asked to remain anonymous agreed an Alphabet-Wiz deal would spark a review, no matter who is in the White House. Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, attends a campaign rally in Ohio. (AP Photo/Jeff Dean) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut a Trump-led DOJ or FTC, the former official said, would more likely favor concessions from Alphabet over litigation if a review raised competition concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegulators could even probe for evidence to learn if Google is already engaged in the cloud cybersecurity market in hopes of challenging the company on grounds that the deal poses a potential, rather than existing, competition threat.\n\nThe former FTC official said that evidence might not support the theory, but such an investigation could be worthwhile for regulators to explore because they are interested in further developing the law on potential threats.\n\nThat, too, could take up substantial time.\n\nIf a deal to buy Wiz does in fact move forward, either the DOJ or FTC would lead any ensuing investigation.\n\nAt preliminary stages, merger and acquisition reviews typically span 30 days, with room for extensions. If officials decide to move beyond preliminary review to what’s known as a second request, the additional investigation can take six to 18 months. Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) (Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images)\n\nOnly then, once a second request is completed, could a legal challenge to the transaction happen.\n\n\"So we're talking at a minimum of probably eight months before there's an actual challenge and, more likely, a year or more before there's an actual challenge,\" Kass said.\n\nThe antitrust experts said competition concerns could include fears that an acquisition would give Alphabet’s Google an opportunity to disadvantage rivals or diminish competition in a downstream market.\n\nNew York University professor Lawrence White said an Alphabet-Wiz deal could also receive scrutiny from regulators abroad.\n\nThat would pose additional complications for the companies since the EU keeps turning up the heat on US tech giants.\n\nJust last month European regulators hit Microsoft (MSFT) with an antitrust charge one day after the same regulatory body charged Apple with violating European Union competition law.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Analyst Thinks Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Has More Upside Potential",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nKing Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management’s chief strategist, recently talked to CNBC about the latest decline in tech stocks and market rotation. Lip said that he’s still bullish on tech stocks and a single event does not show a trend. However, the cause of decline in tech stocks last week was the lower-than-expected CPI data which caused investors to do some “profit taking” and invest in names that can benefit “more” from lower interest rates, according to the analyst. Lip noted that small-cap stocks, real estate stocks, among others, gained ground on the back of this trend.\n\nHowever, Lip has high expectations from the upcoming earnings reports from tech companies. He also said that July has been one of the strongest months for tech stocks. Lip, however, said that major tech companies cannot go on to post record gains and their returns are expected to “fall in line with historical returns.”\n\nLip thinks the economy is entering a “Goldilocks scenario” where growth is steady but not “hot enough” to cause inflation. He reiterated his view that he expects strong earnings growth this year and in 2025, which could be a tailwind for stocks.\n\nAsked what would cause earnings growth of tech companies, Lip said a lot of that comes down to efficient management and strong cash piles these companies have. He also said “slightly” lower interest rates could also be a tailwind for the economy.\n\nSince Lip is bullish on tech stocks and believes major AI companies still have upside potential, we decided to take a look at the top names in his portfolio. These are the top holdings of King Lip, according to CNBC. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Analyst Says Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Has More Upside Potential?\n\nPixabay/ Public Domain\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nKing Lip of BakerAvenue Wealth Management has AMZN in his portfolio as of July 15.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Dan Ives of Wedbush thinks have the potential to grow based on the AI revolution.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\n\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn’t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled “chatbot recommendations” as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strength in the application layer of AI.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates the world’s leading e-commerce marketplace and the largest public cloud platform and has a burgeoning advertising business. We expect to see sustained margin improvement as Amazon’s retail regionalization efforts are bearing fruit and as its advertising business continues to scale ahead of peers. We believe the profitability ramp is still in the early innings as the company turns its attention to improving costs. One area will be inbound shipping, where faster delivery times through reduced freight, miles and packaging can reduce waste. We also see generative AI tailwinds and infrastructure modernization driving re-acceleration in growth at AWS, further enhancing Amazon’s free cash flow compounding potential. In addition, following our early 2024 ESG engagements with Amazon (after multiyear engagements) we were positively inclined to see continued improvements in labor relations (health and safety metrics, benefits and wages), as well as in environmental stewardship (climate targets, reducing packaging materials, electric delivery trucks) and innovation (commitments to responsible AI and data privacy). One of the newly announced initiatives on the retail side is consolidating deliveries into fewer boxes, which reduces packaging.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Tech stocks look set to drop sharply at the U.S. open Wednesday, after ASML's disappointing guidance and worries about Taiwan. Amazon looks set o benefit from its Prime Day, while U.K inflation shows underlying strength.\n\n1. Futures slip as tech stocks slump\n\nU.S. stock futures fell Wednesday, retreating from record levels with the tech sector taking the brunt of the selling after a downbeat forecast from Dutch semiconductor firm ASML (AS:ASML).\n\nBy 04:30 ET (08:30 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 70 points, or 0.2%, lower, S&P 500 futures dropped 45 points, or 0.8%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 270 points, or 1.3%.\n\nThe main indices closed higher on Monday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average rallying more than 700 points and closing at a record, while also posting its best session since June 2023.\n\nHowever, sentiment has turned negative after ASML's (AS:ASML) third-quarter sales forecast fell short of estimates despite a strong second quarter, with sales reaching the high end of guidance.\n\nThere are more earnings to digest Wednesday, including from United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Johnson&Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB).\n\nOn the economic front, the Fed’s Beige Book will also be released, as will housing starts and building permits data for June.\n\n2. TSMC weakens after Trump’s comments\n\nDonald Trump, the Republican candidate for the U.S. presidency, has stepped into the thorny topic of U.S.-China diplomatic relations, saying Taiwan should pay the U.S. for supplying defense equipment as it does not give the country anything.\n\n“I know the people very well, respect them greatly. They did take about 100% of our chip business. I think, Taiwan should pay us for defense,” Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek published late Tuesday, adding that he felt the U.S. was no different than an insurance company.\n\nThe freedom of Taiwan is a key point of contention between the U.S. and China, and the U.S. is Taiwan’s biggest supplier of defense equipment, despite having no formal agreement with the island.\n\nThis resulted in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (NYSE:TSM) stock falling sharply, with the world’s biggest contract chipmaker by far Taiwan’s most valuable company as well as a main point of focus for China.\n\nTaiwan is a key part of the global supply chain for technology, with a bulk of the world’s semiconductors being manufactured in the country.\n\nTSMC will report earnings on Thursday, and is forecast to see a strong quarterly profit on sustained demand from AI. Monthly data showed the company benefited from much higher-than-expected revenue in the second quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Amazon’s Prime Day set for strong sales growth\n\nAmazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) annual Prime Day two-day shopping event concludes later Wednesday, and spending by the online retail giant’s customers could rise 10.5% from last year, according to forecasts from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics, a firm that studies e-commerce transaction data.\n\nShoppers are likely to spend roughly $14 billion over Tuesday and Wednesday, Adobe said, with Amazon turning July, a traditionally slow time for retailers, into an important component of its annual results, accounting for 1% to 2% of its net global sales, according to CFRA Research.\n\nAmazon said that Day 1 of its two-day Prime Day 2023 earned its biggest sales day ever, although it doesn't disclose total sales for Prime Day.\n\nAdobe calculated that shoppers spent $12.7 billion at Amazon last year during Prime Day, which was 6.1% more than what they spent during the 2022 event.\n\n4. UK rate cutting on hold?\n\nDoubts are growing over whether the Bank of England will start cutting U.K. interest rates at its next meeting in August, after British inflation held steady last month, defying forecasts for a slight fall.\n\nConsumer prices rose 0.1% on the month in June, an annual rise of 2.0%, unchanged from the previous month, defying expectations of a drop to 1.9%.\n\nImportantly, core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy factors, held steady at 3.5% on an annual basis, suggesting underlying price pressures remained strong.\n\nThe Bank of England meets at the start of next month, and rate futures now showed investors saw a roughly one in three chance of a rate cut then, down from almost 50-50 before the inflation data.\n\n“We know that services inflation is what the Bank of England is mostly focused on at this stage, and the stabilization at 5.7% YoY in June does not endorse any additional easing bets ahead of the 1st August meeting,” said analysts at ING, in a note.\n\n5. Crude climbs on US inventories draw\n\nCrude prices edged higher Wednesday, as signs of tighter U.S. supplies helped soothe some fears over weakening demand in the rest of the globe, and China in particular.\n\nBy 04:30 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.4% to $80.04 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $84.03 a barrel.\n\nU.S. crude oil inventories fell by 4.4 million barrels last week, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute, considerably more than expected, pointing to a tight market in the world's largest oil producer and consumer.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official storage report later in the session.\n\nCrude markets suffered a sharp tumble over the past week as weak economic data from top oil importer China ramped up concerns over slowing demand.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech weakness, Taiwan concerns, Amazon's Prime Day - what's moving markets\n\nIndia's food subsidies to cost 11% more than initial plan, sources say\n\nFactbox-India's economy poised for robust growth ahead of annual budget\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Consumer spending makes up 70% of the GDP and is a driving force of the global economy. Without consumer spending, companies go out of business and lay off workers. People spending less money can create a negative feedback loop for the economy until the course reverses.\n\nWhile fads come and go, some companies continue to generate revenue from consumers. These companies are also in good positions to offer numerous products and raise prices when necessary. Investing in consumer stocks can lead to solid long-term returns and potentially allow you to outperform the stock market. Some consumer stocks also come with diversified revenue streams and steady dividend payouts.\n\nEach consumer stock to buy now has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. They have also delivered rising revenue and profits in recent quarters. Investing in these growth stocks can be a solid move for long-term investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) offers affordable prices for various consumer goods. It’s the largest grocer and sells various products beyond food. The retailer has been in business for more than 60 years and has navigated various economic cycles during that stretch. Recent quarterly results suggest that Walmart can continue to grow. The company reported 6.0% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 FY25, while adjusted earnings per share jumped by 22% year-over-year.\n\nWhile the company had impressive revenue growth, investors should monitor e-commerce and advertising revenue. Both segments were up by more than 20% year-over-year and can strengthen Walmart’s profit margins in the long run. Profits are strong as they are and have contributed to the stock’s 32% year-to-date gain. Furthermore, shares are up by 84% over the past five years.\n\nWalmart stock trades at a 30 P/E ratio and offers a 1.19% yield. Thirty analysts rate Walmart a Buy.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nDeckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) is the athletic apparel company behind iconic brands like HOKA and UGG. The stock joined the S&P 500 earlier this year and is up 35% year-to-date. The stock has more than quintupled over the past five years. Deckers Outdoor can gain additional momentum due to a 6-for-1 forward stock split. Although stock splits do not increase a company’s intrinsic value, they bring more attention to a stock and make it easier to trade options. Call and put options trading can increase a stock’s volatility.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street analysts have rated the stock as a Strong Buy and believe it can gain 19% from current levels. It’s easy to give the company’s strong Q4 FY24 results; it’s why analysts are optimistic; given the t quarter, Deckers Outdoor reported a 21.2% year-over-year increase in net sales. Domestic sales were up by 19.4% year-over-year, while national sales jumped by 25.2% year-over-year. Net income surged by 39% year-over-year, resulting in a 13.3% net profit margin for the company.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) makes buying products across various categories easy and convenient. The company’s online marketplace is one of the most recognizable e-commerce sites on the web. The stock has been in the spotlight for many years, first as a FAANG member and now as a member of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nShares are up by 28% year-to-date and have almost doubled over the past five years. Even with those gains, Wall Street analysts believe that more growth is on the way. The average price target implies a potential 15% upside for the stock. Amazon is currently rated as a Strong Buy among 43 analysts.\n\nThe company’s first quarter results have rewarded analysts’ optimism. Revenue increased by 13% year-over-year, featuring double-digit growth rates in domestic and international markets. Amazon Web Services sales increased by 17% year-over-year, while other segments like advertising and groceries also delivered solid gains.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in DECK and AMZN.

        "title": "Amazon Prime Day: Consumers expected to spend nearly $14 billion during e-commerce holiday",
        "content": "Amazon's (AMZN) most anticipated deal event of the year is here.\n\nOn Tuesday, the e-commerce giant kicked off Prime Day, its annual two-day promotional event. Prime Day began nine years ago as a way to highlight the value of a Prime membership by offering deals and benefits for members.\n\n\"When it comes to Prime Day, Amazon still sets the agenda and takes the majority of sales,\" eMarketer analyst Sky Canaves told Yahoo Finance (video above). \"We expect that US consumers will spend nearly $14 billion online during these two days.\"\n\nLast year, Prime Day brought in $13 billion in sales, with 60% of those sales coming from Amazon, while the rest came from third-party sellers, according to eMarketer. Prime members purchased more than 375 million items during the event last year, Amazon said, making it the \"biggest Prime Day event ever.\"\n\nThis year's Prime Day is expected to surpass that record, though the pace of revenue growth has slowed. Nearly 80% of online shoppers anticipate the best deals of the year, according to research conducted by marketing platform Skai.\n\nOther retailers such as Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), and Costco (COST) have followed Amazon by offering competing deals to boost sales. For instance, during Target's Circle Week, a seven-day sale that ran July 7-13, the retailer offered members of its loyalty rewards program up to 50% off clothing, skin care, fragrance, technology, and food items.\n\nThe shopping events come as consumer spending continues to hold up despite concerns over a slowing US economy. As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported Tuesday, retail sales were flat in June, coming in better than the expected 0.3% decline.\n\nBeauty category expected to shine\n\nCanaves expects essential goods and beauty to outperform other categories.\n\n\"Beauty is a category where Amazon's online sales continue to outpace overall e-commerce growth for the category,\" Canaves said. \"And it's been a very strong, resilient category, and one where brands are keen to get on Amazon because so many consumers are there looking for beauty products.\"\n\nAmazon has been gaining share in health and beauty, one of its fastest-growing product categories. In addition to rivaling other retailers such as Ulta (ULTA) and Sephora (LVMUY), Morgan Stanley predicts Amazon will overtake Walmart as the US's top beauty retailer by 2025. An Amazon package moves along a conveyor belt at an Amazon's DAX7 delivery station during Amazon's annual Prime Day event on Tuesday, July 16, 2024, in South Gate, Calif. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nPart of Amazon's push into beauty has been expanding its offerings. Canaves pointed out that Amazon has recently attracted more premium brands, such as Clinique and Kiehl's.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to a 2023 McKinsey & Company report, the \"premiumization\" trend in beauty and fragrance is expected to continue in the coming years. McKinsey estimates the prestige beauty category will grow 8% per year between 2022 and 2027 versus a 5% growth rate for mass beauty.\n\nThat's leading prestige brands who previously skipped over setting up an Amazon storefront to reconsider the marketplace.\n\n\"If the beauty brands aren't selling [products on Amazon], then third-party resellers will,\" she said.\n\nClick here for all of the latest retail stock news and events to better inform your investing strategy\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The market offers plenty of options, but only a select few have the potential to be true long-term winners. Not many people can look at a company and say that they have good enough conviction that the business in question will remain relevant a few decades from now. Even half a decade can completely change everything—as some can speak from personal experience.\n\nThus, it is important not to get “tunnel visioned” and keep your skin in the game. The means to an end matter. You should always be ready to sell if any of these companies become obsolete or face major stumbles in the coming decades. It pays to be flexible.\n\nWe’ll be looking at seven stocks that I personally think will be relevant in 20 or 30-plus years. Their historical records and market dominance give me peace of mind for the long haul. However, it’s equally important to focus on short-term growth. Remember, if you only wanted stability, you could park your money in bonds. We want our money to compound. Thus, each pick offers a blend of stability and growth and aims at nearer-term returns, too. Let’s take a look!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntuitive Surgical (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:INTU) makes tools for robotic-assisted surgery and is riding high on the megatrends of minimally invasive procedures and an aging population. Q1 procedure volumes surged 16% year-over-year (YOY).\n\nThis company simply has a massive runway for expansion. With its current clearances, the company estimates it can reach around seven million patients annually, over three times its current patient base. New product launches like the da Vinci 5 in the U.S. and Europe should further fuel adoption.\n\nFinancially, Intuitive Surgical is firing on all cylinders. Its Q1 revenue jumped 11% to $1.89 billion, while GAAP net income soared 53% to $545 million. Analysts are bullish, too.\n\nSure, challenges exist, such as competition in China. However, with the stock up 32% year-to-date (YTD) and demographics in its favor, Intuitive Surgical’s best days are still ahead.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) has been a standout performer in the stock market lately. The stock is up over 30% YTD. It has even been outshining Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Costco reported strong Q3 of fiscal year 2024 results, with revenue growing 9.1% to $57.39 billion and e-commerce sales jumping an impressive 20.7%. Net income surged nearly 30% to $1.68 billion. Same store sales growth has also started to pick up.\n\nStory continues stocks to buy: costco same store sales growth\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nFurthermore, analysts are bullish on the stock. Oppenheimer raised its price target to $950, citing Costco’s solid June sales driven by non-foods and its upcoming membership fee hike. Other firms like Baird, Loop Capital and Stifel also boosted their targets. The average 12-month analyst price target is now $910.05, implying an 8% upside.\n\nCostco has consistently been gaining market share. It benefits from loyal members and a compelling value proposition. Nevertheless, Costco does lag behind its rivals in key growth areas like e-commerce and advertising. Thus, future gains may need to come more from earnings growth than valuation expansion. I’m still very bullish on the long run.\n\nLinde (LIN) Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical company\n\nSource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.com\n\nLinde (NASDAQ:LIN) is a leading global industrial gases and engineering company that serves a wide range of industries. I believe Linde will remain one of the most consistent and stable stocks in the market going forward. The industrial gas sector has huge staying power, and Linde’s revenues and profits should stay sticky even as the white-collar world rapidly changes.\n\nSeveral megatrends are providing tailwinds for Linde’s business, including the clean energy transition, digitization and the rise of advanced electronics manufacturing. Linde is investing heavily to capture growth from these trends, such as its recent $150 million investment to supply industrial gases to the world’s first large-scale green steel plant. Analysts are bullish on the stock, with an average price target of $489.31 (as of writing). That implies around an 11.7% upside.\n\nAlso, Linde delivered solid Q1 of 2024 results, with 6% operating profit growth. The stock has surged 115% in just the past five years. Thus, I’m optimistic Linde will continue its steady trajectory as a core industrial holding. Companies tied to long-standing industries with enduring demand rarely underperform.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (BAH) Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) provides management and technology consulting services to government agencies and corporations. BAH stock has climbed an impressive 136% over the past five years, and I believe it has room to run higher.\n\nThe company is deeply embedded with many federal agencies that are expanding operations as the geopolitical environment grows more complex. BAH’s expertise in areas like AI, cybersecurity and digital transformation aligns perfectly with the increasing technology needs of its government clients. I expect federal agencies will only become more reliant on the type of sophisticated solutions Booz Allen Hamilton delivers.\n\nThe firm posted Q1 earnings per share of $1.33 and revenue of $2.77 billion both topping expectations. While analyst opinions are mixed, the average price target of $168.78 points to further upside potential. I’m optimistic Booz Allen can sustain its impressive growth trajectory as it capitalizes on powerful tailwinds in the government services market. This is a high-quality company that looks poised to thrive for decades to come.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe world’s largest retailer of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) operates over 10,500 stores globally and generates over $600 billion in annual revenue. The company has been one of the best-performing retail stocks in 2024 so far, with shares jumping 29% in the first half of the year. Walmart crushed earnings expectations in Q1, with revenue growing 6% to $161.5 billion.\n\nThe company is rapidly automating its supply chain, which should massively increase profit margins in the coming years. In addition, Walmart is gaining grocery market share, growing e-commerce sales by 24%, and seeing huge tailwinds across the business. Per-store sales have naturally been booming, too. WMT sales per store\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nI’m confident this retail giant will continue to thrive for decades to come. While many retailers are struggling, Walmart looks poised to go from strength to strength.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s leading e-commerce and cloud computing company. The company offers unparalleled exposure to two massive growth industries for decades to come. No other U.S. company can match Amazon’s e-commerce dominance.\n\nBeyond retail, Amazon’s AWS cloud business gives it a stronghold in another critical sector. If artificial intelligence (AI) fulfills its immense promise, cloud providers like AWS stand to benefit enormously. Amazon is investing heavily to capitalize on the AI revolution. The company recently committed $230 million to expand its Generative AI Accelerator program for startups.\n\nAmazon’s stock is up over 28.5% this year (as of writing) as investors recognize its leadership in e-commerce and cloud. Moreover, today and tomorrow’s Prime Days event could set new sales records, with JPMorgan analysts highlighting AI-powered shopping tools as a key driver.\n\nAmazon’s financials are also robust, with $143 billion in Q1 revenue and 13% YOY growth. The company continues to innovate across its businesses while improving profitability. Amazon is uniquely positioned to ride multiple technological megatrends in the coming decades.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up.

This company has its hands on everything.\n\nWindows remains hugely popular globally. Microsoft’s suite of productivity apps spans industries. Moreover, Microsoft deserves immense credit for making the AI breakthrough a reality through its massive early investments in OpenAI.\n\nThose investments are now paying off handsomely. OpenAI is using Microsoft’s Azure cloud to power its AI systems. Additionally, Microsoft will receive a substantial share of OpenAI’s future profits. And, the company maintains significant influence over OpenAI’s direction.\n\nIn Q3 of 2024, revenue grew 17% YOY to $61.9 billion. Azure cloud revenue surged 31%. Cloud adoption is accelerating across industries. And of course, AI integration is driving increased demand for Microsoft’s products and services.\n\nFew companies are as well-positioned to capitalize on the most important technology trends shaping our future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "On Prime Day, Amazon workers like me pay a high price",
        "content": "Since 2020, I have worked at an [hotlink ignore=true]Amazon Warehouse outside St. Louis. This week is my fourth Prime Day. I’m not sure my body can take it. I started at Amazon with a sense of optimism. I was working for a company known around the world for delivering anything, anytime, anywhere. I was proud to be helping folks trapped at home during the pandemic get what they needed for their families.But that feeling quickly vanished. Just a few months in, I could already feel the toll the job was taking on my muscles and mental state. My legs grew numb, and I was constantly fatigued. On average, I’m expected to pack around 600 items every hour during my shift, scanning each and making sure it’s moving properly down the belt. Taking a break is nearly impossible. At most, Amazon plays a 10-second safety video a few times a day telling us to stretch. Otherwise, I move as quickly as possible because if I don’t make my rate, I could be written up and fired. And even if I do hit that goal, managers tell me to speed up. Amazon’s relentless push for speed is mentally draining and physically dangerous. It leads to injuries as we break our bodies down to meet our quotas. Last year, I was rushing to my workstation, tripped over a misplaced pallet, fell on my face, busted my nose and lips and suffered a torn meniscus. I was out of work for almost two months. Working in an Amazon warehouse is very dangerous every day of the year, but during peak times like Prime Day, which takes place this year on July 16 and 17, our jobs are even more perilous.New data from Amazon shows just how dangerous Prime is for workers like me. The Strategic Organizing Center, a coalition of labor unions, analyzed the timing of injuries for 2023 and found injury levels at Amazon warehouses spiked during the company’s peak operational periods, including Prime Days and Cyber Monday. The SOC found that in 2023 Amazon reported its single highest weekly serious injury total, 1,066 cases, during the week of Prime Day in July, representing a 48 percent increase from the previous week.Working during prime days is grueling. Our quotas go up even higher than usual. We are told to stay hydrated, yet we barely have time to use the bathroom, and Amazon’s 8- to 10-second stretch breaks typically disappear. I have to work extra hours and extra shifts—resulting in 11.5-hour shifts for five days a week.During Prime, Amazon freezes vacation—making it difficult to see family—and, aside from weekends, all I have time to do outside of work is eat and sleep. Each year, it seems to get worse, with fewer breaks and more workers suffering injuries. One coworker was moved to a new area that was understaffed during Prime, wasn’t trained and broke her ankle. Working during Prime makes you feel like you walked 50 miles in one day. You go home, get a few hours of sleep and do another 50 miles the next day. You lose feeling in your feet. In 2021, Amazon committed to cutting its injury rate in half and becoming “Earth’s Safest Place to Work,” but in the three years since that promise, the company’s total injury rate has gone down less than two percent. Amazon leadership barely talks about safety anymore. Instead, they brag about delivering “at the fastest speeds ever” and talk about their plans to cut costs and “invest in speed.”I want people to know there’s a human cost to all of those Prime Day deals, delivered at the click of a mouse. I’m 58 and would like to stay at Amazon, as long as my body holds up, but something has to change. That’s why I’m organizing for a union alongside Amazon workers nationwide to create a better, fairer place to work, where workers get living wages and a say on the job. A union is the best way for us to make Amazon safe for all warehouse workers, and we will keep building our strength in numbers and speaking out until we win. This Prime Day will push my body to the limit, but I believe it will also push more workers to join us in our fight to make Amazon a place where we can be proud to work.  +++ Editor's note: The following is a condensed and edited response from Amazon The information we’d need to verify these claims wasn’t provided to us and it’s unreasonable to take a single anecdote to make conclusions about safety at a company with more than a million workers. Employee safety is our top priority. We’ve made measurable progress on safety including improving our recordable incident rate by 28% since 2019, and our rate of injuries that result in lost time by 75%. We've consistently used 2019 as our benchmark to gauge progress, and that’s clear in all of our annual safety updates.Like any business, we have performance expectations for all of our teams, but they aren’t static and they’re based on multiple factors, including the overall performance of the entire team across an individual site.Employees are free to take breaks whenever they need them to use the restroom, grab water, or speak to a manager or HR. This is in addition to the two breaks they receive each shift, and their lunch break.There’s no truth to the claim that “working in an Amazon warehouse is very dangerous every day of the year.”During times of high demand, employees are sometimes asked to work overtime, but they’re never asked to work more than 12 hours per day and no more than 60 hours in a week. There are far more people working in the buildings during peak times and more total hours worked by those employees—facts that the SOC report fails to acknowledge or account for.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore commentary published by Fortune:\n\n3 in 4 Gen Zers are interested in vocational training as uncertainty and AI shape the minds of the next ‘toolbelt generation’ I connect U.S. manufacturers with their workforce.

        "title": "Amazon Prime Day causes an ‘outrageous level’ of workplace injuries, says Bernie Sanders",
        "content": "It’s the most wonderful time of the year. Not Christmas, but Amazon Prime Day season. That’s at least if you’re a consumer cashing in on deals offered by the e-commerce giant, which ranks No. 2 on the Fortune 500. And it’s particularly lucrative for Amazon, which in 2023 recorded $12.7 billion in sales for 375 million products over the course of just two days.\n\nBut Prime Day is doomsday for Amazon warehouse workers who suffer injuries at an “outrageous level,” during the high-traffic week, according to a report released Tuesday by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nDuring Prime Day week in 2019, almost half of all warehouse workers at Amazon suffered injuries on the job, according to the report, which cites “internal Amazon documents.” Sanders blames the “incredibly dangerous working conditions at Amazon” on “the type of corporate greed that the American people are sick and tired of,” he said in a statement. The report also says there were nearly 45 injuries per 100 workers during the week of Prime Day in 2019.\n\nAmazon denies these findings.\n\n“Unfortunately, this report—which was not shared with us before publishing—ignores our progress and paints a one-sided, false narrative using only a fraction of the information we’ve provided,” Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson, tells Fortune. “It draws sweeping and inaccurate conclusions based on unverified anecdotes, and it misrepresents documents that are several years old and contained factual errors and faulty analysis.”\n\nThe report released by Sanders’ office includes injuries the company is not required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Still, Amazon’s rate of “recordable” injuries, or injuries the company is required to disclose to OSHA, was still more than double the industry average, with more than 10 injuries per 100 workers during that same time period, according to the report. The most recent data provided by Amazon was from 2019, a spokesperson for Sanders tells Fortune.\n\n“Amazon, the second-largest private employer in America, is worth over $2 trillion. It is owned by Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest man in America, worth over $2 billion,” Anna Bahr, director of communications for Sanders, tells Fortune. “Amazon should be the safest place to work in America, not one of the most dangerous.”\n\nAmazon also denies the claims in the report that it systematically underreports injuries, and the allegations that its actual injury rates are higher than publicly reported are false. The company is required to report every injury “that needs more than basic first aid,” Nantel says.\n\nStory continues\n\n“While any company might make an occasional clerical error, after a nearly six-month investigation that gave OSHA access to all of our internal injury and incident report notes, and closed-door interviews with our associates, OSHA found no intentional, willful, or systemic errors in our reporting,” Nantel says. Instead, since 2019 Amazon has made “significant progress” in reducing its recordable incident rate by 28%.\n\nWhat the report shows\n\nThe full report also includes findings from interviews with more than 100 Amazon workers, which included sentiments about the pressure they face to meet demand during Prime Day and the holiday season. It “demonstrates the company’s blatant disregard for the safety of its workers,” according to the report.\n\nDespite knowing the risks and dangers associated with peak seasons like Prime Day and the holidays, Amazon consistently fails to adequately staff its warehouses, according to the report. Indeed, an October 2020 report used for this study showed the company’s operating headcount is less than 80%, which indicates Amazon regularly operates with a high number of open positions. Nantel, however, says these claims are not true.\n\n“We carefully plan and staff up for major events, ensure that we have excess capacity across our network, and design our network so that orders are automatically routed to sites that can handle unexpected spikes in volume,” Nantel says.\n\nBeing overworked during Prime, holiday season\n\nAmazon receives significantly more orders than it does during other periods, according to the report. One worker told the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP), which released the report, their delivery station had to process twice as many packages each day during Prime Day and the holidays. Workers prepare customer orders for dispatch as they work around goods stored inside an Amazon.co.uk fulfillment centre in Peterborough, central England, on November 15, 2017. Shops could be seeing the effect of consumers postponing purchases until \"Black Friday\" on November 24, 2017, a day of sales in the United States that has become increasingly popular in Britain. (Photo by CHRIS J RATCLIFFE / AFP) (Photo by CHRIS J RATCLIFFE/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n“Peak hits, they blew out the warehouse,” the worker told the HELP committee. “We got 120,000 packages when we normally handle 60,000.” In response, Amazon requires employees to work faster and work longer shifts, according to the report.\n\nThis can be particularly strenuous during the summer, when warehouse temperatures skyrocket. In 2022, Amazon warehouse worker Rafael Reynaldo Mota Frias, 42, died during a Prime sales rush. Fellow workers told The Daily Beast they believed he was being overworked and was overheated. Amazon, however, denies those claims, telling Fortune the incident was due to an underlying medical condition and pointing to an OSHA report that found Frias died of \"myocardial fibrosis unrelated to work.\"\n\nWhile the findings of the report put a target on Amazon’s back, it’s not just the e-commerce giant that has similar workplace issues.\n\n“The recent injuries reported by Amazon workers highlight the urgent issue that workplace safety is not always guaranteed, especially in the manufacturing industry,” Cristian Grossmann, a former frontline worker and author of The Rise of the Frontline Worker, tells Fortune.\n\nGrossman also serves as CEO of Beekeeper, a software company for frontline workers. A 2024 study by Beekeeper, in which 2,000 manufacturing workers worldwide were surveyed, found safety concerns were among the top stressors for frontline teams.\n\n“For decades, unsafe working conditions have been a persistent concern for frontline workers and managers with inadequate measures taken to prioritize and protect these frontline employees,” Grossmann says.\n\nStill, Amazon insists it’s made progress in improving its safety standards and working conditions for warehouse employees.\n\n“If someone wants to truly understand the facts about our safety record and our progress toward being the safest company in the industries in which we operate, we encourage them to review our annual safety report or come visit one of our fulfillment sites to see for themselves,” Nantel says.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Transportation Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "It’s not been a great year for transportation stocks.\n\nThe benchmark SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (NYSEARCA:XTN) has fallen 9% over the past 12 months. That’s a dramatic divergence from the S&P 500, which is up 25% over the same time span.\n\nThere are several reasons for this. For one, the transportation ETF has investments in airlines and electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) companies, both of which have seen heavy volatility recently. In addition, broader macroeconomic concerns have caused investors to worry about falling freight volumes for cargo transportation companies.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, given the selloffs across the sector, many of these fears are already baked into the sector’s stock prices. These are seven of the most promising transportation stocks in own for Q3 of this year and beyond.\n\nFedEx (FDX) A FedEx employee loads a FedEx Express truck in Manhattan.\n\nSource: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com\n\nFedEx (NYSE:FDX) is a gigantic transportation company primarily engaged in parcel delivery services. With annual revenues of more than $80 billion, FedEx is an integral part of the logistics network that ships freight around North America and internationally.\n\nFor years, FedEx had a simple attractive investment narrative around growth from e-commerce shopping. People ordering from the internet, rather than going to the mall, was a fantastic development for the parcel delivery industry.\n\nHowever, investors soured on this theme in recent years due to worries that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) would eat into the market. However, it seems that Amazon has dialed back its investments in logistics and fulfillment assets. While Amazon and other competitors are certainly a concern, FedEx’s core market remains robust.\n\nThe company’s most recent earnings report reaffirmed that view. FDX spiked 15% higher following a strong report and news around strategic actions to further improve profitability. This has some analysts suggesting that FDX stock could have 100% upside from here.\n\nAirbus (EADSY) A photograph of the sun setting from a vantage point above the clouds.\n\nSource: OlegRi/ShutterStock.com\n\nAircraft manufacturer Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY) has a tremendous opportunity right now.\n\nThe large aircraft market is effectively a duopoly, with only Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) offering the largest classes and highest-range jets available for commercial aviation. While there is some competition in the regional jet market, Boeing and Airbus have tremendous pricing power for their models such as Boeing 747s and Airbus A380s.\n\nAnd, for the time being, Boeing is facing tremendous scrutiny. After a series of crashes and other technical mishaps, regulators are laying into the company. In fact, Boeing recently pled guilty to criminal charges related to past accidents. And Boeing mechanics allege that unsafe behavior has continued to occur at the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis should lead to an improved outlook for Airbus, as the only viable competitor for larger-class jets. Indeed, the industry is facing a plane shortage right now, so Airbus should have a huge demand ramp-up in coming months and years. EADSY stock has dipped over the past quarter, offering investors an improved entry point right now.\n\nUnion Pacific (UNP) United Pacific (UNP) switch on tracks near Kansas City.\n\nSource: Michael Rosebrock / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnion Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is one of North America’s class one railroads. It has dominant market share on many freight routes within the western part of the U.S.\n\nIn addition, Union Pacific has been active in the Mexican market for over 30 years. It jumped onto that trend just prior to the time the NAFTA free trade deal went into effect. Also, Union Pacific owns more than one-quarter of a leading Mexican railroad, Ferromex, giving it upside from Mexico’s growing manufacturing boom.\n\nUNP stock is down around 5% year-to-date (YTD). Analysts are worried that a slowing economy may lower freight demand. That’s certainly a valid concern. But upcoming interest rate cuts may jumpstart freight shipments. In any case, with the recent underperformance, Union Pacific is on offer at a fair 20 times forward earnings today.\n\nGrupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte (OMAB) international stocks mexico\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGrupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte (NASDAQ:OMAB) — or North Central Airport Group in English — is a private Mexican airport operator.\n\nAbout 25 years ago, Mexico’s government decided to privatize the majority of its country’s commercial airports, splitting them up into four distinct operating groups. OMAB got the key airports near the U.S.-Mexican border that are now at the center of the current reshoring/manufacturing boom.\n\nThe company’s flagship airport serves Monterrey, which is Mexico’s second largest urban area, trailing only Mexico City. Monterrey is also Mexico’s hub for numerous manufacturing industries including automobiles. That was reflected in Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) decision to locate its multi-billion dollar gigafactory in Monterrey. As more businesses locate in Monterrey, that should increase both business travel and freight-related services at the city’s airport.\n\nFurther, OMAB has been able to cash in on the rising prosperity in its region. It has grown its revenues from $451 million in 2019 to $851 million in 2023, showing tremendous upside despite the Covid-19 related traffic disruption. In addition, this business is highly profitable, trading around 15 times forward earnings while offering a 7% dividend yield.\n\nCorporacion America Airports (CAAP) two women carrying luggage in an airport\n\nSource: Shine Nucha / Shutterstock\n\nAirports are a tremendous asset class. They have a monopoly within their local market. And travelers are generally not price sensitive and are willing to splash out a lot on money on food, drinks and duty-free shopping. Airports have other attractive ancillary revenue streams as well like hotels, car rentals and advertising.\n\nThis makes Corporacion America Airports (NYSE:CAAP) an attractive investment. It is the largest private airport operator in the world by number of airports held.\n\nCorporacion America Airports is most known for its dozens of Argentine airport properties, including the facilities serving the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. The airport group also holds airports in Italy, Armenia, Ecuador, Brazil and Uruguay.\n\nCAAP stock had collapsed following its 2018 IPO. It fell victim to the one-two punch of the Argentina hyperinflation crisis and the 2020 travel shutdowns. However, the stock has come roaring back, rising almost 1,000% from its lows, as travel demand has surged to new highs.\n\nAlso, reasons for optimism shine through on the political front. Argentina elected Javier Milei, a staunchly pro-business president, in its 2023 election. And there’s another positive. Milei previously served as the chief economist for Corporacion America Airports prior to entering politics. All this has CAAP stock set to lift off thanks to strong tailwinds on both the economic and political fronts.\n\nForward Air (FWRD) Plenty of shipping containers stacked at the Port of Hamburg and blue sky\n\nSource: Hieronymus Ukkel / Shutterstock.com\n\nForwardAir (NASDAQ:FWRD) is an air freight and logistics company. It operates in two segments of Expedited Freight and Intermodal. And it provides services such as local pick-up and delivery, less-than-truckload services, intermodal container drayage services and other such items. Forward Air serves various clients such as cargo carriers, freight forwarders, third-party logistics firms and retailers.\n\nFor many years, FWRD stock as on a steady upward trajectory. Shares rose from around $15 coming out of the 2008 financial crisis to its recent peak of more than $100. But disaster struck over the past year, with shares falling as much as 90% since July 2023.\n\nThat’s primarily due to a controversial merger with Omni Logistics. Omni itself was a rollup of several smaller freight companies. Many analysts and investors have been skeptical about how long it will take to combine Omni with Forward Air and wring out anticipated merger synergies.\n\nHowever, the tide is turning. FWRD stock has doubled off its recent lows following the appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) along with an activist investor taking a large stake in the company. As the company gets back on track, shares should have considerable upside.\n\nJ.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) A photo of a J.B.

Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ:JBHT) is an intermodal transportation company which offers a variety of services for its end clients.\n\nThe company derives around half its revenues from shipping its own containers along class one railroads. It also offerw tailored fleet services, for-hire truckload, truck brokering and final-mile delivery services.\n\nJBHT stock has historically been an expensive one compared to other transportation picks due to its strong management team and diversified business model. However, the stock has pulled back more than 15% YTD due to mounting concerns around the broader macroeconomic environment.\n\nThat gives investors a decent discount on this leading transportation stock. And the company could have considerable upside as it taps into AI functionality to improve its clients’ supply chains.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in CAAP and OMAB stock.

        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL shares have rallied 33.7% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 29.1%. It is benefiting from strength in the Google Services segment, which is mainly driven by Search, YouTube and Android.\r\n\r\nThe company is continuously expanding YouTube’s capabilities to strengthen Google Services segment..\r\n\r\nPer a 9to5Google report, Alphabet recently added a “Mark as played” feature to YouTube Music, allowing podcasters to mark an episode as played or unplayed, with confirmation messages appearing in the overflow menu.\r\n\r\nGoogle also added an official sound search feature to YouTube Music, allowing users to query over 100 million official songs by sound while also testing AI-generated conversational radio for U.S. Premium subscribers.\r\n\r\nAlphabet partnered with Garmin GRMN in a bid to boost YouTube Music’s adoption rate by expanding its reach to more platforms.\r\n\r\nThe YouTube Music app is now available on Garmin IQ Connect smartwatches. The app experience is similar to Wear OS watches, with users able to search their library for music and podcasts and a slick playing page with physical buttons for play, pause, and skip.\r\n\r\nGrowing YouTube Music efforts will enable Alphabet to capitalize on the solid growth opportunity present in the music streaming market, which, per a Grand View Research report, is expected to witness a CAGR of 14.4% between 2023 and 2030.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it would also aid Alphabet in narrowing down its gap from Spotify SPOT and Amazon AMZN. \r\n\r\nPer a Statista report, Spotify maintained its dominant position in the music streaming space in 2023 with a market share of 32%.\r\n\r\nAmazon, on the other hand, is making continuous efforts to strengthen its foothold in the music streaming market with Amazon Music. It recently introduced Maestro, an AI playlist generator, in Amazon Music, enabling users to create any and all playlists, with the feature currently in beta for select U.S. customers.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nExpanding Google Services Aids Prospects\n\nGoogle rolled-out an updated version of YouTube’s \"Erase Song\" tool which allows content creators to remove copyrighted songs from videos without affecting other audio.\r\n\r\nThe company also introduced new features like Jump Ahead and Shorts Picture-in-Picture for YouTube Premium subscribers. \r\n\r\nIn addition to YouTube, Alphabet is making concerted efforts to enhance its search and Android capabilities in a bid to further boost the Google Services segment.\r\n\r\nAlphabet bolstered its search capabilities with the addition of a “Listen to this page” text-to-speech feature on Google Chrome, enabling users to hear texts on web pages. This new feature will support several languages including Arabic, Bengali, English, French, Chinese, German, Hindi and Portuguese, to name a few.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s launch of Circle to Search allows users to now circle what they see on their Android screens, ask a question about an image or object in a video, and get an AI overview with Lens.\r\n\r\nIt also strengthened Android features with its latest user interface (UI) redesign for one of its Android apps, Google Messages. \r\n\r\nThe company announced a feature on Google Maps that shows entrances for buildings to some select users, addressing the issue of navigating to specific building portions on the map.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nAlphabet’s strength in the Google Services segment is expected to drive its overall financial performance. Its robust cloud division and growing momentum across autonomous driving space, and deepening focus on the wearables category, are other positives. Generative AI strength is expected to boost the company’s long-term prospects. \r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $291.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.6%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.61 per share, indicating a 31.2% rise from the year-ago figure.

        "title": "Amazon Prime Day is a major cause of injuries for warehouse workers, Senate review says",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon’s popular Prime Day sales event has been “a major cause of injuries” for warehouse workers who pick and pack customer orders at the e-commerce giant's facilities across the United States, according to a report released Tuesday by Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe report, which draws information from a year-long Senate committee investigation into Amazon's safety practices and relied on internal company data from 2019 and 2020, said peak shopping times – including the holiday shopping period – resulted in the “highest weekly injury rates” for warehouse workers.\n\nThe preliminary report complied by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which Sanders chairs, also was based on interviews with more than 100 current and former Amazon employees. This year's two-day Prime Day event started Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement, Sanders said the “incredibly dangerous working conditions at Amazon” highlighted in the report are a \"perfect example of the type of corporate greed that the American people are sick and tired of.\"\n\n“Despite making $36 billion in profits last year and providing its CEO with over $275 million in compensation over the past three years, Amazon continues to treat its workers as disposable and with complete contempt for their safety and well-being,\" the Vermont independent said. “That is unacceptable, and that has got to change.”\n\nLabor unions and safety experts have long criticized Amazon, alleging the company’s focus on speed and fast deliveries puts workers in danger. In recent years, some states have passed laws aimed at Amazon to curb the use of warehouse productivity quotas, though the company claims it doesn't employ them.\n\nAccording to the Senate report, 45 out of 100 warehouse at Amazon received injuries during the 2019 Prime Day event. The number included minor injuries the company was not required to disclose to the federal government, such as bruises and superficial cuts, but also serious ones such as concussions that should have been reported, it said.\n\nAmazon disputed the finding.\n\n“The claims that we systemically underreport injuries, and that our actual injury rates are higher than publicly reported, are false,” Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a prepared statement. “We’re required to report every injury that needs more than basic first aid, and that’s what we do.”\n\nWhile Amazon “might make an occasional clerical error,” a six-month federal investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration found “no intentional, willful, or systemic errors” in the company’s reporting, Nantel said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe report also alleged that Amazon had a practice of failing to refer workers for outside medical care because doing so could affect whether an injury should be considered “recordable” and referred to OSHA. Even when injuries were serious and might have required extra medical attention, workers often received first aid before being sent back to work instead of to a doctor, it said.\n\nAmazon has acknowledged in the past that its warehouse injury rates had been higher compared to its peers. In March, the company said its allocated over $750 million to safety efforts for this year.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Nantel complained that the Senate review ignored the progress the company has made since 2019 in reducing its rate of recordable incidents – those which require more care than basic first aid – by 28%. The company also has improved the rate of significant injuries that require an employee to miss at least a day of work by 75%, she said.\n\n“We’ve cooperated throughout this investigation, including providing thousands of pages of information and documents,” Nantel said. “But unfortunately, this report (which was not shared with us before publishing) ignores our progress and paints a one-sided, false narrative using only a fraction of the information we’ve provided. It draws sweeping and inaccurate conclusions based on unverified anecdotes, and it misrepresents documents that are several years old and contained factual errors and faulty analysis.”\n\nThe report also says Amazon failed to adequately staff its warehouses during peak shopping times, which the company disputed.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Social Media Stocks That Will Have Better Returns Than META",
        "content": "Less than two years ago, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) hit lows of $90 per share. Now, the company is a trillion-dollar titan at nearly $500 a share. Many of us, whether short-term or long-term investors, look forward to the day we can get lucky enough to hit a multi-bagger like META. However, there are plenty of other social media stocks worth your investment. Having said that, how do you find them?\n\nOne of the best ways to do so is through a simple investment strategy known as Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP). With GARP, investors should focus on companies with strong fundamentals, a large moat usually attached to market share, margin expansion, and high revenue growth.\n\nIn this article, I’ll cover stocks that I believe have a setup that META had in 2022. By using the GARP principles, these three stocks could be social media multi-baggers in the making!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeing an AI innovator, search engine giant, and social media superstar, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is truly one-of-a-kind. This unique moat has positioned Alphabet as the fourth-largest company in the world by market cap.\n\nThe company has an 81.95% market share in the search engine industry with its subsidiary, YouTube, holding a market share of 97.67%. Not surprisingly, Alphabet’s financials are stellar with 57.2% year-over-year net income growth and 15.4% year-over-year growth in revenue to $80.54 billion. Its balance sheet holds just $30 billion in total debt compared to $110 billion in cash & equivalents.\n\nSo how is Alphabet continuing to fuel growth as a $2.3 trillion company? First, Alphabet is cost-cutting, having laid off more than 12,000 employees in 2023 alone. This contributed to its operating margin increasing to 32% from 25%. Second, it’s heavily investing in its technical infrastructure to support AI and Cloud growth. In Q1 alone, Alphabet’s CapEx was $12 billion, driven by investments in servers and data centers to develop its Gemini models. Lastly, Google is integrating this AI infrastructure into its current product line. YouTube cycles a host of generative AI tools, which led to 50% more channels uploading YouTube Shorts. This led to a 21% year-over-year rise in ad revenues.\n\nSpotify Technology SA (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a market share of 30.5%, Spotify (NASDAQ:SPOT) is the leader in the music streaming market. It is also second in the podcast market, housing 28.2% of podcast listeners. This only adds to the company’s extensive monthly active user (MAU) count of 615 million with 44% of them using the platform daily. This reinforces Spotify’s networking effect: as more users use the platform, friends and family will join as well. Features like Spotify Wrapped add a true social dimension to the app.\n\nStory continues\n\nMonthly active users reach new all-time highs growing 19% year-over-year leading to quarterly revenues of $3.64 billion up about 20% year-over-year. Starting in July, the company announced price hikes for its individual, duo, and family plans by 9%, 13.3%, and 17.7% respectively.\n\nProvided that the company has had a historical monthly churn rate of just 2% and given that its customer conversion rate is 44%, I do not believe these price hikes will significantly impact the company’s user base. SPOT trades at 3.9x sales and has a 0.8-forward Price to earnings ratio divided by its annual EPS Growth (PEG ratio). This is low relative to other music streamers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) at 1.39 or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 2.8. This is easily one of the best social media stocks on the market.\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent (NASDAQ:TCEHY), is China’s largest company and operates in social media, gaming, and eCommerce. While the company’s revenues have grown by 26% since 2020 the stock is down 50% from its all-time high.\n\nIt has a staggering 47% market share in the global gaming industry. Tencent’s WeChat super-app hosts 1.3 billion monthly active users. This is nearly twice the users of Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) which has 676 million monthly active users. Net margins were up 50% quarter-over-quarter driven by improved digital advertising through its AI-powered ad targeting.\n\nTencent has a stellar lineup of games including Fight of Golden Spatula which broke mobile records in China. Other games under Tencent’s umbrella include Valorant, PUBG Mobile, and League of Legends. With more than 140 games and $135 million in annual gross revenue per game, any new release adds to Tencent’s high-margin top-line growth.\n\nAt first glance, TCEHY trades at more than double the EV/EBITDA of peers like Baidu and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). But stronger growth metrics justify shares trading at 14.62x and 16.4x forward earnings. Quarterly revenue growth grew six times that of Baidu’s while net profit margins are 50% higher than BABA. If you are looking for the top social media stocks, start here.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon’s Prime Day to Remind Wall Street of Its Retail Dominance",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- In all the excitement around artificial intelligence, Amazon.com Inc.’s most important business has been somewhat forgotten by investors. This week’s Prime Day event could change that.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm’s Ad Trump Shooting Changes Biden’s Plan to Revive 2024 Campaign Amazon Sold a Used Diaper. It Tanked a Mom-and-Pop Business Trump Classified Documents Case Dismissed by Florida Judge Xi Jinping’s Great Economic Rewiring Is Cushioning China’s Slowdown\n\nThe two-day shopping jamboree, starting Tuesday, is expected to show robust growth and reinforce Amazon’s dominant position within e-commerce — and in retail overall. It could also underline how enhancements made during Covid continue to pay off, a positive signal before the company’s second-quarter results.\n\n“Those investments are improving efficiency, and there’s room to surprise to the upside with faster expansion and improved margins,” said Mike Brenner, research analyst at FBB Capital Partners. “Prime Day used to be about revenue, but now investors are looking for growth and margins, and if it can improve its retail margins, that will definitely drive the stock higher.”\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies wrote last week that improved efficiencies in Amazon’s retail business would boost the e-commerce giant’s Ebit margins fourfold — from 2.4% in 2022 to 9.9% this year.\n\nWhile Prime Day sales have faded as a direct driver for the stock, a strong showing would provide further justification for the 27% rally in 2024, a move that has lifted Amazon above a $2 trillion market valuation. The Nasdaq 100 Index is up 21%.\n\nMuch of that advance reflects the benefit the company could see from AI and its Amazon Web Services cloud-computing division. Last quarter, Amazon said generative AI represented a “multi-billion dollar revenue run rate business.”\n\nEven so, while AWS is Amazon’s most profitable unit, retail remains the primary contributor to sales.\n\nOnline stores accounted for 40.3% of Amazon’s 2023 revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Another 24.4% came from commissions and other services sold to the third-party sellers who list their wares on Amazon’s sites.\n\nAWS generated less than 16% of total sales last year, with the annual pace of growth at 13%. That’s faster than the 5.4% seen at online store, but trailing the 18% increase for third-party seller services.\n\nAmazon’s most recent revenue forecast was weak, a sign of caution about the e-commerce business, especially as retail-sales data has been underwhelming. There is some optimism that Prime Day will ease those concerns, helped by added momentum from Amazon’s new AI shopping assistant.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Prime Day should promote an early start to back-to-school/college shopping during a quieter time in the retail calendar,” and the “financial benefits extend well beyond the 2-day event period,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth. He pointed to downstream tailwinds for Amazon’s advertising business and membership trends.\n\nJPMorgan projects total gross merchandise value of $12.4 billion over the event, an increase of 12%, along with $7.9 billion in total retail net sales. Of that, $5.8 billion will be revenue Amazon wouldn’t have generated without Prime Day, it estimates.\n\nThis pace of growth, along with an expanding market share within e-commerce, is why JPMorgan last month tipped Amazon to surpass Walmart Inc. as the largest US retailer this year.\n\n“Retail sometimes gets a little lost amid AWS, but it remains a great business and there’s a strong bull case to be made for e-commerce,” said Stephen Lee, founding principal at Logan Capital Management. “Prime Day is less of a catalyst than it used to be, but it’s an opportunity to highlight how Amazon offers reasonable values on top of the game-changer of same-day delivery.”\n\nAmazon’s dominant positions in both retail and cloud-computing support the argument that its shares are a relative bargain. The stock trades at 32 times estimated earnings, and while this is above the 27 multiple of the Nasdaq 100, it is well below Amazon’s 10-year average of about 55. The valuation isn’t far from multiyear lows.\n\nMore than 95% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Amazon, and the average price target points to upside of 15%, the highest return potential among megacaps.\n\nThe company is expected to generate revenue growth of 11% this year and maintain a double-digit pace for the subsequent two years. Net earnings are projected to soar 63% this year.\n\n“This kind of growth can support the multiple, which I think will continue to compress as Amazon maintains strong earnings growth,” said FBB’s Brenner. “It would be a little flip to call the retail business gravy, but Amazon’s clearly an amazing company even without AWS.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nIn a positive sign of improving market breadth, more than 70% of Nasdaq 100 Index components are trading above their 50-day moving average. This is near the highest such ratio since February, and a dramatic turnaround from April, when fewer than 20% were above this closely watched level.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nHuawei Technologies Co. is close to finishing the construction of a chip research and development center in Shanghai, in a move that’s likely to advance China’s technological ambitions even as the US tries to halt its rise. Verizon Communications Inc., the biggest wireless carrier in the US, is exploring selling thousands of mobile-phone towers across the country, according to people familiar with the matter. Google offered a group of European Union-based cloud firms a package worth about €470 million ($512 million) in a failed attempt to derail their antitrust settlement with Microsoft Corp. that freed the US software giant from a potentially costly EU case. Starboard Value became the third activist investor this year to take a stake in Match Group Inc., the owner of the dating app Tinder whose paying customer base has shrunk for six straight quarters. Huma Therapeutics Ltd. has raised $80 million, valuing the startup at nearly $1 billion in the increasingly crowded health-care AI arena. The storied founder of Byju’s is losing control of his eponymous company after an Indian court pushed it into insolvency, a landmark ruling that may seal the fate of a startup that once symbolized India’s technology ambitions.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel French Elections Result Is Least Worst Outcome for Business\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Here’s how to track the Prime Day deals to get what you really want",
        "content": "For nine years now Amazon has made the middle of summer a shopping holiday. And each year, it has been a little bit harder to grab the deals you want as more people swarm the site looking for bargains. Casual browsing isn’t the way to approach things if you’re on a mission. You’re going to need a plan.\n\nAmazon has regularly updated how it approaches Prime Day deals, but there are some go-to methods that will help you locate bargains that are customized to things you actually need. Here are a few you’ll want to be aware of:\n\nAlexa: Start Prime Day by asking, “Alexa, what are my Prime Day deals?” (and it might be worth asking more than once throughout the day in case there are additions). While Amazon isn’t as gung ho on its digital assistant as it used to be, it’s still a good tool to find deals that might fly under the radar. Be sure to enable voice purchasing so you can grab those deals immediately.\n\nThis year, Alexa will also notify you of upcoming deals as much as 24 hours in advance, if that item is on your wish list, in your shopping cart, or saved for later. Go to the Alexa app and open Notifications under Settings and tap Amazon Shopping. Scroll down to Deal Recommendations and enable it.\n\nAmazon’s app: Amazon's app (available for Android and iOS) is a useful tool to track deals throughout both Prime Days. Again, your shopping list and items in your cart are key. Go to the app's settings menu, click notifications, and toggle alerts on for \"Your Watched and Waitlisted Deals.\" You can also select the \"Watch this deal\" button on upcoming items that catch your eye.\n\nAmazon Assistant browser extension: If you’re on a desktop or laptop, this Chrome extension will send desktop notifications for deals you're watching. Maybe don’t add that to a work computer, though.\n\nCamelCamelCamel.com: Prime Day prices are not always at their lowest, despite what the marketing might imply. CamelCamelCamel follows the price history of all products on Amazon, letting shoppers see how close a price is to its all-time low. You can also set alerts to find out when the price of your item of interest drops to a certain point.\n\nInvite-only deals: Amazon, as it did last year, will offer some deals only by invitation. You can try to get on the list on the site’s front page. Among the deals being offered this year are up to 40% off Sony wireless headphones, up to 30% off Peloton products, 40% off a Speedo Champion Signature Swim bundle, up to 60% off a Citizen Chronograph watch, and 58% off a Foreo LUNA mini 3 beauty set.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeal hunting sites: Group-sourced deal tracking sites can be especially useful on Prime Day, though not necessarily with the big-ticket items (which sell out in minutes). Your best choices for these crowdsourced deals include SlickDeals.net and Offers.com.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Exclusive-FTC seeking details on Amazon deal with AI startup Adept, source says",
        "content": "By Krystal Hu, Greg Bensinger and Jody Godoy\n\n(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has asked Amazon.com to provide more details on its deal to hire top executives and researchers from artificial intelligence startup Adept, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe request reflects the FTC's growing concern about how AI deals have been put together and follows a broader review of partnerships between Big Tech and prominent AI startups.\n\nThe informal inquiry into Amazon, which has not previously been reported, centers on last month's announcement that Adept Chief Executive David Luan and others were leaving to join Amazon, which would also license some of the startup's technology.\n\nSuch inquiries do not necessarily result in an official investigation or enforcement action.\n\nAmazon is trying to catch up with rivals Google and Microsoft, which partners with OpenAI, in developing its own large language models that can respond almost instantaneously to complicated prompts or queries.\n\nReuters previously reported on Amazon's efforts to establish a new organization called the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) team, focused on developing large language models. Luan is now running the “AGI Autonomy” team, consisting of many former Adept employees, and reporting to Rohit Prasad, head of the AGI team.\n\nFounded in 2022, Adept made a splash by raising over $400 million from venture capital investors with the aim to train large language models to perform general tasks for enterprise clients. Once valued at over $1 billion, it released some open-source models but failed to launch successful commercial products. It's unclear whether Amazon has compensated Adept investors, or the details of the licensing fees.\n\nAmazon, Adept and the FTC declined to comment.\n\nThe regulator is already investigating a similar move by Microsoft, which hired away much of another startup, Inflection AI's leadership and employees and agreed to pay a roughly $650 million licensing fee. The FTC is looking into whether the deal was a play to skirt merger disclosure requirements, a source told Reuters last month.\n\nThis is not Amazon's first AI startup bet. Amazon has invested $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic since September, taking a minority stake in the San Francisco company.\n\nThe FTC earlier this year launched a study of investments and partnerships in the AI space, demanding information on Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI, and Anthropic's tie ups with Google and Amazon.\n\nThe extensive document request, made in January, seeks details on how AI company partnerships with Big Tech influence strategy, pricing decisions, access to products and services, and personnel decisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nU.S. antitrust enforcers also expressed concern about Big Tech companies wielding their existing advantages in AI to shut out smaller competitors. The FTC and Justice Department have staked out responsibility for potential probes into Microsoft, OpenAI and chipmaker Nvidia.\n\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu and Greg Bensinger in San Francisco, Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Kim Coghill)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "4 Blue-Chip Stocks to Bet on as Dow Hits Fresh All-Time High",
        "content": "It has been a great 2024 for Wall Street, with all three major indexes hitting multiple record highs. Easing inflation and price pressures have raised optimism surrounding rate cuts, which have fueled the rally.\n\nDow Hits New Record High\n\nOn Jul 15, the Dow edged up 0.5% to close at a record high of 40,211.72 points, to register its 20th record close this year. This is also the blue-chip 30 stock index’s first record close since May 17.\n\nYear to date, the index has gained 6.7% and has now ended in positive territory for the fourth straight session.\n\nThis year’s rally has been primarily driven by tech and semiconductor stocks, which have been boosting the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. The value-oriented Dow has been slow in the race but has still put up an impressive show.\n\nThe Dow’s recent rally is being driven by positive economic data. The consumer price index (CPI) declined 0.1% sequentially in June after remaining unchanged in the previous month and recording its first decline since May 2020. On a year-over-year basis, CPI rose 3.3%, the smallest increase since April 2021.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, also rose 0.1% month over month in June and 3.3% from the year-ago levels. Year-over-year, core CPI was also the smallest since April 2021.\n\nRate Cut Hopes Rise\n\nInflation unexpectedly resumed its climb in the first quarter after declining sharply in 2023, thanks to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary tightening campaign that saw interest rates being hiked by 525 basis points.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is now gearing up for rate cuts, as inflation continues to decline. Last month, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, in his first post-FOMC meeting statement, said that the central bank now sees only one rate cut in 2024.\n\nHowever, even a single 25 basis point rate cut is good news, given that market participants had expected no rate cuts in 2024.\n\nMoreover, the latest FOMC \"dot plot,\" suggests a planned cumulative rate cut of 1% by 2025, which will take the Fed funds rate down to 4.1% by the end of next year. Currently, markets are pricing a rate cut in September, with the possibility of another before the year-end if inflation continues to decline sharply.\n\nOur Picks\n\nGiven the positive sentiment and bright outlook, investors should bet on these four fundamentally strong blue-chip stocks, namely JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL and Walmart, Inc. WMT. These companies are strategically positioned to take advantage of the overall upward trend in the market. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is one of the biggest global banks with assets worth $4.09 trillion and stockholders’ equity worth $336.6 billion as of Mar 31, 2024. With operations in more than 60 countries, JPM is one of the largest financial service firms in the world.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has an expected earnings growth rate of 1.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.7% over the last 60 days. JPM currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN’s online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company’s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish a footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. AMZN also enjoys a dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service space, thanks to Amazon Web Services.\n\nAmazon.com has an expected earnings growth rate of 57.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last 60 days. AMZN presently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nApple Inc.’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone. However, the Services portfolio of AAPL, which includes revenues from cloud services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services, has now become the cash cow. Moreover, non-iPhone devices like Apple Watch and AirPod have gained significant traction.\n\nApple has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.5% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 60 days. AAPL currently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nWalmart has evolved from just being a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer to an omnichannel player. WMT’s product offerings include almost everything from grocery to cosmetics, electronics to stationery, home furnishings to health and wellness products, and apparel to entertainment products, to name a few.\n\nWalmart’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 9.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3% over the past 60 days. WMT presently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Snowflake Stock Meltdown: Is the Cloud Giant’s Growth Story Over?",
        "content": "Snowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) has been in the cloud industry “penalty box” since former CEO Frank Slootman retired suddenly at the end of February.\n\nSnowflake is a cloud data warehouse that competes with Cloud Giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), as well as privately held competitors including Databricks, Motherduck and Clickhouse.\n\nIts fall has been precipitous. Snowflake stock sold at $230 per share before Slootman’s announcement. It will open July 15 at about $136. It is still no bargain. The market cap is roughly 15 times expected sales of $3 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut is this something where you “buy on the dip?” Or is this a broken growth story you need to walk away from?\n\nMassive Hack Attacks\n\nSnowflake is in the news right now for all the wrong reasons.\n\nIt is responsible for a huge hack against AT&T (NYSE:T) and dozens of other companies that were storing data with it.\n\nSnowflake disclosed the hack on May 30. But it wasn’t its technical systems that broke. According to the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) security subsidiary Mandiant, which investigated the problem, customers’ contractors had their credentials stolen.\n\nBut blaming the victim doesn’t work for me. First, as Mandiant noted, “Some of the malware infections in Snowflake’s systems date to 2020 and the credentials were, in some cases, still valid years after being stolen.” Also, Snowflake only began demanding two-factor authentication from its users this month.\n\nIf I were a potential Snowflake customer, or even a current one, I’d have to ask some hard questions, based on these facts. I’m not sure I’d like the answers.\n\nSlootman Out Before the Hammer Fell\n\nWhen Slootman stepped down in February, it was called an effort to “step up to AI.” Slootman was called more of a business leader than a tech leader.\n\nBut that’s not true. Slootman is a tech leader. He began his career running the data testing operation at Borland, a 1990s era tools company. After the dot-com bubble popped he joined a storage startup called Data Domain (now part of Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL)). Then he became CEO of ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW). He is described as an “insanely confrontational” leader.\n\nSnowflake was the third tech company he took public after Data Domain and ServiceNow. He was trusted by investors and thus able to run Snowflake from his home in Bozeman, Mont. A January profile on the Sequoia Capital site calls him a “next stage growth doctor.”\n\nAs an investor, I like Frank Slootman. He supported his own myth by writing a book in 2022 called Amp it Up with blurbs by other tech leaders testifying to his greatness.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat doesn’t sound like “a business leader” who needs to give way to a “tech leader.” It sounds like a billionaire getting out of the way before the bad news hits. A hack that started in 2020, with credentials held by hackers for years, is not what customers and would-be customers want to read.\n\nThis is especially true as Goldman Sachs joins the parade of critics wondering whether generative AI is all its makers claim. Too much spending for too little benefit sounds like hard times and consolidation is on the way.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Snowflake Stock\n\nSnowflake made its reputation by offering tight integration with other tool vendors. This created a lot of partners, each with their own policies and many relied on third-party consultants to do their work. Yet Snowflake only began mandating two-factor authentication this month?\n\nThat’s not the position you want to be in when the market is slowing, and your competitors include the Cloud Giants. My guess is Slootman still has a job to do and that is getting his investors out with their shirts on.\n\nThe near term outlook for this stock is grim. For investors’ sake I hope it comes back.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in MSFT, AMZN, and NOW.

        "content": "According to a report by the Financial Times on Tuesday, one of the most successful tech investors said Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could be worth almost $50 trillion in a decade.\n\nThe number represents more than the combined current market value of the entire S&P 500.\n\nHowever, the publication reported James Anderson, well-known for his early bets on companies such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), as saying that \"the potential scale of Nvidia in the most optimistic outcome is both way higher than I've ever seen before and could lead to a market cap of double-digit trillions.\"\n\n\"This isn't a prediction but a possibility if artificial intelligence works for customers and Nvidia's lead is intact,\" he reportedly added.\n\nNvidia has been a primary beneficiary of the surge in chip demand following the emergence of generative AI. Its shares have surged over 175% in the last 12 months, pushing its market capitalization above the $3 trillion mark.\n\nAnderson, who recently teamed up with the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family to launch Lingotto Investment Management, said Nvidia's \"persistent exponential progress, the competitive advantages in hardware and software, and the culture and leadership are exactly what we look for.\"\n\nWhen assessing the difference between Nvidia and some of his previous successful tech bets Anderson notes: \"Amazon, Tesla etc didn't start from highly profitable and dominant positions but had to get there\".\n\nHe explained that the real growth in data center AI chip demand looked to be running at about 60% per year. When assessing the next decade, he stated that 10 years of 60% growth in data center revenue alone, with unchanged margins, would result in earnings of $1,350 per share and free cash flow of approximately $1,000 a share.\n\nThe FT said Anderson remarked that an Nvidia share might be worth $20,000 in 10 years, translating to a market capitalization of $49 trillion. Anderson assigned the probability of this type of outcome at 10% to 15%.\n\nHe added: \"It is the long duration of the development of GPU usage in AI — and not just AI — from excitement, through potential pauses, to transformation of industries that is most important to us.\"\r\n\r\nAnderson believes the route to the extremely lofty valuation will likely be volatile, and it would not be surprising if the chipmaker had one or more significant drawdowns.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCan Nvidia really hit $50 trillion market cap like this tech investor suggests?\n\nThese stocks are benefiting from what could be a larger market rotation\n\nProgressive shares up 2% as Q2 earnings exceed estimates\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in July",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is a term that describes seven of the world's largest tech companies, many of which have been among the best-performing stocks over the past few years. The companies are Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla.\n\nEach Magnificent Seven company is an industry leader in its own right and at the forefront of many innovations. However, the following three companies stand as particularly good buys in July and going forward. If you're looking for tech stocks with appealing growth opportunities to add to your portfolio, they're well worth considering.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nNvidia's stock surge over the past two years has gotten a lot of attention (rightfully so), but Microsoft has also experienced significant growth. It's the second-best performing Magnificent Seven stock over the past three years and up over 22% in 2024 (as of July 12).\n\nA lot has been said about the rising valuations of big tech companies, and many of them are warranted. With a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 39, Microsoft is expensive by virtually all standards, leaving it susceptible to a market correction. MSFT PE Ratio Chart\n\nThankfully, the one thing Microsoft has going for it that other Magnificent Seven stocks don't is the vast ecosystem it has developed through the years. And it's not just the ecosystem, it's the customers that Microsoft serves in this ecosystem: other businesses.\n\nCountless businesses globally count on Microsoft's products and services to run their businesses. Between PCs, Office software, cloud service Azure, and recruiting hub LinkedIn, Microsoft has its hand in multiple crucial enterprise-focused industries.\n\nThis helps shield it a bit against downturns because it's not as easy for businesses to abandon Microsoft's services or products as it is for consumers of other tech companies. By no means does it make Microsoft a foolproof investment, but you can almost be certain of its long-term stability and growth trajectory. If its valuation worries you, I'd recommend dollar-cost averaging your way into a stake.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nDespite surging over 34% this year, Alphabet still seems like a bargain compared to other Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nWhen it comes to market dominance, there may not be a more clear example than Google's search business. Google search has around a 90% market share globally, and it's maintained this dominance for quite some time. And although you never want to make assumptions, it's safe to assume it'll continue this dominance for the foreseeable future.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts leadership position in search has led to a bustling advertising business. In the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, Google advertising generated $61.7 billion in revenue, with Google search specifically bringing in $46.2 billion. Google advertising accounted for over 78% of Alphabet's revenue in Q1 and was up 13% year over year. GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAdvertising will continue to keep Alphabet's lights on, but the growth of its cloud platform, Google Cloud, shouldn't be overlooked. Google Cloud has turned the corner on profitability, and in Q1, its operating income (profit from its core operations) grew 371% to $900 million.\n\nWith a dominant search business, a fast-growing cloud business, and a newly announced dividend ($0.20 quarterly), Alphabet is in a great position for sustained long-term growth.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon became the company it is today because of its e-commerce business, but it has done a great job at branching out and ensuring its business isn't too dependent on just that segment.\n\nHaving the foresight to see the role cloud services would eventually play has worked wonders for Amazon and its bottom line. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the global leader in cloud computing, with a lead it should manage to hold on to for a while, barring a major competitive disruption.\n\nIn Q1, AWS generated just over 17% of Amazon's revenue but over 61% of its operating income. Cloud computing is a much higher-margin business than e-commerce, so its growth will continue to boost Amazon's profitability. Add in the emerging AI innovations, and AWS is becoming a one-stop shop for cloud and AI solutions.\n\nAmazon has spent billions building out its e-commerce and cloud infrastructure, and it's now at the point where it can leverage these investments to generate new revenue streams. Take Supply Chain by Amazon, for example, an end-to-end set of supply chain services that allows sellers to take advantage of Amazon's logistics network.\n\nAmazon is a company built for sustained growth, and investors can feel confident holding on to it for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Prime Day is a big event for scammers, experts warn",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon Prime Day is here, and experts are reminding consumers to be wary of scams.\n\nDeceptions such as phony emails from people impersonating online retailers like Amazon are nothing new. But phishing attempts increase amid the heavy spending seen during significant sales events, whether it's Black Friday or Prime Day, according to the Better Business Bureau.\n\n“This is a huge moment on the retail calendar,\" Josh Planos, vice president of communications and public relations at the Better Business Bureau, previously told The Associated Press. \"And because of that, it represents an enormous opportunity for a scammer, con artist or even just an unethical business or organization to capitalize on the moment and separate folks from their hard-earned money.”\n\nPrime Day, a two-day discount event for Amazon Prime members, kicks off on Tuesday and runs through Wednesday. In updated guidance published last week, the Better Business Bureau reminded consumers to watch out for lookalike websites, too-good-to-be-true social media ads, and unsolicited emails or calls during sales events this month.\n\nConsumers might need to be more vigilant this year than ever before. In June, the Better Business Bureau published a report that said it received a record number of phishing reports in 2023. Reports are also trending up so far this year, the organization said.\n\nMeanwhile, in a report released this month, the Israel-founded cybersecurity company Check Point Software Technologies said more than 1,230 new websites that associated themselves with Amazon popped up in June. The vast majority of them were malicious or appeared suspicious, according to Check Point.\n\nScott Knapp, director of worldwide buyer risk prevention at Amazon, identifies two areas that the company has seen hoaxes around come Prime Day in recent years: Prime membership and order confirmations.\n\nLast year, for example, more than two-third of scams reported by Amazon customers claimed to be related to order or account issues, Knapp wrote in an emailed statement. People reported getting unsolicited calls or emails saying there was something wrong with their Prime membership and seeking bank account or other payment information to reinstate the accounts, Knapp explained.\n\nUrging consumers to confirm an order they didn't place is also a common tactic at this time of year, he added. Scammers might pick something expensive, like a smartphone, to get attention — and again ask for payment information or send a malicious link. They might also try to lure in consumers with promises of a giveaway, or by using language that creates a false sense of urgency.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is attempting “to ensure scammers are not using our brand to take advantage of people who trust us,” Knapp wrote, adding that customers can confirm their purchases and verify messages from the company on its app or website.\n\nAdditional scams are probably out there, but it's hard to know what form they might take before this year's Prime Day begins. Still, experts note that the same shopping scams tend to resurface year after year.\n\n“Typically, the bones remain the same,” Planos said, pointing to fake delivery scams, email phishing and other repeated methods. “It’s always a ploy to separate consumers from (their) personal and payment information.”\n\nBut online hoaxes are also constantly evolving to become more sophisticated, Planos and others warn. That means images might look more legitimate, text messages may sound more convincing and fake websites that look very similar to real shopping destinations.\n\nAmazon's Knapp has said that with artificial intelligence “starting to leak in,\" the scams targeting e-commerce shoppers follow the same approach but with a machine populating an email or text instead of a person.\n\nAccording to data from the Federal Trade Commission, consumers reported losing about $10 billion to fraud in 2023, a 14% jump from 2022. Online shopping scams were the second most-reported form of fraud, following impostor scams, the FTC said.\n\nBoth the FTC and Better Business Bureau provide consumers with tips to avoid scams year-round. Guidance includes blocking unwanted messages, not giving financial information to unsolicited callers and checking links before clicking — secure websites, for example, will have “HTTPS” in the URL, Planos notes, never “HTTP.”\n\nScammers will often pressure you to act immediately, experts say. It's important to pause and trust your gut. Experts also urge consumers to report scams to regulators.\n\nBeyond scams that impersonate companies or retailers, it's also important to be cautious of counterfeit products and fake reviews on the sites of trusted retailers. Just because you’re shopping on Amazon, for example, doesn’t mean you’re buying from Amazon. The online shopping giant, like eBay, Walmart and others, has vast third-party marketplaces.\n\nThe quality and look of counterfeit products has significantly increased over recent years, Planos notes, making the activity difficult to police. A good rule of thumb is looking at the price tag — if the product is being sold for less than 75% of its year-round market rate, “that's a pretty big red flag,” he says.\n\nSketchy sellers can show up on different platforms, including sites like Amazon, “all the time” Planos said, urging consumers to check out companies on the Better Business Bureau's website. Like other scams, counterfeit products may increase around high spending periods.\n\nAmid increasing pressure to tackle counterfeit products, Amazon has reported getting rid of millions of phony products in recent years. The company said it also blocked billions of bad listings from making it on to its site. In 2023, Amazon the company said more than 7 million counterfeit items were \"identified, seized and appropriately disposed of.” The online retailer has also filed multiple lawsuits against fake review brokers.\n\nAmazon notes customers can also report fake reviews and other scams on its website. If a shopper purchases a counterfeit item detected by the company, Amazon has said it will “proactively contact” the customer and provide a refund.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) closed the most recent trading day at $192.38, moving -1.08% from the previous trading session. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.28% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.53%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.4%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the online retailer had gained 5.9% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector gained 1.3%, while the S&P 500 gained 3.78%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Amazon in its forthcoming earnings report. In that report, analysts expect Amazon to post earnings of $1.02 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 61.9%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $148.54 billion, up 10.54% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.58 per share and revenue of $638.24 billion. These totals would mark changes of +57.93% and +11.04%, respectively, from last year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Amazon. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. As of now, Amazon holds a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nLooking at valuation, Amazon is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 42.45. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 22.12.\n\nIt's also important to note that AMZN currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.43. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. Internet - Commerce stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.07 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 51, putting it in the top 21% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nTo follow AMZN in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Buy Alert: 7 Growth Stocks That Have Outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 2024",
        "content": "The S&P 500 is the hallmark of portfolio diversification. When most investors aim to “beat the market,” they are talking about this index. It contains 500 profitable publicly traded corporations, with allocations weighted by market cap. For instance, investors will have the most exposure to the largest publicly traded corporation and the least exposure to the 500th largest company on the list.\n\nThis index routinely adds and removes stocks based on financial performance and other factors. Furthermore, it’s not easy to get into the S&P 500. A company must fulfill several requirements, such as having a sufficient market cap and reporting a profitable year.\n\nAlthough many investors use index investing to match the market, it’s possible to outperform the S&P 500. These growth stocks have lived up to the premise and have outpaced the S&P 500 so far. Investors may want to take a closer look at these growth stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalmart (WMT) An image of a Canoo, Inc. (GOEV) Walmart electric delivery vehicle\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is a haven for consumers who want to protect their wallets and buy affordable products. The company can deliver solid earnings during the good times and remain resilient during economic downturns. Walmart has delivered a 30% year-to-date gain, which outpaces the S&P 500’s 18% year-to-date gain.\n\nWalmart also offers a 1.20% yield for its investors. While dividend growth has been an issue in previous years, the company recently announced a 9% dividend hike — the highest dividend increase in more than a decade.\n\nQ1 FY25 financial results suggest that Walmart can continue the rally. Revenue increased by 6.0% year-over-year in that quarter, while adjusted EPS was up by 22.4% year-over-year. Global e-commerce sales were a major highlight, increasing by 21% year-over-year. Store-fulfilled pickups and deliveries continue to pick up momentum. Investors should also monitor the small but growing advertising segment, which reported 24% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s hard to talk about outperforming the S&P 500 without mentioning at least one of the Magnificent Seven stocks. These stocks have carried the index to new heights for several years and heavily influence the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks, delivering a 30% year-to-date return. Online marketplace sales continue to grow and achieve double-digit revenue growth in domestic and international markets. That wasn’t the only highlight from Q1 2024 results. While overall revenue increased by 13% year-over-year, the company also reported 17% revenue growth for Amazon Web Services. That part of Amazon’s business generated $25.0 billion in the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile e-commerce and cloud computing are Amazon’s core specialties, the company is making strides in the advertising market. The tech giant reported $11.8 billion in ad revenue this quarter, a 24% year-over-year increase. Amazon thrives in multiple industries, which should lead to long-term gains for patient investors.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) Graphic of yellow money bag next to green arrow and coins floating in air, symbolizing growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Monster Ztudio\n\nNu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is a Brazilian digital bank that offers a wide range of financial products and services to the Latin American community. Shares have logged a 65% year-to-date return. It helps that the company recently surpassed 100 million users, most of whom are active.\n\nThe digital bank reported an 83% activity rate at the end of the first quarter. This rate demonstrates that 83% of the company’s 100 million customers are active monthly. The bank has more than 83 million monthly active users, and they use multiple financial products. Nu Holdings reported 69% year-over-year revenue growth as customers used the bank’s personal loans, credit cards, bank accounts, brokerage accounts and other resources.\n\nWall Street analysts still believe that the stock can rise. Seven analysts rate it a Strong Buy, with a projected 5% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $15.20 per share suggests the stock can gain an additional 13%.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been outperforming the stock market for several years. It has almost quadrupled over the past five years and is up 28% year-to-date. The Mexican Grill chain recently completed a 50-for-1 stock split and has been under a correction ever since. This correction presents an opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nThe company continues to grow at a robust pace. Revenue increased by 14.1% year-over-year to reach $2.7 billion in the first quarter, and net income rose by 23.2% year-over-year to reach $259.3 million. Chipotle opened 47 new restaurants this quarter and remains on pace to open 285-315 restaurants throughout the year.\n\nRestaurant expansion isn’t the only reason Chipotle’s revenue is still rising. The company reported 7.0% year-over-year growth in comparable restaurant sales. Wall Street analysts are on board and have rated the stock as a Moderate Buy. The average price target suggests a 16% upside, while the highest price target of $80 per share indicates that a 38% gain is possible.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another member of the Magnificent Seven that has outperformed the S&P 500 over a lengthy amount of time, including this year. Facebook’s parent company has logged a 44% year-to-date gain and comes with a 0.40% yield. The stock trades at a 29 P/E ratio and trades at a $1.26 trillion valuation.\n\nThe social media giant closed out the first quarter with 3.24 billion daily active users, 7% higher than the same time last year. Meta Platforms’ large user base allows it to experiment with new products and AI offerings. As it works on new initiatives, the company performs well with its current business model. Revenue increased by 27% year over year, while net income surged by 117% year over year.\n\nMeta Platforms remain a big hit on Wall Street. The stock is rated a Strong Buy with a projected 6% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $625 per share suggests the company can rally by an additional 25%.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) isn’t as big as Chipotle, but the steakhouse chain has momentum and a more reasonable valuation. The stock trades at a 34 P/E ratio and offers a 1.44% yield. Shares are up by 42% year-to-date and have more than tripled over the past five years.\n\nThe steakhouse chain reported 12.5% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. Net income jumped by 31.9% year-over-year, which should help the company maintain a double-digit dividend growth rate. Texas Roadhouse opened 12 restaurants in the quarter, including three franchises. The steakhouse chain’s comparable sales increased by 8.4% year-over-year at company-owned restaurants. The growth rate came in at 7.7% for franchise restaurants. Both growth rates are respectable and demonstrate that Texas Roadhouse is becoming a fixture in numerous communities.\n\nWall Street analysts have rated the stock as a Moderate Buy. The average price target only implies a 3% upside, but the highest price target of $191 per share suggests a potential 13% gain.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been crushing the stock market. The cybersecurity firm is a recent addition to the S&P 500, delivering a 50% year-to-date gain. Shares are up by more than 400% over the past five years.\n\nThe company operates in an industry projected to grow for many years. Cybersecurity is projected to maintain a compounded annual growth rate of 13.8% until 2030. Many companies will benefit from the industry’s success, but few are as well-positioned as Crowdstrike.\n\nWhile other cybersecurity companies have reported decelerating revenue growth, Crowdstrike continues to charge ahead. The company reported 33% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Crowdstrike operates on a subscription business model and currently has $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue. Profits are also surging, going from $0.5 million in the same quarter last year to $42.8 million in this quarter.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AMZN, TXRH, and CRWD.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks Investors Can Buy Now (Amazon, Spotify, ASML Holdings)",
        "content": "The tech sector continues to be a driving force in the market, but with so many options, it can be tough to know where to invest. Here's where the Zacks Rank can be a valuable tool.\n\nWe've identified three tech stocks – Amazon (AMZN), Spotify (SPOT), and ASML Holdings (ASML) – that not only boast innovative products and services but also hold coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings. Let's dive into why these tech giants should be on your watchlist, or even better, in your portfolio right now.\n\nStocks Amid an Epic Bull Market\n\nThis market is undeniably strong and seems to make new record highs daily. How can investors best take advantage of a raging bull market like we have today?\n\nIn a market regime like this, the best approach is to seek stocks that are expected to outperform the market, but with limited downside risk. My preferred method of doing this is screening for stocks that have top Zacks ranks and are showing relative strength against the market index.\n\nEven better if they have thematic tailwinds like Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing and Digital media transformation.\n\nAdditionally, we should try to avoid stocks that have uber-high valuations as well, as they increase the downside risk.\n\nIn the chart below we can see that each of the stocks picked today are displaying impressive momentum and are outperforming the market year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon: Cheapest Valuation in a Decade\n\nFirst up, we have the e-commerce behemoth, Amazon. While some might hesitate due to the recent market pullback, there are compelling reasons to consider AMZN. For one, Amazon is currently trading at its cheapest valuation in a decade.\n\nToday's forward earnings multiple of 41.2x sits well below its 10-year median of 97.3x, presenting a deep historical discount.\n\nThis attractive valuation comes despite Amazon's continued dominance in e-commerce and its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is a major growth driver for the company, boasting a dominant market share in the cloud computing industry.\n\nThis segment is expected to keep expanding rapidly, providing significant tailwinds for Amazon's future earnings.\n\nFurther bolstering the case for AMZN is the company's impressive earnings growth trajectory. Analysts are projecting a robust 29.6% annual growth in EPS over the next 3-5 years.\n\nThis combination of a discounted valuation and strong earnings growth makes Amazon a compelling investment opportunity for those seeking exposure to the ever-growing tech sector.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSpotify: Huge Earnings Growth Drives Stock Appreciation\n\nNext on our list is the music streaming giant, Spotify. While some investors might be wary of companies with limited profitability, Spotify's future looks bright. Earnings are turning positive in a big way this year and analysts are forecasting a staggering 76.1% annual growth in earnings per share (EPS) over the next 3-5 years. This explosive growth potential is a major reason why investors are taking notice.\n\nBecause of these tremendous growth forecasts in earnings, Spotify enjoys a relatively discounted valuation. Today, SPOT is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 60x, which is extremely high. But with the earnings growth forecast, it has a PEG ratio of 0.8, which is a discount based on the metric.\n\nSpotify isn't just about impressive forecasts; it's also delivering on the stock price front. The company has experienced powerful stock price momentum, indicating strong investor confidence in its future. This combination of sky-high EPS growth forecasts and a surging stock price makes Spotify a compelling option for investors seeking high-growth potential in the tech sector. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nASML Holding: Critical AI Infrastructure\n\nRounding out our list is ASML Holdings (ASML), a Dutch company that holds a near-monopoly in the production of photolithography machines. These machines are the unsung heroes of the modern tech world, responsible for etching the intricate patterns on silicon wafers, the foundation of computer chips.\n\nBecause of its mission critical status in the production of semiconductors, it has very long-term growth tailwinds thanks to technology’s endless creep into our lives. Furthermore, it plays a crucial role in the function of Artificial Intelligence, as its machines will be required for the development of chips used in the technology.\n\nIn addition to its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, ASML Holdings also boasts a very bullish technical setup.\n\nASML stock has been coiling and breaking out all year, and if the stock can trade above the $1,100 level, would again signal another imminent leg higher. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe tech sector remains a powerhouse, offering exciting opportunities for investors. As earnings season approaches, we can anticipate further confirmation on how these companies are executing in this environment.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Thanks to developments in artificial intelligence and the need for more effective data processing near where the data originates from, edge computing stocks continue to attract investors because of their rapid transformation.\n\nWith a value of $16.45 billion in 2023, the worldwide edge computing industry is predicted to expand 36.9% annually from 2024 to 2030, reaching $155.90 billion. Other projections indicate that, with a 36.7% increase over the following eight years, the market may reach $200.8 billion by 2031.\n\nNorth America will be the largest market in the world in 2023, with about 40% of the edge computing market share. Asia-Pacific is expected to grow the fastest, with a 43% CAGR from 2024 to 2030. IoT, manufacturing and smart city projects all help explain this increase.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe magnitude of the market is driving several platforms to be developed. EdgeCortix’s most recent development for edge artificial intelligence uses is the SAKURA-II Edge AI processor. Meanwhile, Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) has developed a bot management system to target DDoS assaults and frauds and enhance edge security.\n\nEdge computing is still volatile; hence, it’s important to stay as cautious as possible. For our research on edge computing stocks, we will thus consider large-cap firms with double-digit upsides.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDue to the high demand for servers that run artificial intelligence applications, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is one of the best-performing edge computing stocks this year, up 86%.\n\nOne of the safest edge computing firms to buy, Dell’s edge computing initiatives will improve its consensus upside potential of 12.6%. They recently introduced Dell NativeEdge, the newest edge operations software from Dell Technologies. NativeEdge simplifies edge app security and expansion with unified control, zero-touch release and autonomous operations.\n\nDell Technologies’ next-generation PowerEdge servers with AI-enhanced edge computing.

MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) regularly releases new edge computing products and services. MSFT’s quarterly product upgrades entail extensive research and development to help clients be more productive and secure.\n\nBecause of its relationship with OpenAI, the company is adding AI features to its edge computing products. Microsoft has been adding more space to its data centers to support these AI-driven edge computing projects.\n\nMicrosoft is doubling the size of its new data center to meet the growing demand for AI and edge computing services. As part of this growth, much money is spent on computer power and GPU capacity, which are important for building and launching AI models at the edge.\n\nBy virtue of its diversified business model, MSFT is one of the strongest edge computing stocks to purchase. Ten years of consecutive profitability underscoring the robustness of its business model complement a potential 10.8% upside for investors seeking edge computing stocks.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock has boomed, up over 45% in a year, and analysts expect a further 14% gain. Investors like the company’s AI push, online retail resurrection and cloud expansion. Moreover, AMZN is also adding edge computing to its offerings. Amazon Web Services, one of its subsidiaries, is a big name in cloud computing and is now adding edge computing to its list of services.\n\nAWS has released Snowcone, an edge computer and data-sharing device that is very small and light. It weighs less than five pounds, is made to work in rough conditions, and can be used in places with limited power, connection or room. It can move data online and offline, and companies like SmugMug and Flickr are already using it to make data capture and transfer faster during remote photo shoots.​\n\nAWS continues expanding edge services for data processing, analysis, and storage closer to users. This project supports applications requiring real-time response and little latency. AWS simplifies the edge-to-cloud move by offering on-premises and ruggedized services and infrastructure.\n\nIn addition, AWS and the Australian Government want to develop a secure data cloud to simplify information sharing in Australia’s security sector. AWS is also expanding internationally, including in Taiwan, to fulfill the Asia-Pacific cloud demand.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "Jeff Bezos praises Donald Trump’s ‘grace under literal fire’ after assassination attempt",
        "content": "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Donald Trump haven’t always gotten along, but after the former president survived an assassination attempt over the weekend, Bezos decided to bury the hatchet.\n\nHours after Trump was injured in a shooting at his rally in Pennsylvania Saturday, the Amazon founder praised him in a post on X.\n\n“Our former President showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire tonight. So thankful for his safety and so sad for the victims and their families,” Bezos wrote.\n\nBezos was one of several top business leaders that showed support for the former president in the aftermath of the shooting. Pershing Square founder and investor Bill Ackman formally endorsed Trump in a long post on X Saturday. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also endorsed Trump and wished him well, adding in a post on X that the “Last time America had a candidate this tough was Theodore Roosevelt.” Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon also offered Trump his condolences Monday.\n\nBut Donald Trump hasn’t always gotten along with his fellow one-percenters, and before Bezos called for peace over the weekend, he was one of the former president’s favorite targets.\n\nTrump has often criticized Bezos on X, mostly for owning The Washington Post, which he bought in 2013 and has published articles and opinion pieces critical of the former president. In a stream of tweets from 2015, Trump took a shot at Bezos’ ownership of the Post, saying he only owned the newspaper to avoid taxes. He also called the newspaper the “Amazon Washington Post,” even though Bezos, not Amazon, owns the outlet.\n\nThe @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon! Big tax shelter\n\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015\n\nIn 2017 when Trump was president, Bezos, then the CEO of Amazon, wrote in a personal email to employees to make it clear that the company did not support Trump’s ban on immigration from Muslim-majority countries. Later that year Trump invited Bezos to the White House along with other CEOs for a four-hour meeting on tech in the government.\n\nFast forward to 2019 and Trump had a new name for Bezos, “Jeff Bozo,” which he employed to poke fun at the world’s second-richest man after the National Enquirer tabloid reported on Bezos’ alleged affair with now-girlfriend Lauren Sánchez, a former host of “So You Think You Can Dance.”\n\nStory continues\n\n“So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post.”\n\nFollowing this weekend’s rally, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy also wished Trump well in a post on X.\n\n\"It's hard to digest what happened in Pennsylvania today. Just awful. My thoughts go out to the victims' families. Glad that President Trump is safe and hoping he recovers quickly,\" he wrote.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "How has Prime Day performed through the years?",
        "content": "Prime Day has grown into one of Amazon’s biggest sales events. But the numbers the sale turns in these days make the early experiments look downright puny.\n\nLast year’s Prime Day saw 375 million items sold, per Amazon, and Adobe estimated sales came in close to $13 billion in the U.S. alone. That’s even more impressive when you consider that the initial Prime Day sold just 34.4 million items, but was still considered an overwhelming success.\n\nSo as you prepare to start either your early holiday shopping or grab yourself a few summer essentials, here’s a look back at how Prime Day has done though the years.\n\nPrime Day 2015\n\nShoppers bought 34.4 million items on the one-day inaugural event, breaking Black Friday sales records. And analysts estimated it brought in $415 million. The event was marred somewhat, however, by people complaining on social media that they experienced technical problems when checking out.\n\n“Going into this, we weren’t sure whether Prime Day would be a one-time thing or if it would become an annual event. After yesterday’s results, we’ll definitely be doing this again,” said Greg Greeley, Vice President of Amazon Prime.\n\nPrime Day 2016\n\nIf the first Prime Day was a hit, the second was a phenomenon, dubbed the company’s “biggest sales day ever” at the time. Sales hit an estimated $525 million. And Amazon said customer orders surpassed Prime Day 2015 by more than 60% worldwide and more than 50% in the United States. Orders to third-party sellers tripled year-over-year, the company said.\n\nPrime Day 2017\n\nPrime Day became more than a daylong event this year, with Amazon stretching the sale to 30 hours, resulting in yet another sales record. This was the first year the company was thought to clear $1 billion in sales. Amazon, as usual, didn’t give any hard numbers on subscriptions, but said more new members joined the premium program on Tuesday than any single day in the company’s history.\n\nPrime Day 2018\n\n2018 saw Prime Day extend to 36 hours and add several more markets, including Australia, Singapore, Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The sale set another record and saw shoppers buying more than 300,000 Instant Pots and over 100 million items overall. This was the year Prime Day really took off, with sales topping an estimated $4 billion.\n\nPrime Day 2019\n\nEncouraged by the success of 2018, Amazon made Prime Day a two-day event in 2019, which it has continued to do ever since. The strategy worked, with people buying 175 million items. Analysts estimated at the time that the company had recorded sales of more than $6 billion during the event.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrime Day 2020\n\nIn the heart of the pandemic, consumers were itching for something new in their lives—and Amazon’s Prime Day gave them the opportunity to buy lots of new things. And, boy, did they respond. Sales were up 36% compared to the year before. Analysts projected total sales would hit $6.17 billion in the United States, and almost $10 billion including other markets.\n\nAmazon, as always, didn’t confirm those, but did disclose that third-party businesses sold $3.5 billion worth of goods that year.\n\nPrime Day 2021\n\nWith inflation raging, Amazon held a pair of Prime Day sales in 2021 (though only the summer event kept the Prime Day name). That summer event brought in an estimated $6.8 billion in revenue.\n\nPrime Day 2022\n\nMore than 300 million items were sold during the two-day 2022 sales event. Adobe estimated day one overall sales of more than $6 billion and day two sales of $5.9 billion as consumers looked for deals amid still roaring inflation and the upcoming back-to-school season.\n\nPrime Day 2023\n\nDespite fears of a recession, shoppers bought 375 million items last year, spending an estimated $12.7 billion in the U.S. alone. A growing number of consumers also took advantage of Amazon’s version of layaway, called “Buy Now Pay Later. That option accounted for 6.6% of orders on one of the sales days, a 21% jump over the previous year, said Adobe.\n\nPrime Day 2024\n\nAdobe is forecasting Amazon will take in $14 billion this year, a 9.2% increase year over year. Electronics, the company says, will be the biggest deals, with discounts of 22%. Apparel, home/furniture and televisions will also cost less than a year ago.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Soaring Stocks I'd Buy With No Hesitation",
        "content": "The U.S. stock market has been quite volatile in the past decade. Many trends, including e-commerce, cannabis, blockchain, cryptocurrency, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI), have shaped the investment landscape in this time frame.\n\nHowever, AI is no passing trend and is rapidly changing the overall face of corporate America. With broad-reaching utility across industries, functions, and various spheres of daily life, this AI revolution's eventual impact is beyond imagination. According to PWC estimates, AI will contribute a mind-boggling $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.\n\nConsidering that AI technologies are very much here to stay, astute investors should consider picking up at least small stakes in these soaring AI-powered growth stocks as a part of their long-term investing strategy. Here's why Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) fit the bill.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first growth stock to buy with no hesitation is social media giant Meta Platforms. With over 3.2 billion people -- nearly 40% of the global population -- using at least one of the company's apps (Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger) daily, the company enjoys exceptional user reach and engagement. Not surprisingly, Meta's social media applications are highly sought after by advertisers.\n\nMeta leverages powerful AI-driven algorithms to recommend relevant content, which in turn helps boost user engagement. The company is currently working on a new unified recommendation system to give more relevant and personalized content recommendations to users across its social media applications and content formats. Meta offers multiple AI-powered tools to advertisers to automate and optimize their advertising campaigns.\n\nIncreasing user engagement and improved ad targeting are now translating into better ranking, performance, and returns for advertisers -- which directly helps boost business for Meta. In the first quarter, Meta saw the total number of ad impressions and average price per ad grow 20% and 6% year over year, respectively.\n\nBesides strengthening its core digital advertising business, Meta also sees huge potential in monetizing its AI technologies by scaling business messaging, introducing advertisements or paid content in AI assistant interactions, and enabling people to pay for accessing larger AI models.\n\nMeta also reported an impressive surge in profitability in the first quarter, generating $13.8 billion in operating income and $12.4 billion in net income, up 91% and 117%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the company continues its heavy investments in AI initiatives and the metaverse, it is also returning significant value to shareholders as dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter, the company paid $1.3 billion in dividends and repurchased $14.6 billion worth of shares. With the share count dropping and profits rising, Meta will generate more earnings per share in the coming quarters.\n\nMeta shares are trading at 30.5 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is higher than its five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 27.4. Despite this, the stock seems a smart long-term pick even at these elevated valuation levels, considering its dominance in the social media and digital advertising industry and its rapidly strengthening position in the AI industry.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe second compelling growth pick for retail investors is e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon.\n\nIts Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business has been the company's key profit engine for the past several quarters. AWS generated revenue of $25 billion in the first quarter, up 17% year over year -- an accelerated rate compared to 13.2% year-over-year revenue growth in the previous quarter. AWS also reported operating income of $9.4 billion, up $4.3 billion year over year.\n\nAWS has already reached a $100 billion annual run rate. However, with more than 85% of the global IT spending still associated with on-premise IT infrastructure, there is still much scope for AWS to grow in the coming years.\n\nWith a major part of cloud spending optimization initiatives completed, enterprises are now focusing on new projects to migrate on-premise infrastructure to the cloud. AWS customers are also increasingly adopting AI-related services such as custom silicon and compute instances to build proprietary models, Amazon Bedrock for customizing existing large language models, and Amazon Q for AI-powered software development and data analysis.\n\nAmazon is also gearing up to increase capital investments in AWS and generative AI capabilities. Hence, considering the increasing dependence of its diversified customer base on AWS for non-generative AI and generative AI workloads, a broad partner ecosystem, and robust security and operational performance, AWS can continue to be a major growth catalyst for Amazon in the coming years.\n\nThe e-commerce giant is focusing on improving profitability in its core retail business by optimizing the U.S. inbound fulfillment network to place inventory closer to customers, consolidating shipments to reduce cost to serve and to improve customer experience, and expanding the network of same-day fulfillment facilities. The company is investing in robotics and automation to streamline and standardize fulfillment processes.\n\nFinally, although a small part of the business, advertising is also emerging as a major profit contributor. The company sees significant scope for growth in areas like sponsored products and streaming TV advertisements.\n\nConsidering the many robust growth catalysts, Amazon can be a smart buy now -- especially when it is trading at only 3.3 times trailing-12-month sales.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "Investors have been on a roller coaster since the start of 2024, with considerable market fluctuation. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 experienced plenty of peaks and valleys due to factors like the budding artificial intelligence (AI) market, a potential decrease in interest rates, and easing inflation. ^IXIC Chart\n\nThe most recent dip occurred on July 11 when a U.S. inflation report revealed the Consumer Price Index (CPI) decreased 0.1% the month before, the index's first negative reading since May 2020. Meanwhile, the CPI saw a 3% year-over-year rise in June, decelerating from May's 12-month increase of 3.3%.\n\nMarkets opened higher on the encouraging news, while tech stocks began to tumble later in the day. Investors who sought haven in tried-and-true stocks like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft seemed to reshuffle their holdings to include companies that could also benefit from easing inflation.\n\nThe dip in tech stocks could signal a buying opportunity, with many of these companies still likely to see significant gains over the long term. So, here are two growth stocks that are screaming buys in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Nvidia: Growth catalysts that will keep it expanding for decades\n\nNvidia's stock has climbed 157% since the start of 2024, which has made it the first chipmaker to cross a market cap of $3 trillion. Yet, its dominant role in tech suggests it still has plenty of room left to run.\n\nSince the start of last year, Nvidia emerged as one of the biggest threats in AI, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) becoming the most sought-after chips by developers worldwide. Increased demand for AI services has caused Nvidia's earnings to soar as the market has required a seemingly endless supply of GPUs.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia's revenue rose 262% year over year in its latest quarter (first quarter of fiscal 2025), while operating income soared 690%. The company profited from impressive gains in its AI-focused data center segment.\n\nWhile AI remains a lucrative growth catalyst for Nvidia, with the sector projected to hit nearly $2 trillion in spending by 2030, the company achieved solid positions in other tech areas that could also boost its business in the long term.\n\nFor instance, the company achieved an 88% market share in discrete desktop GPUs, a market where it sells its chips to consumers who use them to build high-powered gaming PCs or setups for video editing. Sales of these chips are classed under Nvidia's gaming segment, which rose 18% in the fiscal first quarter of 2025, ended April 28, 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe quarter also highlighted the company's budding automotive business, where Nvidia supplies its hardware to companies like Tesla, powering self-driving technology. Automotive revenue jumped 11% to $329 million in Q1 2025. However, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress sees automotive as a potential multibillion-dollar business as the market develops and expects it to be the \"largest enterprise vertical\" with its data center segment in 2024. NVDA Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nNvidia's shares are trading at about 47 times its forward earnings, which doesn't exactly scream \"bargain.\" However, its head start in AI has seen its financials rise so far above its competitors that Nvidia is unlikely to lose its market dominance anytime soon. As a result, this growth stock will likely continue delivering gains for years, making it a screaming buy in 2024.\n\n2. Amazon: A better value than you might think\n\nWhile Nvidia enjoys hype around its chips, there's been similar excitement over Amazon's position in AI software. The company's cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), holds a leading 31% market share in the cloud industry, potentially giving it an edge in AI.\n\nCloud services have become the go-to for many businesses seeking ways to integrate AI into their workflows. Meanwhile, AWS and rivals like Microsoft's Azure invested heavily in their respective platforms, introducing new AI tools over the last year.\n\nHowever, Amazon's lead in the industry has allowed it to more easily promote its products to its prominent clientele, which includes Netflix, Formula 1, Meta Platforms, and Samsung.\n\nAs a result, bullish investors boosted Amazon's stock by 53% since last July. While that kind of rally could sink the value of a company's shares, Amazon is actually more of a bargain than you might think. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nAmazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is significantly lower than the same metric for its biggest competitor, Microsoft. Additionally, Amazon's P/S is reasonably close to the average it has maintained over the last decade, while Microsoft's is nearly double. The P/S ratio is a useful valuation metric calculated by dividing a company's market cap by its trailing 12-month revenue. In other words, the metric highlights the cost of a single share in relation to how much that share generates in revenue. As a result, the lower the P/S, the more value a stock offers.\n\nSo, in this case, Amazon's P/S indicates that its stock is trading at a bargain compared to its No. 1 rival, Microsoft, making it a no-brainer investment this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Prime Day sales to hit record $14 billion, data firm says",
        "content": "By Ananya Mariam Rajesh and Arriana McLymore\n\n(Reuters) - Shoppers are likely to spend roughly $14 billion during Amazon's Prime Day two-day shopping event this week, according to projections from Adobe Analytics, a firm that studies e-commerce transaction data.\n\nSpending at Amazon on Tuesday and Wednesday could rise 10.5% from Prime Day 2023, Adobe said.\n\nThe online retailer began holding Prime Day a decade ago, typically in July. Prime Day accounts for 1% to 2% of Amazon's net global sales, according to CFRA Research.\n\nAmazon started advertising pre-Prime Day deals in early July on clothes, back-to-school gear, wellness products and electronics, though it moved Prime Day back by five days on the calendar this year.\n\nAmazon said that Day 1 of its two-day Prime Day 2023 earned its biggest sales day ever, although it doesn't disclose total sales for Prime Day.\n\nThe $12.7 billion shoppers spent at Amazon last year during Prime Day was 6.1% more than what they spent during the 2022 event, according to Adobe.\n\nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT?\n\nAmazon's Prime Day has turned July, an otherwise slow time for retailers, into a season when shoppers look for bargains, especially on back-to-school clothing, electronics, uniforms, backpacks, dorm decorations and supplies.\n\nRivals Walmart and Target are also launching July discounts and marketing events in a bid to beat Amazon at its own game, and capture some of the $38.8 billion that the National Retail Federation trade group projects Americans will spend on back-to-school merchandise this summer.\n\nFollowing years of high inflation, shoppers have delayed purchases of non-essential goods and retailers are tempting shoppers to break that habit with aggressive July discounting.\n\nKEY QUOTES\n\n\"We are expecting really strong momentum for back-to-school,\" said Vivek Pandya, Adobe's lead insights analyst.\n\nShoppers are now more willing to spend and have started to use Prime Day as a back-to-school shopping opportunity, he said.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nShoppers could spend $7.1 billion at Amazon on Tuesday alone, up 11.3% from a year earlier, Adobe said. Day 2 is expected to bring $6.9 billion in online sales, up 9.2% from a year earlier, it said.\n\nAdobe expects Amazon to dangle discounts of 22% on electronics, 20% on clothing, 17% on home goods and furniture and 11% on sporting goods.\n\nAdobe's projections are based on its analysis of data measuring transactions from previous Prime Days.\n\n(Reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru and Arriana McLymore in New York City; Editing by Rod Nickel)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon Sold a Used Diaper. It Tanked a Mom-and-Pop Business",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Paul and Rachelle Baron were an Amazon success story. The washable swim diaper they designed for their infant son quickly became a best-selling product as the online retailer’s algorithm worked its magic. Satisfied parents left five-star ratings and glowing feedback, elevating the diaper in search results and steering more shoppers their way. The momentum seemed unstoppable.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Shooting Changes Biden’s Plan to Revive 2024 Campaign BlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm’s Ad Trump Emerges Defiant From Rally Attack Set to Shake Up ’24 Race Trump Classified Documents Case Dismissed by Florida Judge Bold and Bloodied Trump Seizes the Moment After Being Shot\n\nThen one scathing review changed everything.\n\n“The diaper arrived used and was covered in poop stains,” a shopper wrote in a review with a one-star rating. “Nothing could have been more disgusting!! I am assuming someone returned it after using it and the company simply did not check the item and then shipped it to us as if it was brand new. These were not small stains either. I was extremely grossed out.” Worst of all, the review featured photos of the stains for all to see.\n\nThis wasn’t supposed to happen. Amazon.com Inc. has committed to inspecting each return for issues before reselling it. But warehouse employees, trained to work quickly, don’t always have enough time to carefully inspect each item before putting it back into circulation, according to someone who spent years in the returns operation. The Barons learned the hard way that the world’s largest online retailer isn’t perfect and sometimes makes mistakes.\n\nSelling returned products as new on Amazon is a major and growing problem, according to consultants who advise merchants how to navigate the online marketplace. When the practice spawns negative feedback, they say, the damage increases exponentially.\n\nThe Barons told Amazon repeatedly that they weren’t at fault and that the review should be taken down. Yet it remains on the site, inflicting lasting harm. The couple says they’re $600,000 in debt, including a loan secured by their home that complicates the prospect of filing for bankruptcy. They make enough selling diapers to pay down debt and order more inventory, they say, but it’s not a living.\n\n“The last four years have been an emotional train wreck,” Paul Baron said. “Shoppers might think returning a poopy diaper to Amazon is a victimless way to get their money back, but we’re a small, family business, and this is how we pay our mortgage.”\n\n“We are sorry to hear that a seller feels their return was not evaluated correctly and resulted in a negative review,” Amazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti said in a statement. “We encourage selling partners to reach out with any concerns, and we listen to their feedback to help us continue improving the selling experience.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon recently introduced a policy that lets sellers instruct the company not to resell any returned products. Previously, “all items returned as new were automatically resold after being carefully evaluated by a member of our team to ensure the returned product meets strict guidelines for resale as new,” Boschetti said. She also said sellers can contact the company if they believe feedback on a resold product is “inaccurate or incorrectly attributed to them.”\n\nThe Barons’ entrepreneurial journey began a decade ago. They had enrolled their newborn son Beauregard in swim class. But the swim diapers they purchased were too tight on his legs and had to be removed like underpants, making cleanup messy. So the Barons turned their frustration into an idea: a reusable swim diaper with snaps to make it adjustable and easy to remove.\n\nThey used a credit card to place their first order with a factory in China and launched Beau & Belle Littles on Amazon. Before long, the business had reached $1 million in sales. The couple appeared on the Rachael Ray Show and were profiled in Forbes. Theirs was the kind of small-business success that Amazon loves to tout, especially when regulators accuse it of hurting mom-and-pops.\n\n“We started this as a dream to make enough money for Rachelle to be able to stay home,” Paul said. The alternative was Rachelle working as a teaching assistant, which barely covered the cost of childcare, they said.\n\nThe Barons were executing a plan to triple their annual sales to $3 million in 2020, when the review landed with a thud. Even though the diaper had a four-plus-star rating from hundreds of buyers, it was hard to miss the stain photos. More than 100 shoppers upvoted the damaging review as “helpful,” which increased its visibility. The algorithm was suddenly working against the Barons. Sales plummeted.\n\n“It should be common sense,” Rachelle said. “Why would something like a diaper ever be put back into inventory to be resold?”\n\nThe amount of time Amazon workers spend inspecting returns varies, depending on what the item is, according to the former employee. But on balance, a worker shouldn’t spend more than a minute eyeballing each return, the person said. Employees often don’t even bother opening packages if they appear to be sealed and just assume they’re unused, the former worker said. But because seals are often just a sticker or zipper it’s not always clear if the product is as-new, the person said.\n\nThe breadth of Amazon’s catalog exacerbates the problem. The company sells hundreds of millions of items. An Amazon worker handling returns might see a particular product only once and never develop expertise about a given category. It might seem unlikely that a stained diaper would be resold, except that Amazon also sells fake dirty diapers as gag gifts.\n\nAmazon says it doesn’t allow reviews that address packaging or shipping problems or product condition and damage. The guidelines appear to prohibit the stained diaper review since it suggests the item had already been used, and the Barons were hopeful that a quick note would fix things. But their emails went unanswered. Paul recalls spending hours on the phone, getting passed from one department to another. Seller support representatives acknowledged a used diaper had been mistakenly resold, but told him they couldn’t take the review down, he said. The couple tried the famous jeff@amazon email that supposedly goes to founder Jeff Bezos himself. Nothing happened.\n\nAmazon knew reviews could be misused when it designed the system, according to a person who worked on the project. Executives realized it would be impossible to hire enough people to adjudicate every disputed review. The best remedy, they decided, was to encourage as many authentic reviews as possible so that false ones would get washed out, the person said. The company also doesn’t let businesses respond to critical feedback, unlike Google and Yelp.\n\n“There should be a very simple appeal process where a seller can get the review removed if a used item is resold as new,” said Jason Boyce, a long-time Amazon merchant who now runs a consulting business for online sellers. “But that process has been broken for a long time.”\n\nIn the same month as the diaper review, the Barons got an email from another customer. She had ordered a swim diaper on Amazon for an upcoming lake trip and received a stained one. The customer didn’t leave a critical review and just emailed the business owners directly.\n\n“I just received one of your swim diapers via Amazon today and when I opened it looks like it had dirt or mold on the inside. Looks like it’s possibly been previously used,” the email said.\n\nRachelle responded that Amazon shouldn’t resell used diapers, but sometimes it does anyway and that it was beyond their control. She offered her apologies and sent the shopper a replacement.\n\n“It had a stain on it, and I’m not sure if it was poop or not,” said Jessica Salerno, the shopper, when reached by Bloomberg. “The business owners were really great about it when I contacted them. I feel really bad this happened to them.”\n\nFor a long time, the Barons wondered if the first review was fake, posted by a competitor bent on sabotage. Merchants have been known to buy a competitor’s product solely to leave a bad review with hopes that it elevates their business—a tactic known as “sniping.” Competition among the more than 2 million sellers on the site is so fierce, merchants have even stooped to bribing Amazon workers to give their products an advantage and sandbag their competitors. One scheme for sale was a “take-down,” in which critical reviews were left on a competitor’s product to hurt their sales, according to a 2020 federal indictment.\n\nAs it turns out, the diaper review was real. Erin Elizabeth Herbert, a teacher from Redlands, California, confirmed to Bloomberg that she left it to spare other shoppers a similar experience. The diaper arrived encrusted with feces and hadn’t been washed, she said. It looked as though someone used it at the beach and rinsed it in the ocean. Herbert said she got her money back from Amazon and ordered a swim diaper from a different company.\n\nThe Barons “reached out to me and said they were mortified and offered to send me a new product,” she said. “They explained to me that Amazon handles all the returns and shipping. I always meant to go back and revise my review to reflect that, and life got busy and I never did.” Herbert forgot all about the review until Bloomberg contacted her in June.\n\nThe Barons spent a year trying and failing to get the review taken down despite following Amazon’s instructions on how to do so. Today, the couple is trying to salvage a once-promising business. Paul works on the side as an e-commerce consultant and Rachelle is seeking a job in logistics.\n\n“Amazon talks a big game about helping small businesses,” Paul said. “But they really don’t.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel French Elections Result Is Least Worst Outcome for Business\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Got $500? 2 No-Brainer Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "The stock market has continued to give investors a remarkable run up as the bull market is in full swing. If you're looking for great companies that you can buy and hold through market thick and thin, it's important to be selective about the businesses you put cash into and keep in your portfolio.\n\nIf you have even a more modest amount like $500 to invest, you can still take advantage of investment methods like fractional investing or dollar-cost averaging to become part owner of quality stocks. Here are two no-brainer growth stocks to add to your buy list as summer kicks off.\n\n1. Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nBristol Myers Squibb(NYSE: BMY) hasn't delivered the share price growth some investors may have hoped for recently, but overlooking this business could be a mistake. If you're wondering what's behind the stock's roughly 35% decline over the past 12 months, there are several factors at play.\n\nFirst off, the company is facing the impending loss of patent exclusivity on a few core products, including the blockbuster blood thinner Eliquis. The company is working to stave off the long-term headwinds that the entry of generic competitors to this addressable market will bring, and has made a series of important acquisitions recently.\n\nThese acquisitions have included two cancer drugmakers, and a company that specializes in treatments for psychiatric and neurological disorders. Not surprisingly, the company has paid billions for these acquisitions, which hold significant growth opportunity for the business over the long run.\n\nSuch acquisitive growth is inevitably going to weigh on a company's top and bottom lines in the short term, as has been the case with Bristol Myers. The biopharmaceutical industry is remarkably resilient in a wide range of economic backdrops, but it is also cyclical. Fluctuations in growth due to factors like loss of patent exclusivity, acquisitive maneuvers, and the inevitable adjustment periods that follow are to be expected.\n\nFor investors taking a position in a stock like this for five, 10, or more years, that isn't something to be worried about. Income-seeking investors may be glad to learn that Bristol Myers is a faithful dividend payer, and has raised its dividend every year for well over a decade at this point.\n\nWhile the stock's performance has been lackluster of late, that has helped elevate its dividend to an eye-popping yield of just under 6%. The company maintains a payout ratio of about 60%. Bristol Myers still has a strong balance sheet overall, with plenty of cash to maintain its shareholder obligations.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's brought in revenue of about $46 billion over the trailing 12 months, with operating cash flow of about $14 billion. Its levered free-cash-flow position has totaled about $16 billion in that same time frame. It ended the most recent quarter with about $10 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand. The company still looks like a smart buy if you're searching for a long-term buy-and-hold investment in the healthcare space.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is hardly a company that needs an introduction, but sometimes the best investments are the mainstay businesses that keep delivering growth through economic thick and thin. The tech giant's continued expansion in the burgeoning world of artificial intelligence (AI) is breathing new life into its growth story.\n\nWhile Nvidia still undeniably dominates the AI chip market, Amazon makes its own AI chips, called Inferentia and Tranium. These are offered at a lower price compared to competitors in the space, and Amazon's management has indicated that demand is consistently growing.\n\nSelling chips is far from the only opportunity for Amazon amid the AI revolution. It's introduced a series of AI-focused applications. These include Amazon Bedrock (a service for building generative AI applications), Amazon Sagemaker (a machine learning service that can help build AI chatbots among various use cases), and Amazon Q (a generative AI-powered assistant).\n\nThese are all applications that integrate seamlessly with its cloud infrastructure platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is habitually the single largest driver of profitability for the company. Management said in the first quarter earnings report that AWS' AI capabilities are driving the segment to achieve a $100 billion annual revenue run rate.\n\nLast year, AWS reported segment sales of about $91 billion. It's worth noting that Amazon's flagship e-commerce business is still the single largest piece of the pie when it comes to net sales.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, net sales rose 13% year over year to $143 billion. Of that total, $55 billion was derived from online store sales and $35 billion from third-party seller services for its e-commerce platform.\n\nOperating income rose 219% year over year to $15.3 billion ($9.4 billion of that amount was from AWS), and net income jumped 225% to $10.4 billion. Amazon also brought in free cash flow of $50 billion over the trailing 12 months, with operating cash flow of $99 billion in that same time frame.\n\nThis is a company that has proven its ability to reinvent itself through the years, and the future looks to be no different. The growth and overall dominance of its mainstay e-commerce and cloud computing businesses, as well as the promise of tremendous growth as it expands in the world of AI, are all incredible value propositions for long-term investors to consider.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bristol Myers Squibb right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bristol Myers Squibb, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bristol Myers Squibb wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "With 'Prime Day' ahead, here's what to do about porch pirates",
        "content": "Amazon's annual sale starts Tuesday, which means even more impulsive purchases will be packaged and dropped onto porches across the state this week.\n\nSome of those parcels won't make it into the buyer's home, however. That's because package theft is commonplace in California, as well as the rest of the United States.\n\nAccording to estimates compiled by Capital One, 119 million packages were stolen in 2023 — a big number, although it represents only about 0.5% of the 21.7 billion shipments in the U.S. that year.\n\nWith Americans receiving multiple packages per week on average, the odds eventually catch up to many consumers. According to Security.com, 44% of those surveyed last year said they'd had a package stolen at some point.\n\nIn California, one out of five people have at least one package stolen every year, Capital One estimated. That makes them a bit more likely to be victimized than other Americans, but their average loss — $40 — is lower than the typical loss for all U.S. consumers, which Security.com put at roughly $50.\n\nThe best defense against package theft is also the least practical one: Be at your door when the delivery person arrives. Short of that, Amazon and other delivery services offer options that are more secure than your porch.\n\nIf you do fall victim to package theft, you have a number of different routes to a refund. None of them are guaranteed, however.\n\nHere are answers to some common questions about porch piracy and tips for how to avoid it.\n\nRead more:'The bane of retail.' To prevent theft, many big chains now lock up all kinds of merchandise\n\nIf my package is stolen, how do I get a refund?\n\nUnder normal circumstances, no one is legally obligated to cover your losses to porch pirates. One exception would be when the delivery company is responsible for the loss — for example, when the package is stolen by the driver or delivered to the wrong address.\n\nSome retailers will refund your money to keep you happy, and you may be able to wrangle a refund from the delivery company, especially if the package had been insured. Whatever route you take, you'll have to jump through some hoops.\n\nStep 1 is determining that the package has actually been delivered. You can (and should) enroll in services from the U.S. Postal Service, UPS and FedEx that let you to track all the packages they're delivering to your home. In many cases, the services can send you a text as soon as your package arrives.\n\nBe forewarned that the notifications are not 100% accurate; drivers will occasional mark a package delivered prematurely, then bring it to your doorstep a day or two later. Amazon advises people to wait two days before concluding that the \"delivered\" package has definitely been delivered — and taken.\n\nDon't assume that a package has been stolen just because it's not at your front door. Different drivers use different techniques to deter porch pirates, so make sure to look around your property in case the driver found a drop-off spot that was easy to reach but out of sight.\n\nStep 2 is filing a police report. You probably won't get the \"Law & Order\" treatment of your lost item; you're filing a report mainly to create a public record (and because some sellers require it), not to launch an investigation.\n\nStep 3 is contacting the seller. If you ordered from Amazon, the seller often turns out to be a third party selling through Amazon's Marketplace. How the seller responds will vary. Some will file a claim with the delivery company for the insured value of the package, then use the proceeds to make a refund. Others may simply tell you that it's your problem to solve.\n\nRead more:Trapped in an Amazon return box: One Utah cat's mistaken journey to California\n\nAmazon has a reputation for making refunds when items are stolen after Amazon delivers them, especially when the items are from third-party sellers covered by the company's \"A-to-z Guarantee.\" But there's no blanket promise of refunds.\n\n“While the vast majority of deliveries make it to customers without issue, we recognize package theft is a reality all delivery companies contend with, especially during busy times of year,\" said Montana MacLachlan, an Amazon spokesperson. \"We encourage anyone who’s been a victim of theft to report the crime to law enforcement and notify Amazon’s Customer Service team so we can provide any assistance possible.”\n\nIf Step 3 fails, Step 4 is filing a claim with the company that delivered the package — you can do so through its website, and you typically have to file it within 60 days of the scheduled delivery date. You'll need to provide a receipt, invoice or other proof of the item's value.\n\nAlthough FedEx, UPS and other delivery companies pledge to investigate claims, they don't promise refunds. Packages are routinely insured for up to $100 by FedEx and UPS unless the shipper pays for more insurance, so even if your claim is approved, whether you recover the full value could depend on whether the shipper bought extra insurance. Also, if UPS approves a claim, it typically pays the shipper, not you, so you'll have to rely on the shipper to reimburse you for your loss.\n\nYour homeowner's or renter's insurance covers stolen packages, but chances are your deductible is greater than the value of the sweater or Instant Pot taken from your porch. If you paid for the item with a credit card, you may have a better option: Visa, Mastercard and American Express all offer a form of insurance that covers theft losses, with limits on the types of items and amount of loss covered. You can submit a claim through the relevant card's website.\n\nRead more:Alleged 'porch pirate' tracked by bait package dies of car crash injuries, Arcadia police say\n\nHow do I prevent my packages from being stolen?\n\nDelivery companies offer a number of ways to protect your deliveries. The most straightforward (but least convenient) one is having your package delivered to one of the company's retail outlets or partners, then picking it up from there.\n\nAmazon has self-service lockers at thousands of retailers, groceries, pharmacies and convenience stores across the country. You can search for one near you on Amazon's website.\n\nUPS allows users of its My Choice service to have all their deliveries made to a nearby UPS Store outlet or retail partner at no extra charge. If they want to change the delivery of just one package, UPS charges a $6 fee unless the customer has a My Choice Premium membership, which costs $20 a year. To select an alternative location, sign into your My Choice account and follow the prompts under Delivery Preferences. To pick up a package there, you'll need to present an ID that shows an address that matches the one on the shipping label.\n\nRead more:Amazon Ring surveillance emails are flooding LAPD inboxes\n\nFedEx offers to hold your packages for up to seven days at one of its retail partners, including FedEx Office locations, Walgreens, Office Depot and Dollar General. You can search for a location on the FedEx website.\n\nFor no additional charge, you can arrange for all of your deliveries to go to an alternative location, or just set them one at a time. You'll pick the package up by showing a government-issued photo ID and proof of address, or you can provide a QR code to someone else so they can pick it up for you.\n\nTo get started on the FedEx site, either log into you FedEx Delivery Manager account or enter the tracking number for the package you're expecting.\n\nAlternatively, all three of those companies allow you to redirect a package to a neighbor you know will be home to receive the delivery. They also allow you to specify potentially safer spots on your property or in your building for packages to be dropped off. And if you're away on vacation, UPS and FedEx allows you to delay your deliveries for one to two weeks.\n\nAmazon offers another option in certain parts of the country if you're enrolled in Amazon Prime and have an internet-connected garage door opener: Its drivers can deliver packages inside your garage. Going this route, however, requires you to give Amazon the ability to open your garage, which will be encoded into the label on your package for one-time use. It's a leap of faith, although the company says it has a number of safeguards, such as verifying \"the driver, package and package location via multi-step authentication before granting them temporary, one-time access to your garage.\"\n\nRead more:California lawmakers want to curb retail theft, but say it's not as easy as it sounds\n\nWhen ordering something online, try to have the shipper require a signature for delivery. You won't be given that option often, though; it's typically used to protect expensive items, such as laptop computers.\n\nSome security consultants recommend installing a security camera or a doorbell with a built-in webcam, which can record porch thieves in the act. That may help you obtain a refund from the shipper; whether it will drive off thieves is another story. One study found that security cameras had a \"modest but significant effect\" on crime rates, leading to a roughly 13% decrease. But there's not a lot of data from published studies that suggest doorbell cameras deter porch pirates.\n\nSome less conventional solutions have found their way onto the market as well.\n\nParcel Vault sells a kit that can put a package door in your wall so packages can be dropped inside your home (it also sells full-size doors with built-in package doors).

        "content": "While there are many ways to gain an advantage on Wall Street, betting alongside the biggest investors can potentially be quite lucrative. Naturally, the wealthiest institutions didn’t earn that status by losing money all the time. So, it makes sense that to get the best results, you partner with the best. That’s the mainline thesis behind institutional investor favorites.\n\nAnother factor to consider is that the behemoths enjoy access to the best resources and tools available. Typically, retail investors lack the wherewithal for such privileges. In addition, the major institutions hire the brightest candidates. Therefore, you have a greater breadth of confidence when acquiring shares of institutional investor favorites.\n\nAt the same time, no guarantees exist. While the big boys may target the best ideas, they’re not foolproof. Also, they can afford to be audacious with their wagers. However, you might not have the same luxury. Still, more often than not, the pros know what they’re doing. On that note, below are intriguing institutional investor favorites to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nEasily one of the most popular ideas on Wall Street, it’s no surprise that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the institutional investor favorites. Per data provided by HedgeFollow, AMZN stock represents the second-biggest institutional acquisition, behind only semiconductor juggernaut Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). As of filings in the first quarter of this year, institutional investors acquired $14.41 billion worth of shares.\n\nFundamentally, Amazon offers a multi-pronged weapon. Primarily, it dominates the e-commerce sector, an ecosystem that’s been marching higher since the second quarter of 2022. In addition, Amazon dominates in technology services, particularly its AWS cloud network. Thanks to so many relevant businesses, the company posted an average earnings per share of 87 cents in the past four quarters. In contrast, analysts were anticipating only 63 cents.\n\nOne drawback with AMZN stock is that it trades at 3.58X trailing-year sales. Between the first quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, the average metric sat at 2.63X. Still, what’s intriguing here is that sales are projected to steadily expand. In fiscal 2024, the top line could move up 2.6% to $589.61 billion. By 2025, this figure could rise to $654.94 billion, up 11.1%.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to the topic of institutional investor favorites, we could discuss tech-related ideas to the end of time. However, it’s important to note that the big dogs are also focused on other market segments. Interestingly, insurance and healthcare services provider UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) ranks highly in terms of major market participants. Overall, Wall Street’s best have acquired $6.14 billion worth of shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, institutional buyers may be thinking long term. Yes, UNH stock presents relevancies regarding medical insurance and other coverage-related concerns. Further, the company could see significant demand in the coming years for its over-age 65 plans. Thanks to the population spike of the post-war baby boom, millions of people will be retiring. Naturally, people of advanced age often require greater care needs.\n\nTemptingly, UNH stock is trading at a relative discount, with the market pricing it at 1.23X trailing-year sales. In the past year, this metric averaged 1.35X. What’s more, covering experts believe that by year’s end, revenue could rise to $398.43 billion. If so, that would imply a growth rate of 16.3%.\n\nIn the following year, sales could tick up again (by 7.5%) to $428.42 billion. It’s one of the institutional investor favorites to consider.\n\nHess (HES) Hess (HES) logo on a phone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those who wish to try their luck among the ideas endorsed by giants, energy player Hess (NYSE:HES) could be an interesting opportunity. Falling under the oil and gas exploration and production industry, Hess is also known as an upstream specialist. It also offers midstream (transportation) capabilities, covering crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas. Thanks to geopolitical dynamics, HES stock may jump higher.\n\nEven better, the alpha dogs appear to be sniffing something special over the horizon. All told, the top investors have acquired $3.89 billion worth of HES stock. Cynically, should global oil supply chains be disrupted due to ongoing “current events,” Hess could see a boost to the bottom line. Notably, it’s already strong, with the company posting an average EPS of $1.77 in the past four quarters.\n\nAnalysts, it should be noted, expected only $1.18 during that time. Another compelling signal is that HES stock trades for only 3.98X trailing-year sales. In the past year, this metric reached 4.08X. So, even with the institutional interest, HES hasn’t been priced at a premium.\n\nThat could change soon. Analysts are looking for fiscal 2024 revenue to hit $12.29 billion, up 15.5%. Therefore, it’s one of the top institutional investor favorites to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Stocks That Could Join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia in the $3 Trillion Club",
        "content": "The U.S. Senate is sometimes called \"the most exclusive club.\" However, I can think of a club that's much more exclusive than the legislative body, which has 100 members. It's the $3 trillion club.\n\nOnly three companies in the world boast market caps of $3 trillion or more: Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. But this club might be a little less exclusive in the not-too-distant future. Here are three unstoppable stocks that could join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia in the $3 trillion club.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is in the driver's seat to become the next $3 trillion company. The Google parent's market cap currently stands at around $2.3 trillion. At the rate the stock is climbing, it's not out of the question that Alphabet could join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia by early 2025.\n\nMost of Alphabet's revenue and profits continue to be generated by its Google Search business. While some have predicted the rise of generative AI presents an existential threat to search engines, Google has thrived. CEO Sundar Pichai noted in Alphabet's first-quarter earnings call that Google's new AI overviews have increased search usage and user satisfaction with search results.\n\nGoogle Cloud should enjoy a strong tailwind from AI for years to come. The unit's sales jumped 28% year over year in Q1 with operating income soaring 371%. Google Cloud is especially popular with generative AI start-ups, with more than 60% using its cloud service.\n\nYouTube is another key growth driver for the company. It's the leader in U.S. streaming with viewers watching over 1 billion hours of content daily. YouTube now has over 100 million music and premium service subscribers, while YouTube TV claims over 8 million paid subscribers.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't too far behind Alphabet, with a market cap hovering around $2 trillion. I fully expect the e-commerce and cloud services giant will also take a spot in the $3 trillion club within the next two or three years.\n\nLike Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS) should deliver strong growth in the years ahead thanks to the demand for building and deploying AI models. AWS is the leader in the cloud services market. I suspect it will stay on top because of the appeal of new products such as AI-powered software development assistant Q.\n\nAmazon dominates the e-commerce market. Cost improvements in the company's e-commerce platform and distribution network have helped to boost profitability. As Amazon increases delivery speed further, its e-commerce revenue and profits should grow as customers shop online more frequently.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvertising is also an important growth engine for Amazon. In Q1, advertising sales soared 24% year over year on a constant-currency basis. This growth could increase in the future as advertising on Prime Video gains momentum.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has a steeper hill to climb to join the $3 trillion club. The social media leader's market cap of $1.3 trillion is well below the market caps of Alphabet and Amazon. However, I think it's only a matter of time before Meta reaches the $3 trillion threshold.\n\nThe company is an advertising juggernaut. Its apps, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, reach more than 3.2 billion people across the world every day. Advertisers can' ignore such a massive audience.\n\nMeta's efforts to more efficiently monetize its products, especially Reels, are paying off handsomely. Profits more than doubled year over year in Q1. The company continues to get better and better at showing ads to the right person at the right time.\n\nAI presents a major growth opportunity for Meta. In particular, CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that AI-powered business messaging will be the \"next major pillar\" of the company's business.\n\nShould you buy these future members of the $3 trillion club?\n\nYou might think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are no-brainer stocks to buy if they're truly on track to join the $3 trillion club. And you'd be right, in my view.\n\nAll three stocks have tremendous growth prospects. The growth drivers already mentioned don't even tell the full story. For example, robotaxis could be huge opportunities for Alphabet's Waymo and Amazon's Zoox units. Meta could be a bigger winner in virtual reality and the metaverse. I think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are great stocks to buy and hold.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,904!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $43,562!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $349,245!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of July 8, 2024\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "3 Top Buffett Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Haul",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is one of the world's most closely followed billionaire investors because his investment-driven conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the past four decades. Therefore, buying some shares of Berkshire Hathaway is still a smart move for investors who want to generate stable long-term gains without doing too much homework.\n\nEven if you don't want to directly invest in Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate's investment portfolio is still a great starting point for finding some blue chip winners. I personally believe three of Berkshire Hathaway's tech holdings -- Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW) -- will head higher in the future. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple accounts for 44.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's entire portfolio. Buffett started buying Apple in the first quarter of 2016 and now owns 5.1% of the entire tech giant, which is now trading nearly 480% above his average purchase price of $39.60.\n\nFrom fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last September), Apple's revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% as its earnings per share (EPS) grew at a CAGR of 17%. The company bought back nearly 30% of its shares over the past seven years.\n\nApple achieved that stable growth even as the pandemic, tougher competition in China, and supply-chain constraints disrupted its sales of iPhones. The company still generates more than half of its revenue from the iPhone but has been diversifying its business by expanding its services ecosystem, which now serves more than 1 billion subscribers. It's launched new products like the Vision Pro, and locked in its users with new artificial intelligence (AI)-oriented services.\n\nWith $162 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of its latest quarter, Apple still has plenty of ways to expand its business with fresh investments and acquisitions. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect it to grow its revenue at a steady CAGR of 5% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 10%. The stock isn't cheap at 31 times forward earnings but could continue rising over the next decade as it diversifies its portfolio with new products and services.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's 0.1% stake in Amazon accounts for about 0.5% of its entire portfolio. Buffett started buying Amazon in the first quarter of 2019, and it's risen nearly 140% from his average purchase price of $84.20.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2023, Amazon's revenue rose at a CAGR of 20% as its EPS grew at a CAGR of 26%. Its e-commerce and cloud infrastructure businesses experienced a major growth spurt during the onset of the pandemic in 2020, but it struggled with tougher year-over-year comparisons as those tailwinds dissipated. Inflation and other macro headwinds further throttled the growth of both of those core businesses in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut in 2023, Amazon's e-commerce business stabilized as it benefited from faster delivery speeds, the growth of its integrated ads, and its expansion into more overseas markets. Its cloud growth also accelerated again as more companies upgraded their infrastructure to support bigger workloads and AI applications. With $85 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of its latest quarter, Amazon also has plenty of ways to expand its retail, cloud, and digital-media ecosystems.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect the company's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 11% and 37%, respectively. Its stock isn't cheap at 44 times forward earnings, but its dominance of the e-commerce and cloud markets justifies its higher valuation.\n\n3. Snowflake\n\nBuffett usually avoids hypergrowth tech stocks, but he invested in Snowflake during its initial public offering (IPO) in 2020. Berkshire only holds a 1.8% stake in Snowflake and it's just 0.2% of its entire portfolio, but it's still up about 14% from its IPO price of $120.\n\nSnowflake's cloud-based data warehousing services pull data from a wide range of computing platforms into a centralized location so it can be easily accessed by third-party apps. The market's booming demand for well-organized data, which can be fed to analytics and AI applications, lit a fire under Snowflake's business over the past few years.\n\nIts revenue surged at a CAGR of 80% from fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), but analysts only expect it to grow at a CAGR of 24% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027. That deceleration, which it mainly blamed on the macro headwinds, spooked the bulls. But as Snowflake's sales growth cooled off, it turned profitable on a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis in fiscal 2022 with an EPS of $0.01 -- then grew that figure to $1.08 in fiscal 2024.\n\nSnowflake's stock has declined about 66% from its all-time high of $401.89 on Nov. 16, 2021, but it admittedly doesn't look cheap at 250 times its forward adjusted earnings and 13 times this year's sales. Yet if we take the long-term view, I believe Snowflake could gradually expand and evolve into a much larger cloud software company. If that happens, investors who buy this stock at this slight premium to its IPO price could be well-rewarded over the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – July 15, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL, Walmart Inc. WMT and Chevron Corp. CVX.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n4 Blue-Chip Stock Picks to Strengthen Your Portfolio\n\nU.S. stock markets have been on an impressive bull run over the past 18 months. However, the Dow, despite participating in the rally, lagged its peers, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. Wall Street’s blue-chip index is up 5.4% year to date. On the other hand, the broad-market S&P 500 Index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite have climbed 17.8% and 23.8%, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow recorded its all-time high of 40,077.40 on an intraday basis on Mar 20 and 40,003.59 on a closing basis on May 17. Technically, at its current level of 39,753.75, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 39,035.26 and 37,365.23, respectively.\n\nThe 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trendsetter. Historically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the asset (in this case the Dow Index) becomes a strong possibility.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to four Dow stocks that have strong earnings growth potential for the rest of 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. A deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive for AMZN.\n\nThe strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home offerings are tailwinds. The advertising business is also pretty robust. AMZN enjoys a strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are its other positives.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank #2 Amazon.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 57.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last 60 days.\n\nApple Inc. has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, AAPL’s competitive position is expected to improve. Moreover, AAPL is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment.\n\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. AAPL’s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Apple has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.8% and 7.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending September 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nWalmart Inc. has been gaining from its highly diversified business with contributions from various segments, channels and formats. WMT has been benefiting from an increase in in-store and digital channel traffic due to its robust omnichannel initiatives. Store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped 50% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nWalmart’s strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has also been rewarding, as evidenced by the constant increase in the market share for groceries. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled WMT’s first-quarter results and led to an encouraging fiscal 2025 view.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Walmart has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025).

        "content": "Understanding stock valuations can be difficult. What's more, the seemingly countless varieties of ratios don't make it any easier: price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), etc.\n\nHowever, grasping these ratios is critical to understanding how expensive a stock truly is.Similarly, simply checking the share price doesn't reveal that information -- a stock trading at $2,000 could be far \"cheaper\" than a stock that trades at $20, depending on the underlying financial condition of the two stocks.\n\nAccordingly, let's delve into why I think investors should consider Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) based on its valuation. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon's current valuation gives investors a tremendous opportunity\n\nIt might seem impossible, but Amazon's stock is currently making new all-time highs while also sporting a very low valuation.\n\nSo, how is that possible?\n\nIn short, it's happening because Amazon is operating at its most efficient level ever -- thanks to massive capital investments.\n\nThe company ramped up capital expenditures in response to the COVID pandemic, expanding and improving its logistics network that supports its massive e-commerce business. As it did so, the company's free cash flow dried up, as cash was funneled into construction projects, equipment, and machinery.\n\nHowever, after the end of the pandemic, Amazon scaled back some projects and ended others entirely, resulting in a significant drop in capital expenditures spending and a surge in free cash flow.\n\nAccordingly, Amazon's price-to-free-cash-flow -- a critical stock valuation metric for a mature company like Amazon -- has decreased considerably.\n\nAmazon now sports a price-to-free-cash-flow valuation of 46x. That's down from the 400x valuation the stock had just last year.\n\nMoreover, its current valuation by that metric is one of the lowest for the stock dating back 10 years. AMZN Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nWhy Amazon can keep growing and produce more millionaires\n\nMake no mistake: Valuation is an important metric -- but it isn't everything. For an investment to have staying power, it's important to understand what a stock's future prospects are.\n\nAmazon's potential for growth is not limited to its e-commerce division. The company operates a diverse range of business lines, each with its own growth potential.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud services division, is a standout example. It now generates over $100 billion in annual revenue, a figure that surpasses most other companies. In fact, if AWS were a stand-alone entity, its annual revenue would be on par with BankofAmerica, Tesla, or PepsiCo.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's more, AWS is not just a revenue generator, it's a growth engine. As organizations increase their cloud spending and the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution gains momentum, AWS is growing at an impressive rate. In the most recent quarter, AWS saw a 17% revenue growth, outpacing Amazon's overall revenue growth of 13%.\n\nTo sum up, Amazon's operations are running more smoothly than ever -- thanks to huge capital investments made during the pandemic. Moreover, the company's chief growth engine, AWS, shows no signs of stopping.\n\nGiven how much free cash flow the company is producing, Amazon's management has numerous options to create value. They could return cash to shareholders through a regular or special dividend; they could repurchase shares; they could invest in further capital spending; they could pay down debt; or they could make a strategic acquisition.\n\nIn any event, Amazon's river of free cash flow is a good reason for investors to consider the stock now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Cloud computing makes it easier for companies and consumers to store data and become more efficient. Also, it more affordable to use cloud providers than it is to invest in the hardware which needs management. These benefits have resulted in a multi-year boom that isn’t slowing down.\n\nThe cloud computing industry has a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.8% through 2031. Artificial intelligence (AI) should keep growth rates elevated since AI tools rely on cloud platforms to process large amounts of data.\n\nMany tech giants have positioned themselves to benefit from the booming cloud industry. In addition, these same corporations have trounced the S&P 500 over the past five years and look ready to extend their rallies. High revenue and net income growth are key components for each of these cloud stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWondering which sky-high cloud stocks can take your portfolio higher? These are some of the top picks that can reward patient investors in the long run.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) service now sign logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is up by 8% year-to-date (YTD) and has delivered a 146% gain over the past five years. The cloud platform features rising revenue and net profit margins. Luckily for long-term investors, it’s also feeling the heat from a bearish analyst.\n\nA Guggenheim analyst warned that generative AI revenue may not grow as quickly as anticipated. It’s possible, according to the bearish call, that this catalyst won’t come to fruition until 2025. ServiceNow is still rated as a strong buy with a projected 15% upside, so most analysts are still bullish.\n\nThe bearish call has resulted in a sharp drop that presents a buy-the-dip opportunity. A look at recent earnings highlights the long-term potential. ServiceNow reported 24% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in the first quarter and raised its full-year guidance. Net income more than doubled YOY to reach $347 million. NOW has a 98% renewal rate among 8,100 customers. And some of them pay more than $1 million per year to use the company’s cloud platform. Therefore, ServiceNow looks ready to deliver long-term gains for patient investors.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has the largest market share in the cloud computing industry. The company’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) makes up roughly one-third of the total market, and it’s growth is accelerating. The tech giant reported 13% YOY net sales growth across its business. AWS stood out with 17% YOY growth, bringing in $25.0 billion in the process.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Amazon isn’t just winning in the cloud computing industry. Also, it is leading the way in e-commerce, advertising, groceries, streaming and other verticals. Each of these segments allows Amazon to show up in front of more consumers. It’s certainly been showing up for investors.\n\nCurrently, Amazon stock is up by 33% YTD and have roughly doubled over the past five years. Wall Street analysts believe that the stock has more room to run. The average price target suggests an 11% upside for the consensus strong buy stock. The highest price target of $246 per share indicates that the stock can gain 23% from current levels.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Minesweeper game with bombs and exploded frowny face, classic Microsoft computer game\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/tomeqs\n\nThe second-largest cloud provider, Microsoft‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud services are growing at a faster rate than Amazon’s. Microsoft Cloud generated $35.1 billion in Q3 of fiscal year 2024 which was 23% higher than the same period last year. AI is fueling more demand for the company’s cloud platform.\n\nThe tech conglomerate as a whole reported 17% YOY revenue growth and 20% YOY net income growth. And, MSFT rewarded shareholders with some of its profits. The company poured $8.4 billion into share repurchases and dividends in the quarter.\n\nMicrosoft currently trades at a 40 P/E ratio and has a 0.65% yield. Shares are up by 24% YTD and have gained 232% over the past five years. It’s a core component of the S&P 500 and most funds in general. Wall Street analysts believe there’s more upside to the stock and have rated it as a strong buy. The average price target suggests a 9% gain from current levels.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NOW, AMZN, and MSFT.

        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, is in advanced talks to acquire cybersecurity startup Wiz for about $23 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. If the deal is finalized, it will be the company’s largest ever acquisition.\n\nThe news comes days after reports surfaced that Alphabet has decided not to pursue an acquisition of HubSpot (NYSE: NYSE:HUBS), a company with a market cap of over $24 billion. Antitrust scrutiny was said to have played a part in the company’s decision not to acquire HubSpot.\n\nWiz posted annual recurring revenue of $350 million in 2023, up from $100 million in its first 18 months after its founding in 2020 by CEO Assaf Rappaport.\n\nThe company raised $1 billion earlier this year at a valuation of $12 billion, suggesting the takeover is nearly double from those levels. Wiz is backed by venture capitalists, including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures, and Lightspeed Venture Partners.\n\nWiz was one of the rare startups outside of AI to raise capital at a higher valuation in 2024. Many startups are suffering from a tech boom hangover fueled by the low-interest rate environment.\n\nIf a deal is completed, it would be nearly double the value of Google’s largest deal to date, a $12.5 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility in 2012. Meanwhile, its second-largest acquisition to date was a $5.4 billion purchase of another security company, Mandiant.\n\nCommenting on the possible deal, Wedbush analysts said this would be a \"shot across the bow at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\"\n\n\"For Google this would be a shot across the bow at Microsoft and Amazon making a major bet on the cyber security space to complement its flagship GCP offering in the cloud,\" the Wedbush analyst stated. \"This would give Google an edge on a number of cloud deployments and further monetize the cyber security cloud space with still less than 50% of the workloads not on the cloud globally.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoogle near deal to acquire cybersecurity startup Wiz for $23 billion - WSJ\n\nTSMC second-quarter profit seen jumping 30% on surging AI chip demand\n\nPro Research: Wall Street dives into Regeneron's robust prospects\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Future-Proof Your Portfolio: 3 Low-Cost AI Stocks to Buy in July",
        "content": "Investors need to keep a close eye on technology trends and business ideas in the burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) market. In this brief review of three stellar AI investment ideas, a panel of Fool.com contributors will focus on tech giants with proven prospects in this arena.\n\nThese stocks are also relatively affordable. The companies under the lens today are at the forefront of AI innovation while offering fantastic investment opportunities.\n\nThis lumbering Nvidia customer is up over 50% in a year and could have more to give\n\nNicholas Rossolillo (Amazon): E-commerce and cloud infrastructure provider Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) rallied over 50% in the last year. Finally, after the stock was clobbered by the bear market, it reached fresh all-time highs recently. Yet in spite of all its economic might, Amazon's market cap is a lowly $2 trillion, currently in fifth place among the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks behind Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nThough it lags behind in total size, Amazon actually rakes in the most sales of any of its tech peers by far. Amazon is homing in on $600 billion in annual revenue. Apple is a distant second place at about $380 billion in trailing 12-month sales. MSFT Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nWhy the disconnect in Amazon's valuation despite swimming in revenue? The reason is simple: The bulk of that revenue is derived from extremely low-margin e-commerce sales. GAAP operating income for the two e-commerce segments North America and International was just 5.8% and 2.8%, respectively, in Q1 2024.\n\nBut in this new AI era, Amazon is looking to change that. It has billions of dollars worth in new AI data centers in the works, with plans to fill them up with lots of Nvidia accelerated computing systems. The promise of such actions? Amazon will gradually convert more of those sales into actual earnings for its shareholders, using the power of AI.\n\nThe company is in a tremendous position of strength, and it's an advantage I believe can help the company generate outsized profit gains for years to come. The initial fruits of this labor are already being realized.\n\nAmazon's operating income increased nearly 170% in the last reported 12-month stretch to over $47 billion. This explains why the stock has rallied as of late. But if the company's AI plans pan out, there could be much more left to gain.\n\nAmazon stock trades for 46 times trailing 12-month free cash flow. I'm more than happy to continue holding my position.\n\nThe one AI stock down big in 2024 is due for a turnaround\n\nBilly Duberstein(Intel): Contrary to most other AI stocks that surged this year, Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) still finds itself down 33% on the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's struggles are well-known. Intel lost the chipmaking process technology lead about a decade ago and has been losing market share to rivals ever since. In addition, new CEO Pat Gelsinger is trying to engineer an expensive turnaround, even as Intel's core PC and data center chip businesses have gone into a downturn.\n\nHowever, the second half of 2024 could mark a turning point in which virtually all of these headwinds turn into tailwinds. Enterprises are lapping the huge 2020-2021 PC cycle, and the Windows 10 operating system will no longer be supported next year. And with the advent of the \"AI PC,\" it's pretty likely these factors will all buoy a PC industry recovery starting in the second half.\n\nAdditionally, the downturn in non-AI servers appears to be bottoming and turning up, according to a few bullish reports last month from Taiwanese server makers. That should also help Intel's data center business.\n\nAlso set for the back half, Intel forecast about $500 million in revenue for its Gaudi accelerator, its AI training chip, for the back half of the year. That would be the first meaningful Gaudi revenue for Intel.\n\nBut the most important thing is for the company to continue executing on its \"five nodes in four years\" turnaround plan, whereby Intel aims to regain process leadership by next year while also attracting third-party foundry customers.\n\nNews on that front has been promising. In June, Intel announced it was now in mass production on Intel 3, its third node of the five nodes in its four-year plan, right on schedule. Intel 3 is an important milestone, with process technology aimed at data center applications.\n\nThe next two nodes will be Intel 20A and 18A. Both of these will incorporate the dual innovations of gate-all-around transistors and backside power whereby the power inputs and outputs are put on the back of the chip, leaving more room on the front for computing power. This is where the rubber will meet the road and where Intel plans to catch Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing in process technology.\n\nIntel trades at one-seventh the market cap of Taiwan Semiconductor. Should Intel successfully execute and reach its 18A goal on time late in 2024 or early in 2025, its stock likely has further upside in a \"catch-up\" trade to other AI winners.\n\nAlphabet: The low-priced AI leader that's built to last\n\nAnders Bylund (Alphabet): Today's stock market is full of potential AI winners -- but I'd rather own a top-quality stock with tremendous long-term prospects that just happens to be an established leader in AI technology, too. That's what Google parent Alphabet brings to the table.\n\nIn my opinion, Alphabet is the best AI stock to own, even after the stock's impressive 58% price surge over the past year. This tech giant is built to last.\n\nThe company's AI capabilities, managed in the Google DeepMind group, keep pushing the boundaries of innovation. DeepMind was there to rewrite the rules of chess engines in 2017 and didn't stop there. Their latest rollout of Google AI features shows a relentless drive to stay ahead of the game. The Gemini large language model (LLM) is getting faster and better, while the Veo generative video creator and Imagen 3 image generator set new standards in AI-based media quality.\n\nI don't see AI as an effective competitor to Alphabet's traditional core business. Despite all the buzz around generative AI as an alternative to traditional search engines, Google Search remains the undisputed leader, grabbing 91.1% of the global market and boosting profits by nearly 60% in the first quarter. And I'm convinced that Google Search users walk away happier, avoiding the possibility of \"hallucination\" results from an overly creative AI system.\n\nWhat really sweetens the deal is Alphabet's valuation. With a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 28.5, a price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 7.2, and price to free cash flow of 33.2, it's a steal compared to Nvidia's sky-high valuations. Alphabet isn't just another player in the AI game -- it started shaping the future of AI long before ChatGPT was a thing and still leads the race.\n\nFrom cutting-edge AI research to practical applications in search, cloud, and even drug discovery, Alphabet is a smart, sustainable pick for the long haul. It's a stock that never looks expensive, and its diverse revenue streams ensure it's here to stay for decades. I'm not worried about missing Alphabet's AI train pulling out of the station.\n\nThis stock is a long-term buy at nearly any price, and those multicolored shares don't even look expensive today. They even come with a modest dividend nowadays, sweetening the pot for value and income investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Best AI Value Stocks That are ‘Money Machines’ According to NYU’s Aswath Damodaran. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nAswath Damodaran is a Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. His thoughts on economy and stock valuations are given a lot of weight by analysts. Damodaran in his recent interview with CNBC said that Magnificent Seven stocks have become the “value stocks for investors who care about earnings and cash flows.”\n\n“We look at the last year and a half, they’ve added $8.8 trillion in market cap… just these seven companies. Just to give you perspective, the second-largest market in the world, China, has a market cap of $12.1 trillion. These seven stocks alone have added more in market cap than the entire German market, the French market, the Swiss market.”\n\nDamodaran’s comments are important because he’s been repeatedly saying in the past that major technology companies are fully or overvalued. In September, he said on CNBC that if you go through the list of top tech stocks, “you are more likely to be overvalued than undervalued.”\n\nBut in his latest interview, Damodaran said that before we “dismiss” Mag. 7 stocks as “risky tech companies,” we should keep in mind that “these are the money machines in this market.”\n\nHowever, when asked whether he believes we are not in any kind of “danger zone,” the professor said we are in the danger zone not just in terms of these seven stocks, but the market overall.\n\nIn this article we take a look at the Mag 7. stocks and their AI-related growth catalysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Best AI Value Stock That is ‘Money Machine’ According to NYU’s Aswath Damodaran?\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nAMZN is one of the top names in the Mag. 7 group of stocks which Aswath Damodoran recently called “money machines.”\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Dan Ives of Wedbush thinks have the potential to grow based on the AI revolution.\n\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn’t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled “chatbot recommendations” as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strength in the application layer of AI.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\n\nAlphyn Capital Management stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer’s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Buy With $1,000 and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Don't let Nvidia's raging popularity distract you from the fact that there are many sorts of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to choose from. Companies in industries ranging from chips to software are poised to feel the tailwinds of AI growth over the coming years.\n\nInvestors can position themselves for success by gravitating to bona-fide winners, the cream of the crop that are equipped to stay on top as the AI industry grows and inevitably evolves. Three Fool.com contributors did their homework and came up with Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM), and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). These companies have the competitive edge to win over the long haul -- and their stock can be had for just $1,000.\n\n1. Amazon: Modest valuation makes it appealing\n\nJake Lerch (Amazon): My choice is Amazon. If I'm making a choice today about an AI stock to buy and hold forever, I have to consider valuation. Simply put, AI stocks have been on a wild ride, and some of them are now reaching dangerously high valuation levels.\n\nConsider this chart: NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe three largest companies in the world -- Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia -- are at or near 10-year highs when it comes to their price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. This ratio is important because it captures market sentiment, reflecting investors' expectations of future growth, rather than quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in a company's earnings results, which is what price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios tend to do.\n\nThe takeaway is that many AI stocks are rising to new highs on future expectations of growth, rather than on current sales. However, there are AI companies that are bucking this trend, or at least, they are an example where the size of the increase isn't as large.\n\nHere's the same chart, with Amazon's P/S ratio included. NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nWith a current P/S ratio of 3.6x, Amazon's valuation is a fraction of Nvidia's (41.8x); it's also much lower than Microsoft's (14.6x) or Apple's (9.4x). Importantly, Amazon's current P/S ratio is roughly equal to its 10-year average of 3.2x, indicating a stable valuation over time.\n\nIn other words, while some of its major competitors' stocks have gotten ahead of themselves during the AI boom, Amazon stock still looks highly attractive.\n\nOn top of that, the company has numerous AI initiatives ranging from smart speakers to its fleet of nearly 1 million humanoid robots. These initiatives, coupled with Amazon's strong financial position, show it is well-positioned to capitalize on the AI revolution and potentially experience significant growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn summary, investors seeking an AI stock to buy and hold forever should strongly consider Amazon.\n\n2. Qualcomm: Build a connection with this stock\n\nWill Healy(Qualcomm): Over the last year, investors have become focused on AI chips. However, just because Nvidia leads the industry does not mean it is the only player. With an increased focus on AI, investors may have more reasons to consider Qualcomm a forever holding.\n\nQualcomm has long served as the leader in smartphone chipsets, and maintaining that leadership in today's market means proficiency in AI. Fortunately, the company has embraced on-device AI. This works collaboratively with cloud AI and its devices, which reside on the edge. Thus, it can deliver AI capabilities faster and more efficiently.\n\nMoreover, Qualcomm does not limit these capabilities to smartphones. In recent years, the company has worked to deliver its technology to IoT devices, automotive platforms, and PC chips, amounting to a tech ecosystem powered by AI.\n\nAdditionally, after a revenue slump in fiscal 2023, Qualcomm has finally begun to rebound. In the first six months of fiscal 2024 (ended March 24), revenue of $19 billion rose 3% compared with the same period in the previous year.\n\nAlso, total costs and expenses fell 1%, leading to a net income of $5.1 billion in the first half of the fiscal year. That represents a 29% increase from year-ago levels. Also, since Qualcomm forecasts $9.2 billion in revenue at the midpoint in fiscal Q3, its revenue growth rate could reach double digits in the next quarter.\n\nInvestors have paid increased attention, as the semiconductor stock has risen by approximately 80% over the last year. That took its P/E ratio to around 28, its highest level in over three years.\n\nNonetheless, assuming double-digit revenue growth returns, rising profits should reduce the impact of its rising valuation. Ultimately, improving financials, coupled with Qualcomm's increasing importance in the AI space, should solidify its stock as a profitable long-term holding.\n\n3. Meta Platforms: AI is complementary\n\nJustin Pope (Meta Platforms): While searching for the ultimate buy-and-hold AI stock, Meta Platforms kept rising to the top of my list. The pitch for Meta stock is simple but effective. The company is already a clear technology juggernaut today. It makes money on digital ads served to its 3.24 billion daily active users across its social media apps: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads.\n\nIt's a lucrative business; Meta converts a robust 35% of its revenue into free cash flow and earns an impressive 29% return on the capital it invests in the business.\n\nMeta still offers plenty of growth despite its $1.3 trillion market cap. Analysts believe the company will grow earnings by an average of 18% annually over the long term. AI could play a big role in that. Meta has unleashed AI to improve its advertising business and boost profits.\n\nAdditionally, the company has invested heavily in AI infrastructure, spending billions of dollars to develop and run generative AI models.\n\nThe great thing about Meta is that AI won't make or break the stock. AI could unlock the growth needed for Meta to remain a long-term market-beater, but it was already a great business before AI. Meta's CEO and co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, is still in charge, and he's just 40 years old. You can buy and hold Meta, knowing the company is in good hands for the foreseeable future.\n\nLastly, the stock remains attractive at a P/E ratio of 26 times earnings, a very reasonable price for a business growing earnings by 18% annually. Many other AI stocks have gotten too expensive, meaning Meta could perform much better if it realizes its AI potential.\n\nThis ultimately makes Meta a no-brainer AI stock investors should buy and hold tight.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Hedge Fund Managers' 2 Favorite Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks (Hint: Nvidia Isn't 1 of Them)",
        "content": "\"Follow the money.\"\n\nThat phrase gained notoriety during the Watergate scandal five decades ago. However, it could be useful for investors today looking for stocks to buy.\n\nMuch of the big money has poured into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the last two years. Nvidia has been an especially significant beneficiary of this trend, with its shares skyrocketing over 9x since the beginning of 2023.\n\nBut where would following the money lead investors now? Here are billionaire hedge fund managers' two favorite AI stocks -- and Nvidia isn't one of them.\n\nThe top hedge fund billionaires\n\nForbes ranked the wealthiest hedge fund managers of 2023. The top 10 were:\n\nRank Manager Hedge Fund Net Worth (as of 3/10/23) 1 Ken Griffin Citadel $35 billion 2 Jim Simons Renaissance Technologies $28.1 billion 3 Ray Dalio Bridgewater Associates $19.1 billion 4 David Tepper Appaloosa Management $18.5 billion 5 Steve Cohen Point72 Asset Management $17.5 billion 6 Carl Icahn Icahn Enterprises $17.5 billion 7 Michael Platt BlueCrest Capital Management $16 billion 8 Israel Englander Millennium Management $11.5 billion 9 Chase Coleman Tiger Global Management $8.5 billion 10 David Shaw D.E. Shaw & Co. $7.9 billion\n\nData source: Forbes.\n\nJim Simons has since passed away, although his Renaissance Technologies hedge fund remains active. The net worths of the other nine hedge fund managers have changed somewhat since last year, but they're all still multibillionaires.\n\nMost of these billionaire hedge fund managers have invested heavily in AI. Carl Icahn stands out as a notable exception. None of Icahn Enterprises' holdings are AI-related. Michael Platt's BlueCrest Capital also has no AI stocks among its top positions.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund managers' two favorite AI stocks\n\nHowever, two AI stocks, in particular, are arguably the favorites of the other billionaire hedge fund managers. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ranked in the top five holdings of seven of the 10 richest hedge fund managers on Forbes' list based on their latest regulatory filings. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) wasn't too far behind, landing in the top five for half the 10 wealthiest hedge fund managers.\n\nSteve Cohen and Israel England like Amazon the most. The e-commerce and cloud services leader is the largest holding for Cohen's Point72 Asset Management and England's Millennium Management. Amazon is the second-largest holding for David Tepper's Appaloosa Management.\n\nMicrosoft ranks as the No. 1 position for David Shaw's D.E. Shaw & Co. It's the second-largest holding for Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management. And while the tech giant isn't Ken Griffin's biggest position for his Citadel fund, Microsoft is his top AI stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nRunners up\n\nAlthough Nvidia wasn't one of billionaire hedge managers' top two favorite AI stocks, it was a close runner-up. The graphics processing unit (GPU) maker was in the top five holdings for four of Forbes' 10 richest hedge fund managers. Perhaps surprisingly, though, Nvidia wasn't the No. 1 AI stock for any of them.\n\nMeta Platforms wasn't too far behind either. It ranked in the top five holdings for three of the individuals on Forbes' list. Meta is the largest position for Coleman's Tiger Global Management.\n\nShould you buy Amazon and Microsoft too?\n\nNo one should buy a stock only to follow in the footsteps of billionaire investors. However, I think Amazon and Microsoft have a lot going for them.\n\nAmazon is the world's largest cloud services provider. AI should provide a long-term tailwind for the company's Amazon Web Services unit. Amazon is also using AI extensively in its e-commerce operations to increase efficiency and profitability.\n\nMicrosoft continues to reap the rewards from its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. It has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 throughout its products. The company is the second-largest cloud service provider and should benefit from the same AI tailwind as Amazon.\n\nAs customers continue to move to the cloud to build and deploy AI models, Amazon's and Microsoft's revenue and earnings should grow significantly. Share prices tend to rise with earnings growth over the long term. I view Amazon and Microsoft as great AI stocks to buy right now. Just follow the AI money.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Prime Day deals are almost here. Should you take advantage of them?",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — It's summertime, and the bargains seem easy at a time when many consumer prices are high.\n\nJuly sales events have become a seasonal revenue driver for the retail industry since Amazon launched its first Prime Day back in 2015. While consumers may be enticed by the advertised can't-miss savings on some products, personal finance experts say shoppers should be careful not to fall for potentially misleading marketing or give in to impulse buys.\n\nAmazon has drummed up expectations in recent weeks for its 10th Prime Day event, which will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday and is open only to customers who pay $14.99 per month, or $139 per year, to receive free shipping and other perks as Prime members.\n\nRival retailers tried in the past to capture some of the Prime Day excitement by offering their own discounts during the two-day event. This year, Walmart, Target, Kohl's, and newcomers TikTok Shop and Temu launched summer promotions ahead of Amazon, hoping to siphon off some of the e-commerce giant's savings-hungry shoppers. Meanwhile, Macy's will be rolling out what it calls its “best summer deals” during an eight-day discount event that begins on Tuesday.\n\nWhy are retailers offering so many summer discounts?\n\nJuly sales help retailers attract customers who are looking to get a head start on back-to-school shopping, which is the industry’s second-most important shopping season behind the winter holiday period. The markdowns also pull in some discretionary spending from shoppers who’ve had their eyes on gadgets, household products and seasonal items, such as a bikini or a new summer dress.\n\nDiscounts can help retailers combat “a summer lull in retail spending” as consumers shift their spending to summer vacations and services, like going out to eat at restaurants, according to John Mercer, the head of global research at Coresight Research.\n\n“It drives a bit of excitement in that mid-year period,\" when retailers may otherwise struggle to generate more revenue, Mercer said. Companies also have relied on discounts to drive consumer spending during the recent period of inflation and high interest rates, he said.\n\nAmazon doesn't disclose how much revenue it pulls in from Prime Day, but it has given some indications of its success. The company said last year's event resulted in the “single largest sales day\" in the company's history, with customers purchasing more than 375 million items.\n\nAn estimate from market research firm Emarketer indicated Amazon's global sales on Prime Day went up to $12.5 billion in 2023. The firm forecasts sales to jump roughly 7% this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre the prices on offer really deals or something else?\n\nIt depends on who you ask.\n\nRetailers hype up their promotions to pull people in. But the New York Times-owned product review website Wirecutter published an article this month saying most of Amazon's early deals this year so far “stink.”\n\nSanta Clara University business professor Kirthi Kalyanam, who is writing a book about Amazon, said Prime Day offers have been good, historically. That's because the company was able to source discounts from well-known brands such as Apple and to incentivize third-party sellers to lower their prices by promising to feature them prominently on the Amandon website, according to Halyanam.\n\nBut Prime Day discounts may matter less these days because customers are getting accustomed to the ultra-cheap products sold by Amazon competitors Shein and Temu, which were both founded in China.\n\n“Many of (the) deals may not be as competitive compared to Temu and Shien,” Kalyanam said.\n\nAt the same time, he noted rival retailers will most likely be looking at Amazon's prices and trying to match them overnight. Last week, he said he saw Best Buy discount two products after Amazon revealed some of its early deals.\n\nConsumer data company Numerator reported that a majority of the roughly 5,000 Prime Day shoppers it surveyed after last year's event saw product discounts of up to 40%. Survey respondents said they saw a quarter of items selling at a discount of 60% or more.\n\nSome shopping experts have said that some past Prime discounts were not as big as they appeared.\n\nWhat are some bargain-hunting and budgeting tips?\n\nIf you're watching your budget, personal finance experts say you should exercise caution before you buy.\n\n“Avoid the false sense of urgency of manufactured holidays,” advises Mark Elliot, chief customer officer at financial services company LendingClub. “The idea that ‘The more you spend, the more you save’ — that’s just definitionally not true.”\n\nDan Egan, a vice president at financial advising and investment company Betterment, says shoppers should make a list of what they need before the sales begin to be intentional about purchases. He also encourages consumers to avoid shopping late at night or out of boredom.\n\n“Once you have a list, it’s less likely you’ll get distracted by things you don’t need,\" Egan said. \"If that list contains almost nothing, I would say to delete the (retailers') apps off your phone for the next week or two. Or you’re going to get lots of notifications.”\n\nAny shopper already carrying a credit card balance should keep in mind that the interest paid on that balance could end up cancelling out any perceived savings from a summer sale purchase, he added.\n\n“A deal is not a deal if you have to pay interest on it,\" Egan said.\n\nWhile it may make sense for shoppers to try out free or temporary memberships to qualify for the best deals during the summer sales, those programs typically charge a fee to the customer’s credit card on file after a short period of time, noted Erin Witte, the Consumer Federation of America's director of consumer protection.\n\n“Set a calendar reminder to cancel if you don't want to go through with that subscription,” Witte said. “Think about it right at the beginning. And remember that these companies design this product to make it easy to sign up, but more difficult to cancel.\"\n\nConsumer Reports also offers a few tips: Download Amazon's app, sign-up for invite-only deals available for a select group of shoppers, and join the waitlist on limited-time offers that are already sold out.\n\nDon't forget to shop around\n\nFilling up an online Amazon cart is tempting for Prime members since they are paying for access to Prime Day deals. But it’s always a smart idea to compare prices across multiple websites before completing a purchase.\n\nUnlike Prime Day offers, Walmart’s discount event this month was open to everyone. However, the company sweetened the deal for its Walmart+ members by offering them early access.\n\nTarget only offered discounts to shoppers enrolled in its Target Circle loyalty program and used the weeklong event to promote a new membership program that aims to rejuvenate sales and traffic.\n\nTikTok Shop, the e-commerce arm of the popular video-sharing app, opened its summer sales event to everyone. The event started on July 9 and runs until Wednesday.\n\n_______\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Costco vs. Amazon",
        "content": "Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are both categorized as retail stocks, but their varied business models make for some challenging comparisons when trying to determine which is the better investment.\n\nOne commonality is that both companies are leaders in their respective areas of retail (Costco leads the wholesale brick-and-mortar sector and Amazon is the king of e-commerce). Costco has vastly expanded its online presence in recent years so some comparisons are getting easier. Likewise, Amazon is building a position in grocery stores with its subsidiary Whole Foods.\n\nOne significant commonality is that they both use a subscription-based model to increase sales and encourage brand loyalty. Costco has found considerable success in offering an annual membership for access to its super competitive product pricing. Amazon's Prime membership gives members access to cheaper and more efficient shipping (as well as other perks). Both companies boast an impressive renewal rate on these memberships. These subscription models pave the way for reliable growth over the long term, helping both companies worry less about product sales and more about membership growth. COST Chart\n\nOn the investor side, that steady income is attractive and it has helped both Costco and Amazon stocks deliver market-beating gains over the past several years (see chart above). Even better, both stocks are expected to continue this above-average performance, offering new investors a chance to get in on the continued growth.\n\nBut if you only had room to add one of these retail stocks to your portfolio, which should you choose? Which one has a better chance to profit from the retail sector's continued growth over the next decade?\n\nThe case for Costco\n\nAs measured by market cap, Costco (at $390 billion) is the world's third-largest retailer (trailing only Amazon and Walmart). The company has come a long way during the nearly 50 years it's existed. Costco now operates 879 warehouses across 14 countries. Yet it has barely scratched the surface of its expansion potential.\n\nCostco's relatively unique business model offers paying club members access to wholesale prices on thousands of products across multiple categories. The company's priorities emphasize quality products and low-margin prices catered to the varied cultures of the countries it operates in. Its earnings continue to rise despite its low margins and investments in international expansion thanks to efficient operations, loyal customers, and steady membership fees.\n\nOver the past five years, Costco's annual revenue and operating income have jumped 59% and 71%, while free cash flow has soared by 121%. For reference, Walmart's free cash flow fell 14% during the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd despite its steady growth (including achieving 714 locations in North America), the retail giant still has plenty of room to add more stores and grow its footprint. Costco has seven or fewer stores in six of the 14 nations it operates in, suggesting it's only just getting started in those markets. Its expansion will only be helped by the 91% membership renewal rate the company has worldwide, which saw it hit 128 million members in 2023.\n\nMoreover, e-commerce has become a major growth catalyst for Costco in recent years. In the third quarter of 2024, e-commerce sales rose 21% year over year, more than double the growth from any other segment and even outperforming Amazon's retail growth in the same quarter.\n\nAs already noted, investors are attracted to Costco's business model. As a result, shares in Costco have delivered triple-digit growth over the last five years. That elevated share price performance has also elevated the stock's valuation well above its 10-year average. That elevated valuation is reasonable, though, given its growth potential.\n\nThe case for Amazon\n\nLike Costco, Amazon has amassed a considerable user base. Its subscription-based model has seen Amazon Prime gain over 200 million subscribers worldwide, boasting a 99% 2-year renewal rate in the U.S. Prime has become so ubiquitous that roughly 71% of all U.S. Amazon shoppers are members.\n\nAmazon's annual revenue and operating income have risen by 105% and 153%, respectively, over the last five years, and its free cash flow is up 111%. That growth has come despite the economic turbulence of 2021 and 2022, proving the resiliency of Amazon's business.\n\nHowever, Amazon's overwhelming presence in online retail has caused e-commerce growth to slow, with sales in Q1 2024 up 5% compared to total revenue growth of 13% year over year. As a result, the company has steadily reinvested its gains into diversifying its revenue streams, becoming one of the most prominent names in tech. The company is home to the world's biggest cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and is responsible for a leading 22% market share in video steaming thanks to the success of Prime Video.\n\nWhile retail continues to deliver sales growth, the company's positions in cloud computing and streaming are boosting earnings even more. In the first quarter, AWS revenue spiked by 17% year over year, while operating income nearly doubled. Meanwhile, advertising services sales jumped 24% year over year after Amazon introduced ads on Prime Video.\n\nAmazon has built itself into a behemoth in retail and tech. The growth catalysts across both industries make its stock worth considering. Its valuation is elevated compared to an average stock, but low compared to other tech stocks and not bad compared to its 10-year average. Given its growth potential going forward, its valuation is reasonable.\n\nIs Costco or Amazon the best stock to buy right now?\n\nAs was noted at the top, comparing these two stocks isn't easy. They really are different companies with different factors influencing the investment thesis for each. Finding financial metrics that allow for fair comparisons isn't easy either. How do you fairly compare what is best described as a tech growth stock to what is best described as a retail sector dividend stock?\n\nEven a basic metric like the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) isn't perfect. The chart below would seem to indicate Amazon is the more expensive stock to buy right now. COST PS Ratio Chart\n\nBut expand that chart out over a decade and include 10-year averages, and you see that the answer is more complicated. Amazon stock is actually trading around its average P/S while Costco is trading roughly twice its average P/S over the past decade. That suggests Costco is the more expensive stock. COST PS Ratio Chart\n\nIt's fair to say that both Costco and Amazon are killing it in their respective industries, and both companies' stocks are likely to lift any portfolio over the long term. So the choice between these companies really comes down to your investment style.\n\nAnother look at the chart above shows that Amazon's P/S has been erratic over the past decade, while Costco's has remained more stable. Amazon's focus and earnings are gradually moving away from retail and more into tech, an industry that generally offers significant gains over the long term but can also suffer short-term steep declines from time to time. Costco has offered more reliable growth.\n\nSo, if you're willing to hold during potential market downturns in order to gain exposure to high-growth markets like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and digital advertising, Amazon stock is an excellent option. If you prefer a steady growth stock (also offering a dividend) that you can just buy and forget about over the next decade, you might be better suited to Costco's stock.\n\nGiven my investing goals and interests, Amazon is the better buy than Costco at the moment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has triggered a multi-year investment cycle across the enterprise. Additionally, generative AI is now permeating various consumer internet applications. These trends bode well for AI wealth-building stocks.\n\nIn Q1 of fiscal year 2024, a huge moment of clarity appeared on AI spending as cloud service providers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) increased their capital expenditure plans. Indeed, it was a stark reminder of the heavy investment needed to make AI applications and products a reality. Bank of America projects capex for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon will increase by $37 billion in 2024 to $145 billion.\n\nMoreover, according to Capital Group, big tech giants are raising their capital expenditure budgets and will spend an estimated $500 billion over the next three years. This spending will go toward chips, particularly graphics processing units (GPUs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Plus, a substantial proportion will cover memory, servers and network equipment. This means more profits will flow to these three AI wealth-building stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nCustom ASICs have emerged as an alternative to Nvidia’s H100 and B200 GPUs. After Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is the second-largest player in this fast-growing high-end market, with a 13-15% share.\n\nJPMorgan analysts are bullish on Marvell Technology as one of the AI wealth-building stocks to buy. They forecast that the high-end ASIC market will grow to between $20 and $30 billion. Additionally, due to demand from generative AI, this market will grow at a 20% compounded annual growth rate.\n\nBuoyed by this growth, the company’s AI revenues could skyrocket. Notably, the chip maker is working with various big tech companies on custom silicon. It has been collaborating with Google on its 5-nanometer Axion ARM CPU chip and Amazon on its 5-nanometer Tranium chip. Additionally, rumors are buzzing that it’s working with Microsoft on its Maia chip and Amazon on its Inferentia chip.\n\nConsidering these tailwinds, JPMorgan analysts think MRVL could generate $1.6 to $1.8 billion in revenues from networking and custom ASICs this year. Moreover, they expect AI revenues to double next year. Additionally, most analysts are extremely bullish, with 28 buy ratings and a median price target of $90, representing over 20% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter a 10% pullback, it is time to buy Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). The memory maker is among the best-positioned AI wealth-building stocks due to its high bandwidth memory (HBM). Importantly, HBM memory reduces bottlenecks, increasing training efficiency for large language models.\n\nAlthough Micron Technology tumbled after Q3 of FY 2024 earnings, the results were stellar. The company blew past estimates, reporting revenues of $6.81 billion for the third quarter against estimates of $6.67 billion. Data center drove the strength as AI demand led to 50% quarter-over-quarter (QOQ) growth in the segment. Furthermore, the company grew its share in high-margin AI products such as data center solid-state drives and HBM.\n\nAnother impressive highlight was the company disclosing that HBM chips were sold out for 2024 and 2025. Due to robust demand, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sanjay Mehrotra noted in Q3 prepared remarks that Micron Technology was on track for record FY 2024 revenues. Besides, he expects this momentum to carry over into FY 2025.\n\nIndeed, MU is set for a banner FY 2025 due to AI demand, making it one of the top AI wealth-building stocks. Moreover, an ongoing shift from commoditized memory to high-margin AI products will boost profitability.\n\nASML Holding N.Y. (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nAs demand for AI accelerates, semiconductor foundries and integrated device manufacturers are scrambling to increase capacity. This ramp-up spells opportunity for ASML Holding N.Y. (NASDAQ:ASML), the maker of EUV machines used to manufacture chips.\n\nSeveral reasons prevail for maintaining a bullish stance on ASML. First, AI-related revenue is soaring due to memory demand driven by advanced memories such as HBM and DDR5. As a result, the semiconductor equipment maker is seeing increasing orders from memory makers like Micron Technology.\n\nSecondly, the firm benefits from increased subsidies and grants to the semiconductor sector. Due to incentives and grants from laws such as the CHIPS and Science Act, chip manufacturers are opening new facilities. For instance, Micron Technology is constructing new fabs in New York and Idaho. In line with this expansion, it will spend $8 billion of capex in 2024 and increase it to a mid-30s percentage of revenue in 2025.\n\nThe outlook for ASML is very positive. Almost every foundry and integrated device maker is constructing new chip manufacturing facilities. Companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Samsung Electronics and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have broken ground on new projects in the U.S. and Europe. These facilities will be filled with ASML equipment, making the stock a top buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon is worried about upstarts like Temu and Shein. Here's how it's confronting them.",
        "content": "Amazon’s (AMZN) dominance in e-commerce makes any potential threat hard to take seriously. On the surface anyway. But the staggering growth of direct shippers like Temu and Shein, though puny in comparison, has grabbed the attention of the people who run the everything store.\n\nAnd Amazon aims to confront them directly before they get much more traction.\n\nAmazon’s reported move to start a new service focused on shipping low-cost fashion and lifestyle products directly from China highlights how bargain platforms have made inroads with American shoppers and Chinese manufacturers. And how even market leaders are forced to adjust to maintain top billing.\n\n“The Chinese marketplaces aren’t currently a huge threat to Amazon, but they are growing, and they are nibbling away at its market share,” said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at GlobalData.\n\nNew data underscores how thoroughly Amazon commands the e-commerce market but also suggests why propping up a bargain copycat service seems like a strategic necessity, akin to a mainstream airline launching a discount carrier to fend off the \"little guys.\"\n\nBy the numbers, of course, the up-and-comers look more like niche businesses compared with the Seattle mega-retailer.\n\nAmazon is forecast to generate more than $360 billion in 2025 from sales tied to independent sellers that use the online platform, according to a report published by eMarketer last week. That represents a 10% jump from 2024. And it’s ten times higher than its closest online competitor, eBay (EBAY).\n\nBut even as Amazon towers above its rivals, including the likes of Walmart (see above chart), and is expected to post healthy growth, Temu’s anticipated figures, for example, outshine everyone else.\n\nTemu — where customers can order shoes for less than $10, drones for $15, or a mattress topper for a little more than $30 — is expected to grow its third-party sales by nearly 60% next year to more than $30 billion, eMarketer estimates show. That’s well above the growth forecasts of other marketplace competitors, including Walmart (WMT) and Etsy (ETSY).\n\nAt the moment, Temu and other low cost platforms have a catalog confined to more affordable products and basic consumer goods. “But there is a danger the overlap could grow as the marketplaces round out their offer and push into higher price points,” said Saunders.\n\nLike other forms of online shopping or walking the aisles for sales, perceived savings have a way of loosening purses, playing off impulses, and convincing shoppers to pick up items they didn't know they needed.\n\nStory continues\n\nOwned by the Chinese e-commerce group PDD Holdings (PDD), Temu began operating in the US in 2022. The company has relied on an advertising blitz and subsidies to disrupt established players in China and abroad, wielding ultra-low prices to claw away market share, a model that has thrived as consumers mind their spending. PDD doesn't break out Temu sales figures. But the parent company reported revenue of $12 billion for the quarter ending in May.\n\nShein also has Chinese roots but is currently headquartered in Singapore. The fast-fashion juggernaut, which features $5 pajama sets and $7 yoga leggings, doesn't report its financials. But in a run-up to a potential IPO, estimates pin the company's annual revenue at more than $30 billion.\n\nAlongside their financial accomplishments, the two platforms have drawn political scrutiny over the way they handle sending goods to the US. Shein and Temu benefit from a tax loophole that exempts packages from tariffs if they are worth less than $800. Some lawmakers have called for an end to this trade provision, targeting Chinese companies. Almost half of the shipments that are sent over using the duty-free exemption come from China, according to a recent Congressional committee report. Is Amazon running scared? The Temu website. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nA cheaper but slower supply chain\n\nPlatforms like Shein and Temu have discovered that for some customers looking for a certain set of products, speed is less important than extraordinary value.\n\nFor years, Amazon has conditioned US consumers to buy unbranded goods from Chinese sellers at low prices. The company optimized for speedy delivery, developing a fulfillment network that can deliver goods in days or even hours. That’s true for goods already shipped to the US from abroad and from domestic merchants. In March, for instance, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or the next day across the top 60 largest US metro areas, the company has touted.\n\nCustomers shopping on discount platforms, however, can buy from sellers who ship products directly from China. Since the goods aren’t already sitting in stateside warehouses, the logistical journey means delivery times are measured in days and weeks. But what these transactions lose in time, they make up for in price. That’s how customers can find an array of goods on Temu that are much cheaper than those sold by department stores or even Amazon. (To beat the heat, an ice maker costs around $50 on Temu, compared to roughly $80 on Amazon. And a neck fan — who doesn't need one of those? — goes for around $5 on Temu. Similar items range from $20 to $45 on Amazon.)\n\nThe direct shipping model works especially well for cheaper items since more of their price is attributed to cost and fees. Removing a fulfillment layer can make them significantly cheaper. That’s why traditional retailers and Amazon — which offer service, convenience, and speed — typically can’t match the prices of bargain apps.\n\nCopycat models\n\nAs the discount platforms have grown their customer base, Amazon has taken notice.\n\nThe e-commerce leader has shared plans with Chinese sellers to launch a new shopping channel that would cater to users looking for affordable clothing and lifestyle products, as first reported by the Information's Jing Yang and Theo Wayt. The items, many of which will cost less than $20, would be shipped directly from China, with delivery as fast as nine days.\n\n“There is also something of a future threat in that the Chinese marketplaces are very appealing to younger generations, which Amazon also wants to recruit and retain as future shoppers,” said Saunders.\n\nAnd it’s not just customers Amazon is after.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Amazon said “We are always exploring new ways to work with our selling partners to delight our customers with more selection, lower prices, and greater convenience.”\n\nTemu told Yahoo Finance in a statement that their direct-from-factory model streamlined the traditional retail supply chain. \"By eliminating intermediaries, we pass savings directly to consumers, offering lower prices without compromising quality,\" the company said. \"Consumers have embraced this approach by making Temu one of the most popular shopping apps in the world.\"\n\nShein did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAmazon's planned discount storefront is also an attempt to court Chinese sellers, their flow of business, and their ad dollars, said Sky Canaves, a principal analyst at eMarketer.\n\n“They may individually sell small amounts, but in the aggregate, they are high. If the sellers decide to go sell elsewhere, on TikTok and Shein and Temu, if they start exploring other platforms, they are going to be spending on other platforms,” she said. “That’s what Amazon is trying to anticipate.”\n\nBut the supply chain mimicry and incursion into rival turf go both ways. Just as Amazon is trying to be more like Temu and Shein, the discount platforms are trying to be more like Amazon, said Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder of the market research firm Marketplace Pulse.\n\nBargain platforms are setting up partnerships and local warehouse programs in the US and are recruiting domestic merchants.\n\nTemu's efforts to recruit more Chinese sellers with US inventory, as well as local merchants, are taking a page out of the Amazon book. It's also a way to protect the company if the US government eliminates the trade provision that exempts low-cost shipments from customs duties, as the Information reported on Wednesday. While it continues to ship products directly from China, Temu is establishing a stronger base of independent US sellers\n\nTemu told Yahoo Finance that qualified sellers can now handle their own logistics from local US and European warehouses. \"This enriches our product selection, reduces shipping distances, and shortens delivery times,\" the company said.\n\nThe broad success of Amazon’s e-commerce business has also invited other major players like Walmart and Target (TGT) to build their own marketplaces with third-party sellers. And the build-out of supply chain logistics has made it easier for bands outside the US to gain a foothold, said Cayce Roy, the founder and chief executive at Standvast, an e-commerce fulfillment company, and a former vice president at Amazon.\n\nThe challenges for Amazon\n\nIn an environment where Amazon still has headroom for growth but is closer to saturation, experts say creating new revenue streams and claiming share from rivals are ways to boost growth.\n\nBut challenges lie ahead for taking on the discount platforms that have fortified a niche for themselves.\n\nIf Amazon built an identity based around rapid delivery and convenience, how will the company communicate to shoppers the upside of slower delivery?\n\n“This is not a natural fit for them. And they don’t necessarily have an advantage,” said Kaziukėnas.\n\nKaziukėnas also pointed to Prime Day, just around the corner, to highlight the many other shopping behaviors Amazon is trying to cater to.\n\n“Shein and Temu are not accidental. This is the one thing these apps are focused on, but for Amazon, this is going to be priority number 17,” he said. \"For all of Amazon’s prowess and strength, this is where they are starting from a point of weakness.”\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its “ClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy” second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. U.S. stocks increased during a difficult quarter for diversified portfolios due to the market leadership remaining centered around a few mega-cap firms that were thought to be the major winners in the expanding AI industry. The benchmark Russell 3000 Index returned 3.22% in the quarter. The strategy underperformed the benchmark in the second quarter and had gains in four of 10 sectors in which it was invested, on an absolute basis. Overall stock selection detracted the most, mainly stock selection in the IT, consumer discretionary, health care, industrials, and real estate sectors. Please check the top 5 holdings of the strategy, to know its best pick in 2024.\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy highlighted stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides consumer products, advertising, and subscription services through online and physical stores. The one-month return of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was 5.90%, and its shares gained 44.41% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On July 10, 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock closed at $194.49 per share with a market capitalization of $2.024 trillion.\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates the world's leading e-commerce marketplace and the largest public cloud platform and has a burgeoning advertising business. We expect to see sustained margin improvement as Amazon's retail regionalization efforts are bearing fruit and as its advertising business continues to scale ahead of peers. We believe the profitability ramp is still in the early innings as the company turns its attention to improving costs. One area will be inbound shipping, where faster delivery times through reduced freight, miles and packaging can reduce waste. We also see generative AI tailwinds and infrastructure modernization driving re-acceleration in growth at AWS, further enhancing Amazon's free cash flow compounding potential. In addition, following our early 2024 ESG engagements with Amazon (after multiyear engagements) we were positively inclined to see continued improvements in labor relations (health and safety metrics, benefits and wages), as well as in environmental stewardship (climate targets, reducing packaging materials, electric delivery trucks) and innovation (commitments to responsible AI and data privacy). One of the newly announced initiatives on the retail side is consolidating deliveries into fewer boxes, which reduces packaging.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in first position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 302 hedge fund portfolios held Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) at the end of the first quarter which was 293 in the previous quarter. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported strong results in the first quarter and delivered $143.3 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "The 3 Best Stocks to Buy for Q3 2024",
        "content": "There is some truth behind the old investment adage, “sell in May and go away.” The summer months tend to be stock market low points with September being one of the worst across all three major market indices. There is even a name for it: the September Effect.\n\nBut for me, the summer doldrums mean it is time to buy. Because I like to buy stocks when they go on sale, periods when stocks are falling is when I’m looking for bargains. Previous high-fliers are now more attractively priced. So long as you seek out quality companies with good, long-term growth prospects, buying when the market is selling is the perfect time to ensure your portfolio sees outsized gains over time.\n\nBelow are three of the best stocks for Q3. They offer a mix of solid businesses, discounted valuations and excellent prospects for beating the market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) Person holding smartphone with logo of US renewable energy company First Solar Inc. (FSLR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolar panel pure-play First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is the world’s leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panel technology. With a focus on utility-scale applications in the U.S. market, First Solar is perfectly positioned to capture increased demand for renewable sources of energy.\n\nFirst, the Biden administration imposed steep tariffs on cheap, Chinese imports that should give First Solar a competitive edge. Second, inflation fell more than expected in June increasing the likelihood of interest rate cuts in September. That could spark a wave of investment.\n\nIt was the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented rate hikes two years ago that cratered the solar industry. The cost of financing solar installations simply became prohibitively expensive. Yet Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) just achieved an aspirational goal of many businesses by matching 100% of the electricity its consumes with 100% renewable sources. It is now the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world by investing billions of dollars in more than 500 solar and wind projects globally.\n\nFirst Solar is down 24% from its 52-week high and though is up 35% year-to-date it trades at just 11 times next year’s earnings estimates. However, Wall Street sees the solar shop growing earnings at a blistering 58% annually for the next five years. First Solar stock trades at just a tiny fraction to that estimate making it one of the best stocks for Q3 to buy.\n\nTilray Brands (TLRY) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of cannabinoid company tilray cannabis, blurred marijuana and pipette background\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarijuana stock Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) is also well positioned to capitalize on growing legalization trends. With rescheduling of cannabis in the U.S. and legalization adopted in Germany, the opportunity to expand globally is arguably the best it has been in years.\n\nStory continues\n\nTilray already has a substantial presence in the German market. As a provider of medical marijuana in the country, which is the largest market for it in Europe, its sales team has boots on the ground that can take off running. The pot stock also has production facilities in Portugal and Canada and exports marijuana to Germany. Obviously, legalization in the U.S. would be the biggest catalyst for growth.\n\nRevenue and gross profits are already growing with first-quarter sales jumping 30% and adjusted gross profits widening 17%. Although Tilray still produces GAAP losses, it dramatically lowered them from $1.1 billion last year to just $105 million this year. With analysts forecasting 37% compounded annual earnings growth, GAAP profits should be a reality soon.\n\nRoku (ROKU) media stocks to buy roku\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries of streaming videos proliferation during the pandemic was connected TV leader Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) though it declined sharply in the aftermath. Roku stock is down almost 90% since those highs and off 33% in 2024. It may be perfectly positioned for a turnaround.\n\nThe shakeout expected in streaming is underway. AT&T (NYSE:T) spun off its entertainment unit into Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) that combined HBO Max and Discovery+ into Max. Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) folded Showtime into Paramount+ and now Paramount itself is being acquired by Skydance Media. Disney (NYSE:DIS), of course, gained full control over Hulu and both it and Warner Bros have joined forces to offer a streaming bundle to include Disney+, Hulu and Max.\n\nWith further deals possible, competitive pressure on the remaining companies will lessen, potentially boosting profits. Just as digital advertising has returned in force, Roku stands ready to pounce on the industry’s recovery.\n\nFirst-quarter revenue jumped 19% to $882 million as the number of active accounts rose 14% to 81.6 million. It was the third consecutive quarter Roku had positive adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Wall Street forecasts long-term earnings growth of 43% annually. It makes Roku one of the best stocks for Q3 to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in T and WBD stock.

        "content": "Buying stocks and holding onto them in the long run can lead you to financial security. You don’t have to pay special attention to price fluctuations or use technical analysis to find short-term opportunities. Investors who beat the market aren’t necessarily spending more time in their portfolios than day traders. It’s also common for investors to prioritize fundamental analysis for long-term performance. Thus, many investors are seeking compounding stocks to secure their futures.\n\nFundamental analysis focuses on a  company’s earnings, growth opportunities, advantages over competitors, and other components of the underlying company. Stocks can compound if you just hold onto them instead of trying to time the market. Time in the market is often a better strategy than timing the market.\n\nInvestors can choose from many stocks, but some growth stocks are better than others. Knowing your risk tolerance and long-term financial goals can help you make better investments and steer away from speculative picks. Want a head start with some stock ideas to consider? These are some of the top stocks to buy for long-term gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been a top performer for several years. The global advertising leader is up by 34% year-to-date and has gained 231% over the past five years. Alphabet trades at a 29 P/E ratio and offers a 0.43% yield. Although the dividend yield is low, investors should expect Alphabet to maintain a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years.\n\nThe tech giant shook off early AI mishaps with a resounding first quarter. Revenue increased by 15% year-over-year to reach $80.5 billion. Net income jumped by 57% year-over-year and came to $23.7 billion. Alphabet secured a 29.4% net profit margin to close out the quarter.\n\nWhile advertising is still the main revenue driver, Google Cloud is gaining market share. Google Cloud brought up $9.57 billion in revenue and netted $900 million in operating income. Alphabet continues to trim its workforce and seems to be following in Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) footsteps. That’s part of the reason profit margins and net income surged in the first quarter. You can see why this made our list of the top compounding stocks.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) amazon (AMZN) sign with dark background\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has more than doubled over the past five years and is already up by 32% year-to-date. The Magnificent Seven stock offers exposure to numerous verticals. The company’s online marketplace is the biggest draw and contributes to the majority of Amazon’s revenue. Sales from the marketplace helped Amazon report 13% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. The company achieved double-digit growth rates for domestic and international sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is also positioning itself to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom. Rising revenue for Amazon Web Services demonstrates the company is gaining market share. AWS sales jumped by 17% year-over-year. Amazon saw big gains across several segments, such as streaming, groceries, and advertising.\n\nWall STreet analysts are bullish on Amazon stock and have rated it as a Strong Buy. The stock has a projected 12% upside based on the average price target. However, some analysts are more optimistic. The highest price target of $246 per share suggests that Amazon can gain an additional 24% from current levels. This is easily one of the top compounding stocks.\n\nCintas (CTAS) an empty restaurant dining room\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) has more than one million small businesses as its customers. The company offers business supplies and safety equipments which result in steady revenue for the company. Cintas has almost tripled over the past five years and is up by 19% year-to-date.\n\nThe company’s latest earnings report suggests that growth is still strong. Revenue increased by 9.9% year-over-year to reach $2.41 billion. Net income jumped by 22.0% year-over-year to reach $397.6 million. Cintas also offers a 0.77% yield and has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years. The firm recently hiked its dividend by 17.4% last year and will announce another dividend hike shortly.\n\nCintas is currently rated as a Moderate Buy. The highest price target of $765 per share suggests that the stock can gain an additional 9% from current levels. Cintas offers an impressive dividend growth rate and steady gains that have translated into happy long-term investors.

        "title": "Forget Apple: Consider These 2 Millionaire-Maker Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has a long history of providing consistent stock gains. Its shares are up 346% in the last five years alone, outperforming many of its peers and the S&P 500's 86% rise. The company is the king of consumer tech, profiting from the immense brand loyalty it has built.\n\nHowever, Apple has hit many hurdles over the past year. The company got a late start in artificial intelligence (AI), which left it out of much of the rally the market has seen since the beginning of 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, repeated declines in sales have forced the company to rethink its product strategy. It has the cash and brand dominance to turn things around over the long term, but it might be worth investing in more reliable stocks for now. NVDA Chart\n\nThis table shows Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) have delivered significantly more returns than Apple since the start of 2024. They have rallied investors with dominating roles in crucial areas of AI: chip design and cloud computing. The two leaders in their respective industries are unlikely to be dethroned anytime soon.\n\nTheir more established positions in tech indicate they could offer more share increases over the next decade than the iPhone maker. So, forget Apple and consider buying these two millionaire-maker stocks instead.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nFew stocks have been watched as closely as Nvidia has over the last year. The company has achieved rock-star status in the tech industry as its chips have become the gold standard for AI developers worldwide. Nvidia is responsible for an estimated 90% of the AI chip market thanks to the success of its graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nMuch as Apple has attracted loyal users with its easy-to-use design language, Nvidia's Computer Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a leading reason for its AI dominance. CUDA is the software platform that complements the company's AI GPUs. Millions of developers have grown so accustomed to Nvidia's chip architecture that switching to similar offerings from competitors like AMD makes little sense. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAs demand for AI services has soared, so has Nvidia's sales. The chart above shows the significant difference in financial growth that Nvidia has seen over AMD since last July. As a result, Nvidia hit $39 billion in free cash flow this year, while AMD hovered around $1 billion in free cash flow.\n\nNvidia's higher figure suggests it's only widening the gap between the companies, with it potentially being better equipped to keep investing in its technology and maintain its lead.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market reached $196 billion in spending last year and is growing at a rate that would see it hit close to $2 trillion by 2030. So, despite its meteoric rise since last year, the AI market still has plenty of room to run, with Nvidia well-positioned to keep seeing major gains and creating millionaires.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon has made more than a few millionaires over the years. Since its initial public offering in 1997, the company's stock has soared over 200,000%.\n\nIt has gone from an online book retailer to the biggest name in e-commerce in multiple countries. And as its earnings have grown, Amazon has reinvested in its business, diversifying its revenue streams to include income from cloud computing, digital advertising, streaming, and more.\n\nThe company posted its first-quarter earnings on April 30, delivering revenue growth of 13% year over year and beating Wall Street estimates by $750 million. Amazon proved its e-commerce business remains lucrative, with revenue rising 10% and 12% in its two retail segments. Meanwhile, retail operating income reached a collective $6 billion after reporting losses of $349 million the year before.\n\nBut it's outside of e-commerce where the company's greatest promise can be found. Its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), dominates the market, reporting revenue growth of 17% year over year and operating income that nearly doubled. The quarter also highlighted the company's budding digital ad business, with revenue in its advertising services segment rising 24% after introducing ads on Prime Video.\n\nWhile Apple has suffered several quarters of sales declines, Amazon has seen an impressive boost to revenue in its retail segments. Meanwhile, it has become an imposing figure in AI thanks to AWS. With growth catalysts in multiple markets, its stock is too good to ignore right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "6 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Inside Warren Buffett's $410 Billion Portfolio",
        "content": "Warren Buffett has managed the Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) investment company since 1965. Over that 59-year stretch, he steered the conglomerate to average annual returns of 19.8%, which is nearly twice the average annual return delivered by the S&P 500 index over the same period.\n\nIn dollar terms, $1,000 invested in Berkshire stock in 1965 would have grown to $43 million by the end of 2023. The same investment in the S&P 500 would have been worth a mere $312,230.\n\nBuffett likes to buy stock in companies with steady growth, consistent profitability, solid management teams, and shareholder-friendly initiatives like dividend schemes and stock buyback programs. One thing Buffett doesn't do is chase the latest stock market trend, so you won't find him piling into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks just because they are generating the best returns right now.\n\nThat said, at least six of the 47 stocks already in Berkshire's $410 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities now use AI in some capacity. Here's a look at each company and what they're up to in AI. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Apple: 44.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is Berkshire's largest position. The conglomerate spent about $38 billion accumulating shares since 2016, and the position is now worth $184 billion -- even after Berkshire sold 13% of its stake for tax reasons earlier this year. Apple makes some of the world's most popular consumer devices led by the flagship iPhone, and it could soon be one of the biggest players in AI.\n\nApple just revealed its Apple Intelligence software, which it developed in partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. It's expected to go live in September alongside the new iOS 18 operating system, and it will overhaul many of the company's existing software products.\n\nThe Siri voice assistant will be powered by ChatGPT, and users will be able to read a summary of their emails in the Mail application with a single tap. Apple Intelligence can also transcribe audio recordings, which means users can spend less time typing.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, so the company could become the largest distributor of AI to consumers. Some analysts on Wall Street expect the upcoming iPhone 16 to drive a big upgrade cycle because it's rumored to come with a powerful new chip designed specifically for processing AI workloads.\n\n2. Bank of America: 10.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire first bought shares in Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) in 2007, and it's now the conglomerate's second-largest holding.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors probably don't associate banking with cutting-edge technology, given it's such a slow-moving industry. But Bank of America was an early adopter of AI, launching its AI assistant called Erica way back in 2018. Erica can remind customers about upcoming bills, locate historical transactions, and even offer ideas for saving money and reducing debt.\n\nOver the last six years, Erica has logged more than 2 billion interactions with customers, and adoption is accelerating. Bank of America recently introduced Erica to its business clients who use the CashPro platform, and the chatbot is already solving 43% of inquiries autonomously with no human intervention.\n\nAI tools like Erica are likely to shrink the human workforce for banks, especially in their customer service departments, and those cost savings can translate into much higher earnings.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: 6.1% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nLast year, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) allowed generative AI to formulate a new drink called Coca-Cola Y3000. The AI model used customer data to predict what the popular beverage might taste like in the year 3000. It was a great marketing stunt that showcased Coca-Cola's progressive approach to technology, and the company even hired a \"head of generative AI\" in 2023.\n\nThe company recently signed a five-year deal with Microsoft, committing to spend $1.1 billion on the Azure cloud platform and its generative AI services. Coca-Cola will use Azure to weave AI throughout its entire organization, enhancing everything from marketing to manufacturing to the supply chain.\n\nBerkshire spent $1.3 billion accumulating 400 million shares in Coca-Cola between 1987 and 1994. It never sold a single one, and that position is now valued at $25.1 billion. Plus, Berkshire will collect $776 million in dividend payments from Coca-Cola this year alone, which highlights the powerful effects of compounding over the long term.\n\n4. Visa: 0.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nVisa (NYSE: V) has more than 4.4 billion cards in circulation worldwide, making it the largest issuer in the industry. Visa doesn't lend any money; it simply operates a payments network, which means it earns a steady stream of fees that grows as more merchants and consumers enter its ecosystem. It's right in the wheelhouse of a patient long-term investor like Buffett, which is why Berkshire has owned the stock since 2011.\n\nVisa is constantly battling fraud, which includes highly automated enumeration attacks that use bots to exploit network vulnerabilities. The company just launched a new AI-powered tool for its Visa Account Attack Intelligence (VAAI) platform, which autonomously identifies and assigns a score to enumeration attacks so banks can make more informed decisions on when to block transactions on behalf of customers.\n\nBut that's not all. Visa's new Stand-In Processing tool steps in when banks suffer outages or network disruptions, using AI to approve and decline transactions so services can continue for customers without interruption.\n\nVisa processed over 72 billion transactions in the last quarter alone, and with that much volume and data, automation is essential. Therefore, investors should expect this company to push the boundaries of innovation when it comes to AI.\n\n5. Amazon: 0.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock in 2019, but Buffett often expresses regret for not identifying the opportunity much earlier. Amazon has expanded beyond its roots in e-commerce and now operates in video streaming, digital advertising, cloud computing, and AI.\n\nThe Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division is investing heavily in AI. It developed its own chips, its own large language models (LLMs), and even its own applications, all of which are available to businesses and developers who can use them to either create their own AI products or drive efficiency in their day-to-day operations.\n\nAmazon also uses AI to power the recommendation engine on Amazon.com. It learns what customers like so it can show them more of those products to boost sales. Plus, merchants can use Amazon's AI software to create product pages with engaging descriptions and images.\n\nAmazon just entered the exclusive $2 trillion club, and there could be plenty of long-term upside ahead thanks to AI.\n\n6. Snowflake: 0.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nSnowflake (NYSE: SNOW) doesn't fit Buffett's usual criteria. The cloud computing company is growing, but it's a long way from achieving profitability, and it doesn't return any money to shareholders. Berkshire bought Snowflake around the time of its IPO in 2020, and one of Buffett's lieutenants likely made the decision.\n\nSnowflake's data cloud helps organizations aggregate their data even if it's spread across multiple cloud platforms, eliminating silos and enabling more effective analysis. The company launched Cortex AI last year, which gives businesses the tools to develop AI models using a mixture of their own data and ready-made LLMs.\n\nCortex AI also includes several AI-powered tools. The Copilot chatbot understands natural language and can offer assistance across Snowflake's platforms, and Document AI allows developers to rapidly extract valuable data from unstructured sources like contracts and invoices.\n\nSnowflake is in a great position to thrive in the world of AI, but investors should tread cautiously because its stock is very expensive.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Stock (NASDAQ:AMZN): 3 Reasons Why I’m Bullish",
        "content": "Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) went public 30 years ago and is among the largest companies in the world. Valued at $2 trillion by market cap, the e-commerce giant has returned more than 160,000% to shareholders since its IPO (initial public offering) in 1997. Despite its outsized gains, I remain bullish on Amazon due to its expanding addressable market, expanding profit margins, and growing advertising business.\n\nAn Overview of Amazon\n\nToday, Amazon is a household name and has a presence in most global markets. It sells consumer products, online ads, and subscription services through online and physical stores. In the last 12 months, Amazon reported revenue of $590.74 billion, up from $280.52 billion in 2019.\n\nAmazon Is Firing on All Cylinders\n\nAmazon has a sizeable presence in several growth markets that include e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and online streaming. In Q1 of 2024, its Online Store segment increased its revenue by 7% year-over-year to $54.7 billion, accounting for 38% of sales.\n\nAccording to a report from Research and Markets, the global e-commerce market is forecast to expand from $18.98 trillion in 2022 to $47.73 trillion in 2030, indicating an annual growth rate of over 12%.\n\nIts Amazon Web Services business accounts for 17% of sales, and this segment grew by 17% year-over-year in the March quarter. A Statista report forecasts the public cloud market to expand from $631.8 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2029, indicating an annual growth rate of 18.5%.\n\nIn recent years, Amazon’s Advertising Services business has gained significant traction. While it accounts for just 8% of total sales, sales from the segment rose by 24% year-over-year in Q1. A Precedence Research report expects global digital ad spending to rise from $550 billion in 2023 to $1.367 trillion in 2033, indicating annual growth rates of 9.6%.\n\nWe can see that each of Amazon’s business segments is positioned to grow at a steady pace in the upcoming decade, making the tech giant an enticing investment option right now.\n\nAmazon’s Expanding Margins\n\nSimilar to most other companies, Amazon has focused on lowering its cost base to tide over an uncertain and soft macro environment. Since Q4 of 2022, it has eliminated more than 27,000 jobs, allowing it to improve profit margins significantly. In the last 18 months, Amazon has lowered its technology and infrastructure costs as well as sales and marketing expenses, shoring up its bottom line.\n\nIn the last 12 months, Amazon reported free cash flow of $50.15 billion compared to a free cash outflow of $3.31 billion in the year-ago period. Further, it expects profit margins to improve in Q2 of 2024, although at a far more measured pace.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon expects operating income to range between $10 billion and $14 billion in Q2 compared to the year-ago figure of $7.7 billion. Comparatively, it expects revenue between $144 billion and $149 billion, indicating year-over-year growth between 7% and 11%.\n\nHistorically, Amazon has sacrificed profitability for growth. In fact, it reported several quarters of operating losses before reporting consistent profits in the last decade. Currently, Amazon is experiencing strong growth in sales and earnings due to economies of scale, a competitive moat, and its leadership position.\n\nAd Sales Will be a Key Driver\n\nAmazon owns and operates the third-largest digital ad business after Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Due to higher customer purchase intent, Amazon’s ad business should attract a higher share of corporate marketing spend amid sluggish consumer demand.\n\nAmazon attributed its strong digital ad performance to sponsored products, which benefited from improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. It expects sponsored products to drive demand going forward while growing new verticals such as Prime Video ads.\n\nIn the last three years, Amazon’s ad business has grown from $6.4 billion in Q1 of 2021 to $11.8 billion in Q1 of 2024. Its ad business grew at a much higher pace compared to peers Alphabet and Meta. Moreover, this segment is a high-margin one and should be a key driver of revenue and profitability through 2030.\n\nIs Amazon Stock Undervalued?\n\nWall Street expects Amazon to report an adjusted earnings per share of $4.54 in 2024, up from $2.90 per share in 2023. So, AMZN stock is priced at 44x forward earnings, which is steep, given that the sector median multiple is far lower at 15x. Alternatively, Amazon is growing at a far higher pace, so a premium multiple is justified.\n\nIs Amazon Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nEach of the 42 analysts covering Amazon stock has a Buy rating, indicating a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average AMZN stock price target is $222.45, indicating upside potential of 11.5% from current levels.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nTwo years ago, Amazon stock was pummelled due to its slowing growth and unattractive profit margins. Today, it is one of the fastest-growing mega-cap stocks on the planet, driving its share price toward all-time highs. In my view, its expanding addressable market and improving bottom line make it a top investment choice for investors in July 2024.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investors with an interest in Internet - Commerce stocks have likely encountered both Amazon (AMZN) and Coupang, Inc. (CPNG). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\n\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\n\nCurrently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Coupang, Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that AMZN has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nAMZN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 42.57, while CPNG has a forward P/E of 864.80. We also note that AMZN has a PEG ratio of 1.44. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. CPNG currently has a PEG ratio of 46.20.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for AMZN is its P/B ratio of 9.37. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CPNG has a P/B of 9.50.\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, AMZN holds a Value grade of B, while CPNG has a Value grade of C.\n\nAMZN is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that AMZN is likely the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Daniel Wiessner\n\n(Reuters) -A New York federal judge has ordered Amazon.com to comply with a subpoena from a U.S. civil rights agency investigating claims that the online retailer discriminated against pregnant warehouse workers.\n\nU.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan late Thursday rejected Amazon's claims that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) subpoena was too broad and sought irrelevant information.\n\nThe EEOC is seeking data on requests that pregnant workers at five U.S. warehouses made for accommodations such as limits on heavy lifting and additional breaks, and whether Amazon granted or denied them.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmazon spokesperson Sam Stephenson said the company has cooperated with the investigation since it began three years ago and disagreed with the EEOC's characterization of its conduct. Amazon is proud of the benefits and time off it offers to workers who are pregnant or whose partners have given birth, he said.\n\n“We take this issue very seriously and look forward to showing why the EEOC’s concerns are unfounded,\" Stephenson said in a statement.\n\nThe commission's probe was prompted by complaints from five women who say they faced pregnancy discrimination while working at Amazon warehouses in New Jersey, Connecticut, North Carolina, and California.\n\nAmazon said it has provided the EEOC with about 370,000 pages of data in response to the subpoena, but not in the specific format requested by the agency.\n\nSchofield in her ruling said the information sought in the subpoenas was necessary for the EEOC to determine whether Amazon engaged in illegal discrimination. The judge gave Amazon until Aug. 9 to comply with the subpoena.\n\nAn EEOC spokesman declined to comment.\n\nIn 2022, a New York state agency filed an administrative complaint accusing Amazon of requiring pregnant and disabled warehouse workers to take unpaid leaves of absence, even if they were capable of working, instead of providing accommodations. That case is pending.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has denied wrongdoing and said it strives to support it workers, but acknowledged in a statement responding to the New York complaint that \"we don't always get it right.\"\n\nThe EEOC issued a subpoena last year seeking five categories of information, including data on accommodations Amazon provided to warehouse workers with disabilities. At the time, federal law only required companies to provide the same accommodations to pregnant workers that they gave to employees with disabilities.\n\nA law passed later last year mandates that employers accommodate workers' pregnancies regardless of how they treat workers with disabilities.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by David Holmes and Josie Kao)",

        "content": "Amazon’s AMZN shares have rallied 28.5% year to date, outperforming the industry growth of 18.8%. The company is riding on its robust cloud computing arm — Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). The solid customer momentum of AWS is driving the company’s top line. \r\n\r\nThis is evident from the latest collaboration of Exscientia EXAI with AWS. The former strives to power its platform for end-to-end drug discovery and automation with the help of AWS.\r\n\r\nThis deal highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS's innovative cloud products and services.\r\n\r\nPer the terms, Exscientia is expanding the use of AWS’s artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) services to accelerate early drug development at a lower cost. It is leveraging generative AI models of AWS to design drug candidates efficiently. It has deployed generative AI in its DesignStudio. The company draws on large language models via Amazon Bedrock.\r\n\r\nExscientia also plans to include robotic automation in its lab works on the back of its collaboration with AWS.\n\nCustomer Base Expansion Aids Growth\n\nThe latest move of Exscientia has added strength to AWS’s customer base.\n\nAWS’s portfolio strength is driving its customer momentum.\r\n\r\nRecently, Smartsheet implemented AWS’s Amazon Q Business to introduce a generative AI-powered assistant for its employees.\r\n\r\nFormula 1 (F1) teamed up with AWS to introduce a generative AI-designed F1 trophy for the Canadian Grand Prix with the support of AWS. \r\n\r\nFWD Group Holdings Limited recently selected AWS as its strategic cloud provider.\r\n\r\nSAP joined forces with AWS to embed generative AI solutions across its enterprise resource planning applications. SAP will integrate generative AI models from Amazon Bedrock, such as the Anthropic Claude 3 model family and Amazon Titan, into its generative AI hub in SAP AI Core. \r\n\r\nNinjaTech AI partnered with AWS to launch its next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using the latter’s ML chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike extended its strategic partnership with AWS to accelerate cloud security and AI innovation. \r\n\r\nBrightcove started using Amazon’s generative AI assistant called Amazon Q Business on AWS internally for real-world use cases applicable to the enterprise, media and entertainment technology sectors.\r\n\r\nZilch extended its collaboration with AWS to expand the use of the latter’s AI and ML services in order to accelerate sales in the next two years, and improve customer service and lending decisions.\r\n\r\nAWS’s expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In first-quarter 2024, AWS generated revenues of $25.04 billion (18% of the total sales), which grew 17% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 AWS revenues is pegged at $106.5 billion, indicating a growth of 17.3% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening performance of AWS, which has become the key catalyst of Amazon, will benefit the overall financial performance of the company.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $638.24 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 11%. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 0.9% to $4.58 per share over the past 60 days. The figure indicates year-over-year growth of 57.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nWe believe that AWS’s growing clientele, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is continuously riding on strong momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business, driven by the solid adoption of Azure. Strength in Azure AI remains a positive. The company’s strong efforts to power its cloud capabilities with generative AI are noteworthy. Also, growth in AI Copilot is contributing well to Microsoft’s cloud business.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud, which has turned out to be the key catalyst for Alphabet’s growth, is gaining from the growing generative AI capabilities, increasing data centers, availability zones and cloud regions. The solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace is a major positive.\n\nConclusion\n\nAWS’s expanding clientele, deepening focus on generative AI and strong competitive position are expected to benefit Amazon’s prospects. In addition to the cloud, strong capabilities, especially in grocery and pharmacy retail, coupled with ultrafast delivery services, are boosting its e-commerce prospects. The growing footprint in the video streaming space with Prime Video is another positive.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Top 4 Blue-Chip Stocks Picks to Strengthen Your Portfolio",
        "content": "U.S. stock markets have been on an impressive bull run over the past 18 months. However, the Dow, despite participating in the rally, lagged its peers, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. Wall Street’s blue-chip index is up 5.4% year to date. On the other hand, the broad-market S&P 500 Index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite have climbed 17.8% and 23.8%, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow recorded its all-time high of 40,077.40 on an intraday basis on Mar 20 and 40,003.59 on a closing basis on May 17. Technically, at its current level of 39,753.75, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 39,035.26 and 37,365.23, respectively.\n\nThe 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trendsetter. Historically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the asset (in this case the Dow Index) becomes a strong possibility.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to four Dow stocks that have strong earnings growth potential for the rest of 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart shows the price performance of our four picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon.com Inc. AMZN is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. A deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive for AMZN.\n\nThe strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home offerings are tailwinds. The advertising business is also pretty robust. AMZN enjoys a strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are its other positives.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Amazon.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 57.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last 60 days.\n\nApple Inc. AAPL has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, AAPL’s competitive position is expected to improve. Moreover, AAPL is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. AAPL’s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Apple has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.8% and 7.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending September 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nWalmart Inc. WMT has been gaining from its highly diversified business with contributions from various segments, channels and formats. WMT has been benefiting from an increase in in-store and digital channel traffic due to its robust omnichannel initiatives. Store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped 50% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nWalmart’s strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has also been rewarding, as evidenced by the constant increase in the market share for groceries. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled WMT’s first-quarter results and led to an encouraging fiscal 2025 view.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Walmart has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3% over the last 60 days.\n\nChevron Corp. CVX is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin. Further, the recent acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen CVX’s presence in oil-rich Guyana.\n\nCVX seems one of the best-placed global integrated oil companies to achieve sustainable production ramp-up. We expect the company's average output during 2024 to rise 4-7% year over year, due to the PDC Energy acquisition and robust output in the showpiece Permian Basin region.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Chevron has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 2.3% and 0.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The S&P 500 is currently at roughly 5,500. Big tech companies under the Magnificent Seven moniker have been carrying the stock market for several years, and AI tailwinds suggest that the gains can continue.\n\nThe index is up by roughly 800 points year-to-date, which means it can take a few years before it reaches 7,000. Many top corporations have been expanding their revenue and earnings for several years. Slow and steady wins the race in investing, but some stocks continue to outperform the S&P 500. Discovering these stocks and accumulating their positions can result in sizable returns when the S&P 500 exceeds 7,000.\n\nYou don’t even have to look at individual stocks. The Nasdaq has outperformed the S&P 500 for most years, but there’s a reason. The Nasdaq is more heavily concentrated in tech stocksthan the S&P 500. While tech isn’t the only sector delivering high returns, it’s worth exploring that sector for most of these seven picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a top component of the S&P 500, delivering a 33% year-to-date gain for investors. Shares are also up by 106% over the past five years. Amazon has plenty of Wall Street enthusiasts on board. The corporation has received an average price target with a 12% upside.

Advertising has been a top performer for several quarters and generated $11.8 billion, a 24% year-over-year improvement.\n\nCintas (CTAS) Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) is a dividend growth stock that has delivered impressive returns and cash flow for several years.

Cintas hiked its dividend by 17.4% last year and will announce a new dividend hike in a few months.\n\nThe business safety equipment provider has more than one million businesses as its customers. That level of diversification helped Cintas generate $2.41 billion in Q3 FY24 revenue. That’s a 9.9% year-over-year improvement. Net income surged faster, climbing up by 22.0% year-over-year. Cintas ended up recording $397.6 million in net income that quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nFour Wall Street analysts rate Cintas as a moderate buy.

The company achieved record-breaking profits by delivering 27% year-over-year revenue growth and trimming its headcount. These results and the dividend program that started in Q4 2023 attracted a heap of praise. Meta Platforms can become a dividend growth stock with an annual double-digit growth rate for many years.\n\nWall Street is quite bullish on this Magnificent Seven stock. It is rated as a Strong Buy among 42 analysts, and the highest price target of $600 per share suggests a potential 12% gain from current levels.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nDeckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) is a growing athletic apparel company scooping up market share from rivals.

This retention should help the company deliver better results in future quarters as it continues to expand. Texas Roadhouse opens some of its own restaurants and lets franchises open up other locations. Between its company-owned and franchise-owned restaurants, Texas Roadhouse has 753 restaurants.\n\nUpwork (UPWK) upwork (UPWK) logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nUpwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) looks ready to deliver gains for patient investors.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Value Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "There are no hard and fast rules for what constitutes a value stock. It’s more about the feelz. Well, it is a little bit more than that. You can feel however you want about a company to say it is an undervalued value stock. But if the fundamentals of a business don’t match up, then you’re not investing. You’re gambling. You may as well throw darts at a dartboard.\n\nThere is a better way, though. Look for stocks that are discounted relative to the market in terms of price, free cash flow (FCF) and earnings growth potential. They will indicate that, although the market is downgrading their value, the company still has the wherewithal to come back strong.\n\nWhat I’ve done is look for stocks that are trading at below that of the S&P 500’s price-to-earnings ratio of 29. But they should also have low FCF multiples. That means after paying their bills, the companies still have money available to invest back into the business. I also want them to have high earnings growth potential. This should point to companies with good expansion opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMind you, you may likely end up looking at some ugly stock price charts. These undervalued value stocks could look like they’ve gone a round or two with Mike Tyson in his prime. But don’t be scared off. Hold your nose and dive into the three deeply discounted stocks below.\n\nTarget (TGT) an image of bullseye the target dog in a target store\n\nSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com\n\nDiscount retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) is the country’s sixth-largest retailer. Not being atop the heap means those above it apply considerable competitive pressure. After rebounding from missteps a decade ago, the mass merchandiser reinvested in its business to create an efficient operation that resonated with consumers. Especially its digital initiatives that came to the fore during the pandemic, Target proved it can go toe-to-toe with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nIts biggest drawback, though, is needing to constantly drive cost efficiencies, whether it is in its stores, fulfillment or supply chain. Because it doesn’t stand out in terms of scale, price or product differentiation, Target must continuously improve its cost structure. Fortunately, the retailer is a cash-generating machine.\n\nTarget produced $3.8 billion in FCF last year and has grown FCF to $4.6 billion over the trailing 12-month period. TGT stock trades at 14 times FCF and goes for 16 times earnings. The stock is flat in 2024, but with Wall Street expecting the retailer to grow earnings at 18% annually, the retailer is poised to grow and enjoy a multiple expansion. Target stock is an undervalued value stock that should be on your buy list.\n\nStory continues\n\nNextracker (NXT) Clean energy stocks: Rows of solar panels are lined up around a center aisle.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSpun off from electronics manufacturing specialist Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) in 2023, Nextracker (NASDAQ:NXT) hasn’t fared too badly in its bout with Tyson. The stock is up 65% since the separation but is only 9.3% higher this year. As it still trades for some cheap valuations, it is worth considering buying this undervalued value stock.\n\nNextracker is the world’s largest manufacturer of intelligent tracking systems based on gigawatts (GW) shipped in the U.S. and globally. Solar panels produce 25% to 35% more energy when they follow the sun’s path across the sky than stationary panels. Nextracker provides these solar trackers at utility-scale.\n\nUnlike residential solar systems, utility-scale projects aren’t affected the same by high interest rates, though they are not immune. Yet that is why fiscal fourth-quarter revenue surged 42% from last year and profits exploded from 2 cents per share to $1.51 per share.\n\nDespite the powerful performance, Nextracker stock remains undervalued. It trades at 15 times earnings and 16x FCF. Yet with analysts anticipating the solar tracker stock expanding earnings at a breathtaking 40% annually for the next five years, this is an undervalued value stock to buy today.\n\nBrinker International (EAT) A photo of a Chili's restaurant sign, owned by Brinter International (EAT).\n\nSource: James R. Martin/ShutterStock.com\n\nOn the surface, Brinker International (NYSE:EAT) doesn’t seem to fit the undervalued value stock mold. Shares are up 51% year-to-date and are 71% higher over the past year. Those are growth stock numbers and wildly so, since Brinker is a restaurant chain that owns Chili’s and Maggiano’s Little Italy.\n\nAnd yet it does offer investors significant value still. It is an example of a company whose performance has outpaced its valuation, and that bodes well for investors. Buying now lets you enjoy the multiple expansion to come.\n\nBrinker International is benefiting from the love affair with Mexican food. Its Chili’s chain is the moneymaker for the restaurateur, as its Tex-Mex flavors are capturing diners wallets as well as their stomachs. Fiscal third-quarter sales for the brand rose 3.8% to $988 million, representing 89% of total revenue.\n\nThat was achieved by Brinker offering a combination of menu innovation and value. It resulted in the restaurant operator growing sales and traffic ahead of the industry.\n\nWhile trading at 19x earnings, it also goes for a small fraction of its sales and for less than its long-term earnings growth rate of 20%. It does trade at a slightly elevated price-to-free cash flow of 19, but as a fast-growing chain, Brinker International still offers investors great value and is an undervalued vale stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "46% of Warren Buffett's $410 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "When it comes to Wall Street investing greats, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett is on a pedestal of his own. Since taking the reins at Berkshire in 1965, he's overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 5,028,429%, as of the closing bell on July 10. On an annualized basis, the \"Oracle of Omaha\" has practically doubled up the total return, including dividends paid, of the benchmark S&P 500 since the mid-1960s.\n\nBuffett's formula for success primarily involves buying stakes in brand-name, time-tested businesses with well-defined competitive advantages. While this strategy places a lot of emphasis on value stocks, the occasional growth stock does wind up in the 44-stock, $410 billion portfolio Buffett and his team oversee at Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nWhat might be especially surprising is discovering that Warren Buffett and his cohorts have, at least inadvertently, bet big on the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nAI involves the use of software and systems for tasks that humans would typically oversee or undertake. The capacity for these systems to learn and evolve over time, becoming more proficient at their tasks or perhaps learning new skills, is what gives AI such broad-reaching utility.\n\nAs of the closing bell on July 10, a whopping 46% ($188.8 billion) of the $410 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway was invested in four top-notch AI stocks.\n\nApple: $183.9 billion (44.8% of invested assets)\n\nThe lion's share of Buffett's exposure to artificial intelligence rests on the shoulders of tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which accounts for close to 45% of Berkshire's $410 billion of invested assets.\n\nIn June, during the company's annual Worldwide Developer Conference, Apple unveiled what it dubbed \"Apple Intelligence.\" Though Apple has been leaning on various AI solutions for years, it laid out plans to bring chatbot solutions, powered by ChatGPT, to its operating systems, as well as make its voice assistant Siri a lot more intuitive.\n\nHowever, the Oracle of Omaha and his team didn't buy into Apple because of its role in the future of AI. More than likely, Buffett and his close advisors recognized its dominance in smartphones -- Apple has sustained a 50% or greater domestic share of the smartphone market since introducing 5G-capable iPhones in late 2020 -- as well as the success it's having in shifting to a services-based model that's driven by higher-margin subscriptions.\n\nWhile Apple certainly deserves a premium given its first-mover advantages and cutting-edge innovations, its growth engine has stalled out in recent years. Although it's possible AI could be the catalyst that reignites growth, Apple's $674 billion in cumulative stock buybacks since the start of 2013 have done most of the heavy lifting of late.\n\nStory continues\n\nBYD: $2 billion (0.5% of invested assets)\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock that the Oracle of Omaha and his team have bet big on is China-based electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer BYD(OTC: BYDD.F). The roughly 65.8 million shares Berkshire holds in BYD equates to a 6% stake in the company, which is worth around $2 billion.\n\nNewer vehicles are becoming increasingly more reliant on technology and AI to improve safety and comfort for drivers. For instance, in mid-January, BYD launched its Xuanji Architecture, which is designed to help drivers with automated parking and other advanced driving assistance technologies.\n\nBYD has also been working with Chinese regulators to test Level 3 autonomous driving on high-speed roads in the city of Shenzhen. U.S. rival Tesla has been stick at Level 2 autonomy for years, despite the continued promises of CEO Elon Musk that Level 5 autonomy is \"about one year away.\"\n\nWhat's been particularly exciting about BYD's production ramp is that it's now selling more battery-EVs than Tesla worldwide. While Tesla still retains its first-mover advantages in North America, BYD's rate of ascension in China has dwarfed all other competitors. Image source: Amazon.\n\nAmazon: $2 billion (0.5% of invested assets)\n\nThe third stock that accounts for another multibillion-dollar bet on AI is none other than e-commerce legend Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). The 10 million shares of Amazon stock held by Berkshire works out to a market value of roughly $2 billion.\n\nAlthough most investors are familiar with Amazon because of its dominant online marketplace, cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) is, arguably, its most important operating segment. Generative AI solutions can be leaned on by businesses in AWS to deploy virtual chatbots or assistants and build/scale large language models (LLMs).\n\nThe best thing about enterprise cloud spending is that we're still in the very early innings of its expansion. This is fantastic news considering that AWS has already surpassed $100 billion in annual run-rate sales, and is Amazon's highest-margin segment.\n\nThe company's other fast-paced ancillary segments are holding their own, too. Advertising services and subscription services offer sustained double-digit growth. Attracting 2.5 billion unique visitors to its website monthly has helped with ad sales, while a growing content library, which now includes Thursday Night Football, has almost certainly lifted the aggregate number of global Prime subscribers.\n\nSnowflake: $842 million (0.2% of invested assets)\n\nThe fourth AI stock that, along with Apple, BYD, and Amazon, collectively accounts for 46% of Berkshire Hathaway's $410 billion of invested assets is cloud data-warehousing company Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW). Similar to Amazon, Snowflake was added to Berkshire's portfolio by one of Buffett's investing \"lieutenants,\" Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.\n\nLast year, Snowflake acquired Neeva, a company that leverages generative AI solutions within the cloud to improve search. Snowflake plans to rely on various generative AI solutions within its data cloud to allow its customers to easily analyze data and build, train, and deploy LLMs.\n\nBeyond its AI ties, the lure of Snowflake as an investment has long been its ingrained competitive advantages. Snowflake built its data cloud atop the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platforms. Whereas sharing data can be challenging across competing platforms, it's a breeze with Snowflake.\n\nLikewise, Snowflake has shunned the subscription-as-a-service model in favor of a pay-as-you-go approach. The transparency of businesses only paying for the Snowflake Compute Credits and data storage space used has helped it retain clients and steadily grow its base of bigger businesses.\n\nHowever, Snowflake is a pricey stock and certainly doesn't fit the mold of a traditional Warren Buffett investment. Valued at 13 times forecast sales in the current fiscal year, and roughly 139 times earnings per share (EPS) in the following year, Snowflake has a lot to prove to Wall Street.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon’s $20 billion NBA deal isn’t riskless. But it’s close",
        "content": "The NBA is close to announcing its long-rumored TV rights deal with ESPN, NBC, and Amazon, The Athletic reported on Tuesday. The deal is expected to net the league $76 billion over 11 years, with the TV networks and online giant divvying up regular season and playoff games. There’s an outside chance that TNT, an incumbent, could still push Amazon aside in the deal, the publication reported but, as currently constructed, Amazon is expected to be the NBA's new partner.\n\nFor the tech giant, the deal helps fill a hole in its already-giant advertising business, while serving as a nice addition for Prime members who are sports fans but who might occasionally dabble with the thought of dropping the service. The risks on the other hand, whether monetary or related to internal politics, appear relatively minimal for a company valued at $2 trillion. If you’re Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, you probably do this deal 10 times out of 10, even at the steep cost of a reported $1.8 billion a year.\n\nDoes it matter that Jassy is a huge sports fan? It probably didn’t hurt for those Prime Video leaders at the company who were pushing for the deal. But that’s not why a deal like this gets done. The tech giant’s advertising division is on pace for $50 billion in revenue this year but has largely reached those heights on the back of product ads – the product search results carrying “sponsored” labels that have in recent years began dominating much of the shopping site for better or worse. Along with its Amazon’s Thursday Night NFL games, the new NBA package (which would begin with the 2025-2026 NBA season) will help attract different big-brand advertisers to Amazon that typically wouldn’t advertise with the online retailer because their product or service aren’t widely sold on the platform. Think Anheuser-Busch for example.\n\nLive sporting events also serve as one of the last areas of appointment viewing, which drives big advertising spending. In addition to some Friday and Saturday regular season games, Amazon is also expected to air the NBA’s new in-season tournament, which was a hit in its inaugural season last year, as well as some conference final playoff games and the so-called play-in games, which decide the last few teams that make the playoffs.\n\nBut the deal might be just as much about giving Prime customers another reason to stick around and not consider ditching the $139-a-year membership. According to a recent survey conducted by the equity research firm Evercore ISI, 90 million American households already have a Prime membership. In short, Prime has saturated much of the US market. Could the NBA package bring in some new Prime members, whether just for Prime Video or the broader service? Sure. But that likely isn’t the overwhelming expectation internally.\n\nStory continues\n\nInstead, this is about getting Prime members to spend more time in the company’s ecosystem because when that happens, they spend more money on Amazon. Another related reason: to give Prime members another reason not to think about dropping their membership. While the same Evercore survey found Amazon is still the online retailer that the greatest percentage of respondents believe has the best prices, selection and convenience, all three percentages were down between 4 and 10 percentage points from last year. Membership offerings from competitors like Walmart and new low-price competitors like Temu have caught the attention of US consumers, including Prime members.\n\nIn other words, to use a sports metaphor, this deal is more about playing defense with Prime membership numbers, not offense.\n\nAs a bonus, NBA games provide another big audience for Amazon to cross-promote Prime Video’s original shows like Fallout or Reacher. You also can’t count out merchandise tie-ins or new ways that the NBA might work with Amazon Web Services either.\n\nAre there risks? Sure.\n\nFor starters, it’s no sure thing that the increased advertising in the games will make up for the $1.8 billion annual outlay for the rights (and that’s not including production costs or the big-money contracts Amazon will offer top announcing talent to call the games). Amazon, however, also cares about the DWI , or down-stream impact, of increasing engagement with Prime members, who historically spend more on shopping the more they watch Prime Video.\n\nThe other thing to watch out for internally: If and how the multi-billion deal impacts the budget and ambitions of the company’s studios business. Even at its $2 trillion market cap, Amazon divisions of course sets budgets and it’s fair to wonder how nearly $2 billion earmarked for one part of the Prime Video business impacts investment allocations for the studio side of Prime Video.\n\nEven so, the upsides are too great to outweigh these risks. You might even call this deal a slam dunk.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Millionaire-Maker Retail Stocks to Buy Now: July 2024",
        "content": "Compared to the overall market, the retail sector has been underperforming recently. While the S&P 500 as a whole is up by 26.78% since the beginning of the year, retail companies in the S&P 500 only achieved a relatively small 2.09% year-to-date return. Investors are still skeptical about investing in retail at this moment as they believe people will cut down on their discretionary spending ahead of the economic slowdown.\n\nWhile a lot of the companies in the retails struggled with the macroeconomic headwinds, some were able to sail through this challenging time for the sector. One commonality with retails that had success recently was dominance in their own niche market and market cap, giving them a major competitiveness over its growing rivals. While all in different maturity phases, these stocks still have potential to go up more. Below are three millionaire-maker retail stocks that will bring fortune to investors.\n\nCoupang (CPNG) A close-up shot of a Coupang (CPNG) delivery vehicle.\n\nSource: Ki young / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoupang (NYSE:CPNG) is an e-commerce stock that originated in South Korea. It was the pioneer of the Korean online market 14 years ago, and just less than two years ago, it relocated its headquarters from Seoul, South Korea to Seattle, United States. Known as the Amazon of South Korea, Coupang achieved rapid growth especially during the pandemic, and now the company is the largest online retailer in Korea.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company’s largest strength is its strategic positions. 70% of Koreans live within seven miles of Coupang’s warehouse, and because of this, the retailer is able to deliver items to customers quickly and conveniently.\n\nWhile there are lots of positives with Coupang, one of them is certainly its financials. Most impressively, the Korean online retailer achieved net revenues just over $7 billion in the first quarter of 2024, which was an astonishing 28% increase from the same period a year ago. Furthermore, its gross profit and gross margin went up by 36% and 27.1% respectively.\n\nThe success story of Korea’s biggest online retailer will continue, and investors should buy before they miss out on this opportunity.\n\nTJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.\n\nSource: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com\n\nTJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is an American discount department store that is the owner of many famous subsidiaries such as Marshalls, T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods and more. While the majority of retail stores struggled with a period marked by high inflation and now high interest rates, TJX Companies’ strategic business model helped the retailer navigate through its challenges smoothly and outperform its competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nTJX Companies adapted very well to the difficult macroeconomic conditions and consumer preferences. When inflationary pressure was high, discount stores like T.J. Maxx and Marshalls attracted consumers who did not have extra money to spend on the discretionaries.\n\nWhile it offers clothing that are marked anywhere from 20-60% below the full retailer price, its reputation to the public is positive. Most people recognize TJ Companies’ discount stores as places that sell good branded clothing at a reasonable price. TJX Companies pioneered and dominated this niche discount market, which will continue to equip the company with a strong advantage and competitiveness in the long run.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Watch for Dips, Because Amazon Stock Is a Buy Amid the Market Chaos\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the largest online retailer and the second largest retailer globally after Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Just two weeks ago, the largest online retailer in the world joined the $2 trillion club, making it the fifth ever company to accomplish this milestone.\n\nWhile Amazon has most likely hit its peak growth already, there are still plenty of reasons for investors to be bullish about Amazon’s stock.\n\nAs of writing, we are less than a week away from Prime Day, an annual event where Amazon provides a multitude of discounts to its members across different products. Last year, Amazon’s two days of Prime Day sales accounted for 2% of its annual revenue. According to analysts, this year’s Prime Day might be the largest one in the company’s history.\n\nMoreover, Amazon has strong financials that seem attractive to investors. In the first quarter of 2024, the retail giant had a breathtaking 228.85% growth in net income as well as a 12.53% revenue growth year over year. With such strong financials and continued dominance, Amazon will maintain its position as one of the millionaire-maker retail stocks for a long time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andy Kim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Alphyn Capital Management, an investment management firm, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The Master Account of the fund returned -2.7% net in the second quarter compared to 4.3% for the S&P500 Index. As of June 30, 2024, the top ten holdings accounted for approximately 66% of the portfolio, and approximately 16% of the portfolio was held in cash. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nAlphyn Capital Management highlighted stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides consumer products, advertising, and subscription services through online and physical stores. The one-month return of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was 8.68%, and its shares gained 48.76% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On July 10, 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock closed at $199.79 per share with a market capitalization of $2.079 trillion.\n\nAlphyn Capital Management stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"In his annual letter to shareholders, CEO Andy Jassy underscores Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) commitment to \"primitive services\" over the last 20 years – creating foundational building blocks that empower rapid development of higher level products and services. Examples include developing core functionalities like payments and search, which eventually led to the Fulfilled by Amazon service, or developing logistics infrastructure, which led to the Buy with Prime service. Amazon is adopting the same approach to the next front, GenAI, from custom AI chips and training/deployment services to empower companies to construct their own core GenAI models, to their Bedrock service which allows customers to use pre-existing models to more quickly develop applications, to Amazon developing their own applications for internal use (think Alexa and a new shopping AI called Rufus).\n\nAmazon's dominance comes not just from its scale but also from a relentless “customer obsession,” exemplified by its focus on building services that empower customers. This positions Amazon to capture significant shares of the growing retail and cloud markets. With a 45% share of online retail, which only makes up 25% of total retail sales, Amazon is well-placed for growth. The company's expansion into the grocery sector, backed by investments in same-day delivery, shows promise. Currently, Amazon holds a 20% share of the grocery market, a segment that constitutes 34% of US retail sales but is only 12% penetrated. As online retail trends towards 40-50% penetration, Amazon's growth potential is meaninful. Similarly, in the cloud sector, only 10% of IT spending has shifted to the cloud, with AWS holding a 35% market share.\"\n\nStory continues 20 Most Reputable and Trustworthy Companies in the World\n\nchristian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplash\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.

        "title": "4 Stocks to Boost Your Portfolio as S&amp;P 500 Hits New Milestone",
        "content": "Wall Street has been on a rally this year, with all three major indexes hitting multiple all-time highs. The S&P 500 particularly has been the standout performer, with the index registering its 37th record close in 2024 on Jul 10.\n\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed at 5,633.91, closing above the 5,600 mark for the first time and recording its seventh straight day of gains.\n\nThe recent rally is being led by tech stocks, especially semiconductor giants, which have been at the heart of the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). The AI darling NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has been driving the overall rally. The company’s shares have gained 172.4% year to date.\n\nBesides, the optimism surrounding rate cuts is also largely responsible for the ongoing rally. Inflation has finally started showing signs of easing after climbing in the first quarter. The consumer price index (CPI) held steady month over month in May after increasing 0.3% in April. May’s reading was also 0.1% lower than analysts’ estimates and the softest since July 2022.\n\nYear over year, CPI rose 3.3%, which came in slightly below analysts’ expectations of a rise of 3.4%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has indicated one rate cut this year, which is substantially lower than the three rate cuts projected earlier this year.\n\nHowever, even a single 25 basis point rate cut has been welcomed, particularly because a large section of market participants had expected no rate cuts in 2024.\n\nThe latest FOMC \"dot plot\" indicates a projected total decrease of 1% in interest rates by 2025, potentially lowering the Fed funds rate to 4.1% by the end of that year. Markets are now pricing in a rate cut in September, with expectations of another cut by the end of the year if economic conditions look favorable.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL and Broadcom Inc. AVGO thathave strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to AI-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected earnings growth rate of 106.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 12.1% over the last 60 days. NVDA presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN’s online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company’s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish its footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space.

        "content": "Amazon must take “swift and comprehensive action” to improve its compliance with industry rules designed to protect suppliers, the grocery regulator has said.\n\nThe Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA) said it would “not hesitate” to launch a formal investigation if necessary to ensure Amazon was treating its suppliers fairly and lawfully.\n\nIt encouraged suppliers to submit information confidentially about any issues they were facing with Amazon.\n\nThe GCA said its 2024 annual survey found that fewer than half of respondents directly supplying Amazon believed the retail giant “consistently” or “mostly” complied with the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe code aims to ensure Britain’s 14 largest grocery retailers, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Marks & Spencer, treat suppliers fairly.\n\nThe results are in! The GCA has published its 2024 annual survey results, showing improved treatment of grocery suppliers by the 14 largest retailers. Find out more here: https://t.co/O7PGuvfi3v\n\n— Groceries Code Adjudicator (@UKGCA) July 11, 2024\n\nIt restricts firms from making changes to supply contracts at short notice and also requires retailers to give an appropriate period of notice if they no longer want to use a supplier, and provide reasons for ending the contract.\n\nAmazon’s perceived code compliance score fell from 59% last year to 47%.\n\nThe results of the eleventh annual survey, which received more than 3,000 responses, show that the number of suppliers experiencing a code issue fell from 36% to 33%.\n\nAs food price inflation has fallen, the number of suppliers which requested at least one cost price increase (CPI) from a retailer over the previous 12 months fell from 91% in 2023 to 67% in 2024.\n\nThe number of suppliers highlighting a retailer’s response to a CPI as an issue almost halved, falling from 28% in 2023 to just 16%.\n\nStory continues\n\nGroceries Code Adjudicator Mark White said: “I am encouraged to see improvements in retailers’ treatment of suppliers across a range of issues including the management of cost price increase requests but also resolution of invoice discrepancies and data input errors.\n\n“However, the survey shows clearly that many suppliers do not believe that Amazon is complying with the code. Amazon must ensure suppliers understand the changes it has made since its designation and in response to these survey results, and make any further changes that are needed to ensure code compliance.\n\n“I will not hesitate to launch a formal investigation if appropriate and necessary to ensure Amazon is treating its suppliers fairly and lawfully.\n\n“I encourage suppliers to continue to confidentially tell me about the issues they are facing with Amazon.”\n\nFor the first time, Co-op came top of the 14 retailers for overall code compliance, at 98%.\n\nCo-op and Lidl both recorded a 2% improvement, which was the biggest percentage improvement across the 14 retailers.\n\nCo-op Food managing director Matt Hood said: “I am absolutely delighted to see Co-op at the top of the 2024 GCA annual survey, and again one of the most improved retailers, which is a huge testament to how far we’ve come and the sheer hard work of the team, as it is a significant improvement on even last year, where we were in fifth position.\n\n“I am extremely proud of our teams, as we continue to drive innovation, creativity and excellence in supplier engagement whilst delivering ongoing improvements in our commercial performance.\n\n“I’m also grateful to all the suppliers who completed the survey and shared their feedback.”\n\nAmazon UK has been approached for comment.",

        "content": "Companies develop new generative AI capabilities, simplify custom application development, and accelerate joint go-to-market collaboration\n\nSEATTLE, July 11, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced an expanded partnership with Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ: WDAY), a leading provider of solutions to help organizations manage their people and money. Together, AWS and Workday will build generative artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, jointly innovate new customer experiences, and invest in joint go-to-market initiatives to accelerate customer cloud transformation, helping customers increase productivity, grow and retain talent, and streamline business processes.\n\n\"This expanded partnership combines the power of Workday AI and AWS to deliver AI features to our customers faster and more efficiently,\" said Shane Luke, vice president of Product and Engineering and head of AI and ML at Workday. \"With Workday AI, we’re focused on delivering value for our customers through the use of enterprise data in their Workday applications. By leveraging AWS, we can focus more directly on that goal, while using the tools and services they provide for a range of model management and operations.\"\n\nDeveloping generative AI tools\n\nWith AI embedded at the core of its platform, Workday leverages AWS technologies such as Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker JumpStart to develop generative AI capabilities that help customers manage their workforce and financial assets. For example, Workday is using AWS generative AI capabilities to help customers create job descriptions in minutes versus hours, analyze and correct contracts for more accurate revenue reporting, and create personalized employee talent highlights.\n\nWorkday is also teaming up with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center to experiment with new applications of generative AI capabilities and to identify new use cases. As a result, Workday is deepening its use of Amazon SageMaker to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) by implementing model guardrails and responsible AI policies and evaluating generative AI use cases for production.\n\nIncreasing native integrations for developers to build custom applications\n\nWorkday is also expanding its native integrations with AWS to enable Workday developers and customers to apply AWS technologies to build custom applications. Customers can now use their Workday data along with AWS technologies, including AWS Lambda, Amazon EventBridge, Amazon Comprehend, Amazon S3, Amazon Textract, and Amazon Translate, in Workday Extend to build customized apps for finance and HR processes more securely and at scale. This deeper integration is designed to help customers improve the developer experience, build customized apps that can reduce operational costs, and respond to unplanned spikes in demand and resource disruptions.\n\nStory continues\n\nExpanding joint go-to-market collaboration\n\nAs part of the expanded partnership, Workday and AWS will invest in joint sales and go-to-market initiatives. These initiatives will help accelerate new Workday customer acquisition and raise awareness around the availability of Workday on the AWS Marketplace, in addition to helping Workday customers that run on AWS launch preconfigured Workday solutions. Running Workday on AWS will give Workday customers near-zero downtime maintenance windows and help them comply with regional data residency laws and regulatory requirements.\n\n\"Since 2008, AWS and Workday have worked together to help thousands of customers across every industry accelerate cloud migrations and drive faster, more intelligent financial and workforce decisions,\" said Kathrin Renz, vice president of AWS Industries. \"With AWS as a preferred cloud services provider, Workday can quickly develop new ways to help organizations around the globe become more responsive and data-focused.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks Flashing Danger Signs",
        "content": "Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has been the hottest sector in the stock market. Since OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, it has been a race to develop the best and smartest generative AI platforms. Bloomberg Intelligence issued a report that potentially valued the generative AI industry at $1.3 trillion by 2032. The AI hardware sector has exploded in value with every major tech company scrambling to buy high-powered GPUs. Semiconductor stocks have led the massive Nasdaq and S&P 500 rally over the past year. Over the past twelve months, the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) has gained more than 54%. Yet there could now be newly risky AI stocks.\n\nMany of these AI stocks have become overvalued and diverge from their fundamentals. At their current values, it’s hard to justify chasing them after rallying for over a year. These three AI stocks flash danger signs and should be avoided at their current multiples.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nYears ago, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the king of the chip industry. However, a drop in PC demand and being replaced as the chip provider for Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Macbook computers sent Intel into a downward spiral. While other chip stocks have flourished, shares of INTC are down by more than 30% in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSome believed that Intel would be boosted after a deal with the US government. The agreement saw Intel receive $8.5 billion in funding to advance its AI chip technology. Despite this, Intel continues to lose ground in its core CPU business. Chip-rivals AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and ArmHoldings (NASDAQ:ARM) are eating away at Intel’s market share after creating CPUs with superior performance and speed.\n\nAs a result, Intel is showing a negative revenue growth CAGR over the past five years. They are one of the only chip companies with negative growth in recent years. Comparatively, AMD has a five-year revenue CAGR of 30%, and ARM has a three-year CAGR of 17%. Intel is still trading at nearly 30x forward earnings, even with a five-year net income CAGR of -28%. The stock is too richly valued for its declining growth as it continues falling behind its peers and into a category of risky AI stocks.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock. Nvidia stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNo stock has been as front and center for the AI revolution as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). I outlined my views on Nvidia a couple of weeks ago, and thus far, my thesis for calling Nvidia’s peak has been playing out. Shares of NVDA are up by nearly 200% over the past year of trading.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s recent 10-for-one stock split not only continued the stock’s snowball but also made shares more accessible to retail investors. Those left out of the stock’s historic one-year rally FOMO’d into the stock at the top. Nvidia also faces the threat of homegrown GPUs from companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and cheaper domestic offerings in China. Through its Made in 2025 policy, China plans to produce 70% of its chips domestically by the year 2025.\n\nThere is no denying that the company’s recent growth has been impressive. Analysts have a current average price target of $119.32 and the stock even received a downgrade from a rating of Buy to Neutral by New Street Research. Nvidia will not continue to grow its revenue at a five-year CAGR of nearly 50%. With shares trading at 40x sales, any decline in revenue growth will result in the stock becoming increasingly overvalued. Nvidia is not the only way to gain exposure to AI.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nNot many people think of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as an AI company, yet. What was once the most popular stock on the market has struggled in 2024, only recently bringing their year-to-date returns above water. After gaining nearly 30% in the first week of July, the stock has returned 1.2% in 2024 to shareholders.\n\nMuch of Tesla’s long-term potential revolves around AI-based initiatives like their Robotaxi and Optimus robots. Tesla Bulls also believes in the future of their FSD technology as well as public listings of Elon Musk’s other companies like SpaceX. But most, if not all, of these initiatives are a long way off from being a reality and some may never even come to fruition. Tesla vehicles are the best-selling EVs on the planet yet the market is pricing Tesla as more than just an automaker.\n\nEven if Tesla were a full AI company, the stock now trades at a sky-high valuation. At 101x forward earnings, Tesla trades at double Nvidia’s price-to-earnings ratio. There is a future where Tesla is a leader in AI technology and software. Until we see any of these play out and hit the market, Tesla has to be considered an automaker more than an AI leader and thus one of the risky AI stocks on the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que held a LONG position in AMZN.

        "title": "3 Underpriced Stocks Primed for a July Breakout",
        "content": "Some thin trading activity could be ahead for the broader markets but don’t count out the red-hot momentum plays, many of which could continue to inch closer to a breakout. Of course, July isn’t exactly the most action-packed month for stocks, especially as many investors, traders and other market participants look to take some much-needed time off while it’s hot.\n\nWith artificial intelligence (AI) on the minds of many growth-hungry investors, perhaps the companies with less-appreciated AI stories can stay hot even as trading activity cools down just a bit. Also, let’s not forget other stocks in this market are faring well without the tailwind of AI.\n\nIn this piece, we’ll examine three underpriced stocks (and perhaps even slightly undervalued) that may be in a spot to make a run for new heights in the coming weeks. Though lacking in timely catalysts, the following seem like worthy additions to the mid-summer radar.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCorning (GLW) the corning (GLW) logo and homepage displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nCorning (NYSE:GLW) was still a relatively underpriced and under-the-radar AI beneficiary when I first highlighted the name back in early June. After reporting an incredible quarter, the Gorilla Glass and optical cable maker is now in the hot seat, soaring more than 16% in the last week on the back of better-than-expected demand.\n\nWith raised guidance for the second quarter (revenue expected to come in at $3.6 billion, up from $3.4 billion) and new innovations that could solidify the company’s positioning in the data center boom, GLW stock seems to have enough wind at its back to power even more big beats over the coming year.\n\nAs builders of data centers continue buying the latest Corning equipment, perhaps the second-quarter sales guide raise will prove too conservative. Either way, I’d be unsurprised if Corning shares break out to new 10-year highs as soon as this month. The stock is less than 3% from the level.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock has already broken out in a big way, with shares now up over 7% from highs hit back in July 2021. Indeed, AMZN stock is a tad later than its Magnificent Seven peers to break out to new highs. Still, I view Amazon as having more than enough growth drivers (notably in AI) to continue powering the latest surge.\n\nMore recently, the $2 trillion e-commerce and cloud giant pulled the curtain on its latest semiconductor innovation: the Graviton4 CPU. The chip, based on the ArmHoldings (NASDAQ:ARM) architecture, makes considerable performance gains over its predecessor and could help Amazon lower its dependence on third-party chipmakers in the data center.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Amazon continues innovating on AI-capable software and hardware, I find it tough to pass on shares as they look to extend the massive bull run that started in January 2023.\n\nTeradyne (TER) Teradyne Silicon Valley office\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nTeradyne (NASDAQ:TER) stock has been a huge winner so far this year, with the stock up an astounding 43% year-to-date. With Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently adding the industrial automation solutions provider to its “conviction list,” investors may be looking for a summertime breakout for the name. Specifically, Goldman noted that the firm may be on track to enjoy a “sales inflection.”\n\nAt writing, TER shares aren’t too far off from new highs, down just over 6% from its January 2022 peak. Even at more than 60 times trailing price-to-earnings, TER stock stands out as an intriguing breakout candidate with numerous underrated catalysts that could help power a move.\n\nThe company’s new industrial-focused autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), like the MiR1200 pallet jack, are helping advance the robotics boom in the warehouse. For such impressive innovations, you can expect to pay a rich premium. Arguably, the current premium may not be rich enough.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Amazon.

        "content": "Jeff Bezos Now Owns Less Than 9% Of Amazon, Billionaire Divests $863.5M Worth Of Shares As Part Of $5B Liquidation Plan\n\nAmazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos sold more shares of the e-commerce giant, a late-Tuesday filing by the company with the SEC showed.\n\nWhat Happened: Bezos reported three tranches of stock sales, two of which were done on Monday and the third one on Friday. The details of the transactions are as follows:\n\n3,085,116 shares divested Friday at an average price of $200.07 1,171,794 shares at $200.33 apiece and 57,199 shares at $201.05 per share on Monday.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how many people got started through this free crypto faucet?\n\nThe selling was in conformance with the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by Bezos on March 2. The rule offers corporate insiders a way to transact in company stock over a predefined period, provided the insiders can establish that they were unaware of any material non-public information when the pre-existing plan was established.\n\nThe total value of shares divested over the past two trading sessions is $863.49 million.\n\nFollowing the most recent transaction, Bezos is left with 930,696,284 shares in Amazon, representing an ownership interest of 8.9% based on the 10.41 billion in outstanding shares.\n\nThe most recent disclosure comes close on the heels of the sale of $333.09 million worth of shares on July 2 and July 3 which was disclosed on Friday. Put together, the billionaire has pocketed roughly $1.2 billion from the recent divestments.\n\nIncidentally, the company said in a separate filing on July 2 that Bezos intends to sell 25 million shares valued at $4.93 billion.\n\nWhy It’s Important: Bezos is the world’s second-richest man, with Bloomberg estimating his wealth at $221 billion, and the bulk of his net worth is tied to his stake in Amazon. The billionaire also owns the Washington Post and space company Blue Origin, which competes with Elon Musk’s SpaceX.\n\nAmazon shares have been on a tear this year, riding on the artificial intelligence mania. On Monday, the stock hit an intraday high of $201.20 before pulling back below the psychological $200 barrier by the close. It edged up 0.03% on Tuesday before settling at $199.34, according to Benzinga Pro data. This is slightly off the $200 closing high reached on Friday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be the Top Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to End 2024",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is a group of companies that led the market since 2023:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nOther than Tesla, which is basically flat year to date, this group is having a fairly strong 2024. MSFT data by YCharts.\n\nNvidia outshines them all, continuing its unbelievable run after a phenomenal 2023. But investors who didn't buy in earlier can't do anything about that now; they can only look forward. So which Magnificent Seven stock looks likeliest to be the biggest winner for the rest of the year?\n\nMany of the Magnificent Seven trade at sky-high valuations\n\nLet's start with the stocks that likely won't have the best performances in the second half. While Tesla shares underperformed for most of the year, there were good reasons for that. Demand for its electric vehicles declined and its margins have shrunk due to its price cuts. There are no signs those trends will turn around before 2024 is over.\n\nNext, let's consider valuations: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all trade at expensive levels of 34 times forward earnings or more, which is quite a premium over the benchmark S&P 500 index, which currently averages 22.7 times forward earnings. Those premiums will likely inhibit their performance from here.\n\nThat leaves just Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Of the two, I think Alphabet is primed for the best second half of 2024.\n\nAlphabet's investments are starting to pay off\n\nAlphabet has long been a force in artificial intelligence (AI). However, it appeared caught off guard when the generative AI craze took off in late 2022. As a result, it had to scramble to launch competing products that weren't great initially. However, it has largely cleaned up their problems.\n\nNow, Alphabet's generative AI model, Gemini, is recognized as one of the top options available, and has already been integrated into several of its products to perform tasks such as summarizing Google search results.\n\nFurthermore, Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum. Because most companies can't afford to spend millions of dollars to build and operate their own supercomputers to train AI models, renting that processing power from a cloud computing provider is far more economical. Each cloud infrastructure provider has its specialties, and AI appears to be one of Google Cloud's. With 60% of funded generative AI start-ups and 90% of generative AI unicorns (private companies worth at least $1 billion) using its services, it has a strong foothold in this emerging market.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Alphabet's advertising business should continue to perform well this year -- and while AI may be flashy, advertising is what keeps the company's lights on. In Q1, more than three-fourths of its revenue came from advertising-related sources, and that revenue was up 13% year over year. While that's not blazing-fast growth, it is impressive for a fairly mature business. With upcoming catalysts like election-related advertising, we can expect a strong end to 2024 for Alphabet.\n\nAs for its valuation, Alphabet is actually the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven cohort, trading at 25 times forward earnings. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile that's not cheap relative to the broader market, it is when compared to its peers.\n\nBased on the combination of its relatively cheap valuation and its strong business momentum, I have confidence that Alphabet will have a strong close to 2024. Whether it will outperform the rest of the Magnificent Seven is still up in the air -- especially with a wild card like Nvidia in the mix -- but I'm confident that Alphabet will beat the market in the second half.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Soaring Stocks I'd Buy Now With No Hesitation",
        "content": "One of the more difficult tasks in investing can be convincing yourself to buy a stock that has already been on a big run. Buying a stock when it's near an all-time high, or even a 52-week high, requires investors to clear a psychological hurdle. This makes intuitive sense, at least at first. If a stock is already up by a lot, it's easy to imagine that we've missed all the gains.\n\nFortunately, this is not always the case. The best companies in the world set new all-time highs frequently on their way to market-crushing long-term returns. Sure, buying into these companies earlier leads to better results, but in many cases, an investor can do just fine by picking up shares several years into a great stock run-up.\n\nHere are two stocks that have been soaring over the last year and a half, but that I'd buy right now anyway.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\n\nOver the past year, fast-casual Mexican restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) is up 51%, well outpacing the S&P 500's 27% gain. The stock's performance has been propelled by several quarters of impressive and consistent growth. For example, in Q1, revenue increased by 14% year over year while earnings per share grew by 24%. The company also generated $437 million in free cash flow.\n\nImportantly, this growth has been generated by both an increase in the number of Chipotle restaurants and by existing restaurants continuing to sell more. The company grew its total restaurant count by 8% year over year in the quarter while comparable restaurant sales were up 7%.\n\nThese metrics tell investors that Chipotle is still delighting its customers and that there is still plenty of growth to be found from adding new restaurants. This combination could mean further strong returns for shareholders.\n\nThat said, it is reasonable to ask if the stock might have already gotten too expensive. Chipotle is trading at 67 times its trailing earnings. That isn't cheap, but it is within the historical range of the stock. Premium companies are rarely cheap and Chipotle is no exception.\n\nAmazon\n\nIt's hard to believe that at the beginning of 2023, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was trading at its lowest price since 2019. However, since that point, the stock has rallied and is up 138%. Many investors counted Amazon out during its 2022 plunge, but those who hung on have been handsomely rewarded, as the stock has been setting new highs this summer.\n\nBoth the fall and the rebound make sense in context. After doubling its distribution footprint to meet pandemic-fueled demand, Amazon was left with a business that needed to be right-sized as most consumers were able to resume in-person shopping and their e-commerce usage reverted to levels closer to their pre-COVID norms. Amazon's operating income fell significantly from early 2021 through the end of 2022, spooking investors.\n\nStory continues AMZN Operating Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nIn hindsight, it is clear that Amazon just needed time to adjust to that shift, and throughout 2023, its operating income improved dramatically. The turnaround was driven specifically by the e-commerce part of the business, where it was able to get expenses under control. The results over the past year and a half have been impressive. AMZN Operating Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAmazon trades at 56 times trailing earnings. However, unlike Chipotle, this valuation for Amazon is below its historical levels. Put another way, even after a triple-digit percentage return for the stock over the past year, an argument could be made that Amazon is still inexpensive, historically speaking.\n\nThe bottom line for investors\n\nChipotle and Amazon are fantastic businesses with long track records of success, and neither is showing any signs of slowing down. Their recent stock price appreciation shouldn't be a reason for investors to stay away from either company. Both look to me like compelling stocks to buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Finding promising companies that have the potential to outperform the broader market is extremely challenging. Investors can look to sleeper stocks to buy that have been overlooked or undervalued by the market.\n\nThese under the radar companies might not be making the headlines, but their potential for growth makes them attractive buys. Unlike many of the high-flying tech giants in 2024, sleeper stocks have not yet achieved glory. Also they don’t necessarily have to be smaller companies, but can be uniquely positioned to expand their earnings and market share over the next decade. This positive backdrop allows investors to capitalize on the potential upside of stocks with a promising earnings growth outlook.\n\nIf you’re looking for the best place to allocate your capital in the next few months, these companies present a lot of promise.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, let’s discover the 3 best sleeper stocks to buy with $10K right now!\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT), a household name in retail, is among the best sleeper stocks to buy with $10K. The company’s expansive reach and significant strides in e-commerce make it well positioned for long term growth.\n\nIn recent years, Walmart has invested heavily in e-commerce, omnichannel capabilities and supply chain enhancements. These initiatives have not only strengthened its competitive position against online giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) but also opened up new avenues for growth. Moreover, Walmart’s continued strength in international markets will be a strong growth driver over the next decade. In Q1 FY25, revenue increased 6% year-over-year (YOY) to $161.5 billion. Global e-commerce sales swelled 21% from the year prior, driven by strong international sales volume. Additionally, Walmart’s advertising business is picking up steam. This included 26% growth at Walmart Connect, and 27% growth, led by Flipkart and Walmex. Business is booming, and the company’s omnichannel strategy is working. For investors searching for stability and long term growth, WMT stock should definitely be a top contender.\n\nEmcor Group (EME) Numerous electric lines are seen at sunset.\n\nSource: Pand P Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nEmcor Group (NYSE:EME) is a leading provider of electrical and mechanical construction services in the United States. Its diversified business model is built for resilience and its valuation is looking quite attractive at current levels.\n\nEmcor Group’s expertise lies in its ability to provide critical infrastructure services to businesses across the country. With the bipartisan Infrastructure Bill signed into law in November of 2021, Emcor is uniquely positioned to benefit from increased spending. While this is certainly a positive backdrop, Emcor’s financial performance will be what drives the stock price higher. The company’s strategy to grow through acquisitions is working, significantly boosting its revenue and earnings potential. In FY23, Emcor saw record revenue, earnings and free cash flow. Its growth also continues to accelerate in the 2024 fiscal year, with its backlog growing handsomely alongside it. In the first quarter its earnings increased 80% YOY, with remaining performance obligations hitting a record $9.18 billion. Demand for its services is strong, and its price-to-earnings of 24x is still attractive when factoring in its long term growth prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nFiserv (FI) Online banking businessman using smartphone with credit card Fintech and Blockchain concept\n\nSource: Joyseulay / Shutterstock.com\n\nFiserv (NYSE:FI) provides financial technology services to leading financial institutions. Its wide range of services offerings and impressive financial profile make it a compelling sleeper stock to buy in 2024.\n\nOne of the key drivers of Fiserv’s growth is its focus on digital transformation. As the financial industry continues to shift towards digital solutions, Fiserv’s expertise in providing cutting-edge technology and services becomes increasingly valuable. Its product offerings range from payment processing, banking and fraud prevention tools. Moreover, its strategic acquisition of First Data in 2019 has worked wonders for its bottom-line and market positioning. Since then, the company has seen steady revenue and earnings growth, along with significant operating margin expansion. In the first quarter of 2024, revenue increased 7% YOY to $4.88 billion. Net earnings swelled 31% YOY to $735 million, or $1.24 per share. Additionally, its merchant solutions business remains strong growing 36% from the year prior. With earnings per share forecast to rise more than 65%, FI stock should definitely not be slept on in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Streaming Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "In today’s entertainment landscape, streaming has emerged as the main way we consume media. From binge-worthy series to interactive video games and soothing music playlists, streaming platforms have revolutionized our access to content. As this trend continues to mature across various mediums, the streaming space continues to expand rapidly, driven by rising demand and competitive pricing, forming a favorable outlook for related stocks.\n\nFor this article, I have selected three undervalued streaming stocks whose future prospects are likely not reflected in their current share prices. These companies operate in distinct niches within the streaming industry. From pioneering music streaming services to global leaders in original content production, each stock brings its own set of strengths.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) The Netflix (NFLX) logo on a tablet with earbuds and a bowl of popcorn nearby.\n\nSource: Riccosta / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe all know that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) pioneered the streaming industry. Yet what’s truly impressive is that the company continues to assert its dominance despite fronting intensified competition. Many giants like Disney’s (NYSE:DIS) Disney+ and Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video have entered the fray, yet Netflix remains a standout performer in the market. While others struggle to expand their subscriber base, Netflix consistently attracts new members. In fact, its global streaming paid memberships grew impressively by 16% to reach 269.6 million in Q1, despite its already mature status.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company’s relentless focus on original content production, ranging from blockbuster series to critically acclaimed films, has solidified its position as a must-have streaming service, resulting in highly predictable revenues and overall cash flow visibility. Moreover, Netflix has been capitalizing on the economies of scale achieved by its continuous growth to improve portability significantly. Its free cash flow surged to a record $6.93 billion last year, up massively from $1.62 billion in the year before.\n\nValuation-wise, Netflix stock has rallied by about 58% over the past year, which may imply that those who didn’t buy earlier have already missed the rally. Yet, NFLX stock could still be undervalued at its current levels. Its forward P/E of 35.9x may seem rich, but given that consensus earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates point to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.7% over the next five years, I believe this multiple is well-justified and leaves room for further upside potential.\n\nSpotify Technology (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.\n\nSource: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nSpotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) is another undervalued streaming stock to consider. The audio streaming giant continues to impress with strong user and revenue growth, underscoring its position as a leading global platform. As of Q1 2024, Spotify boasted 615 million Monthly Active Users (MAUs), up a notable 19% year-over-year increase. Premium MAUs reached 239 million, up by 14%, while ad-supported MAUs surged by 22% to 388 million.\n\nIn the meantime, Spotify showcased strong pricing and improved its advertising results, boosting premium and ad-supported revenues. In particular, premium revenue grew by 20%, fueled by the aforementioned subscriber gains and a 7% increase in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) compared to the previous year. Along with an 18% rise in ad-supported revenues, Spotify’s total revenue climbed 20% year-over-year to a record €3.64 billion.\n\nOn the surface, it seems that Spotify is trading at a rather hefty valuation. At a forward P/E of 54.9x, it’s hard to argue against this. Nonetheless, this multiple becomes rather fair when you consider Spotify’s incredible moat and the significant improvement in margins and profitability. In Q1, for instance, Spotify’s gross profit margin came in at 27.6%, marking a 243 basis point increase year-over-year, while its free cash flow landed at €207 million, up 263% year-over-year.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnlike Netflix or Spotify, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a unique vehicle for investing in the streaming space. By holding AAPL stock, you get exposure to its diverse ecosystem, which includes Apple TV+ and Apple Music, with the additional advantage of Apple controlling the hardware.\n\nApple TV+ has steadily expanded its subscriber base by producing high-quality, original content, including award-winning series and films. Given Apple’s tremendous financial resources and the ability to bundle services, Apple TV+ is likely to become a dominant streaming platform slowly yet inevitably. In the meantime, Apple Music stays a strong competitor in the music streaming space, offering an extensive library and exclusive releases, thus maintaining a loyal user base.\n\nWhile Apple’s streaming services are confined to its ecosystem, this limitation also fortifies Apple’s market position. The seamless hardware and software integration enhances user engagement and cultivates strong customer loyalty, establishing a resilient and predictable revenue stream. With expanded content offerings over time, I believe that Apple’s services are poised for significant growth.\n\nWhile APPL stock may not seem cheap at a forward P/E of 32.9x, I do believe that Wall Street underestimates its services growth potential, with streaming poised to be a major growth driver in the coming years. In that sense, I view Apple as an undervalued stock in the streaming space.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon could face probe over treatment of UK grocery suppliers, watchdog says",
        "content": "By James Davey\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's grocery regulator on Thursday threatened Amazon with a formal investigation if it does not improve its compliance with an industry code designed to protect suppliers.\n\nThe Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA) said its 2024 annual survey found that less than half of respondents directly supplying Amazon believed the U.S. giant \"consistently\" or \"mostly\" complied with the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP).\n\nThe Code aims to ensure Britain's 14 largest grocery retailers, including market leader Tesco, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer, treat suppliers fairly. Amazon has been subject to it since 2022.\n\nIt restricts firms from making changes to supply contracts at short notice and also requires retailers to give an appropriate period of notice if they no longer want to use a supplier and provide reasons for ending the contract.\n\nAmazon’s perceived Code compliance score fell to 47% from 59% in 2023, with Amazon retaining its position in last place some 41 percentage points behind Iceland on 88% in 13th place.\n\n\"We are very disappointed by these results and we are committed to improving them,\" an Amazon spokesperson said.\n\nThe GCA said it had told Amazon to take \"swift and comprehensive action\" to demonstrably comply with the Code.\n\nThe regulator is monitoring changes that Amazon is making and their impact to determine whether they are sufficient.\n\n\"I will not hesitate to launch a formal investigation if appropriate and necessary to ensure Amazon is treating its suppliers fairly and lawfully,\" said Mark White, the Groceries Code Adjudicator.\n\nUltimately, the GCA can impose financial penalties of up to 1% of a large retailer's UK turnover.\n\nThe Amazon spokesperson said it had made several improvements for grocery suppliers since last year’s results, with clearer explanations for cost price increase decisions, minimum periods for de-listing, and the launch of a major upgrade for handling invoice disputes.\n\n“We will be making further changes, with faster time-frames to resolve more types of financial disputes, as well as strengthened account management support for smaller suppliers,\" the person said.The GCA said overall Code compliance scores across the retailers, excluding Amazon, averaged 94%, unchanged from 2023.\n\n(Reporting by James Davey; Editing by Mark Potter)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Magnificent Dow Stocks That Are No-Brainer Buys for the Second Half of 2024",
        "content": "For the last 128 years, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) has served as the premier health barometer for Wall Street. What began as a 12-stock index that primarily contained industrial companies has transformed into a 30-component index comprised of time-tested, multinational businesses that have consistently delivered for investors over the long run.\n\nWhile most Dow Jones stocks aren't going to rival the growth potential seen from innovative juggernauts like Nvidia and Broadcom, many are well-positioned to make their shareholders richer over time. As we turn the page to the second half of 2024, three magnificent businesses among the Dow's 30 components stand out as no-brainer buys. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nThe first amazing Dow stock that opportunistic investors can confidently add to their portfolios for the second half of 2024 is none other than beverage goliath Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO).\n\nArguably the biggest concern for consumer staples stocks like Coca-Cola is the adverse impact above-average inflation could have on purchasing power. Stubbornly high shelter expenses have provided an unwanted boost to the U.S. core inflation rate. If consumers have less disposable income to put to work, it could lead to a recession and poor short-term operating results for consumer-facing businesses.\n\nThe good news for Coca-Cola is that it sells a basic necessity item. No matter how well or poorly the U.S. or global economy is performing, consumers are going to purchase beverages. It just so happens that Coca-Cola has more than two dozen brands globally that are generating at least $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nWhat's more, Coca-Cola's geographic diversity is a competitive edge that virtually no other consumer staples company can match. With the exception of Cuba, North Korea, and Russia, it has ongoing operations in every other country. This leads to predictable operating cash flow in developed countries, as well as needle-moving organic growth in emerging markets.\n\nBranding is another key catalyst for Coca-Cola. Kantar's annually released \"Brand Footprint\" report notes that Coke was the most-chosen brand by consumers from retail shelves for a 12th consecutive year. This is a testament to the company's top-tier marketing and provides further evidence that basic-necessity goods can thrive in virtually any economic climate.\n\nThe company has been willing to embrace digital-media advertising and artificial intelligence (AI) to tailor its message(s) to a younger audience. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola has more than a century of history it can lean on to continually engage with its mature consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Coca-Cola isn't going to blow your socks off from a growth perspective, its business is transparent and predictable. To boot, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 21 marks an 11% discount to its average forward earnings multiple over the last half-decade. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\n\nA second magnificent Dow stock that makes for a no-brainer addition to investors' portfolios for the second half of 2024 (and likely well beyond) is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ).\n\n\"J&J,\" as Johnson & Johnson is more commonly known, has decisively been left in the dust by the current bull market. The clear-cut reason for its underperformance almost certainly has to do with outstanding litigation regarding its now-discontinued talcum-based baby powder.\n\nIn the neighborhood of 100,000 lawsuits allege that J&J's talc-based powder causes cancer. Two previous attempts by J&J to settle this collective litigation were thrown out in court.\n\nAlthough Wall Street and investors loathe legal uncertainty, the important thing to recognize is that Johnson & Johnson has the financial means to cover an eventual settlement. It's one of only two publicly traded companies to bear the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's. J&J's bountiful operating cash flow and cash on hand will more than cover any potential financial judgment.\n\nThe fuel behind Johnson & Johnson's steady operating earnings growth is its pharmaceutical segment. Management has been shifting focus to this higher-growth and juicier margin division for more than a decade. J&J is investing big bucks into novel research and has demonstrated a willingness to collaborate on potential blockbuster therapies.\n\nIn addition to its core drug division, Johnson & Johnson has a world-leading medical-device segment. While medical technologies have been somewhat commoditized, an aging domestic and global population, coupled with improving access to preventative medical care, should act as a long-term catalyst for this segment.\n\nAnother reason prospective investors can trust J&J to deliver for investors is continuity in its C-suite. Since being founded 138 years ago, J&J has only had 10 CEOs, including current chief Joaquin Duato. Minimal turnover at the top means the company's various growth initiatives have the proper oversight from start to finish.\n\nMirroring Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson's stock is also historically cheap. Based on Wall Street's consensus earnings-per-share (EPS) estimate for 2025, J&J is trading at a forward P/E of 13.6, which represents a 15% discount to its average forward P/E ratio over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe third magnificent Dow Jones Industrial Average stock that makes for a no-brainer buy in the second half of 2024 is e-commerce colossus Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nThe clearest headwind for current and prospective Amazon investors is the likelihood of a U.S. recession taking shape in the not-too-distant future. Although U.S. economic data has remained relatively strong, select predictive metrics, such as the first meaningful decline in U.S. M2 money supply since the Great Depression, portend upcoming trouble for the economy. Since Amazon generates a good chunk of its revenue from its online marketplace, some investors believe a recession would clobber its stock.\n\nWhile recessions can be scary, the important thing to remember is that they're also short-lived. In the 78-plus years since World War II ended, 9 out of 12 U.S. recessions were resolved in less than 12 months. This means consumer-facing companies, like Amazon, are standing in the proverbial sun far more often than navigating choppy waters.\n\nFurthermore, Amazon's operating cash flow has very little to do with its market-leading e-commerce segment. Though its online marketplace is responsible for driving close to 2.5 billion people to its website each month, Amazon's ancillary operating segments handle most of the heavy lifting.\n\nNo operating segment is more vital to Amazon's long-term growth potential or its cash-flow generation than Amazon Web Services (AWS). As the world's leading cloud infrastructure services platform (based on spending), AWS is currently pacing more than $100 billion in annual run-rate sales.\n\nWhat's incredible about this revenue figure is that enterprise cloud-service spending is still in the process of ramping up. With cloud-service margins easily topping e-commerce margins, it should come as no surprise that AWS is consistently responsible for 50% to 100% of Amazon's quarterly operating income.\n\nSubscription services and advertising services are doing their part, as well. Attracting 2.5 billion visitors each month has aided Amazon's ad-pricing power. Meanwhile, having the exclusive rights to Thursday Night Football, along with an expansive content library, is a boon to the company's Prime subscription.\n\nTo round things out, Amazon, like Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson, is historically inexpensive. But whereas the traditional P/E ratio works great for evaluating mature businesses, it's not particularly useful with fast-growing companies (like Amazon) that are reinvesting a substantial portion of their cash flow. This is what makes operating cash flow such a vital metric when evaluating hypergrowth stocks.\n\nAmazon is currently valued at 13.4 times Wall Street's consensus cash-flow estimate for the company in 2025. That's a mammoth discount to its average cash-flow multiple of 22.1 over the last five years and the median year-end multiple of 30 that investors gladly paid to own Amazon stock throughout the 2010s.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Next-Gen Cloud Stocks to Supercharge Your Returns",
        "content": "As network connectivity improves worldwide, so does the ability to integrate wireless technologies like cloud computing. With these advancements, what were previously niche tech sectors have come to the forefront of the stock market. As the need for off-device computing increases with the push to bring artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) to things like laptops and smartphones, next-gen cloud stocks are emerging as potentially lucrative long-term holdings.\n\nYet, that’s not all these companies are good for. That’s because cloud computing is a broad term encompassing any kind of data processing or calculation that occurs on a device other than the one you’re using. You feed the offsite computer the information from your device, say your phone through an internet connection, and the offsite computer processes and returns that data to you on the same connection. This complex, yet practically invisible process now happens constantly across our personal and business devices, opening up several avenues of investment into its improvement and future.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt is essentially impossible to discuss next-gen cloud stocks without mentioning the tech giant driving much of the industry: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). While that may sound like a surprise to the uninitiated who still see Amazon as an e-commerce giant (which is still true as well), the major driver for its growth is now its cloud computing business through Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOne of the big three cloud computing subsidiaries, AWS continues to impress investors with stunning categorial growth. For example, the first quarter of 2024 saw the AWS segment operating income increase to $9.4 billion, compared with an operating income of $5.1 billion for Q1 2023. That’s a stunning 84% increase year-over-year and has driven analysts to be exceptionally bullish about AMZN stock.\n\nShould this quarterly revenue trend continue for AWS revenue, there is little doubt that AMZN will continue surging in value this year. That’s because Amazon has incredibly deep pockets thanks to its $73 billion in cash asset reserves. As such, it’s clear Amazon will continue investing in the tech that makes it number one among next-gen cloud stocks.\n\nOracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Amazon might be focused on overall infrastructure, Oracle’s (NYSE:ORCL) approach to cloud computing targets the enterprise-level customer more specifically. The company, which is known for its business management software has spent the last decade developing a full suite of applications that run exclusively on the company’s cloud environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe advantage to this approach is that Oracle’s customer base is incredibly broad, with it having the ability to provide its services to nearly any business that needs them and can afford them. This is because of the highly efficient computing infrastructure Oracle owns, which allows it to run these applications remotely for display on any machine. As a result, Oracle’s customers don’t need expensive on-site servers or computing capabilities to use its software.\n\nThis successful approach to cloud computing has resulted in 84% and 83% of Oracle’s total revenues in fiscal 2024 and 2023. It’s also a big driver of what is keeping ORCL stock relevant among next-gen cloud computing stocks in a highly competitive industry.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nAdding a wildcard to the discussion of next-gen cloud stocks, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is certainly the riskiest of the three stocks mentioned in this article. This stems from its relatively short history as a publicly traded company. SNOW has risen in value and relative fame over the last two years since going public due to its exciting approach to cloud computing and data processing.\n\nThat’s because the company markets itself as a novel data-as-a-service provider, aiming to collect data from customers, store it in its cloud data centers, and process it for trend evaluation. While this may seem esoteric to the average consumer, for massive enterprises, it can uncover invaluable inefficiencies and areas for improvement.\n\nThough the company is still in its growth stages and investing significant capital into scaling its operations, it could become a runaway hit should the artificial intelligence industry blossom into what some analysts expect it to.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget A.I.

        "title": "Paramount-Skydance deal sets stage for more media dealmaking",
        "content": "Paramount Global's (PARA) plans to merge with production studio Skydance Media could set off a dealmaking spree in the media industry as it grapples with traditional TV's decline.\n\nOn Sunday, Paramount announced it will combine with Skydance following a years-long struggle to make streaming profitable and stop the bleeding of its linear network business.\n\nIt's the same two-pronged conundrum that all legacy media is facing: Fewer consumers are paying for the pay-TV bundle, which doesn't bode well for how much programmers can make from ad sales and affiliate fees paid by distributors for their content. Meanwhile, streaming remains unprofitable for the majority of players as costs rise and subscriber growth stalls.\n\nAll that points to a handful of giants getting even bigger. Rumors have swirled that Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA) could merge or spin off certain assets.\n\n\"I think you're going to have two or three major companies,\" David Wisnia, partner and managing director of media and entertainment at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal, told Yahoo Finance. \"Because if you're not able to bring streaming to a material level of profitability, ... you're going to be looking for a buyer. You have no other choice.\"\n\nThe Paramount deal has been one of the most talked about topics at the ongoingannual Sun Valley conference, which brings together top media moguls and CEOs. It's often a space where company deals are made (or at the very least teased.)\n\n\"Getting [Paramount] in solid hands and having them funded — it’s a great company and a great heritage, so I think that’s good for the industry,\" Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav told reporters on Tuesday, as cited by Bloomberg.\n\n“Over the next year or two you’re going to see some real consolidation, whether that happens with companies buying each other or going after streaming together,” he said.\n\nThat's a reality already taking place with bundles and partnerships becoming more common within the industry at large. Bundles are viewed as a way to create \"stickiness\" for subscribers searching for value.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Disney announced a streaming bundle that will combine Disney+, Hulu, and Max, with a launch date set for this summer in the US. In May, Comcast (CMCSA) rolled out a StreamSaver bundle, which packages Peacock's ad-supported premium tier with Netflix's basic ad tier (NFLX) and Apple TV+ (AAPL).\n\nAnd earlier this year, Warner Bros. announced a sports streaming partnership with Disney's ESPN (DIS) and Fox (FOXA), set to debut later this fall called Venu.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The message has been for the last few years is you need efficiencies, you need growth opportunities, you need ways to find margin improvement. And this is just all a reflection of that,\" Wisnia said.\n\n\"Paramount's deal definitely reinforces the fact that struggling traditional media companies need to improve their fundamentals.\"\n\n'No other choice' A view of Paramount Studios's water tank in Los Angeles, Calif., on September 26, 2023. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe buyers in these deals are more likely to be traditional media and entertainment players or private equity firms than Big Tech companies. Sony (SONY), for example, had submitted a bid with private equity firm Apollo for Paramount while WBD also expressed interest in a merger.\n\n\"Years ago the driving force was Big Tech,\" Wisnia said. However, a difficult regulatory environment has become a top headwind for those types of buyers, which already have a significant level of scale.\n\n\"You see what happened with Amazon and MGM and the struggle they had just to close that deal. And that was only an $8.5 billion deal at the time,\" he said. The merger faced nearly a year of regulatory hurdles before finally receiving approval in 2022.\n\nThe top tech giants have also moved away from sinking money into original content, focusing on sports rights and live content instead. This means less of a need for the intellectual property libraries of traditional media players.\n\nGiven that, the race to consolidate largely falls on the traditional players.\n\nDeep-pocked Comcast has been viewed as a buyer, although CEO Brian Roberts previously said \"the bar continues to be even higher\" when it comes to any potential deals. Lionsgate could also be a potential acquirer as it spins off its film and TV studio business from cable channel Starz. And, following the back-and-forth Paramount negotiations, Japanese conglomerate Sony clearly seems to be looking to scale.\n\nBut, in Wisnia's view, the industry is not as desperate as it seems. Rather, it's in a period of transition.\n\n\"It's a time of transition where new business models are being evolved,\" he said. \"A lot of people are down on the industry but the reality is that consumption of content has never been higher, production is still at historic highs. The only thing that's in question, and that's debatable, are the business models.\"\n\n\"But these transitions have happened before,\" he continued. \"We will come out of this and what's efficient will become clearer. And once that does, it'll be a more smooth environment. But we're in the middle of it right now. And until we get out of it, it's just it's a muddied environment.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Overvalued Social Media Stock You Shouldn’t Touch With a 10-Foot Pole",
        "content": "Social media has taken the market by surprise. With Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) leading the way but joined by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL), and Snap (NASDAQ:SNAP), the social media industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 26% through 2031.\n\nDespite this, some companies are falling behind on capitalizing on this trend. It can be a mix of slowing user growth, stagnating revenues or blatantly bad financials. My investing methodology revolves around buying high-quality businesses with great growth at fair prices. More importantly, I ensure the companies I invest in are financially stable and will last several decades.\n\nHowever, as you look to the future, it is important to capture great companies in a fast-growing industry. It is equally essential to avoid bad businesses that will struggle to maintain market share as competition fiercens.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEtsy (ETSY) etsy logo on a grey wall\n\nSource: quietbits / Shutterstock.com\n\nEtsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) is an e-commerce platform that is also attracting social media influencers to promote merchandise. During its COVID-19 highs, Etsy stock rallied to almost $300 per share. That is a far cry from its current share price of $50 as the company’s growth increasingly stagnates.\r\n\r\nEven with this significant fall in price, the stock still trades at heavy multiples relative to its growth. It currently has a price-to-earnings ratio of 26.69 and an EV/EBITDA ratio of 20.88.\n\nIn the first quarterEtsy’s top line grew just 0.79% year-over-year (YOY) as net margins crashed by 16%. With a market share of just 0.38%, Etsy is being crushed by competitors like PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD), the proprietor of Temu, which has seen its market share rise from just 7% in 2019 to 19% by mid-2023.\n\nSome investors are optimistic about the company’s initiatives for operational efficiency, such as the outsourcing of its paid search efforts. However, this has been met with less-than-promising active buyer growth, which was just 1.9% YOY during the period.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Vipshop Holdings Limited (NYSE:VIPS), one of Etsy’s key competitors with similar revenue growth, trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 2.64. On the other hand, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 21.60. Slightly more than Etsy, the e-commerce giant’s growth is 15 times higher at 12.5%, showing that Etsy still has more room to fall before it bottoms.\n\nRumble (RUM) Illustrative Editorial of RUMBLE.COM website homepage. RUMBLE (RUM) logo visible on display screen.\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nRumble (NASDAQ:RUM), which some have deem a “YouTube copycat,” prides itself on free speech. However, the company’s core business model falters as the stock trails lower.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has had to confront growing challenges. In Brazil, for example, the government is calling for censorship and removal of certain popular accounts critical of the da Silver regime. Similarly, several Western countries, including France and Australia, also want to censor Rumble content.\n\nRumble’s monthly active users (MAUs) also drastically fell by 25% quarter over quarter. The company’s top line was flat at 0.7% year-over-year growth, and most notably, earnings-per-share (EPS) continues to spiral downward from a 14 cents per share loss last year to a 21 cent loss last quarter.\n\nThis only adds fuel to the fire that lies in its balance sheet as total assets decreased by 20% YOY. While most investors would expect liabilities to subsequently decrease as well, they instead jumped by 60% as Rumbled struggled for profitability. In fact, margins have continued to deteriorate with the video site reporting a profit margin of -250% in Q1 2024, a 50% decrease YOY.\r\n\r\nWith slowing user growth, a struggle for profitability and simply bad financial metrics, Rumble is trading at an EV/EBITDA ratio of -9.97. This is further exacerbated by a price-to-sales ratio of 13.85, nonsensical for a company that is experiencing flat sales growth.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) Truth Social (DJT), Gettr, Rumble (RUM) and Parler app icons are seen on an iPhone. Donald Trump's new social media venture, Truth Social, launched on Feb 20 in Apple's App Store.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter being banned from both Facebook and X (previously known as Twitter), Donald Trump took matters into his own hands and created Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT). It was an attempt to fight back against major tech companies such as Meta, Alphabet, and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).\n\nWith DJT down 63% from all-time highs and Trump leading in presidential political polling, some investors wonder if it’s time to buy. To put it bluntly, the company’s underlying fundamentals are out of whack. Strictly from a financial perspective, DJT has some alarmingly low growth rates, with quarterly revenue decreasing 30% YOY.\n\nTo make matters worse, DJT lost $327.6 million in just the first quarter. To compensate, the company has diluted its common shares outstanding by 37%, which is not a good look. Aside from lacking good financials, the company’s user base is in decline. Truth Social’s average number of monthly visits tumbled 40% over the past year, showing an evident lack of interest from the general populous.\n\nLastly, DJT’s EV/EBITDA ratio of -48.52 falls far behind that of similar free-speech medium Rumble, being over five times lower with far-worse levels of growth and profitability. Simply put, investing in Rumble stock is dead money.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever for an ‘All-in-One Portfolio’",
        "content": "The stock market has been stellar so far in 2024. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have hit fresh all-time highs, but volatility could creep back in as rate cuts take effect. This may seem counter-intuitive. But historically speaking, recessions and downturns have aligned with the Federal Reserve initiating rate cuts.\n\nYet, despite the near-term uncertainty, I remain optimistic about the market’s prospects over the mid-to-long term. Why? History has shown repeatedly that a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality companies can weather any storm and deliver solid returns.\n\nIn fact, some of the best-performing stocks of the past decade were those that investors simply bought and held. That’s why I think it’s worth looking into a diversified basket of stocks that could keep performing well going forward. Let’s explore seven such stocks to buy that may fit the bill.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett in the background behind a phone showing the Berkshire Hathaway logo\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/QubixStudio\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) continues to be a darling of Wall Street. Analysts are issuing strong buy ratings on the company’s more affordable Class B shares. They see the stock as undervalued at current levels, with an average price target 15% above the current trading price. I tend to agree that owning Berkshire Hathaway is like having a diversified portfolio all on its own.\n\nThe company holds a wide array of businesses, from insurers to the BNSF railway. This allows Buffett to nimbly shift capital from lagging industries to those with more promise. With the company’s cash hoard expected to top $200 billion by quarter-end, the Oracle of Omaha has immense flexibility to capitalize on opportunities.\n\nAlso, Berkshire Hathaway benefits from some key economic tailwinds. Its energy and utility operations provide steady cash flows, while its insurers are well-positioned in an environment of rising interest rates. And with the U.S. economy still expanding, the firm’s industrial and consumer businesses have a favorable backdrop.\n\nWhile Buffett’s advancing age may concern some investors, the iconic investor shows no signs of slowing down. He’s built a company that can endure for the long haul and has a succession plan in place. For those seeking a “set it and forget it” type of investment, Berkshire Hathaway remains a compelling choice.\n\nAmazon.com (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis e-commerce and cloud computing giant is riding several powerful megatrends that I believe position it extremely well for continued growth in the years ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst off, Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) investment in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic is already paying major dividends. Anthropic’s latest model, Claude 3.5, is outperforming OpenAI’s new GPT-4o on most benchmarks.\n\nSecondly, Amazon Web Services (AWS) continues to dominate the cloud infrastructure market with a 17% revenue jump. As more companies shift workloads to the cloud, including AI applications, AWS provides a strong and stable growth engine for Amazon.\n\nAmazon’s stock does trade at a steep premium, but I believe this is justified given the company’s tremendous growth prospects that extend far beyond e-commerce. Multiple analysts have raised price targets, with Jefferies seeing an 18%-plus upside.\n\nYes, Amazon is an expensive stock. But I think it’s worth paying up for a company with such a wide moat. Other “Magnificent 7” stocks have soared past their 2021 peaks, but AMZN trades around $199 compared to the $186 peak in 2021. Stocks to buy: AMZN EBIT Chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nTherefore, operating income should lead to more upside if they materialize as expected.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nDespite concerns about AI, Google’s search dominance remains rock solid. The latest data from Statista shows Google still commands over 82% of the global search market share. Bing barely made a dent. It makes sense that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has done so well, as Wall Street realizes the bear thesis has been wrong.\n\nGoogle now has its own powerful AI called Gemini that it’s integrating into Search. This should help expand the types of queries Google can handle and improve user satisfaction. Plus, YouTube has been making aggressive moves to boost ad revenue. It is the world’s second most visited site. And cracking down on ad blockers was a smart decision that will likely pay big dividends. Analysts seem to agree, with the majority rating Alphabet’s stock a strong buy.\n\nConsider these tailwinds, along with Google Cloud’s strong 28% growth and the company’s leadership in mobile with Android. Thus, the future looks very bright for Alphabet. The stock has already surged 36% year-to-date (YTD), but I wouldn’t be surprised to see it go much higher as these AI investments and YouTube changes bear fruit.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) continues to ride the megatrend of the global shift from cash to digital payments, which has years of runway ahead. The company delivered another strong quarter, with revenue up 10% and EPS growing 20%. Key business drivers like payments volume, cross-border transactions and processed transactions all showed relative stability and growth.\n\nI’m optimistic about Visa’s future prospects. The pandemic accelerated the war on cash, and much of that behavior change has persisted even as economies reopened. Visa is well-positioned to capture the $20+ trillion opportunity to convert cash, checks and domestic network transactions to its network, especially in emerging markets. Contactless payments, e-commerce and value-added services provide additional levers for growth.\n\nAnalysts remain bullish on the stock, with 19 buy ratings and a $317 average price target, implying 19% upside. Visa benefits from powerful network effects. The more merchants that accept Visa, the more consumers want a Visa card, creating a virtuous cycle. This has enabled remarkably consistent and profitable growth for a company of Visa’s immense scale.\n\nAdditionally, Visa’s business model can thrive in any economic environment. In a strong economy, payment volumes rise. When interest rates are high, Visa earns more on credit balances. However, in a weaker economy with low rates, consumers tend to borrow and transact more on credit, so Visa still wins. It’s a great way to gain exposure to the financial sector while sidestepping many of the risks.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock has had a rough start to 2024, down over 17% YTD amid broader market volatility. However, the recent weakness presents a compelling buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nMcDonald’s is benefiting from its affordable fast food, drive-thru convenience and digital ordering. The company’s scale advantages and strong brand allow it to weather economic downturns better than its peers.\n\nIn fact, McDonald’s tends to outperform during recessions as cash-strapped consumers trade down to lower-priced options. The company grew earnings by double-digits annually during the Great Recession. More recently, McDonald’s held up relatively well during the Covid-19 pandemic thanks to its drive-thru lanes and delivery partnerships. Its franchised restaurant count actually grew in 2020. MCD franchised restaurants chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nIf you’re looking for exposure to the restaurant industry, McDonald’s is the cream of the crop. Analysts seem to agree, with firms like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) recently reiterating their bullish ratings on the stock. While near-term headwinds remain, McDonald’s entrenched popularity and recession-resistant business model make it a compelling long haul. Don’t be surprised to see the Golden Arches shine bright once again.\n\nAntero Midstream (AM) a gas pipe with the sun going down in the background, natural\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAntero Midstream (NYSE:AM) is riding high on the tailwinds of a shifting global energy landscape. The company recently reported strong first-quarter 2024 results, with double-digit growth in EBITDA and free cash flow. Also, AM placed a new compressor station into service to support future throughput growth in the liquids-rich Marcellus Shale.\n\nFurther, Antero Midstream is well-positioned to benefit from Europe’s move away from Russian gas. The E.U. has dramatically reduced its reliance on Russia, with the U.S. emerging as its top liquified natural gas supplier. Even if the war were to end, I expect these sanctions to persist. Moreover, Europe will likely prioritize energy security even if sanctions are not in place. Additionally, natural gas prices have rebounded significantly.\n\nWith a 6.12% dividend yield, Antero Midstream should give you more than enough income. The stock has climbed nearly 28% over the past year, too.\n\nChubb (CB) Person holding cellphone with logo of Swiss insurance company Chubb Limited on screen in front of business webpage. CB stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nNotably, the insurance industry is one of the most consistent and stable sectors. And within this space, Chubb (NYSE:CB) is one of the best bets you can make. The company has been growing at an impressive clip. Over the past year alone, Chubb stock has climbed nearly 35%.\n\nIn Q1 of 2024, Chubb reported strong earnings, with core operating income up over 20% to $2.2 billion and EPS surging nearly 23%. Also, Chubb is smartly leaning into growth areas like cyber insurance and climate risk mitigation, which could eventually become major businesses. The profitability is solid due to its combined ratio of 86.5%. Within insurance, a combined ratio below 100% translates to an underwriting profit. CB combined ratio\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Chubb’s prospects. The stock has nearly a dozen buy ratings, and its average price target implies decent upside from current levels. Notably, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has built a multi-billion dollar stake in Chubb. All things considered, it is the best stock you can buy right now in the insurance industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 ‘Buy Now or Cry Later’ Stocks for Long-Term Wealth",
        "content": "Most investors are primarily concerned with building long-term wealth as opposed to capturing quick gains. Of course, those same investors would gladly reap short-term gains if they were reliable, but they aren’t. It remains incredibly difficult to identify stocks that will perform well over the short term. Yet, identifying stocks with the potential to create long-term wealth has proven easier.\n\nGiven time, companies with readily identifiable fundamental strengths tend to increase in value. These are the kinds of stocks you’re likely to find recommended by value investors such as Warren Buffett.\n\nInvesting in strong companies with durable competitive advantages is one of the best ways to build long-term wealth. These are the kind of companies that routinely maintain strong pricing advantages over the long term that create all kinds of beneficial internal economics. The companies discussed below certainly benefit from those factors and more, which is the reason to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) microsoft stock\n\nSource: Peteri / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best reasons to believe Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock will continue to create long-term wealth for investors is its forecast growth.\n\nMicrosoft reported just under $212 billion in sales in 2023. That figure is expected to approximately double by 2028. Given how successful the company has been in investing in artificial intelligence, it’s easy to see why Microsoft continues to be so loved.\n\nIt is one of the so-called hyperscaler companies looking to commoditize artificial intelligence. It is doing so by buying up massive quantities of AI chips and implementing them at its data centers.\n\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more and more a part of our lives Microsoft should become that much more valuable.\n\nThe strategy is highly logical and is part of a broader thinking that characterizes AI as the new digital gold. Outside of AI, Microsoft continues to be subsidized by the strength of its Office and Windows products. Microsoft has multiple ways to continue winning and creating long-term wealth.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image of an Amazon logo on a building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another strong choice for investors looking for stocks that will create long-term wealth. I believe many investors automatically discount Amazon and other similarly sized companies for the simple fact that they believe past growth is not replicable.\n\nAfter all, Amazon reported $574 billion in revenues in 2023. It’s therefore easy to presume growth will slow due to reaching such a massive scale. Yet, it’s possible that Amazon could reach $1 trillion in sales by 2028. It is predicted to come very close as it will grow by roughly 70% over that period.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat I particularly like about Amazon is the company’s substantial investment in Anthropic, for which it recently completed its $4 billion investment. I believe Amazon will benefit substantially from that investment as Anthropic is noted to take a slower, more pragmatic approach to AI development than rival OpenAI. That developmental approach is likely to yield better results in the enterprise space, which requires greater accuracy and where substantial revenues will flow from.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has long proven capable of creating long-term wealth. It is primarily an income-producing stock with much of its long-term wealth-creating ability coming from dividends. However, it also produces substantial share price gains as oil prices peak.\n\nWe now may be entering another such period as Brent crude surges past $86 per barrel. Analysts believe that it could peak above $90. Standard Chartered says the current supply deficit characterizing the third quarter will spill into the fourth quarter. That suggests Exxon Mobil will perform strongly throughout the remainder of 2024.\n\nAnd while investors should be able to capitalize on those supply shortfalls, there are other reasons to like ExxonMobil. Most investors will compare it to Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the other common Big Oil choice. But with a choice between the two, Exxon is better at creating more value than Chevron. The peak oil argument was overdone and companies like ExxonMobil continue to have the ability to create long-term wealth for investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 E-Commerce Stocks That Could Be the Next Amazon",
        "content": "I believe e-commerce stocks will continue their resurgence in the second half of 2024. The likely catalyst for this move will be interest rate cuts tied to falling inflation. If borrowers have just a little more wiggle room, it’s reasonable to expect that online shoppers will come back will full force and start buying in increasing volumes.\n\nHowever, buying the right e-commerce stocks is easier said than done. Companies in this sector have been on a rollercoaster ride in the post-pandemic world, especially if you move past the top e-commerce bets.\n\nThere are still some e-commerce stocks that have very high growth and are valued at attractive prices. I think such stocks could follow in the footsteps of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and dominate the e-commerce space in their respective regions. Here are three to look into.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is a leading e-commerce and fintech powerhouse in Latin America. The company just celebrated its 25th anniversary, and I believe it’s well-positioned for the next 25 years of growth.\n\nThe company’s latest earnings report certainly supports my bullish thesis. Revenue rose 42.7% year-over-year to a record $4.33 billion, crushing estimates by more than $466 million. Meanwhile, earnings per share of $6.78 trounced expectations by more than a dollar.\n\nWhat’s driving this phenomenal performance? CEO Martin de los Santos highlighted MercadoLibre’s thriving marketplace businesses in Brazil and Mexico, which both posted gross merchandize value (GMV) growth of around 30%, despite macro headwinds. Strategic investments in logistics infrastructure and well-executed marketing campaigns are clearly paying dividends. I believe the company’s e-commerce revenue will continue to grow at particularly high rates. e-commerce stocks: MELI commerce segment revenue\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nMercadolibre’s fintech division also shined, with total payment volume surging 133% to $1.9 billion on the back of 1.5 million new credit cards issued. While a weak Argentine peso remains a drag, the overall business looks very healthy to me.\n\nWith e-commerce and digital payments adoption still in the early innings across Latin America, I’m confident MercadoLibre can sustain this momentum. The stock may look pricey, but I believe the long-term upside for this e-commerce player is still huge.\n\nSea (SE) SEA Limited - Shopee app on mobile phone\n\nSource: Muh.Imron / Shutterstock.com\n\nSea (NYSE:SE), Singapore’s tech darling, posted another strong quarter. The stock has rebounded significantly, but the question is whether the company can maintain this momentum.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q1 2024, Shopee achieved record-high orders, GMV, and revenue, with gross orders surging 57% year-over-year. It’s clear that Shopee is capitalizing on the e-commerce boom in Southeast Asia, where it has become the go-to online shopping destination for millions of users.\n\nThe platform’s integrated logistics arm, SPX Express, delivered 70% of orders in Asia within three days. Increased logistics efficiency is driving down costs and boosting customer satisfaction.\n\nHowever, I can’t ignore the elephant in the room: rising competition. Shopee may be the market leader now, but rivals like Lazada and Tokopedia are nipping at its heels. There are also concerns about Sea’s ability to sustain its rapid growth and profitability as it expands into new markets.\n\nDespite these challenges, I remain optimistic about Sea’s prospects. With Garena and SeaMoney firing on all cylinders, and Shopee continuing to gain market share, Sea is well-positioned to ride the wave of digitalization in Southeast Asia. While there may be bumps in the road, I believe Sea has what it takes to become the next e-commerce giant. The stock has bounced back, surging nearly 90% year-to-date.\n\nKaspi.kz (KSPI) e-commerce stocks, Image of small shopping bags sitting in a shopping cart on a computer. Strong Buy E-Commerce Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nKaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) is a fintech powerhouse revolutionizing how Kazakhs bank, shop and pay through its sleek Super App. Its Super App also covers the e-commerce space.\n\nI’ve been closely watching Kaspi since its splashy $17.5 billion Nasdaq debut. The company features 14 million monthly users tapping into its mobile-first platform. Considering Kazakhstan’s population is less than 20 million, this innovator has clearly cracked the code on the digital-first fintech model. Digital payments in Kazakhstan are set to soar to $14.3 billion by 2028, and Kaspi is perfectly poised to ride this mega trend to new heights. Notably, the company’s margins are also stellar. Kaspi margins\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nHowever, KSPI stock has faced some turbulence, with a 7% sell-off after devastating floods hit Kazakhstan in April. Kaspi also faces some macro headwinds investors need to factor in. The Kazakh central bank aims to break the oligopoly of the two largest banks (including Kaspi) in the payments space with a new universal system next year.\n\nJPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) believes this cooldown is a buying opportunity, given Kaspi’s performance so far. The company continues to post strong results, with Q1 revenue jumping 40% year-over-year. Moreover, analysts remain overwhelmingly bullish, and I’m inclined to agree.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Announcing AWS App Studio, the Fastest and Easiest Way to Build Applications",
        "content": "New generative AI-powered service empowers a new set of builders to create applications in minutes\n\nNEW YORK, July 10, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--At AWS Summit New York, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced AWS App Studio, a generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered service that uses natural language to create enterprise-grade applications. A user simply describes the application they want, what they want it to do, and the data sources they want to integrate with, and in just minutes, App Studio builds an application that could have taken a professional developer days to build from scratch. Modifying App Studio applications is easy using its point-and-click interface, and users also get immediate guidance on how to accomplish a task by asking its generative AI-powered assistant. App Studio opens up application development to technical professionals without software development skills (such as IT project managers, data engineers, and enterprise architects), empowering them to quickly build internal applications that are secure and fully managed by AWS, eliminating the need for operational expertise. This allows users to focus on building applications that help solve business problems and increase productivity in their roles, while removing the heavy lifting of building and running applications. To learn more about AWS App Studio, visit aws.amazon.com/app-studio.\n\nEvery company has internal processes and activities that employees manage daily to keep their organization running. Hospital procurement teams track medical supplies to understand what is in stock and to order more when low; account executives at advertising agencies follow a specific workflow when designing, reviewing, and approving advertisements; and property managers monitor their housing inventory and repairs needed on rentals. These processes are time-consuming and often managed through spreadsheets and documents that are difficult to maintain, error prone, insecure, and tough to scale to multiple users. Employees are much more effective when they can use a custom application tailored to these problems, making it easier to enter information, manage complex processes, and connect to their trusted systems, like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Salesforce. Despite that, development resources to build custom applications are scarce, and as a result, many internal applications do not get built. That is why employees with technical experience turn to low-code tools to build applications themselves. These tools, however, come with their own challenges. Current low-code tools often have a steep learning curve, requiring platform-specific knowledge, and the applications users build often do not meet their company’s security requirements, leading to the information technology (IT) department shutting them down. These applications also struggle to scale as usage grows, forcing users to hand off hosting and running the application to their company’s development team. This leaves many employees stuck between low-code solutions that do not meet their needs or continuing to painstakingly manage these processes manually through spreadsheets and documents.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS App Studio is the fastest and easiest way for people with some technical experience to build the types of enterprise-grade applications that were previously only built by professional developers. App Studio’s generative AI-powered assistant eliminates the learning curve of typical low-code tools, accelerating the application creation process and simplifying common tasks like designing the user interface (UI), building workflows, and testing the application. For example, the user identifies the specific data sources at their company that the application should connect to, using a drop-down menu, and then writes a basic prompt such as, \"Create an app for tracking inventory across stores.\" App Studio generates an outline to verify the user’s intent and then builds an application with a multi-page UI, a data model, and business logic. The user can then ask clarifying questions such as, \"How can I display the ‘approve’ button only to reviewers?\" and App Studio gives detailed answers on how to make the change using the point-and-click interface. To test their application, a user simply clicks the \"generate data\" button to create sample data that will show how their application will handle information in real time. The user can also easily connect their application to internal data sources using built-in connectors for AWS (such as Amazon Aurora, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon S3) and Salesforce, along with hundreds of third-party services (such as HubSpot, Twilio, and Zendesk) using an application programming interface (API) connector. With App Studio, users do not have to think about the underlying code at all—App Studio handles all the deployment, operations, and maintenance. Once an application is ready to deploy, App Studio generates a custom URL that end users can access using existing enterprise authentication tools and role-based access controls.\n\n\"AWS App Studio opens up application development to an entirely new set of builders, helping them create enterprise-grade applications in minutes,\" said Dilip Kumar, vice president of Applications at AWS. \"Designed to meet the needs of the largest enterprise customers and fastest growing startups, App Studio is a force multiplier for technical employees at any company. Now, using natural language, any user with some technical experience can simply describe the application they want to build, and App Studio takes care of the development process, delivering an application that employees can start using immediately. It has never been easier for technical professionals to build custom applications tailored to the unique needs of their business, ushering in a new world of productivity for businesses of all sizes.\"\n\nEvery application deployed via App Studio is highly secure, scalable, and performant, freeing technical professionals to focus on innovating rather than application management. App Studio gives IT teams visibility into every application, so they can easily track usage patterns, control user and data access, and set guardrails to maintain compliance with a company’s security policies. It is free to build with App Studio, and customers only pay for the time employees spend using the published applications, saving up to 80% compared to other low-code offerings. App Studio is available in preview today in US West (Oregon).\n\nCampus Life & Style helps over 28,000 students across 50 locations find their room (and community) to call home for the school year. \"With App Studio, a team of two were able to build a complete application that streamlines data intake, management, and reporting for our 150-person team,\" said Scott Puntenney, national revenue manager at Campus Life & Style. \"Our market survey process gives us the data to determine the next locations to provide student housing, but this process is excruciatingly manual with more than 150 people involved in data collection, entry, and validation across multiple spreadsheets, forms, and dashboards. We expect that this data processing application will increase the efficiency of our market survey collection and distribution process by 20% and cut down on 98% of the human errors associated with manual data entry. We now plan to roll out App Studio to modernize our financial and HR data pipelines and use other AWS generative AI services to further improve how we manage our processes at scale.\"\n\nDeloitte is a leading provider of audit and assurance, consulting, financial advisory, risk advisory, tax, and related services. \"App Studio can help our technical employees build secure, scalable applications in minutes that streamline tasks and increase operational efficiency,\" said JB McGinnis, US AWS alliance leader at Deloitte Consulting LLP. \"As a global provider working with brands from all around the world across various industries, our teams need to operate across a diverse set of clients that all have distinct tasks and processes. With App Studio, our technical employees are able to take charge and easily go from idea to application in just a few sentences, streamlining these activities for the entire team. As teams grow and business goals change, App Studio applications can efficiently scale and shift to our employees’ needs, helping us better deliver for our clients.\"\n\nHealthVerity provides the largest ecosystem of healthcare and consumer data in the US to help build patient journeys and improve patient outcomes. \"App Studio opens up low-code tools to our company for the first time, allowing us to leverage our many existing AWS investments and empowering employees to build applications in minutes, instead of days, with the help of its generative AI-powered assistant,\" said Jeremy Stewart, vice president of engineering at HealthVerity. \"Historically, we built all of our internal tools from the ground up because existing low-code solutions did not meet our company’s strict security requirement. A small team of five developers had to manage this infrastructure on top of their day-to-day work, increasing our operational costs and taking them away from their core responsibilities. With App Studio, every application is secure and fully managed by AWS, freeing our employees to focus on customer-facing projects.\"\n\nLaunchDarkly enables high velocity teams to release, monitor, and optimize software in production. \"Combining an intuitive UI with a generative AI-powered assistant, App Studio helps bridge the skills gap so the technical employees most familiar with a business problem are empowered to solve it,\" said Claire Vo, chief product officer at LaunchDarkly. \"There are numerous processes that could be managed more efficiently with a custom application, and most businesses are not eager to add a specialized vendor and the associated costs. By lowering the barrier to creating an internal application, the technical employees best positioned to address these challenges can now rapidly solve them with a secure, scalable solution tailored to their problem.\"\n\nTrustPortal is a no-code, intelligent hyperautomation Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that delivers high-productivity services to contact center agents and customer self-service across all channels. \"With generative AI-powered guidance available throughout the development process, App Studio is a game changer for technical employees to create high-quality, visually attractive, and intuitive business applications,\" said Chris Lamberton, chief executive officer at TrustPortal. \"We work with some of today’s largest enterprises, so our developers have limited time to dedicate to build and run internal applications. App Studio helps remove the cost and complexity of developing and operating our own internal tools, giving developers more time to innovate on behalf of customers.\"\n\nAbout Amazon Web Services\n\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud. AWS has been continually expanding its services to support virtually any workload, and it now has more than 240 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, media, and application development, deployment, and management from 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic regions, with announced plans for 21 more Availability Zones and seven more AWS Regions in Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. Millions of customers—including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—trust AWS to power their infrastructure, become more agile, and lower costs.

        "content": "By Greg Bensinger\n\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com announced a series of largely incremental refinements on Wednesday to several of its artificial intelligence products as it seeks to keep rivals at bay amid a continued investor frenzy over the technology.\n\nThe retailer has sought to counter a perception that competitors Google, Microsoft and OpenAI have taken a lead in developing generative AI, which can respond almost instantaneously with full sentences or pictures to complicated prompts or queries.\n\nThe improvements Amazon announced at its conference in New York include adding additional memory to so-called agents that automate work for businesses, so that each new request can build on prior ones, said Vasi Philomin, Amazon's vice president of generative AI.\n\n\"This allows agents to provide more personalized and more seamless experiences, especially for complicated tasks,\" said Philomin in an interview Tuesday.\n\nHe said, for instance, that the updated AI agents could remember for each subsequent request that a user prefers aisle or window seats on a flight, which was not previously possible.\n\nAs well Amazon said it updated the Q chatbot it announced last November to make improved suggestions for writing software code, addressing one of the more popular uses for generative AI.\n\nAmazon also said it made improvements to help customers of its Bedrock service, which lets businesses create applications with a range of AI models, to detect and filter out so-called hallucinations -- when AI creates answers to questions or requests that may be wrong or misleading.\n\nHallucinations have been a nagging problem in AI systems because they breed mistrust among users. Google, for instance, was criticized earlier this year for an AI-powered search feature that, among other things, recommended users add glue to pizza sauce to ensure cheese sticks to it.\n\nThe new controls will help reduce the occurrence of hallucinations by about 75% for certain uses, Matt Wood, vice president of AI products at Amazon Web Services, said in an interview.\n\nAWS, which oversees much of Amazon's AI development, is on a pace to reach $100 billion in annual revenue, the company said in April.\n\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger; Editing by Michael Perry)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Do June's Results Show REITs Are On The Way Up?",
        "content": "Do June's Results Show REITs Are On The Way Up?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nWill the potential for lower interest rates might lead to a better second half the year for real estate investment trusts (REITs). Equity REITs are already showing signs of increasing strength, and one sector is looking better than ever.\n\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nThe FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs Index for June was up by 2.2%. While this is encouraging, it's important to note that REITs are still underperforming the broader market. The Nasdaq continued to shine with a return of 6%, while the S&P 500 was up 3.6%, and the Russell 1000 was up 3.3%. However, REITs did outperform the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which inched up 1.2%. Taking the longer view, the index shows that REITs are down 2.2% for the year so far.\n\nSectors To Watch\n\nREIT performance varies widely by sector. So far this year, industrial REITs, which had an impressive 19.2% total return last year, are down by 12.8%. Industrial REITs have enjoyed rising rents and demand for the past several years as many companies adjusted to the global shipping crisis by either storing more goods locally or bringing manufacturing closer to home.\n\nThe slowing of this trend may be temporary bad news for large industrial REITs like Prologis (NYSE:PLD), which lowered its occupancy guidance from 96.5%-97.5% to 95.8%-96.8% for the full year. Those are still strong numbers, but they do indicate that we may see a period of weakness as oversupply becomes a concern in the short term. Founded in 1983, Prologis operates over 1.2 billion square feet of space in 19 countries and counts Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as its top customer. Prologis has seen its price fall by nearly 15% year to date as it waits for the market to absorb industrial warehouse supply. However, its 3.3% dividend yield should reward patient investors holding the stock.\n\nA thriving sector currently includes residential REITs driven by apartment REITs. So far this year, the total return for residential REITs was up 5.8% in June and the apartment REITs were up 6.7%. For the year, residential REIT total returns grew by 7.9% and apartment REITs rose by 12.3%. One major tail wind here is the ongoing pressure on the housing market. With existing home prices up 5.8% in May and inventory remaining below historic levels at a 3.7 months supply, many people are still opting to rent instead of buy.\n\nThis may be good news for apartment REITs like Camden Property Trust (NYSE:CPT), which operates 171 apartment communities and has over 58,000 units with a high concentration in the desirable Sunbelt region. Camden has an average occupancy rate of 95%. On its most recent earnings call, the company indicated a slight slowdown in turnovers from 36% to 34%. One problem facing multifamily operators is that while rents have risen dramatically over the past several years, they have fallen by as much as 21% in some areas. The challenge for apartment REITs will be balancing rent increases and occupancy rates. Camden's price has risen around 7% this year and has a healthy 3.8% dividend yield.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon’t Miss: Finance companies are leaving New York for this hot city. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nWhen The Rate Cuts Come\n\nThe market is starting to consider the timing of interest rate cuts. This may be a double-edged sword for some REITs, especially those in the apartment sector. For office REITs struggling with heavy debt, this may present a window of opportunity for refinancing.\n\nIf debt becomes more affordable, some REITs may take advantage of better terms and acquire properties. This could spark greater overall liquidity within commercial real estate. For the first quarter of 2024, commercial real estate transactions continued to plummet, hitting the lowest rate since 2013. With the market looking forward to at least one rate cut, perhaps as soon as September, now is an interesting time to watch REITs.  With an earnings season between now and then as well as plenty of economic data to consider, it's important to remember that there are many factors that may contribute to the returns on individual REITs.\n\nCheck Out Some of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\n\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\n\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over a 2-year period starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

        "title": "3 Millionaire-Maker Growth Stocks to Buy Now: July Edition",
        "content": "The search for millionaire-maker growth stocks is a never-ending one. But finding companies that are poised to make significant moves higher isn’t an easy task. Finding the “next big thing” may be more difficult than locating companies that have previously provided outsized returns. The three companies on this list can certainly be put in such a category, with market-beating growth rates driving previous surges that have certainly minted their fair share of millionaires.\n\nOf course, the question is whether new millionaires will be minted in the future. Much of that outcome depends on the continuation of the bull market, and whether these companies can continue to grow at market-beating rates. In this regard, there’s always plenty of uncertainty, and that uncertainty is what makes markets.\n\nBut for those who believe this bull rally can continue, here are three millionaire-maker growth stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) amazon (AMZN) sign with dark background\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nA reputable player in the e-commerce sector, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) remains among the millionaire-maker growth stocks. The company’s core business model is one that not only produces strong cash flows, but allows Amazon to reinvest in its higher-margin AWS business, which Amazon is bolstering with the addition of various AI integrations.\n\nNotably, Amazon has emerged as a leading AI innovator on Wall Street. With investments in Anthropic totaling $4 billion, including $2.75 billion in March, Amazon has enhanced its AI capabilities through tools like Amazon Q, Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker in Amazon Web Services (AWS). The introduction of Claude 3.5 Sonnet to Amazon Bedrock marks a significant advancement, doubling efficiency and reducing costs, while empowering complex tasks such as creative content generation, data understanding and advanced coding.\n\nWith strong profitability and recent net sales of $143.4 billion, Amazon remains a leading force in AI innovation, making it a compelling investment choice for investors today. For those thinking long-term, this is a company with operating leverage like few companies out there, making its high-touch business model one to behold.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify (SHOP) logo on a smartphone which is next to a miniature shopping cart and miniature cardboard boxes\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother e-commerce giant on this list is Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). The Canada-based provider of e-commerce platform solutions for small- and medium-sized enterprises looking to set up online shops, Shopify has ridden the wave of e-commerce growth higher during previous cycles.\n\nOf course, the pandemic growth we saw in Shopify is over. The company’s very difficult comps led to slowing growth rates relative to what was seen in 2021 and 2022. But with a strong Q1 earnings report, Shopify’s future growth trajectory may be more bullish than many think. While the company posted a loss (attributed to the sale of the company’s logistics business), its focus on its core high-margin business should propel new money into the stock as its top-line growth rate accelerates over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company expects this to be the case, increasing its revenue forecast for Q2. A recent partnership with Target (NYSE:TGT) to will boost Q2 revenue, expanding its third-party online marketplace and enhancing the company’s reach among larger companies as well. Relying on the continuation of the e-commerce trend, this stock is well-positioned to ride the growth wave higher.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) Flags of Coinbase and NYSE flying in the wind.\n\nSource: rarrarorro / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoinbase’s (NASDAQ:COIN) stock has traded sideways recently amid Bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) recent consolidation. That’s expected, as the company’s transaction fee based business model for its centralized exchange relies on trading volumes. These trading volumes typically tend to be higher during bullish periods in the crypto sector.\n\nWith the expected improvement of crypto prices, COIN appears to have found some footing. And at a forward price-earnings ratio of around 30-times, this is a stock that’s certainly not overly expensive.\n\nAmong the notable partnerships Coinbase has seen for its custody and trading services is a deal with the U.S. Marshals Service to use Coinbase Prime to manage and trade its high-value “Class 1” digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH-USD). This deal denotes a significant step forward in how major U.S. institutions think about cryptocurrency handling. Coinbase has robust, large-scale institutional cryptocurrency services after a rigorous selection process.\n\nStrong growth and excellent performance in Coinbase Prime has led Coinbase’s institutional platform to set records in Q1 2024. Of course, plenty needs to go right in terms of the crypto market for any bull thesis to play out. But for now, Coinbase clearly remains among the top crypto stocks to buy. It offers an introduction for those looking for digital asset exposure during a period of declining interest rates and a potential new wave of interest in this space.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Warren Buffett has outperformed the S&P 500 for decades and has made his investors quite happy. Some investors opt to play it safe by investing in index funds, but others want to outperform the S&P 500 and Warren Buffett.\n\nWhile it’s no easy feat to outperform either of them, it is possible. Investors can start by looking at Warren Buffett’s portfolio in hopes of outperforming him. Every portfolio consists of stocks that perform better than others, and a closer look at any portfolio can highlight the winners. Narrowing down Buffett’s top performing investments and steering clear from less promising picks can lead to impressive long-term returns.\n\nHowever, you also want to avoid stocks that are overvalued. Some Warren Buffett stocks have performed well in recent years but also have lofty valuations. These are some of the most undervalued stocks in Warren Buffett’s portfolio that can benefit long-term investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) trades at a 19x P/E ratio and offers a 1.19% yield for its investors. Warren Buffett holds onto many credit card stocks, but American Express is the most undervalued pick of the bunch. It’s also been outperforming the S&P 500. Shares are up by 25% year-to-date and have jumped by 88% over the past five years.\n\nRising revenue and profit margins point to more gains for long-term investors. American Express reported 11% year-over-year revenue growth and 34% year-over-year net income growth in the first quarter. Those results translated into a 16.9% net profit margin.\n\nThe fintech firm is winning over younger generations which should result in elevated revenue and earnings for several years. American Express aims to generate 9% to 11% year-over-year revenue growth and EPS growth in the mid-teens beyond 2026. This Warren Buffett stock has catalysts, a competitive moat, good financials and a reasonable valuation.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently became a $2 trillion company as a 33% year-to-date ascent has brought the stock to new highs. Shares have also more than doubled over the past five years.\n\nThe tech giant is a core component of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. It’s a Magnificent Seven stock that continues to deliver solid financials. Revenue increased by 13% year-over-year in the first quarter while net income more than tripled year-over-year. Amazon’s online marketplace is generating most of the gains and exhibited double-digit growth rates in domestic and international markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon Web Services was also a winner in first quarter results. AWS sales increased by 17% year-over-year to reach $25.0 billion. Artificial intelligence tailwinds should help Amazon report accelerated growth for its cloud platform. Even without AI tailwinds, Amazon is still in a great position. Advertising, groceries and streaming are some of the company’s additional business segments that look promising in the long run.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) Illustration of phone with dollar sign and other graphics symbolizing fintech displayed on and around it, with a blue background.

Shares have soared by 58% year-to-date and have plenty of fans in Wall Street. The average price target suggests a 10% upside from current levels, and the stock is rated as a Strong Buy. The highest price target of $15.20 suggests that the stock can gain an additional 19%.\n\nThe digital bank continues to report impressive growth number that warrant the recent gains. Nu Holdings added 20.2 million customers year-over-year to reach 99.3 million customers at the end of the first quarter. Net income more than doubled year-over-year, surging from $141.8 million to $378.8 million.\n\nNu Holdings should continue to exhibit high growth rates as users stay active on the platform. The digital bank offers loans, credit cards, bank accounts, brokerage accounts and other financial products. The company’s suite of financial resources resulted in 69% year-over-year revenue growth and an 83% activity rate among its customers. That means 82.6 million of the company’s 99.3 million customers remain active on the platform.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in AMZN.

        "title": "As summer sizzles, US retailers try to move back-to-school shopping to July",
        "content": "By Arriana McLymore and Siddharth Cavale\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - While American children may wish summer vacation would never end, retailers want back-to-school season to start earlier than ever -- preferably now -- and are timing promotions ahead of Amazon's Prime Day.\n\nWith deals on sneakers, computers, kids' clothing and backpacks, Walmart, Target and Shein hope to entice parents to start back-to-school shopping and capture dollars that might otherwise go to Amazon, which holds Prime Day on July 16 and 17.\n\nAlthough in many communities school does not resume until late August or September, the campaigns are launching this week and next, on average two days earlier than in prior years.\n\n\"Retailers are looking to grow market share,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"It's not good enough to have bigger discounts. You need them earlier than your rivals.\"\n\nTarget launched a week-long event on Sunday, two days earlier than last year, offering 30% off on school uniforms and backpacks, including from its in-house brand Cat & Jack. Walmart is holding its “largest deals event ever” from Tuesday to Thursday, also two days earlier than last year.\n\nShein is holding a seven-week back-to-school sale starting July 15, two days ahead of its sale last year and a day ahead of Amazon Prime Day. Bytedance's TikTok Shop is running a deals event from Tuesday to July 17.\n\nBrian McCarthy, a retail strategy consultant at Deloitte Consulting, said the firm last year saw more families plan to spend the majority of their back-to-school budgets by the end of the July.\n\nJewelia Stanley, 32 of Tampa, Florida, expects to spend $1,200, at least $300 more than last year, on back-to-school items for her three kids, including clothes from China-based retailers Shein and Pinduoduo's Temu, uniforms from Walmart and supplies from Amazon.\n\nStanley's priciest purchase will be shoes from brands like Nike or New Balance, which can cost $99 to $250 a pair.\n\nBack-to-school spending last year was an estimated $41.5 billion, a record, for children in kindergarten to 12th grade. The number grew to $135.5 billion when college students were included, according to the National Retail Federation.\n\nPrime Day, Amazon's summer extravaganza, spans two days. Continuing to keep competitors on their toes, the company pushed the event back five days from last year. But Amazon also released early Prime Day deals on Tuesday for Sony speakers, T-shirts, phone cases and other merchandise.\n\nWhen it launched a decade ago, Prime Day reshaped a traditionally slow time of year for retailers. Sales boomed and competitors had little choice but to follow suit.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, Amazon had its biggest single day of sales in company history on the first day of Prime Day. U.S. online sales across retailers during the event hit $12.7 billion.\n\nPrime Day draws shoppers hunting for all kinds of deals, not just on notebooks and lunch boxes. The event is estimated to generate 1% to 2% of Amazon's full year net sales, which were in $574.8 billion in 2023.\n\nThe earlier and earlier start to back-to-school promotions has precedent in a similar strategy by Walmart and Amazon ahead of holidays. They launched year-end promotions in October last year, well ahead of Black Friday and Christmas.\n\nShoppers last year bought 375 million individual items during Amazon's Prime Day. \"Our members are looking for savings,\" said Jamil Ghani, worldwide vice president of Amazon Prime. \"The economic situation of the last five years has been tough, and everybody is looking to stretch their dollars further.\"\n\n(Reporting by Arriana McLymore and Siddharth Cavale in New York City; Additional reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bangalore; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon Stock Is a Buy as Luxury Retail Play Promises Prime Profits",
        "content": "Yea or nay to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock after it was announced July 3 that it and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) would take minority stakes in Saks Global, the name of the company paying $2.65 billion to acquire privately held Nieman Marcus.\n\nOn the surface, it seems odd that Amazon and Salesforce would be involved in this kind of acquisition. However, the Hudson’s Bay Co., the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, is trying To create an exceptional omnichannel experience like no other in the department store industry.\n\nAmazon and Salesforce have significant customer engagement experience that would be useful for growing the combined entities’ dormant sales. Further, who better to deliver omnichannel than Amazon, a logistics dynamo.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTogether, Saks Global will have 39 Saks Fifth Avenue stores, 36 Neiman Marcus stores, and two Bergdorf Goodman. In addition, both Saks and Neiman have outlet shops and online businesses. The head of Saks’ online business, Marc Metrick, is heading up Saks Global.\n\nI believe the deal makes sense for several reasons. Here are three reasons why.\n\nAmazon Gains Access to Luxury\n\nIf there’s one thing that Amazon doesn’t have in its e-commerce business is an abundance of luxury and that’s where the margins are in apparel retail, which could give Amazon stock a boost.\n\n“The involvement of Amazon ‘adds a bit of spice to an otherwise predictable deal,’ GlobalData analyst Neil Saunders wrote in a research note. Its stake makes sense, he said, ‘as it has ambitions to play more heavily in the luxury space and this would give it a toehold,’” Bloomberg reported the analyst’s comments about the deal.\n\nSince it acquired Whole Foods in 2017, Amazon’s done little in the way of expanding its place in physical retail. Being a part of this combination enables it to better understand the luxury retail market.\n\nHeck, maybe with a little time and understanding, Amazon could become the LVMH (OTCMKTS:LVMUY) of North America.\n\nEven if that’s not the company’s intention with this investment, it’s not beyond the realm of possibility. Far better to be the logistics champions for brands that have 70% gross margin than those with 20% or less.\n\nWhy Not Get a Bigger Piece of the Pie?\n\nAmazon likely could have stayed out of the investment side of the transaction and just focused on its logistics business helping the merged entities save money on their online fulfillment and store product distribution costs.\n\nThat would have netted it healthy fees. However, anything Amazon does, it does in a big way. It is not a consultant. It’s an owner of many billion-dollar businesses that work together to generate significant profits and cash flow.\n\nStory continues\n\n“‘How do you future-proof a brand like Saks or Neimans or Bergdorf? You do that through technology,’ Marc Metrick, chief executive officer of Saks Fifth Avenue’s online operations, said in an interview. That includes gathering high-quality data on customers, analyzing it effectively to offer them more personalized options online and improving logistics to make it easier for consumers to shop.” Bloomberg reported.\n\nIf this merger is approved by the Federal Trade Commission — and that’s up in the air given the agency’s penchant for blocking deals under the Biden administration — I could see Amazon buying the entire business once it’s better understood the opportunities that exist.\n\nBy taking a minority stake, Amazon gets a cheaper way to learn about luxury on the fly without taking a major bath to do so.\n\nA New Generator for Amazon Stock\n\nIn March 2018, I suggested Amazon would own more of your home sooner than you expected. The premise being that the Amazon Prime membership — 90 million U.S. members at the time — would drive great sales from each customer. Data showed that Prime members spent $1,300 annually, nearly double nonmembers.\n\nNow imagine if there could be Amazon Prime Luxury, a high-end membership that puts you in a league of your own when it comes to luxury in the home. Access to all these Saks/Nieman customers would get the membership off to a running start.\n\nImagine how much an Amazon Prime Luxury member would spend each year? If I had to hazard a guess, I’d say $5,000 or more per year, a big step up from the regular prime member.\n\nIn the six years since my article, the number of U.S. prime members has doubled to 180 million. Based on a U.S. population of 337 million, approximately 53% of Americans have a Prime membership.\n\nImagine if only 5-10% of Americans could be Amazon Prime Luxury members. That would be some revenue and profit generator.\n\nThe Saks/Neiman investment is another reason to own Amazon stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nvidia Recently Completed a 10-for-1 Stock Split, and These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Members Look Ready to Follow in Its Footsteps",
        "content": "Although most investors are captivated by the long-term potential of artificial intelligence (AI), companies enacting stock splits are an equally hot trend on Wall Street.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows publicly traded companies an opportunity to cosmetically alter their share price and outstanding share count. It's superficial in the sense that stock splits don't affect a company's market valuation or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe two variations of stock splits are forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are purposely reducing their nominal share price to make it more affordable for everyday investors and/or their employees. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split is aimed at increasing a company's share price, often with the goal of meeting continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.\n\nAlthough some reverse-stock splits can be long-term winners, most investors tend to focus their attention on public companies conducting forward splits. High-flying stocks in need of a forward split are usually out-executing and out-innovating their competition.\n\nSince 2024 began, in the neighborhood of a dozen high-profile companies have announced and/or completed a stock split -- but none have garnered more attention than AI titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia was the most-anticipated stock split of 2024 on Wall Street\n\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) in January 1999, Nvidia has completed six forward splits. The latest was announced by the company's board on May 22 -- a 10-for-1 stock split -- with an effective date of June 7. At the snap of a finger, Nvidia's share price of more than $1,200 was adjusted to a little north of $120.\n\nThe reason Nvidia required its largest stock split since going public has everything to do with its AI dominance.\n\nSince the start of 2023, Nvidia's AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the undisputed standard in high-compute data centers. By some estimates, the company holds a virtual monopoly on the AI-GPUs that were shipped for use in enterprise data centers last year.\n\nOn top of being the preferred hardware provider for AI-accelerated data centers, demand for the company's H100 GPU has overwhelmed supply. Even with world-leading foundry services company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rapidly upping its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity for high-bandwidth memory packaging, Nvidia is nowhere close to meeting enterprise demand for its chips. As a result, it's been able to meaningfully increase the selling price of its GPUs, which has provided a hearty boost to its adjusted gross margin.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has plans to retain its first-mover advantages, as well. While most external competitors are playing catch-up to the H100, Nvidia is expected to release its next-generation AI-GPU architecture, known as Blackwell, later this year. Blackwell offers computational improvements in six areas, including quantum computing, generative AI solutions, and engineering simulation, to name a few. In June, CEO Jensen Huang teased the eventual rollout of its Rubin GPU architecture by 2026.\n\nNvidia's 10-for-1 stock split has laid a path for other fast-growing, market-leading businesses to follow. Interestingly enough, two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" might be next to answer the call. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTwo Magnificent Seven components appear ready to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks\n\nAs a quick refresher, the Magnificent Seven account for seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in America. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia have market valuations in excess of $3 trillion; Alphabet and Amazon are valued at north of $2 trillion; Meta is worth close to $1.4 trillion; and while Tesla is currently below $1 trillion, it's previously topped this psychological level.\n\nAmong Nvidia's six peers in the Magnificent Seven, two are primed to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven component that's long overdue for a stock split is the only member that's yet to ever complete one. I'm talking about social media colossus Meta Platforms. Shares of the company have risen by more than 1,300% since its debut in 2012, with the company's stock tipping the scales at roughly $540, as of the closing bell on July 5.\n\nThough Meta is among the basket of companies undeniably benefiting from the AI revolution, it would be well-insulated if the AI bubble were to burst at some point in the future. That's because nearly 98% of Meta's sales can be traced to advertising on its social media platforms.\n\nMeta is the parent company behind Facebook, the most-visited social platform globally, as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads. These are some of the world's most-downloaded social apps, and they collectively helped to attract 3.24 billion daily active users during the March-ended quarter. Businesses are well aware that no other social media company offers access to more eyeballs than Meta, which is what affords the company such exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nSomething else working in Meta's favor is its treasure trove of cash. As of March 31, Meta was sitting on more than $58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. To boot, it's also generated north of $76 billion in cash from its operations over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has the luxury of betting big on AI data centers, the metaverse, and augmented/virtual reality devices thanks to his company's immense cash-flow generation.\n\nWith Meta's stock well over $500 and the company's long-term growth prospects improving, its very first stock split would seem to be in the cards.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven member that looks ready to follow in Nvidia's footsteps and become Wall Street's newest stock-split stock is software and cloud juggernaut Microsoft.\n\nSince its March 1986 IPO, Microsoft has conducted nine forward splits. However, the last stock split it completed was back in February 2003! With the world's largest company by market cap closing the July 5 session at $467.56 per share, the ingredients are on the table for Microsoft to announce a stock split.\n\nThe beauty of Microsoft's operating model is that it relies on sizable margins from its legacy operations to fund its high-growth initiatives. Although iconic software segments like Windows and Office aren't growing like they once were, the exceptional moats and margins associated with these divisions provide Microsoft with plenty of cash to reinvest in the cloud and AI, or perhaps deploy when making acquisitions.\n\nThe bread-and-butter to Microsoft's future looks to be cloud infrastructure service platform Azure. While Microsoft has AI and cloud ties in other operating segments, Azure is consistently its fastest-growing segment -- 31% constant-currency sales growth in the fiscal third quarter (ended March 31). Azure ranks second to Amazon Web Services in global cloud infrastructure service market share.\n\nSimilar to Meta Platforms, Microsoft's balance sheet and cash-flow generation afford it the ability to take risks that few other companies can match. It closed out the fiscal third quarter with $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and has generated $110 billion in operating cash flow over the TTM period. This is what allowed Microsoft to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard last year for $68.7 billion in an all-cash deal.\n\nWhat better way for the world's largest public company to excite Wall Street and its shareholders than by being the next Magnificent Seven component to announce a stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Buying Up This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Instead",
        "content": "The mega-hype surrounding Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA)10-for-1 stock split and its brief stint as the most valuable company on the market is in the past, but Nvidia still might be the most closely followed stock in the investing community today.\n\nHowever, since it has gained nearly 700% over the past two years, some investors are concerned about how much higher it can go in the near term. Several billionaires have been pocketing some of their gains and using them to fund other investments that might have more near-term fuel.\n\nSome examples are Israel Englander of Millennium Management, who sold 2,409,326 shares of Nvidia in the 2024 first quarter, or 64% of his fund's position; Ken Griffin of Citadel, who sold 883,563 shares, or 43% of his position; and John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma, who sold 451,464 shares, or 77% of their position.\n\nInstead, all four billionaire investors bought a different artificial intelligence (AI) stock: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Englander bought 2,476,287 shares, or 34% more; Griffin added 4,673,930 shares, a 246% increase; and Overdeck and Siegel added 364,950 shares to their position, a 41% increase.\n\nShould investors follow their lead?\n\nAmazon might be the best AI stock to buy today\n\nNvidia and Amazon are both deeply invested in the generative AI revolution, but they run very different businesses and even work together. Nvidia makes the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power generative AI, which is the main reason its stock has skyrocketed over the past two years, while Amazon is developing applications to make generative AI work.\n\nAmazon has rolled out a competitive set of generative AI applications that help developers create powerful tools to make businesses run better. These are directed at Amazon Web Services (AWS) clients. This is Amazon's cloud computing segment, and it's the leading global provider of cloud services.\n\nSome tools include chatbots and virtual assistants that can take some of the load away from human customer-service agents, freeing up resources and leading to higher efficiency; code prompts for developers, who can use more time for creative processes instead of manual coding; and high-level data analytics that can help companies make faster, more accurate decisions.\n\nOf the many companies that are already using these tools, one example Amazon highlighted is DoorDash, which used AWS generative AI tools to build a self-service contact center for its delivery personnel.\n\nThis is an incredible opportunity for several reasons. As the largest cloud computing company in the world, Amazon stands to benefit from clients moving over to these tools, and it can also attract new clients to maintain and grow its lead. According to management, company spending on cloud tools is still a small percentage of total information-technology expense, leaving a wide gap that's ripe for the taking.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS is already on the upswing again after facing inflationary pressure. Sales increased 17% year over year in the 2024 first quarter, and management says trends are stabilizing after clients went through some cost-optimization.\n\nIt's not just AI\n\nAmazon uses AI throughout its operations, which it has been doing since well before AI became an investor buzzword.\n\nMachine learning and data analytics are at the root of Amazon's e-commerce business. They offer recommendations for customers looking for a specific product, along with instant comparisons between similar products to help customers choose and convert higher sales. It also uses these kinds of tools in its vast delivery network to make instant calculations about the fastest and cheapest routes to get an order fulfilled.\n\nThe company is using the same infrastructure to build up its advertising business. There might not be any better platform for Amazon's third-party vendors to advertise their products than on its site, where hundreds of millions of Prime members and other shoppers are already looking for their products.\n\nThe company can send the right ads to the right shoppers with unmatched accuracy, increasing sales for vendors and Amazon, and increasing the success of its ad business.\n\nAmazon stock is a rock\n\nNvidia is still an excellent company with strong long-term growth drivers, but investors are worried that with a high valuation and increasing competition, it could have some of its growth priced in. Nvidia stock is already down slightly from its recent jump that resulted from its split.\n\nAmazon stock, on the other hand, is demonstrating strong and steady growth. It's up 32% this year but only 9% over the past three years -- in other words, it only recently surpassed its previous high, so you can still get in while it's climbing. The company has massive long-term opportunities, and investors can feel confident following billionaire investors into a position, or increasing a position, in Amazon stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) ended the recent trading session at $199.34, demonstrating a +0.03% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.07%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.13%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.14%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the online retailer had gained 6.54% over the past month, outpacing the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 2.94% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.34% in that time.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Amazon in its upcoming release. In that report, analysts expect Amazon to post earnings of $1.02 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 61.9%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $148.54 billion, indicating a 10.54% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.58 per share and revenue of $638.24 billion. These totals would mark changes of +57.93% and +11.04%, respectively, from last year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Amazon. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. As of now, Amazon holds a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nWith respect to valuation, Amazon is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 43.5. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 14.29 for its industry.\n\nIt's also important to note that AMZN currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.47. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Internet - Commerce industry held an average PEG ratio of 0.96.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 55, putting it in the top 22% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, had a net worth of $216.5 billion in 2024, making him the second richest person on the planet.\n\nIn 2023 alone, Bezos’s net worth increased by $70 billion, from $107 billion to $177 billion. This means he earned around $191.78 million per day or an incredible $7.99 million per hour. His wealth growth was largely driven by the value of Amazon stock, in which he owns around 9%.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAre you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. Warren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune — How much is that worth today? Many are surprised by Mark Cuban’s advice for lotto winners: Cash or annuity?\n\nTo picture just how much money he is earning, one only needs to look at this fact: Bezos makes in about 13 minutes what an average U.S. worker earns over their entire career. In 2023, the typical worker’s lifetime earnings were $1.7 million.\n\nBezos’s wealth isn’t just sitting in a bank. He’s invested in many different startups and new technologies through his venture capital firm, Bezos Expeditions. He also got in early with big names like Google, Uber, and Airbnb. Lately, he’s been investing money into artificial intelligence, neurotechnology, and biotech.\n\nAs is fitting for one of the world’s richest people, Bezos’s real estate portfolio is extensive and luxurious. He owns properties such as a $165 million estate in Beverly Hills and several high-end homes across the United States, including Washington, D.C., New York City, and Texas.\n\nHe also owns a superyacht named Koru, which is one of the most luxurious and impressive yachts in the world. The 417-foot-long yacht, built by the Dutch company Oceanco, was delivered in April 2023 and reportedly cost around $500 million to build.\n\nTrending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nAnother thing that cost him a pretty penny was a $42 million, 10,000-year clock designed to symbolize long-term thinking.\n\nOne of Jeff Bezos’s biggest projects is Blue Origin, his private space company. Blue Origin’s goal is to make space travel easier for more people. They plan to promote space tourism, send landers to the moon, and possibly even colonize space in the future.\n\nIn 2013, Bezos bought The Washington Post for $250 million. He has also invested in other cultural and entertainment ventures through Amazon, including streaming services and original content production.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, he has stepped up his charity work in recent years, even though some people think he doesn’t donate enough, given his wealth. He started the $2 billion Bezos Day One Fund to help homeless families and support preschool education. He also pledged $10 billion to the Bezos Earth Fund to fight climate change.\n\nTrending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nCriticism\n\nMany people criticize the former Amazon CEO for the company’s working conditions. Employees and critics agree that the company has low wages, stressful environments, not enough breaks, and lacks health care benefits for delivery drivers.\n\nThese issues came into the spotlight again when Bezos thanked Amazon employees and customers for funding his spaceflight, causing backlash from workers and public figures who pointed out Amazon’s tough working conditions and anti-union practices​.\n\nEven his focus on space exploration through his company, Blue Origin, wasn’t met without objection. He invests about $1 billion a year from selling his Amazon stock into Blue Origin, calling it his \"most important work.\"\n\nCritics believe he should use his wealth to address urgent issues on Earth, such as poverty, health care, and education. They compare him to other billionaires like Bill Gates, who spends billions on global health initiatives.\n\nRead Next:\n\nProperty taxes got you stressed?

        "title": "Amazon launches its fourth-generation Graviton4 chip as competition intensifies",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) Web Services (AWS) is launching its fourth-generation Graviton processor, the Graviton4 chip, the company shared exclusively with Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe new chip promises to deliver substantial improvements in performance and efficiency, including three times the compute power and memory of its predecessor, 75% more memory bandwidth, and 30% better performance, according to Rahul Kulkarni, Amazon’s lead product manager for artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\n“Collectively it's delivering more price performance, which means for every dollar spent, you get a lot more performance,” Kulkarni shared with Yahoo Finance at Amazon’s chips lab in Austin, Texas.\n\nDemand for chips is growing as semiconductors continue to play a vital role in the global economy, powering nearly everything we use. The industry is currently valued at $544 billion and is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2033, driven by increasing demand for AI.\n\nAs a result, hyperscalers such as Amazon, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) are creating custom chips to meet their specific needs, cut costs, and offer customers more affordable options.\n\n\"All of these companies are spending a lot of money on developing chips,\" said Patrick Moorhead, who spent over a decade as a vice president at AMD. \"They won't talk about how much they're investing, but they have these giant R&D budgets.\"\n\nNvidia (NVDA) remains the dominant player in the AI chips market, with more than 80% share of the market for graphics processing units (GPUs). But there is enough demand to support multiple competitors, according to Moorhead, who currently serves as CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.\n\nAlthough the Graviton4 chip is not an AI chip, it supports AWS's Inferentia and Trainium chips, which are focused on the technology. Trainium competes directly with Nvidia's AI chips, which are considered the fastest and most powerful in the market.\n\nHowever, AWS's goal is not to unseat Nvidia, Kulkarni emphasized. Instead, the cloud service provider hopes to offer a viable alternative for customers focused on price performance, which they hope will allow them to take a profitable slice of the rapidly expanding AI-driven chips market.\n\n\"Right now, if a customer is more focused on time to market, Nvidia-based products that we offer are a great option,\" Kulkarni said. \"There are customers for whom cost becomes a very prohibitive aspect of running their business. If they want to do more cost-optimized AI workloads like training or inference, then our Inferentia and Trainium products become a great alternative.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHow Amazon keeps development costs down\n\nIn addition to buying chips from makers like Nvidia, AMD (AMD), and Intel (INTC), Amazon also designs its own chips in-house. AWS currently offers two main types of chips: those designed for AI and those made for general purposes, like the Graviton4.\n\nIn a rare look at AWS's lab, Yahoo Finance saw AWS engineers solder and test chip designs, using software to look for performance issues and fix them on site.\n\nIt's one way the company says it drives down development costs.\n\n“We can tune the product, tune this silicon, to just focus on things that really matter for customer workloads,” said Kulkarni. Inside Amazon Web Services' chip-testing lab. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAWS has not disclosed specific pricing details for the Graviton4, but the processors are rented at $0.02845 per second of compute power. This price-performance ratio is crucial for AWS, as it uses its proprietary chips to power its cloud infrastructure and servers.\n\n\"AWS customers can use Graviton4 to cut their bill for IT in half,\" said Moorhead, who currently serves as CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.\n\nIt’s not just about providing chips to customers — AWS's chips strategy is also about using all of its chip offerings to power its own efforts, including a new large language model, a potential rival to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nMoorhead noted that while the development of chips is expensive, it can lead to substantial savings in the long run.\n\n\"Let's say you can save $200 a chip, and you're buying a million of them a year,\" Moorhead said. \"That adds up, and that's a lot of money that you can pour in to do that.\" Attendees walk through an expo hall at AWS re:Invent 2023, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, on Wednesday, Nov. 29, 2023, in Las Vegas. (Noah Berger/Amazon Web Services via AP Images) (AWS)\n\nFor investors, earnings expectations from chip development may impact company profits more than actual chip production. As AWS looks to carve out its niche by designing, testing, and validating its chips, analysts have noticed the company's growing influence in the semiconductor space.\n\nAnalyst earnings expectations are higher for Amazon than for Microsoft or Alphabet, and the profit margins for AWS alone reached 38% in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n\"AWS has a lot of credibility in the semiconductor space,\" Moorhead said. \"Ten years ago, I had questions about how a company like this could do chips when you have companies investing multiple billions of dollars to do that. But they are very good at it.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

Essentially, businesses from across multiple industries are migrating their data streams to online networks. This framework presents a powerful opportunity for forward-thinking market participants, boding well for top-tier cloud-computing stocks.\n\nThe projected numbers really tell the tale. According to Grand View Research, the global cloud-computing market reached a valuation of $602.31 billion last year. Between 2024 to 2030, experts believe that the sector could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.2%. By the forecast culmination point, the arena could be worth $2.39 trillion.\n\nThe message? Get onboard cloud-computing stocks or get left behind.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOf course, there’s no guarantee when it comes to this ecosystem or any other market segment. Not every brand will make it to the top echelon. Therefore, by diversifying your holdings across a range of ideas, you can better improve your odds. Below are compelling cloud-computing stocks to consider.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrankly, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) really needs no introduction to the field of cloud-computing stocks. Its Azure platform brings to the table a comprehensive suite of cloud services, covering infrastructural and software needs. One of the more distinct elements is that Azure seamlessly integrates with Microsoft’s enterprise software ecosystem, which also includes “fan” favorites like Office 365.\n\nPersonally, without Microsoft, I wouldn’t be able to do what I do. So, I admit a soft spot for the company. However, emotions can be completely set aside for investing in MSFT stock. Financially, it’s a consistent performer. In the past four quarters, the tech giant posted an average earnings per share of $2.82. In contrast, analysts were anticipating EPS of $2.64.\n\nIn the trailing 12 months (TTM), Microsoft posted EPS of $11.55 on sales of $236.58 billion. For fiscal 2024, covering experts believe that EPS may rise to $10.87 on revenue of $225.66 billion. Given the already robust performance, the estimate could be understated. Whatever the case, MSFT makes a strong argument for cloud-computing stocks to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother possibly slam-dunk idea for cloud-computing stocks, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is well known in the space for AWS or Amazon Web Services. It offers a wide range of cloud-computing services, including computing power, storage and databases. AWS is also one of the market leaders in cloud infrastructure, commanding a global network of data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, it’s a multi-variate opportunity, with Amazon also offering its mainline e-commerce business. It does so many things well, leading to an impressive financial print. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average EPS of 87.3 cents. However, analysts were only anticipating an average EPS of about 63 cents. Therefore, the earnings surprise came out to nearly 48%.\n\nIn the TTM period, Amazon generated EPS of $3.58 on sales of $590.74 billion. For the current year, experts project that EPS may rise to $4.19 on sales of $588.18 billion. That’s up 44.48% and 2.3%, respectively, against the prior year’s results. Moreover, in fiscal 2025, EPS could jump to $5.31 on revenue of $653.31 billion.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAnother rather obvious but compelling idea among cloud-computing stocks, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) brings plenty to the digitalization table. Fundamentally, the company owns the Google ecosystem, which provides infrastructure, platform services and also serverless computing. One of the core features of the offering is the expertise in data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nAlso, let’s be real here – Google practically owns the internet through its search engine. I know that other entities are trying to compete in this space but Google for now utterly dominates. Because of this dominance, the company managed to post an average EPS of $1.63 in the past four quarters. This handily beat out the average analysts’ estimate of $1.47. This print translated to an earnings surprise of almost 11%.\n\nIn the TTM period, Alphabet generated EPS of $6.52 on revenue of $318.15 billion. For fiscal 2024, covering experts believe that EPS could soar to $7.57 on sales of $346.78 billion. That comes out to a year-over-year performance of 30.52% and 12.8%, respectively.\n\nWorkday (WDAY) Workday Layoffs. A close-up view of a Workday (WDAY Stock) sign in Pleasanton, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the intriguing ideas among cloud-computing stocks, Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) offers cloud-based software for human capital management. It also brings to the table financial management solutions. One of the core reasons why enterprise-level clients choose Workday is the underlying user-friendly interface. As well, the company effortlessly integrates HR and financial functionalities.\n\nWith the Covid-19 crisis imposing significant changes in the workforce, enterprises need to adjust. That’s where Workday could come in handy, making it a long-term idea for cloud-computing stocks. In the past four quarters, the company’s average EPS came out to almost $1.57. This easily beat out analysts’ average target of $1.43. Further, the earnings surprise landed at 9.7%.\n\nWhat’s interesting about WDAY stock is that it presently trades at 8.1X trailing-year sales. In the past year, this metric averaged 9.03X. Thus, some room for growth exists. Enticingly, analysts project that EPS could rise to $6.83 on sales of $8.37 billion. On a YOY basis, this translates to 17% and 15.4% up, respectively.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother intriguing idea for cloud-computing stocks to buy, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) provides cloud-based workflow automation software. Specifically, the company addresses needs that arise in information technology (IT) service management and enterprise operations. The company is distinct for its focus on IT efficiencies and workflow automation. Over the next several years, such acumen could be extraordinarily relevant for large enterprises.\n\nIndeed, with the global economy still somewhat unbalanced from the Covid-19 recovery, every bit of revenue and market share count. Attractively, ServiceNow is delivering the goods. In the past four quarters, the company’s EPS averaged $2.95. This beat out the consensus average view of $2.64. When it came to the earnings surprise, the figure stood at 12.5%.\n\nIn the TTM period, ServiceNow generated EPS of $9.36 on revenue of $9.48 billion. For the current fiscal year, covering experts anticipate a big jump in EPS to $13.52 on sales of $10.89 billion. When stacked on a YOY basis, this projected performance comes out to 25.42% and 21.4% up, respectively.\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in New York City, Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) falls under the application software segment. Primarily, the company operates as an observability and security platform for cloud applications. One of its distinct features is that the underlying offering integrates seamlessly across various cloud platforms. It also provides real-time visibility into application performance, providing enterprise clients with a key advantage.\n\nWhat makes DDOG so attractive to investors of cloud-computing stocks is that it moves beyond mere narratives. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average EPS of 45 cents. This beat out the expected EPS of 35.3 cents. Further, the earnings surprise landed at a very stout 27.9%. The individual performances were also consistent, with the lowest surprise being 25%.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Datadog posted net income of $115.28 million or 34 cents per share. Revenue in the period was $2.26 billion. For fiscal 2024, experts see a dip (about 4%) in EPS to $1.58. However, on the top line, revenue could rise to $2.61 billion. If so, that would translate to a 22.7% YOY growth rate.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) The Snowflake logo on a company office in Silicon Valley, California. (SNOW stock)\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Bozeman, Montana, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is one of the intriguing cloud-computing stocks as a possible discounted idea. Primarily, it offers a data cloud platform which enables customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful business insights, according to its corporate profile. That sounds great and all but SNOW stock has courted some volatility.\n\nSince the start of the year, SNOW has printed a large volume of red ink. Some of it is due to reduced IT spending in the sector. As well, a distracting data breach incident may have shaken confidence in the underlying enterprise. It’s important to note, though, that the breach is tied to Snowflake customers rather than Snowflake itself. Still, it’s not a good look.\n\nHowever, up until the quarter ended April 30, 2024, Snowflake earnings had been destroying analysts’ projections. What makes SNOW stock enticing is that it currently trades at 15.69X trailing-year sales. But in the past year, the market accepted a revenue multiple of nearly 22X.\n\nFor the current year, analysts are targeting revenue of $3.48 billion. That would be up 24.2% from the prior year’s tally of $2.81 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Top Cloud Computing Stocks for Future-Proof Investing",
        "content": "Cloud computing stocks will continue soaring as businesses go digital.\n\nThe profound shift toward cloud migration among global businesses makes it almost a no-brainer to bet on the best cloud computing stocks. Cloud computing is a boon for companies looking to replace costly in-house servers with more scalable, remote data center solutions.\n\nMoreover, as we look towards an AI-powered world, we expect cloud computing technology to continue growing rapidly. Advanced computing chips and robust servers are critical in powering the generative AI revolution, adding to the allure of cloud computing stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAccording to a recent Gartner study, 85% of organizations will adopt a cloud-first strategy by 2025. Therefore, reliance on cloud-native architectures will only become more important over time. With that in mind, here are three cloud computing stocks not only riding the AI wave but also flaunting superb fundamentals and experiencing rapid growth.\n\nCloud Computing Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud computing arm has evolved into the company’s biggest growth driver.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has established itself as a true juggernaut in its niche, commanding a 31% slice of the global cloud infrastructure market. What separates AWS is the diversity and depth of its offerings, which span storage, computing power, databases and more. Consequently, AWS’s sales have skyrocketed from $3.1 billion to an astonishing $90.76 billion over the past decade, representing a 2,820% increase.\n\nKicking off the first quarter (Q1) of the year, AMZN reported a stellar 13% jump in Q1 sales to $143.3 billion, with AWS leading the charge. The cloud segment’s revenues were up a spectacular 17% to reach $25 billion, comfortably outperforming the overall business’ growth. The trend will likely persist, especially as AWS zeroes in on AI-driven services as it looks to continue pouncing on the burgeoning demand for powerful cloud solutions.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure is the biggest needle-mover for Microsoft these days, much like AWS is for Amazon.\n\nAzure’s suite of cloud solutions, from virtual machines to AI tools, has become a smash hit among its clientele. Moreover, in recent quarters, Azure has been effectively closing the gap with AWS in the cloud computing race. In Q1, Azure’s market share surged to an all-time high of 25%, underscoring Microsoft’s leadership role in cloud computing.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe superb growth from Azure contributed significantly to MSFT’s fiscal third-quarter (Q3) performance. Revenues were up 17% year-over-year (YOY), reaching $61.9 billion. The impressive jump was mostly fueled by a 23% jump in revenue from Microsoft Cloud services, totaling $35.1 billion. Additionally, MSFT witnessed a spectacular improvement in its bottom-line, with net income and diluted earnings per share climbing 20%, to $21.9 billion and $2.94, respectively. Thus, these figures underscore Microsoft’s robust strategy and highlight Azure’s powerful impact on the evolving digital landscape.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has carved a unique niche in the cloud space through its specialized software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform for enterprise workflow management. Unlike traditional cloud infrastructure providers, ServiceNow helps streamline digital workflows across multiple IT management functions. This approach helps substantially boost efficiency while ensuring real-time visibility into IT operations.\n\nDue to the mission-critical nature of its service, the company has grown impressively over the years. In its most recent quarterly showing, ServiceNow posted a 24% YOY increase in sales, reaching $2.6 billion. Moreover, net income jumped to $707 million, while its diluted EPS hit $3.41.\n\nThe stickiness of its offerings is shown by its strong customer commitments, with over 8,100 customers and a 98% renewal rate. Nearly 2,000 of those customers boast annual contract values exceeding the $1 million mark. Moreover, during Q1, it clinched eight new deals, each above $8 million.\n\nFurthermore, it recently strengthened its alliance with Microsoft, layering generative AI capabilities into its platforms. This partnership melds ServiceNow’s Now Assist with Microsoft’s Copilot, improving user support while strengthening ServiceNow’s digital workflow prowess.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Avoiding Nvidia Causes Fundsmith Equity To Lag Behind Benchmark In First Half\n\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the subject of significant debate among investment managers, as highlighted by Terry Smith’s recent comments on his decision to avoid the tech giant.\n\nSmith’s global fund, Fundsmith Equity, lagged behind its benchmark in the first half of the year, missing out on the semiconductor manufacturer’s stock surge, the Financial Times reports.\n\nAlso Read: Analysts Boost Nvidia and AMD as AI Market Continues to Expand\n\nThe $32 billion (25 billion Sterling Pounds) Fundsmith Equity portfolio, which prioritizes growth stocks, holds stakes in major US tech companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nHowever, Smith opted out of investing in Nvidia, citing unpredictability in its future outlook.\n\nNvidia, briefly valued at over $3 trillion last month, alongside other tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta, and Apple, made up nearly 60% of the S&P 500’s 14% rise in the first half of the year.\n\nIn the six months ending June, Fundsmith Equity returned 9.3%, trailing the MSCI World Index’s 12.7% return in sterling terms.\n\nThe S&P 500 index saw a 17% return over the same period, driven significantly by Nvidia’s performance, which accounted for a quarter of the gain.\n\nPrice Actions: NVDA shares traded higher by 1.64% at $130.29 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Avoiding Nvidia Causes Fundsmith Equity To Lag Behind Benchmark In First Half originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Amazon’s AMZN shares have gained 31.2% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the Zacks Internet Commerce industry’s return of 22.4%. The e-commerce giant is riding on the solid momentum in its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).\r\n\r\nAWS is benefiting from the growing customer momentum across the world on the back of its strong cloud computing capabilities. Its strengthening cloud infrastructure in various emerging and developed nations is a major positive.\r\n\r\nThe company recently joined forces with the Australia government to build ‘Top Secret’ AWS Cloud (TS Cloud) for Australia’s defense and intelligence agencies. This initiative will allow agencies to host sensitive information securely, which, in turn, will help Australia improve the nation’s cyber capabilities and deepen security cooperation with the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Australia government plans to invest AU$2 billion ($1.3 billion) over the next decade in the new cloud system. Under the agreement, Amazon will construct three facilities in the country.\r\n\r\nTS Cloud will make the sharing of classified data between Australia’s National Intelligence Community and the Australian Defence Force seamless. It will also power the nation’s security with AI and machine learning.\r\n\r\nThe latest deal underscores AWS's global experience, security, performance and ability to dedicate thousands of engineers to a project.\r\n\r\nMoreover, AWS’s commitment to driving innovation, economic growth and digital transformation across Australia reaches a new height with this deal. Last year, it launched its second infrastructure region in Melbourne, Australia. Through the AWS Asia Pacific (Melbourne) region, AWS strives to invest $4.5 billion by 2037 and support 2,500 full-time jobs annually.\n\nYear-to-Date Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExpanding Asia Pacific (APAC) Presence Aids Prospects\n\nAWS has strengthened its footprint in the APAC region on the back of the latest deal.\r\n\r\nPer a Research and Markets report, the cloud market in the APAC region is expected to witness a CAGR of 15.1% between 2023 and 2030. Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service and Software-as-a-Service are gaining strong momentum in APAC.\r\n\r\nAmazon is well-poised to capitalize on this growth opportunity on the back of its expanding APAC footprint.\r\n\r\nAWS recently announced plans to launch an AWS infrastructure region in Taiwan by early 2025. The region will be known as the AWS Asia Pacific (Taipei) Region.\r\n\r\nThe cloud giant is also gearing up to launch an infrastructure region in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2026.\r\n\r\nAWS plans to launch an infrastructure region in Malaysia, in which it strives to invest $6 billion by 2037 and support job creation in the country.\r\n\r\nIt intends to pump in 2.26 trillion yen ($15.24 billion) in Japan by 2027. With this investment, AWS strives to boost its cloud infrastructure across the country, especially in Tokyo and Osaka.\r\n\r\nAWS plans to open a region in Bangkok, Thailand, and set up an infrastructure region in Auckland, New Zealand, comprising three availability zones.\r\n\r\nThe launch of an infrastructure region in Israel, located in Tel Aviv, namely, AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region, is another positive.\r\n\r\nExpanding presence in the promising APAC region is expected to aid the performance of AWS, which, in turn, will drive Amazon’s overall performance in the long run.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $638.24 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 11%. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 0.9% to $4.58 per share over the past 60 days. The figure indicates year-over-year growth of 57.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAggressive Efforts Aid Competitive Prowess\n\nAmazon, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is expected to remain at the top of the competition graph on the back of aggressive expansion efforts in APAC. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s peers like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Alibaba BABA are also leaving no stone unturned to expand their presence, given the booming scenario in APAC.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s Azure is gearing up for the opening of five data centers in APAC, namely South-Central India, Indonesia Central, Malaysia West, New Zealand North and Taiwan North, which will be located in Hyderabad, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Auckland and Taipei, respectively.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Azure also plans to launch a Saudi Arabia Central region.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Alphabet’s Google launched a data center in Japan in 2023, marking its third such establishment in Asia. The facility is located in Inzai, Chiba. Google’s opening of a data center in Singapore is also noteworthy.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s opening of cloud regions in India’s New Delhi and Australia’s Melbourne last year is an uptrend. The search giant’s opening of cloud regions located in Doha, Qatar, and Dammam, Saudi Arabia, is another positive.\r\n\r\nAlibaba is hugely investing in expanding its presence in the cloud market of the underlined region. In regard to APAC, the company has data centers located in Singapore, Australia, Philippines, India, Thailand, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and Indonesia.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmazon’s strength in AWS, which is riding on expanding clientele, strong partner base and growing global presence, is expected to boost its long-term prospects. Its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives.\r\n\r\nAmazon currently has a Value Score of B, which makes it an attractive pick for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Markets might feel unstoppable, but it's important not to get complacent.\n\n\"There's definitely some level of froth [in markets],\" Fed Watch Advisors founder Ben Emons told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen here). \"There's a lot of liquidity in the market. You see speculation through these meme stocks — so that's happening.\"\n\nEmons suggests investors use this moment to reduce concentration risk in your portfolio, or take some profits in a stock that has surged this year and as a result is weighted too heavily.\n\nThe S&P 500 hit 35 record closing highs on Monday. From a trailing price-to-earnings (PE) ratio perspective, the S&P 500 is trading at 28 times compared to a historical mean of about 15 times.\n\nThe “Buffett Indicator” as it’s called in Wall Street circles — which takes the Wilshire 5000 Index (viewed as the total stock market) and divides it by the annual U.S. GDP — is now at a record high.\n\nWarren Buffett's favorite indicator stands at about 196.2% — up sharply from 137% or so from September 2022 lows.\n\nThe figure is well above the 159.2% seen just before the dot-com bubble.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of Apple (AAPL) have gained a cool 30% since April, allowing it to take back the mantle as world's most valuable company ($3.55 trillion market cap) from chip beast Nvidia (NVDA) ($3.15 trillion market cap).\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT), Apple, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are all trading at record high valuations. The top 10 companies in the S&P 500 make up 35% of the market cap but only 23% of earnings, according to data from Apollo (the parent company of Yahoo Finance) chief economist Torsten Slok.\n\nSeemingly everywhere one looks, the market is beginning to feel too hot, given the near-term risks such as a contentious presidential election cycle. The outlook for interest rate policy from the Fed also remains uncertain, and corporate earnings are only seen rising by a single-digit percentage in the second quarter.\n\nPros are beginning to line up on the other side of the trade amid those risks, and are calling for a swift and steep pullback.\n\nMorgan Stanley's top strategist Mike Wilson warned this week of a 10% pullback in stocks ahead of the election. Wilson is among the experts on the worried about current stock valuations.\n\nAnd Nvidia's stock caught a rare downgrade to neutral by New Street Research on valuation concerns.\n\nWhile there is no proverbial crystal ball on markets or individual stocks, Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods said on Opening Bid that 10% pullbacks happen once a year on average.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We had a 14% pullback last year,” reminded Woods.\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled, market-focused conversations and chats with the biggest names in business on Opening Bid.

        "title": "3 Solar Stocks Best Positioned to Benefit From AI",
        "content": "Solar stocks have been relatively hard hit due to the ongoing quantitative tightening that is resulted from high inflation. While the sector has suffered as the economy tackles inflation, a silver lining appears to be emerging.\n\nThat silver lining comes in the form of artificial intelligence. AI seems to be the answer to every problem these days. AI is the answer to the sector’s current woes because it is driving demand for solar-generated energy.\n\nHyperscaler firms operating data centers are largely responsible for much of the increased demand for AI chips. Those same firms are consuming increasing amounts of energy in building out AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, those firms have also pledged greater environmental responsibility through reduced carbon footprints. You can see the problem: They’re consuming more energy because of AI but they need to figure out a way to consume less and keep their promise.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSolar energy has emerged as a viable solution. It is now expected that data centers and other energy-intensive AI applications will increasingly rely on solar power energy. That again made solar stocks a subsector to pay attention to.\n\nSunnova (NOVA) Clean energy stocks: Rows of solar panels are lined up around a center aisle.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSunnova (NYSE:NOVA) is an excellent example of a stock that has faced a lot of trouble due to rate cuts but suddenly looks much stronger.\n\nThe company paid $371.94 million in interest expenses during 2023. The company paid slightly more than $107 million the year before that which was essentially on par with what the company had been paying for the past few years. It was a clear indication of just how drastically the rate hikes affect individual companies.\n\nLosses increased dramatically and Sunnova suddenly became a much less desirable investment. However, at the same time, Sunnova didn’t suffer from a lack of demand in 2023. Quite the opposite was true. Revenues grew by more than 29%, reaching $720.65 million.\n\nNow Sunnova is in a position to benefit from the AI opportunity. Furthermore, rate cuts are expected later in 2024. The combination of those factors makes it a stock to consider for investors interested in the narrative I’ve laid out.\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) Person holding smartphone with logo of US renewable energy company First Solar Inc. (FSLR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is the stock that has largely been shielded from recent turmoil affecting the solar industry. Favorable government policies have protected solar energy producers at the utility-scale. Government subsidies have certainly favored First Solar in that regard. Furthermore, the company continues to benefit from government protections that shield domestic producers from Chinese competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat isn’t to say that First Solar hasn’t suffered over the last year. The company had been flat to down over the past 12 months until this idea of AI benefiting the solar industry began to emerge. It was roughly 5 weeks ago that the notion of rising solar power demand related to data centers began to emerge at large.\n\nAnalysts suddenly dubbed First Solar an AI play citing carbon neutrality pledges from hyperscalers including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) among others. Microsoft’s carbon emissions were 29% higher in 2023 than they were in 2020. That increase was primarily attributable to data center activity related to the training of AI models.\n\nArray Technologies (ARRY) An image of the outline of a battery reflecting a blue sky with light clouds.\n\nSource: petrmalinak/ShutterStock.com\n\nArray Technologies (NASDAQ:ARRY) released its first-quarter earnings report on May 9. That was a few weeks before the notion of AI benefiting solar stocks had emerged.\n\nAs noted in this article, It’s a catalyst that promises to send solar stocks much higher in 2024. Interestingly, in that earnings report, Array Technologies noted that its revenue guidance is loaded toward the back half of 2024. It makes me wonder if Array Technologies was already seeing some indication at that point of increasing demand.\n\nThe company could use it because although the $153 million in revenues the company recorded in the first quarter was ahead of guidance, it was far less than the $375 million in sales the company recorded a year earlier.\n\nThe company also booked $1.8 billion of new business over the past four quarters bringing its total backlog to $2.1 billion. I believe the ground-mounted tracking systems that Array Technologies sells will be in high demand as companies scramble to build more PV installations to satisfy the increasing solar demand brought on by AI.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "35% of the S&amp;P 500 Is Concentrated in the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Here's What That Means for Your Portfolio.",
        "content": "Mega-cap growth stocks continue to dominate the broader market and contribute the bulk of gains in the major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. But the sheer value of some of the largest companies might surprise you.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a term coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe seven industry-leading tech-focused companies: Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nThese seven companies are now so valuable that they make up a combined 35.5% of the S&P 500. Here's what these changing market dynamics mean for the stock market and how to position your portfolio in a way that matches your risk tolerance and helps you achieve your investment objectives. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA double-edged sword\n\nThe S&P 500 is up over 44% since the end of 2022. The primary reason is that the sectors containing Magnificent Seven stocks are outperforming the S&P 500 as a whole, while the other eight sectors are underperforming. ^IXT Chart\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia are in the tech sector. Alphabet and Meta Platforms lead the communications sector. And Amazon and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector.\n\nLarge stocks can move the market when they put up monster gains, especially if you factor in sizable companies that fall outside the Magnificent Seven -- such as Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), which is now valued at more than $800 billion  and is up more than threefold since the end of 2022. MSFT Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are so valuable that they can single-handedly spark a so-called correction in the S&P 500. A correction is a fall of 10% to 20% in a major market index, so an average decline of 28% in the Magnificent Seven would put the S&P 500 in correction territory. That math doesn't even factor in sizable stocks like Broadcom that would likely fall in lockstep with a major sell-off in Nvidia and other tech stocks.\n\nIn this vein, the Magnificent Seven's influence extends beyond their weight in the S&P 500. The group has been driving monster gains in the index during the past 18 months or so, but the larger it becomes, the more vulnerable the market will be to a growth-driven sell-off.\n\nExpectations are high\n\nNo matter your investment time horizon or risk tolerance, it's important to be aware of the S&P 500's composition, especially when it undergoes a significant makeover. The index changes based on the economy's evolution and investor sentiment. In other words, it's a moving target, or benchmark, driven by different themes at different times.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome investors might be nervous about the market's relatively expensive price tag, with the S&P 500's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sitting at almost 29. Even if the market rally is overextended, putting new capital to work -- even at record highs -- has historically been a winning strategy for investors.\n\nThere's also a case to be made that the market deserves to be more expensive. If the S&P 500 grows earnings faster because the weighting of growth stocks increases, then it would stand to reason the P/E ratio should be higher as well.\n\nInvesting is more about where a company is headed than where it is today. And so far, mega-cap growth stocks have mostly delivered on earnings growth. For example, Amazon is still not terribly overvalued despite seeing its stock price more than double during the past 18 months.\n\nA high P/E basically means that investors are willing to pay a higher price for a company relative to its earnings today because they expect earnings to be higher in the future. However, if growth slows and expectations come down, it can lead to a sizable sell-off.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the S&P 500's valuation has become based increasingly on future potential earnings, whereas a few decades ago, the most valuable companies -- consumer staples giants, banks, and oil and gas businesses -- were valued more on their past earnings. Outsize gains could continue if companies deliver the growth that investors expect, but there could also be higher volatility in the market.\n\nBuild a portfolio that's right for you\n\nGiven the expensive valuation of the S&P 500 and its puny 1.3% dividend yield, value- and income-focused investors could consider integrating quality dividend stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into a diversified portfolio.\n\nAs a starting point, Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) trade at discounts to the S&P 500, are both Dividend Kings (with over 50 consecutive years of dividend increases), and both have dividend yields of more than 3%.\n\nThe SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF(NYSEMKT: DIA) mirrors the performance of that index and has a 1.8% yield and a 23.3 P/E -- making it a good option for folks looking to stick with blue chip stocks but through a value lens.\n\nThere are plenty of low-cost Vanguard ETFs that can provide a lifetime of passive income, such as the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF(NYSEMKT: VYM), Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF(NYSEMKT: VDC), and the Vanguard Utilities ETF(NYSEMKT: VPU). Targeting lower-growth, higher-yield sectors can be an effective way to balance a portfolio that is heavily allocated in growth stocks.\n\nAdjusting with the times\n\nAt first glance, the market might look overvalued because the S&P 500 has an inflated P/E ratio. But that's mostly because it is now heavily weighted in surging mega-cap growth stocks.\n\nPlenty of pockets of the market are teeming with quality value and income stocks. Now is the perfect time for investors to conduct a portfolio review and update their watch lists to ensure they hit their passive-income goals while aligning their investments with their risk tolerance.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Nvidia has been on an impressive tear lately, but many investors are concerned about the longevity of Nvidia's current position. It's known to be a cyclical company, so a demand reduction in its GPUs (graphics processing units) is coming, although no one knows when.\n\nWith Nvidia trading on much of its future prospects, there isn't much room for error. However, there are two companies that aren't as high-flying as Nvidia and could be worth more than it five years from now.\n\nThe two companies? Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which are the fourth- and fifth-largest companies in the world, respectively.\n\nAlphabet\n\nWhen discussing which company is larger, I'm talking about market capitalization. Market cap is how much a company is worth and can be calculated by multiplying the shares outstanding by the stock price. Nvidia currently holds around a $3 trillion market cap, while Alphabet and Amazon are valued at around $2.3 trillion and $2.1 trillion, respectively. So, if Nvidia stays stagnant, these two would have to grow by 31% (Alphabet) and 45% (Amazon) to catch Nvidia.\n\nOver a five-year span, those aren't unrealistic outperformance rates, so the odds of either company surpassing Nvidia aren't that low.\n\nAlphabet has a strong case of being worth more than Nvidia solely on a valuation basis. I could talk about how Google Gemini is a fantastic generative AI model that is starting to pick up momentum after stumbling out of the gate or how Google Cloud is vital in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. But the argument is far simpler than that.\n\nCurrently, Alphabet trades at 24.5 times forward earnings. While this is still more expensive than the broader market's 22.3 times forward earnings (measured by the S&P 500 index), it's still far cheaper than the three larger companies in front of it. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWith Microsoft and Apple trading at 34 and 33 times forward earnings, respectively, they garner a much higher premium than Alphabet.\n\nWhile some may argue that this premium is warranted due to recent execution, I'd argue that Alphabet is just as deserving over the long term. If you gave Alphabet a 33 times forward earnings multiple, the company would be valued at $3.08 trillion -- essentially the same size as Nvidia.\n\nAlphabet doesn't get nearly the respect that some other companies do in today's market. As a result, I think it has a strong case to be worth more than Nvidia in the future, as it isn't trading with lofty expectations built into the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon's case isn't as straightforward as Alphabet's. The stock trades at 44 times forward earnings, nearly identical to Nvidia's 45 times forward earnings valuation.\n\nHowever, I believe Amazon's high valuation is a byproduct of its focus on efficiency. CEO Andy Jassy has been pushing for better operating efficiency since he was promoted to CEO. So far, Amazon excelled in this pursuit.\n\nSegment Revenue YOY Revenue Growth Operating Income YOY Operating Income Growth North American $86.3 billion 12% $5 billion 455% International $31.9 billion 10% $903 million N/A AWS $25 billion 17% $9.4 billion 84%\n\nData source: Amazon. YOY = Year over year. Note: International was unprofitable last year.\n\nWith the impressive improvements in all divisions in a year, his plan is clearly working. However, Jassy isn't done yet. Although these profit levels are the highest they've been since the peak of COVID, Jassy believes there are more gains to be had.\n\nThis combination of revenue growth (Amazon grew its revenue by 13% in the first quarter) with margin improvement causes earnings to rise rapidly, making the stock appear cheaper if the stock price doesn't rise by the exact same amount.\n\nAmazon is a solid business with serious staying power. Because of its track record of execution and solid growth, I think it will be worth more than Nvidia in five years. Nvidia's business comes in waves, and although that's great for peaks, it can hurt it when times aren't so good.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Amazon vs. Apple",
        "content": "A number of companies' stocks achieved new all-time highs on Friday, July 5, including tech behemoths Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. As a result, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose 1% and 2%, respectively, during a 24-hour period.\n\nThe rally followed news that unemployment had hit its highest level since 2021. Wall Street expects an uptick in unemployment to bring down interest rates, which often promotes growth in the stock market as companies benefit from lower borrowing costs. As a result, now could be an excellent time to expand your position in \"Big Tech\" before it's too late.\n\nAmazon and Apple are two attractive options, profiting from immense brand loyalty from their customers and the cash to expand into budding sectors like artificial intelligence (AI). Let's examine these consumer-favorite companies and determine whether Amazon or Apple is the better stock to buy this month.\n\nAmazon\n\nShares in Amazon have climbed 53% during the past 12 months, rallying due to several quarters of impressive earnings growth and expansion into some of tech's fastest-growing industries. One of the most attractive aspects of its business is its diversification.\n\nThe company has come a long way since starting as an online book retailer 30 years ago. It's vastly expanded its product range to become the biggest name in e-commerce and achieved lucrative positions in cloud computing, video streaming, digital advertising, and now, AI.\n\nAmazon has growth catalysts across tech, potentially making it one of the most reliable long-term investments. For instance, an economic downturn in 2022 hit the company hard, causing steep profit declines in its retail segments.\n\nHowever, Amazon remained profitable during the challenging year, thanks to its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Meanwhile, the company has since pulled off an impressive turnaround in its retail business, proving its ability to navigate market headwinds successfully.\n\nIn the 2024 first quarter, Amazon's revenue rose 13% year over year to $143 billion. Its North American and international divisions posted revenue gains of 12% and 10%, respectively, with AWS sales spiking 17%. Also, Amazon's operating income more than tripled, hitting over $15 billion.\n\nAmazon is on a promising growth trajectory as sales continue to rise and it keeps investing in its business. This makes its stock a compelling option right now.\n\nApple\n\nApple's stock hit a record high this week following a rally. Its share price has increased by 17% since its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) on June 10.\n\nStory continues GOOGL Chart\n\nDeclines in product sales and a delayed start in AI have concerned investors during the past year. This was reflected in a stock that has risen slower this year than many of its peers (as seen in the chart above). However, the WWDC gave a peek into Apple's plan to boost product sales and carve out a lucrative role in AI over the long term.\n\nAt the June conference, Apple unveiled a new AI platform it calls Apple Intelligence, which will bring generative features across its product lineup. However, consumers must upgrade to the company's newer devices to access Apple Intelligence.\n\niPhone users will need a 15 Pro or higher. Meanwhile, only Macs and iPads using Apple's custom-developed Apple Silicon chips can run the new AI tools. The company hopes the new features will compel shoppers to upgrade their devices to access the coming features.\n\nApple revealed in its Q1 2024 earnings report it had more than 2 billion active devices worldwide. The company's reach in the consumer market is vast, and its deep economic moat is driven by a walled garden of products and a reputation for quality. Apple generated $102 billion in free cash flow (what's left of cash flow after capital expenditures), so I wouldn't bet against the company flourishing over the long term.\n\nIs Amazon or Apple the better buy?\n\nAmazon and Apple have become worldwide household names. Both companies can seemingly do no wrong, succeeding in nearly every new market they enter. However, Amazon's quick recovery after macroeconomic headwinds in 2022 and arguably more diverse business model make its stock potentially more reliable and worth considering over Apple. AMZN Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nThis chart shows that Amazon's financial growth has dwarfed Apple's during the past year. The retail giant is enjoying gains in all parts of its business. Meanwhile, many questions remain about whether Apple's AI expansion will, in fact, boost earnings.\n\nIn addition to Amazon's price-to-sales ratio of 3.5, compared to Apple's 9.3, the e-commerce company's stock is the better no-brainer buy this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "How an ‘accident’ helped the creators of the Mighty Patch unlock Amazon success",
        "content": "You’ve seen the Mighty Patch before.\n\nThe tiny, translucent disks are increasingly adorning the faces of Gen Z and millennials when a pimple appears, and over 1 billion of the brand’s signature hydrocolloid patches have sold thus far. Manufacturer Hero Cosmetics also recently netted a partnership with content creator Alix Earle.\n\nFounder and CEO Ju Rhyu told Fortune she came up with the idea for the brand while living as an expat in South Korea while working for Samsung in 2012. At the time, only two types of hydrocolloid patches existed in K-Beauty: medical and cosmetic-oriented. The entrepreneur wanted to bridge the gap and bring pimple patches to the U.S., seeing an opportunity in the $3.9 billion K-Beauty industry.\n\nSo in 2017, when she was 37 years old, Rhyu launched her brand along with cofounders Dwight Lee and Andrew Lee, capitalizing on their corporate expertise and a cool $50,000 the trio had pooled together.\n\nAfter agreeing that Mighty Patch needed to be cash flow positive and profitable, the trio set out to find a manufacturer. Rhyu compiled a list of potential business partners, and told the Female Startup Club she found the companies from the boxes of acne patches at a local pharmacy.\n\nOf the 10 manufacturers Rhyu contacted through cold emails, only two responded. She said the final match was “luck,” and Hero Cosmetics still works with it today who. Rhyu says the manufacturer makes “the best quality patch in Korea.”\n\nThe Big Launch\n\nArmed with a business partner and a mission to disrupt the Band-Aid aisle, Hero earned its first 10,000-unit order.\n\nIn 2017, Hero began selling the Mighty Patch, including on e-commerce giant Amazon. But the company initially couldn’t get the product featured on Amazon Prime, which can increase orders by 25% as members get free shipping and other perks.\n\nA breakthrough came after some trial and error.\n\n\"The pricing actually was kind of an accident, because we were selling on Amazon,” Rhyu said. “There were already some players that were a lot cheaper at around $5. And actually wanted to place our products at $9.99. But the funny story is we couldn't get Amazon Prime. And we were sort of playing around with different things to see how we can unlock Prime. And one of the ways was we increased our price [to] $12.99.\"\n\nRhyu chose to stick with the newer price tag after selling out in just 90 days. And in 2022, she shepherded a $630 million acquisition with Church & Dwight.\n\nBreaking into the beauty industry\n\nPimple patches may have only recently become a beauty staple for Americans, but they’ve existed in South Korea since the early 2010’s.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen Hero Cosmetics first entered the market in the U.S., Rhyu said there were only a few competitors on Amazon. Now, the beauty industry is flooded with all types of pimple patches. Brands like Starface have introduced bright colors and cloud and star shapes to the beauty aisle, while Neutrogena and CosRX have created their own translucent hydrocolloid disks.\n\nBut Rhyu says Hero’s decision to keep patches discreet allows them to reach a broader range of customers.\n\nRhyu also credits Hero’s success to their special formula, “When they use ours versus competition, I think they can tell the product difference.” She adds that Hero's expertise in the acne patch category created a lot of trust and is part of the reason why they stay number one to this day.\n\n“We want to be very inclusive and accommodate everyone from the 14-year-old to people in their 50s,” she says, adding that bright shapes and colors may be fun for younger generations, “but it won't work for everybody.”\n\nRhyu says her success isn’t determined by her company's revenue, but by changing the narrative around acne.\n\nShe credits social media as a key factor in Hero Cosmetics’ popularity, emphasizing the virality of “the peel off” when content creators remove their Mighty Patch and reveal the “gunk” underneath.\n\n“That type of content goes viral a lot and that virality helps with education,” she says. “Social media, obviously, has been so crucial to the success of our business.”\n\nShe says she feels “proud” when customers wear the product in public since Hero aims to make acne “more acceptable.”\n\n“I love seeing people wear them to the office or just out and about,” she says. “What it means to me is we've done our job, that we've really sort of broken down the taboo aspect of acne and made it okay.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Big Tech's Next Milestone Is The $4 Trillion Market Cap\n\nBig Tech is racing towards a milestone that would have seems impossible only a few decades ago, a market capitalization of $4 trillion.\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) are members of the $3 trillion market cap club, with Google-parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) having only surpassed the $2 trillion milestone.\n\nNvidia could win the $4 trillion race.\n\nWith even more powerful chips on the way, the AI boom could be that powerful to drive Nvidia to $4 trillion valuation. For a moment, Nvidia even became the world’s most valuable company on June 18th. But, Nvidia got dethroned quickly due to concerns over the sustainability of its skyrocketing growth. On the other hand, Microsoft and Apple are ahead in terms of market size. Looking at past numbers, Apple was the first the reach the first three of the trillion valuation milestones. Both Apple and Microsoft are as strong as ever, but Nvidia has an incredible momentum on its side. But, just because it enjoys dominating the market does not mean it should not take seriously the threat of AMD or Intel catching up at some point, although Nvidia does have the resources to defend itself and continue to innovate. Perhaps Nvidia’s biggest protection lies in its expansion of revenue sources as it aims to go beyond chips and build an entire AI ecosystem, ensuring it remains in the center of things as opposed to being only one link in the chain.\n\nNvidia’s Promise Of Blackwell\n\nAt the end of June, Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang spoke at the company’s annual general meeting and pitched the upcoming Blackwell chips as not only the most successful product in Nvidia’s history but also in the entire computer history. Huan proudly spoke of reinventing Nvidia, the computer industry, and consequently, the world. The good part is that at the absolute end, Nvidia still does not have a big rival. But only time will show if the AI hype is enough to propel Nvidia to new heights, refuting doubts of concerned investors.\n\nPutting the the economic promise of AI and the fourth Industrial Revolution aside, there is a lot that is still unknown, the market dynamic is shaped with a lot of uncertainty that is out of even Big Tech’s control, all of which would undoubtedly impact their path to a $4 trillion valuation. In addition, there’s the long-term tech battle to think about in a new AI-shaped era that is in the making.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Yet since its IPO in 1970, the grocery store giant has returned almost 300,000% compared to a 5,000% return by the S&P 500. A $10,000 investment in WMT stock when it went public would be worth $29.8 million today. And that doesn’t even include dividends.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCreating life-altering, generational wealth by investing in stocks is still possible today. You just need to look far enough into the future to visualize a company’s potential. The three long-term growth stocks below represent the same opportunity and can make you tremendously rich over the next 25 years.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) Image of a yellow construction vehicle with the Caterpillar (CAT) logo on it\n\nSource: astudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a stock you should consider owning for long-term wealth generation. Although the stock is up 11% year-to-date (YTD), it has pulled back 14% from its 52-week high.\n\nBack in April when it had just hit that peak, I noted investors might want to sell the stock. I wrote that because Caterpillar is a cyclical company, “It’s an example of a stock I would normally recommend holding long-term but could see someone wanting to take profits before a downturn arrived.”\n\nFor a long-term investor, particularly one looking out to the year 2050, such gyrations are less of a concern. You may realize a few extra percentage points of gains by waiting but few people can exactly time a top or bottom. It is far better to buy a stock and regularly add to your position. That’s because over the years Caterpillar has been a superb stock to own.\n\nWhile CAT has been publicly traded since 1925, just since the beginning of 2000 it has a total return over 6,000% compared to a 500% return by the benchmark index.\n\nBig Cat has paid a dividend every year since 1933 and has raised the payout for 31 consecutive years, making it a Dividend Aristocrat. The dividend yields a respectable 1.7% annually.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe equipment maker will have its ups and downs in the years to come. But in 25 years, you can rest easy knowing your investment will be worth substantially more than it is today.\n\nJefferies Financial Group (JEF) A photo of a hand holding a smartphone showing the Jefferies logo while in the background, a monitor shows the Jefferies website.\n\nSource: T. Schneider/ShutterStock.com\n\nInvestment bank Jefferies Financial Group (NYSE:JEF) makes its money on deal-making. Through capital markets activities, underwriting, financial advisory and asset management services, the firm has its hand in every corner of the market.\n\nIt seems clear a current roaring bull market will benefit JEF more than a black swan event like the 2020 pandemic. However, because the investment bank went public in 1983, it has been through its share of business and economic cycles. Over that time it has tripled the returns of the S&P 500, 9,600% to 3,200%. It is up nearly 1,000% since 2000, or twice the index’s gains.\n\nJefferies has been through many iterations. Originally founded in 1962, it was acquired and merged with various other financial services firms. In 2012 it merged with Leucadia National, which was often referred to as a mini Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) because of the similarities in its operations. In 2018, Leucadia changed its name to Jefferies Financial Group.\n\nThe investment bank has a long, rich history of paying and growing its dividend. Over the past decade, it has increased the payout at a compounded annual growth rate of almost 19% and over the last five years has raised it by 22% annually. The dividend yields 2.8% a year. Jefferies is a favorite investment of Warren Buffett and is one of his highest-yielding stocks.\n\nKroger (KR) Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you are looking for a long-term growth stock most similar to Walmart, then Kroger (NYSE:KR) should be on your list. It is the largest pure-play supermarket stock with over 2,700 stores.\n\nPublicly traded since 1977, a $10,000 investment at the time would be worth $5.5 million today. Not too shabby for doing little more than putting the stock in your portfolio and forgetting about it.\n\nThe grocery store chain is attempting to acquire rival Albertsons (NYSE:ACI). However, it is running into interference from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The regulatory agency has opposed virtually every large acquisition made and last month announced it was suing Kroger to block the merger on antitrust grounds.\n\nThe position displays ignorance of the many competitive threats grocers face in the marketplace. Beyond the likes of Walmart and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) in the brick-and-mortar space, there are online grocers as well. Those include giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart to smaller operations like third party delivery services such as Maplebear’s (NASDAQ:CART) Instacart services.\n\nAlthough the FTC typically loses in court when it sues, even if successful in this instance Kroger doesn’t need Albertsons to thrive. Also, investors will do well, all the while enjoying a dividend that currently yields 1.7% annually.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +8.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has gained 7.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $1.02 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +61.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.58 points to a change of +57.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.80 indicates a change of +26.6% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $148.54 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $638.24 billion and $709.91 billion estimates indicate +11% and +11.2% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $143.31 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.5%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $0.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $142.53 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +36.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum",
        "content": "Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL), a global leader in enterprise software and cloud computing solutions, was founded in 1977. The company excels in developing and marketing database software and technology, cloud-engineered systems and enterprise software products, particularly its own brands of database management systems.\n\nOriginally an enterprise software database giant, Oracle has transitioned to the cloud over the past 10 to 15 years and is now poised to tackle the artificial intelligence revolution. As such, the company presents a compelling investment opportunity amid its impressive momentum in AI and cloud businesses.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with ORCL.\n\nDespite tight competition, Oracle has delivered high double-digit growth in both areas recently. As a legacy database provider, its database solutions have become a key competitive advantage against industry peers, strengthening its position in the cloud business. Oracle offers a comprehensive and fast cloud solution for deploying AI, boasting the fastest infrastructure in the industry, backed by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) hardware. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nSource: Oracle Investor Relations\n\nOracle reported its fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 earnings on June 11. Quarterly earnings of $1.63 per share narrowly missed estimates by 1.20%. Revenue of $14.29 billion also missed expectations by 1.90%. Despite these misses, the stock price surged due to growth in the remaining performance obligation, which has remained resilient despite the deceleration in the company's cloud infrastructure growth rate.\n\nSignificant deals with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, OpenAI and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) around Oracle Cloud Infrastructure also contributed to this positive sentiment. Oracle's earnings growth was complemented by strong margins, with the adjusted operating margin and adjusted Ebitda margin expanding to 44% and 55%, respectively, highlighting the scalability of OCI across its operations. I believe Oracle can sustain this exceptional growth rate as it continues to build larger data centers. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nYear to date, Oracle has outperformed the S&P 500 by over 20%, with the stock yielding more than 35% compared to the S&P 500's 17% increase.\n\nThe company's expanded partnership with Microsoft and other cloud computing providers is expected to enhance the expansion and reach of its leading database management services. Given its smaller scale compared to Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, Oracle must capitalize on multi-cloud adoption opportunities to justify its premium valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrategic moves\n\nOracle's transformation is certainly pushing the boundaries of what the company can achieve, with the primary growth constraint being the speed at which it can establish new data centers. Despite missing both top and bottom-line estimates in the fourth quarter, the stock surged over 13% post-earnings release.\n\nThis surge was driven by the impressive growth in Oracle's RPO, which grew 44% year over year to an astounding $98 billion and increased by $18 billion from the third quarter. Management expects 39% of this amount, or about $38.20 billion, to materialize in the next 12 months. The significant contracts signed in the third and fourth quarter, driven by the unrelenting AI demand, marked the largest sales quarters in Oracle's history. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nSource: Oracle's Investor Relations\n\nThroughout the year, the company secured pivotal deals with industry giants OpenAI, Google and Microsoft. These contracts are crucial as they involve leading names in the AI space that are poised to dominate in the coming years. OpenAI, the entity behind the AI revolution with ChatGPT, signed on to run deep learning and AI workloads on the Oracle OCI. Oracle reported that a total of 30 AI contracts were signed in the fourth quarter, valued at over $12 billion. For these projects, the company will utilize cutting-edge Nvidia chips, interconnect network solutions and liquid cooling to train neural networks. Management also announced the construction of four large data centers for this initiative, potentially incorporating Nvidia's new Blackwell GPUs.\n\nAdditionally, Oracle entered a partnership with Google to offer OCI database services through Google Cloud, planning to build 12 OCI data centers within Google Cloud. The company also advanced its collaboration with Microsoft, with 11 of the planned 23 OCI data centers within Microsoft Azure already operational. During the earnings call, there were hints of a potential future partnership with Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS. With the global shift towards multi-cloud adoption, a deal with AWS would not be surprising. These strategic moves demonstrate Oracle's strong positioning to capitalize on the AI boom through its data centers.\n\nFlexibility and scalability in cloud services\n\nOracle is also offering private OCI for enterprises looking to leverage its cloud services within their own data centers. As outlined in the earnings call, customers will not pay for hardware, but only for consumption costs, with the ability to scale services as needed for training large language models and neural networks. This flexibility is expected to drive scalable revenue generation for Oracle. Its multi-cloud integration and adaptable cloud services position it as a versatile and comprehensive solution for various enterprise needs.\n\nFurther, its Gen2 AI Cloud Infrastructure currently faces demand that far exceeds supply. The company's legacy as a database provider gives it a competitive edge, allowing it to leverage its position in the cloud business. Oracle's capital expenditure guidance for 2024, ranging between $7 billion and $7.50 billion, reflects the increasing demand for Oracle Cloud. This includes growing demand in national security and European Union sovereign regions. While Oracle's infrastructure as a service is in growth mode, its profitable legacy platform supports its overall profitability, enabling competitive pricing for its cloud offerings. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nSource: Statista\n\nWith only a 2% market share in the cloud market, Oracle has substantial room to grow and capture share from competitors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google, the top three players in the field. Recent quarters have seen the company growing its cloud revenue at a faster pace than its main competitors, indicating a strong growth trajectory.\n\nBusiness performance and outlook\n\nDespite the quarterly earnings misses, Oracle's standout performer was the cloud infrastructure segment, which saw revenue jump 42% year over year. The Cloud Application segment also registered growth, reaching $3.30 billion, a 10% increase. Non-GAAP operating margins showed significant strength, increasing 47%.\n\nFor the full year, Oracle reported total revenue of $53 billion, a 6% increase, with non-GAAP operating margins at 44%. It generated $5.56 in non-GAAP earnings per share. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nSource: Oracle's Investor Relations\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, I anticipate exceptional top-line growth as Oracle continues to build out regional AI factories and expand embedded OCI services in Azure data centers. The company has carved out a niche with its automated OCI services, which are poised to grow as quickly as data centers can be constructed. Management projects strong sequential growth for the year as OCI capacity scales to meet demand, with cloud infrastructure services expected to increase 50%. They also reiterated their fiscal 2026 revenue goal of $65 billion, though they now believe this target may be conservative given the accelerated growth momentum seen in 2024. This target seems achievable given the rapid growth across OCI infrastructure and services.\n\nMargin analysis\n\nThere has been some tightening on the margin side due to significant investments to meet the surging demand for Oracle's second generation AI Cloud infrastructure. I expect margins to improve as the company works through its backlog of orders. As the top-line growth continues, I foresee margins scaling and expanding due to the company's automated, modular data center capacity. Additionally, given the recent data breach by one of Oracle's cloud database competitors, there may be opportunities to capture additional market share that were previously unavailable.\n\nCapital expenditures and free cash flow\n\nA key takeaway from the fourth-quarter earnings report was the management's update on capital expenditure spending. For the year, capital expenditures amounted to nearly $6.90 billion. During the earnings call, management stated they expect capex spending to double in fiscal 2025, reaching nearly $14 billion, significantly higher than the earlier prediction of $10 billion.\n\nWhile this figure is substantial, Oracle's cash flow statement shows it has become a free cash flow-generating machine. In 2024, Oracle generated $11.80 billion in free cash flow, a 39% growth. Although FCF growth slowed compared to 2023's 68%, the absolute magnitude of the cash flows should alleviate concerns about the company's capital expenditure.\n\nInvestors should keep an eye on capex spending, but Oracle's ability to generate significant free cash flows, combined with its focus on major AI players as customers, mitigates some of the concerns surrounding the high figure.\n\nValuation analysis\n\nOracle currently trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of about 22, aligning with some peers such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) (22.30) and Alphabet (22.10), but more attractively priced compared to others like Microsoft (33) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) (28.40).\n\nHistorically, Oracle has traded at lower multiples, but the recent surge in positive developments, particularly partnerships with AI giants like OpenAI, Alphabet and Microsoft, has justified a higher multiple. These strategic partnerships have significantly boosted the company's growth potential, particularly in the AI and cloud infrastructure space. Given the company's trajectory, I believe a forward earnings multiple of 22 is appropriate. The company has demonstrated robust earnings per share growth, recording an 8.60% increase, which is close to its fiscal 2026 target of over 10%.\n\nWith a forward PEG ratio of approximately 1.80 and considering management's earnings growth target of 10% by 2026, we can adjust our valuation assumptions accordingly. This adjustment yields an adjusted PEG ratio of around 2. If Oracle achieves this growth target in 2025, the projected EPS would be around $6, aligning closely with the analyst consensus of $6.30. Using a forward price-earnings ratio of 22, this would result in a price target of $135, roughly matching the current trading levels and implying a potential downside of about 5%.\n\nTo further validate the valuation derived from the price-earnings multiple approach, a discounted cash flow analysis can be employed. Using a discount rate of 11% and aligning with management's 10% growth estimate through 2026, the DCF valuation also does not provide a sufficient margin of safety to recommend the stock at current levels. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nWhile Oracle's growth is commendable, particularly in cloud infrastructure and AI, it faces stiff competition from companies like Microsoft, whose Azure and intelligent cloud offerings are better positioned. Microsoft's superior growth in these areas highlights the competitive challenges the company must navigate. Given that Oracle's stock has already surged over 15% following its impressive earnings release and is up over 35% year to date, the current valuation reflects much of the positive developments.\n\nGiven the little to no upside potential at the current price levels, I am maintaining my hold rating on Oracle. The stock has already incorporated significant gains, and while its partnerships and growth in AI and cloud infrastructure are promising, the current valuation does not present a compelling entry point for new investors.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nOracle stands at the forefront of the AI and cloud computing revolution, leveraging its legacy as a database provider to drive growth in these burgeoning sectors. The company's strategic partnerships with key players in the AI space, coupled with its robust financial performance and free cash flow generation, position it well for future expansion.\n\nHowever, given the current valuation levels, which already account for much of the anticipated growth, the stock appears fairly priced with limited immediate upside potential. Thus, while Oracle's long-term outlook remains strong, I advise investors to watch for more attractive entry points in the future.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Contrarian Plays Poised to Soar as AI Mania Cools",
        "content": "It’s no secret that artificial intelligence dominates both the tech ecosystem along with the broader investing arena. However, it might be risky to heavily bet on the usual suspects – you know what I’m talking about. Instead, it might be prudent to consider so-called contrarian AI stocks: securities that aren’t quite getting the attention they deserve for the digital intelligence role but should.\n\nWhy should you zig while others are zagging? I’m reminded about the dot-com boom and bust. Back then, seemingly everyone was piling into internet-related stocks under the thesis that the innovation would change the world. They were right but guess what? Companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) still struggled for years before reaching their prior highs. The same could happen with AI.\n\nGranted, history doesn’t always repeat but it tends to rhyme. Further, the hottest trends feature an ebb and flow. And it seems like it never fails: greed and the fear of missing out (FOMO) combine and the inevitable disappointment materializes. Therefore, it may make sense to consider contrarian AI stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in San Diego, California, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is one of the top semiconductors in the world. Primarily, it focuses on the development and commercialization of foundational technologies for the wireless industry. That may have significant implications for AI, especially as digital intelligence moves into the broader connectivity space. In addition, Qualcomm is working on energy-efficient AI chips.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s a huge and overlooked attribute, making QCOM one of the top contrarian AI stocks to consider. While everyone appears to love the innovations undergirding digital intelligence, we tend to forget that such protocols consume a boatload of power. Several publications have sounded the alarm bell regarding this consumption. So, Qualcomm could let us have our cake and eat it too.\n\nNow, it must be said that has already gained over 45% of equity value since the start of the year. As such, QCOM stock trades at 6.31X trailing-year sales. That’s high, especially compared to the prior year’s average metric of 3.94X. Further, there’s not much growth projected for fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, in fiscal 2025, sales could rise to $39.44 billion, with a high-side estimate of $41.47 billion. That compares favorably to last year’s print of $35.83 billion.  Thus, it’s one of the contrarian AI stocks to consider.\n\nKroger (KR) Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you want to talk about contrarian AI stocks, Kroger (NYSE:KR) is certainly one of the oddball ideas. Of course, natively, the core business of Kroger has nothing to do with technology. Instead, it’s a grocer, doing business in certain markets as Ralphs. However, Kroger has been one of the non-AI companies that have been incorporating digital intelligence into its business.\n\nEarlier this year, Kroger stated that it was adding new capabilities for sellers to its online marketplace. Through the use of advanced technologies, Kroger customers will have a superior experience through clearer and more informative product listings. Of course, what really makes KR stock appealing is the underlying need: we all need to eat.\n\nFinancially, Kroger isn’t spectacular but it gets the job done. Its average EPS over the past four quarters landed at $1.17. That’s better than the expectation calling for $1.08 (yielding an earnings surprise of 8.6%).\n\nWith a forward earnings multiple of 11.43X and a sales multiple of 0.25X, KR stock seems reasonably priced. It also offers a forward dividend yield of 2.52%, making it a sensible idea for contrarian AI stocks.\n\nInnodata (INOD) Hand with pen marking holographic chart with the word \"AI\". Artificial Intelligence\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/everything possible\n\nHeadquartered in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, Innodata (NASDAQ:INOD) falls under the information technology services space. Per its public profile, Innodata operates as a global data engineering firm. In particular, one of its business units – Digital Data Solutions – specializes in the provision of AI data preparation services. This in part involves collecting or creating training data for AI algorithms.\n\nWhat makes Innodata enticing as a candidate for contrarian AI stocks is that we’re moving beyond the low-hanging fruit of public chatbots. Yes, it’s good to get answers to silly questions that you’re too afraid to ask anyone else. However, in order for AI to truly blossom, it needs to be put to genuinely productive use. Innodata could potentially help in this department.\n\nIt’s undoubtedly a high-risk, high-reward idea, with the focus on the top line. In the trailing 12 months, Innodata posted sales of $94.44 million. By the end of fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate revenue of $121.66 million. Further, by fiscal 2025, sales could swing up to $156.05 million.\n\nIt’s also possible that Innodata could generate net income this year as well. With that in mind, it’s one of the enticing contrarian AI stocks to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "content": "A ballot process that could see online giant Amazon recognise a trade union in the UK for the first time is to start on Monday.\n\nWorkers at the company’s Coventry site will start voting on whether they want the GMB to represent them.\n\nThere are two key factors in the ballot that will decide the outcome. Firstly, 40% of employees in the bargaining unit must vote, whether they are union members or not. If this threshold is not met, the ballot fails. Then if the 40% threshold is met, it is a straight majority of the vote that decides the outcome.\n\nAmazon maintains that its employees have always had the choice of joining a union.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe GMB will stage protests at Amazon warehouses across the UK as voting begins.\n\nA rally will also be held outside Amazon’s London head office.\n\nThe union said more than 3,000 workers will take part in the ballot, with the result expected in mid-July.\n\nGMB national officer Andy Prendergast said: “Workers have come together because of the poverty pay and unsafe conditions Amazon has thrust upon them.\n\n“They want the same fair pay and safe conditions any of us would demand.\n\n“Amazon has had every chance to do the right thing – now workers are taking things into their own hands to make work better.”\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said: “Our employees have the choice of whether or not to join a union. They always have. Across Amazon, we place enormous value on having daily conversations and engagement with our employees. It’s a strong part of our work culture. We value that direct relationship and so do our employees.\n\n“We regularly review our pay to ensure we offer competitive wages and benefits. Our minimum starting pay has increased to £12.30 and £13 per hour depending on location – that’s a 20% increase over two years and 50% since 2018. We also work hard to provide great benefits, a positive work environment and excellent career opportunities.\n\n“These are just some of the reasons people want to come and work at Amazon, whether it’s their first job, a seasonal role or an opportunity for them to advance their career.”",

        "content": "Charlie Munger Called Jeff Bezos An 'Amazing Human Leader,' But Missed Out On Amazon Stock Because It Was 'Too Complicated'.\n\nCharlie Munger, the venerable late Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK), never minced words when it comes to praising Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos.\n\nIn a candid discussion in 2019, Munger lauded Bezos as an \"amazing human leader,\" comparing him to Lee Kuan Yew, the transformative leader of Singapore.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nCan you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nBezos’ leadership at Amazon led the company to global dominance in e-commerce and cloud computing. Despite this admiration, Munger and Berkshire Hathaway were notably late in investing in Amazon.\n\nMunger’s hesitation to invest in Amazon was rooted in the company’s complexity and the uncertainties that surrounded it. \"It's always been too complicated and uncertain for my particular temperament,\" Munger said.\n\nHe emphasized his preference for investments where outcomes could be predicted with a high degree of accuracy. This conservative approach has been a cornerstone of Berkshire Hathaway’s investment strategy, focusing on businesses with clear, stable trajectories.\n\nThis cautiousness led to a missed opportunity, one that Munger acknowledged with a hint of regret. He admired Bezos’ unparalleled leadership but stayed true to his investment principles, favoring simpler, more predictable ventures. \"I find other things to do that'll work fine,\" he said.\n\nTrending:This city is the clear winner of Zillow's 2024 Home Value Forecast — No surprise as the number of millionaires there grew by 75% in the last decade.\n\nOver the last 10 years, shares of Berkshire are up over 216% as viewed in the chart from Benzinga Pro below.\n\nCompare that to the +1,055% gain for Amazon.com shares over the last 10 years, as seen in the Benzinga Pro chart below, and it may be easy to see why Munger had some level of regret in not investing in the Bezos-founded ecommerce company.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWarren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune — How much is that worth today?

        "title": "The 3 Best Retirement Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "The best retirement stocks are something investors may consider later in their careers, but the previous few years have proved that there’s no poor time to start preparing. Covid-19, meme stocks and a record 11 interest rate increases between March 2022 and July 2023 have caused upheaval, making everyone think about retirement stocks.\n\nDue to the 8.7% Social Security cost-of-living rise in 2023, more seniors may be subject to federal income taxes on their benefits in 2024, so now is the time to consider the best retirement stocks.\n\nI search for dividend companies with rising returns while researching the best retirement stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFrom 1972 to 2019, Hartford Funds discovered that S&P 500 dividend-paying equities outperformed lower-volatility payers. Dividend growers and initiators had 10.19% returns, nonpayers 4.27%.\n\nAccording to Ned Davis Research, dividend-paying equities have lower betas of 0.89 and a standard deviation of 16.15%, making them less volatile than companies not paying dividends.\n\nPlus, a corporation that has earned profits over the last 10 years is more likely to sustain a high dividend yield as it withstood recessions, pandemics and a hawkish Fed. Also, if the stock has a “strong buy” consensus, it’s a winner in my eyes, even if it’s pricey. Don’t purchase a dud because it’s cheap.\n\nFederal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nFederal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is a contrarian pick among the best retirement stocks. FRT announced disappointing first-quarter 2024 funds from operations of $1.64 per share. The company’s shortfall in profits has harmed the market mood.\n\nFRT demands particular attention since it must distribute 90% of taxable revenue to existing owners as a real estate investment trust. FRT continued its 56-year streak of dividend increases with a $1.09 per common share quarterly cash payout.\n\nFederal Realty, a “strong buy” rated REIT with a 12.2% upside, was profitable over the last decade, outperforming most of the 833 REITs.\n\nIn addition, FRT is carrying out initiatives to grow profits, including a significant refurbishment in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. A new six-story residential building with 217 apartments and 16,000 square feet of retail space is expected to cost $90-$95 million and have a 7% ROI. FRT approved a second Bala Cynwyd phase of a $170 million community project.\n\nRecently, FRT issued $485 million in senior notes due in January 2029 and secured a $200 million Bethesda Row mortgage loan for its subsidiary. The company paid back $600 million in senior unsecured debt in January, balancing financial demands with cautious management.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Harun Ozmen / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT), despite fierce competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), is the world’s largest retailer and a Dividend King, raising its payment each year since March 1974.\n\nWMT’s “strong buy” rating and potential upside of over 8%, based on a $73.85 target price, aren’t as high as growth stocks like JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) or Roblox (NYSE:RBLX), but that’s typical of even the best retirement stocks.\n\nWalmart has outperformed 99.67% of the 299 retail-defensive companies, generating profits yearly over the last decade.\n\nWalmart’s Q1 FY2025 sales were $161.5 billion, above expert projections of $159.5 billion, and EPS was $1.34 instead of $1.31; WMT is aiming for a 3% to 4% sales growth goal for the fiscal year ending January 2025.\n\nIn addition, Walmart will buy Vizio (NYSE:VZIO) for $2.3 billion to boost its Walmart Connect advertising business. Plus, Walmart is working with Agritask to enhance supply chain sustainability and efficiency. It’s also separately redesigning its $2 billion, generation Z-focused “No Boundaries” brand.\n\nAT&T (T) A photo of an AT&T office building.\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) wraps up our exploration of the best retirement stocks with an industry-beating yield of 5.8%, a potential upside of around 17%, complimenting a “strong buy” rating, showing how far it has come from the messy Time Warner merger issues.\n\nFollowing AT&T’s spinoff of Time Warner, CEO John Stankey has repeatedly pledged to build its fiber and 5G businesses. AT&T wants to cut debt and focus on telecom aggressively. Total long-term debt dropped from $230 billion in March 2022 to $132.8 billion in Q1; T’s targeting a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 by 2025.\n\nWith a revenue of $30.03 billion, AT&T somewhat missed expert projections of $30.62 billion. Still, the business had a net profit increase, with operational income jumping by 29.3% year-over-year to $6.4 billion. With a free cash flow of $4.2 billion, AT&T exceeded analysts’ estimate of $3.60 billion. Additionally, the company’s profitability for eight of the last 10 years is better than 53% of the telecom industry.\n\nFor the whole year, AT&T is on target to generate at least $16 billion in free cash flow. Ahead of time, the company reached its $6 billion cost-cutting target; during the following three years, it intends to lower expenses by an extra $2 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2024",
        "content": "The bull market has raged on through the first half of 2024; the S&P 500 index is up 16% year to date and is sitting at new highs. But there are still plenty of stocks that could head higher in the near term.\n\nThese three Motley Fool contributors see more upside for Carnival(NYSE: CCL), Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Here's why they believe these top stocks are timely buys in July.\n\nThis travel stock is poised to hit new highs\n\nJennifer Saibil (Carnival): Carnival is coming off a rebound year when it completely crushed the market, gaining 130%. You would think it would have to demonstrate some seriously strong performance to keep that up, and so far, so good.\n\nThe market seems to think it's had enough, and Carnival stock is trading down 6% this year. But as it continues to exceed expectations, it shouldn't stay down for much longer.\n\nManagement delivered an excellent update for the 2024 fiscal third quarter (ended May 31), with many metrics hitting new highs, including customer deposits and booking levels.\n\nRevenue hit a second-quarter record of $5.8 billion, and operating income was five times last year's levels. It reported a positive net income of $92 million, $500 million better than last year. Management raised its outlook across the board for the full year.\n\nThere's been concern that Carnival's incredible rebound is a short-term reaction to cruise closures, but demand remains strong, and customers are booking out into 2025. In a classic illustration of supply and demand, Carnival has been able to charge top prices due to high interest and low inventory for longer periods. This is helping it move further out into higher profitability and wipe out more of its debt, which remains high. But it's looking quite likely that it will be able to clear it over the next several years and return to a solid financial position.\n\nManagement is taking a number of actions to improve the business, not only from a financial standpoint. It's investing in the passenger experience with better connectivity and celebrity performances. It has upgraded its planning software and is strategically streamlining its fleet to effectively use its resources.\n\nThese are the kinds of actions that should generate more demand, increased sales, and sustained profits. With Carnival stock still down year to date, investors can get excited about a rebound in the back half of the year.\n\nThis oversold stock looks ready for a comeback\n\nJeremy Bowman (Roku): While the S&P 500 continues to churn to all-time highs, the streaming sector has lagged behind. Entertainment giants like Walt Disney and Warner Bros Discovery are still trading down substantially from their previous highs, and Roku stock has fallen nearly 90% from its peak during the worst of the pandemic.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe industry has undergone a brutal correction after a boom during the pandemic, but there are signs that the correction could be coming to an end. Disney just reported its first-ever profitable quarter in streaming, and a pending merger between Paramount Global and Skydance could also help alleviate some of the competitive pressure in the industry. Meanwhile, digital advertising has begun to recover following a sharp drop during the pandemic.\n\nAll of those developments are good news for Roku. Shares of the streaming distribution leader plunged as its path to profitability under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) looked unclear and revenue growth slowed following a spike during the pandemic, but the underlying metrics in the business remain strong.\n\nStreaming hours jumped 23% year over year in the first quarter to 30.8 billion, and streaming households were up 14% to 81.6 million, showing it's still rapidly gaining new customers. Revenue also rose 19% year over year to $881.5 million, and it reported its third quarter in a row of adjusted profitability in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\n\nRoku has struggled as its media partners have pulled back on advertising spending due to the challenges in the industry, but that should start to change as the streaming platforms take steps to profitability and new launches, like the flagship ESPN streaming network, which is due out next fall.\n\nAs Roku grows its user base and revenue, and the stock price remains down, the buy case gets stronger. As business conditions improve, the bottom line and the stock price should respond in kind.\n\nInvestors should stick with this winner\n\nJohn Ballard (Amazon): Amazon stock has doubled the S&P 500's 24% return over the last 12 months by rising 51%. The stock just recently broke to another new high, which could be a sign of things to come in the second half of 2024.\n\nThe main story for Amazon over the past year has been improving profitability. The company is focused on widening its competitive moat in e-commerce by growing its selection of items while keeping costs down. This has led to improved sales momentum in online retail stores, but most importantly, its cost reduction led its first-quarter operating income to triple over the year-ago quarter to $15 billion.\n\nIt's no surprise to see Wall Street analysts upbeat about Amazon. For example, Wells Fargo sees it reporting better-than-expected financial results in the next earnings report. The bank bumped up its price target on the stock from $234 to $239, implying a 21% upside from the current share price of $197.\n\nThe consensus Wall Street estimate projects Amazon's earnings per share to grow 23% per year over the next several years. Assuming that estimate holds up, it would be enough for the share price to potentially double within the next four years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Carnival Corp. right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Carnival Corp. wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Overvalued Tech Stocks Heading for a Fall",
        "content": "When it comes to stocks, valuation matters.\n\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio measures a company’s share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS). The P/E ratio helps to determine if a stock is expensive, or trading at a high multiple, relative to its peers or the overall market. Currently, the average P/E ratio among stocks listed on the benchmark S&P 500 index is near 25 times future earnings estimates.\n\nDuring the 2022 bear market, the average P/E ratio among U.S. stocks was closer to 17 times earnings. Stocks trading at extremely high multiples are often doing so because investors are banking on big future growth at the company, or because hype surrounding a stock is leading to a lot of people buying it. Value investors rigorously scrutinize valuations before buying a stock. Warren Buffett famously won’t buy a stock that has a P/E ratio above 15.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, let’s explore three overvalued tech stocks heading for a fall. Don’t slip up on them.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) looks pricey trading at 727 times future earnings estimates. In the last 12 months, CRWD stock has risen 167%, including a 57% year-to-date (YTD) gain. The sharp move higher has given CrowdStrike stock a lofty valuation. The high P/E multiple was one of the reasons the stock was recently downgraded by analysts at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR).\n\nPiper Sandler lowered its rating on CRWD stock to a hold equivalent neutral from an overweight buy equivalent rating previously. The analysts maintained their price target on the stock of $400. Also, Piper Sandler noted that CrowdStrike stock has few catalysts working in its favor currently. And, the risk/reward for the shares has become less favorable after the big move higher over the past year.\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) looks woefully overpriced right now trading at 443 times future earnings approximations. The company, whose software is used in cloud-computing, has seen its share price rise only about 34% in the last 12 months. However, the move has still pushed shares of the company, which went public in 2019, up to extreme heights relative to its earnings outlook.\n\nInvestors are clearly betting on big future growth at Datadog, which builds cloud monitoring and security products that work with Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other cloud platforms. Analysts are less convinced and have also been downgrading this stock. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) lowered its rating on DDOG stock to neutral from buy, dropping its price target to $105 from $123.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong semiconductor stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) looks pricey trading at 239 times future earnings estimates. AMD stock, which has risen 43% in the last 12 months, is more expensive than rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The latter’s share price is up 203% over the last year but currently trades at a P/E ratio of 75. Some analysts speculate that the valuation is holding back AMD stock.\n\nSince hitting a 52-week high in March of this year, AMD stock has declined nearly 30%. Lackluster financial results are part of the reason. But so too is the premium at which the stock has been trading based largely on hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). In June, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) downgraded AMD stock to a hold equivalent equal weight rating from a buy equivalent overweight rating. The investment bank held its price target on AMD stock at $176.\n\nIn their downgrade, the analysts cited Nvidia as a superior option in the semiconductor space that’s available at a cheaper multiple than AMD.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and MSFT. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years. He spent five years as a staff reporter at The Wall Street Journal, and has also written for The Washington Post and Toronto Star newspapers, as well as financial websites such as The Motley Fool and Investopedia.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget A.I.

        "title": "How the ‘junkification’ of Amazon sparked a race to the bottom against China",
        "content": "amazon box china\n\nNeed to buy a paintbrush? You might start in the same place millions of shoppers do every day: by opening the Amazon app. In the search results you will find a baffling array of brushes, sold by brands such as CNMTCCO, HTHL and Skaaisont, all largely indistinguishable from one another.\n\nIt isn’t just paintbrushes. Look for a cat food bowl and you will be presented with items from YUOHEE; yoga mats by Keplin; water bottles by AOHAN.\n\nThese are not household names: many of the brands are seemingly generated at random. But they are what shoppers are faced with when they search the world’s biggest online retailer for millions of everyday items: a volley of bargain and seemingly interchangeable Chinese brands jostling for attention.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn recent years the number of Chinese sellers on Amazon has exploded as the retailer has prioritised independent merchants over goods that it stocks and sells itself. At the start of July, 50.8pc of Amazon’s top sellers were based in China, according to research site Marketplace Pulse, up from 25.8pc at the end of 2018.\n\nAmazon, which celebrated its 30th anniversary on Friday, is now going further. In a presentation in Shenzhen last month, the company told manufacturers it would launch a “direct from China” service, in a challenge to fast-growing retailers such as Shein and Temu that have nipped at its dominance of online shopping.\n\nUnder the plan the company would sell low-priced items from warehouses in China, shipped to customers’ doorsteps in the West. Despite the company being associated with instant gratification, goods from China would take several days to arrive. The service is expected to launch by Christmas, although it will feature in a separate section of the app rather than bundled among other goods, at least at first.\n\nThe battle for e-commerce supremacy\n\nFor the first time in years, Amazon’s supremacy over e-commerce is under threat. Shein, which focuses on clothing, and Temu, which specialises in everyday household objects, have risen from obscurity to become hits with consumers in a way that Chinese predecessors such as Wish.com and AliExpress did not.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpending heavily on marketing and offering rock-bottom prices, the companies have shown that consumers are willing to sacrifice convenience and brand recognition in order to save a few pounds. Enders Analysis estimates that spending on Shein rose by 44pc last year to $42.3bn (£33bn). Spending on Temu rose from almost nothing to $14bn, and is expected to more than double this year.\n\nThe companies have taken advantage of what is seen by some as a tax loophole that exempts packages entering the UK, Europe and US from import duties if their value falls under a certain level. A US Congress committee found last year that more than 30pc of all packages entering the US under this “de minimis” threshold were from Temu and Shein – some 600,000 parcels a day. Sellers that ship to Amazon warehouses in the West in bulk, meanwhile, do pay the charges.\n\nClaire Holubowskyj of Enders Analysis calls Amazon’s response “highly defensive” and says its rivals’ performances have shown that the basis of the company’s success – offering fast shipping and peace of mind – may be fragile.\n\n“Their entire retail business is built on Prime [being] the best way to get something to you. And what Temu and Shein have proved is that, actually, people will buy the cheapest things from a site that they don’t necessarily, initially at least, trust very much. They don’t mind if it takes two weeks to arrive. But they’re still going to buy it because of that price. That will be the threatening aspect because of where it could go.\n\n“Amazon’s model for so long has been ‘if you want something we are the first place to come and the best place to come’. And that’s being put under a bit of pressure by people wanting to go elsewhere for the really cheap goods.”\n\nAmazon has already indicated that it is feeling the pressure. Last year it slashed fees on cheap clothing, Shein’s forté.\n\nCompeting for eyeballs\n\nBut there are other reasons for it to court the smorgasbord of relatively identikit Chinese brands.\n\nSmall merchants without much brand power have less bargaining power than household names. They must also pay to ensure they feature towards the top of search results (there are more than 2,000 results for “water bottle” on Amazon), either by jumping through hoops such as using the company’s own fulfilment network or by buying advertising space.\n\nAmazon now makes more money from advertising than Prime subscriptions, and with merchants desperate to compete for eyeballs, it is the company’s fastest-growing business.\n\n“The more commoditised the product or more competitive the product category, the higher the proportion of spend on ads,” Brian Wieser, an advertising industry analyst, recently wrote, arguing that Amazon’s new direct from China business would speed up advertising growth.\n\n“[Chinese merchants] have to advertise in order to reach consumers on Amazon. They’re not brand name companies. So consumers aren’t going to seek out and search for them by name,” says Sky Canaves, an analyst at eMarketer.\n\n‘Explosion in the catalogue’\n\nThere are flickering signs that Amazon’s embrace of overwhelming quantity has started to irk consumers. Customer satisfaction surveys have trended downwards in recent years, although the company’s ratings are typically above average. Customers often lament that Amazon has “got worse”, that the task of wading through sponsored results, haphazard product descriptions and incentivised reviews has diluted the one-click magic. The site’s transformation in recent years has been dubbed “junkification”.\n\nBut for now, it does not seem to be deterring shoppers. Amazon’s retail sales are at all-time highs and last month the company hit a $2 trillion valuation for the first time. Consumers do not necessarily demand quality when buying everyday items like garlic presses and clothes pegs.\n\n“Anyone can see the explosion in the catalogue, tens of thousands of similar or exactly the same products with different brand names, it’s all overwhelming. But it doesn’t seem like it has hurt Amazon,” says Juozas Kaziuk&edot;nas of Marketplace Pulse, who points out that rivals such as Walmart are now following the playbook.\n\nWhether that survives a deeper push into China remains to be seen. To the extent the company has gone downmarket, it has so far not been at the expense of speed: goods are still shipped from Amazon’s warehouses using its huge distribution network and typically delivered the next day.\n\nShipping from China will change that, possibly muddying the average shopper’s experience.\n\n“For people who have been shopping on Amazon for decades, to now go back to having items come in two weeks seems like a giant step back,” says Kaziuk&edot;nas. Canaves says that while Temu and Shein’s shoppers are largely motivated by price, Amazon’s tend to value speed.\n\nAmazon’s China push has only brought success to date, but its next step carries risk. Last week, Jeff Bezos revealed plans to sell $5bn worth of shares. The company’s founder has had a knack for cashing in while Amazon is riding high.",

        "title": "Forget Amazon: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) hit an all-time high this week after rising 53% over the last 12 months. The company has rallied Wall Street with multiple quarters of stellar financial growth and an expanding role in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmazon Web Services' (AWS) dominance in the cloud industry grants the company a promising position in AI, as more and more businesses turn to such platforms for their AI needs. Meanwhile, the company has announced a venture into chip design. Amazon has an exciting outlook in AI and would likely make an asset to any portfolio over the long term. However, its stock growth over the last year hasn't exactly matched its earnings growth, meaning its shares are slightly overpriced for now. AMZN PE Ratio Chart\n\nThis table shows Amazon has the highest price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow ratios out of some of the most prominent names in AI software. The figures suggest Amazon is currently one of the worst-valued stocks among its peers.\n\nHowever, two companies stand out as bargain buys in the space, indicating they could be worth considering over Amazon: Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). These tech giants are investing heavily in AI and could see significant gains as the industry develops.\n\nSo, forget Amazon and consider buying these two artificial intelligence stocks now.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is a no-brainer at its current price point. The company has delivered significant earnings and stock growth over the last year, yet is trading at a bargain price compared to its peers. Meanwhile, Alphabet has the brand power, tech, and cash reserves to go far in AI.\n\nThe company's Google Cloud platform holds an 11% market share in cloud computing, compared to AWS' 31%. It's the third-largest cloud company after Amazon and Microsoft. However, it's outpacing both in growth.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Google Cloud revenue jumped 28% year over year. Comparatively, the same period saw AWS sales rise by 17% and Microsoft Azure's revenue increase by 21%.\n\nAlphabet is investing billions in AI and is in a solid position to build a lucrative AI ecosystem around its products. As the home of potent brands like Android, YouTube, and the many services under Google, Alphabet has countless opportunities to boost its business with AI. The company has the potential to offer more efficient digital advertising, add generative features to its smartphone operating system, better track viewing trends on YouTube, and create a Google Search experience closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues GOOGL Chart\n\nMoreover, this chart shows Alphabet is a thoroughly reliable stock. Over the last five years, it has beaten Amazon in stock and free cash flow growth. Meanwhile, it has delivered a similar rise in operating income. In addition to its far better-valued share price, Alphabet is a screaming buy right now and a better AI stock than Amazon.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple's stock has risen 14% since Jan. 1. The figure is considerably lower than its peers, with Amazon's and Alphabet's stocks rising more than 30% during that time. Apple missed out on the initial boom in AI, preferring to take a more gradual approach to the market. However, recent developments suggest it could come back strong in the coming years.\n\nBloomberg reported on Jul. 2 that Apple is poised to get an observer role on ChatGPT developer OpenAI's board. The move follows an announcement at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference in June that revealed its smart assistant Siri will receive a major AI overhaul, making it more intuitive and able to answer hundreds of new questions. Siri will now pass off certain questions to ChatGPT as part of the update, making the OpenAI platform available to users through its iPhones, iPads, or Macs.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, \"The board observer role will put Apple on par with Microsoft Corp., OpenAI's biggest backer, and its main AI technology provider.\" Apple has been in steep competition with Microsoft for years, with both leaders in consumer tech and responsible for the two most used computer operating systems. As a result, Apple's seat at OpenAI's table could bring its AI technology more in line with its rival and boost its entire position in the industry. AAPL Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nThis table shows that Apple is potentially better financially equipped than Amazon or Microsoft to expand in AI. The company is a cash cow, with far more free cash flow and operating income over the last five years. So, despite its slower approach to AI, I wouldn't be against it carving out a lucrative position in the sector over the long term.\n\nAlongside its better-valued stock price, Apple is worth considering over Amazon stock this July.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "45% of Warren Buffett's $398 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett led the Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) holding company since 1965. He likes to invest in companies with steady growth, reliable profitability, strong management teams, and shareholder-friendly initiatives like dividend payments and stock buyback programs.\n\nThat strategy is working: Berkshire delivered a 4,384,748% return between 1965 and 2023. That translates to a compound annual gain of 19.8%, which is nearly double the 10.2% annual return of the benchmark S&P 500 index over the same period. In dollar terms, an investment of $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway stock in 1965 would have grown to over $43 million, whereas the same investment in the S&P 500, with dividends reinvested, would be worth just $312,333.\n\nBuffett isn't the type of investor who chases the latest stock market trends, so you won't find him piling into red-hot artificial intelligence (AI) stocks today. But three stocks Berkshire already owns are set to benefit tremendously from AI, and they account for more than 45% of the conglomerate's entire $398.7 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Snowflake: 0.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nSnowflake (NYSE: SNOW) developed its Data Cloud to help businesses aggregate their critical data onto one platform, where it can be analyzed more effectively to extract its maximum value. The service was designed for use by large, complex organizations that work with multiple cloud providers (like Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud), a situation that often leads to the creation of data silos.\n\nThen last year, Snowflake launched its Cortex AI platform, which allows businesses to combine ready-made large language models (LLMs) with their own data to create generative AI applications. Cortex also comes with a suite of AI tools such as Document AI, which allows businesses to extract valuable data from unstructured sources like invoices or contracts, and Snowflake's Copilot virtual assistant, which can be prompted using natural language to provide valuable insights across the Snowflake platform.\n\nIn the company's fiscal 2025 first quarter, which ended April 30, Snowflake's product revenue came in at $789.6 million, a 34% increase from the year-ago period. That's a robust growth rate at face value, but it continued a trend of deceleration from prior quarters. Though Snowflake continues to invest heavily in growth initiatives like marketing and research and development, it is acquiring new customers at a slowing rate, and its existing customers are expanding their spending with it more slowly.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway bought its stake in Snowflake around the time of the data cloud specialist's initial public offering in 2020, so it likely paid around $120 per share. The stock soared to as high as $392 in 2021, but it has since declined by 63% from that level and now trades at $142. Unfortunately, due to the company's slowing growth, the stock still appears to be quite expensive, so this is one Berkshire pick investors might want to avoid (for now).\n\n2. Amazon: 0.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock in 2019, and Buffett has often expressed regret that he didn't spot the opportunity sooner. Amazon was founded as an e-commerce company, but it expanded into cloud computing, streaming, digital advertising, and now, AI.\n\nIts Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division designed its own data center chips which can be up to 50% cheaper for AI developers to use compared to its other infrastructure powered by Nvidia's chips. Plus, the Amazon Bedrock platform offers developers a library of ready-made LLMs from some of the industry's leading start-ups, in addition to a family of LLMs called Titan that Amazon built in-house.\n\nIn essence, AWS wants to become the go-to destination for developers looking to create their own AI applications. Various Wall Street forecasts suggest AI will add anywhere from $7 trillion to $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade, potentially making it Amazon's largest opportunity ever.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway owns a $2 billion stake in Amazon, representing just 0.5% of the conglomerate's stock portfolio. AI could drive substantial growth for the company over the long term, so if Buffett wished that position was larger before, he might be kicking himself for not adding to it sooner after this next chapter unfolds.\n\n3. Apple: 44.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is Berkshire Hathaway's largest position by far. The conglomerate has spent around $38 billion accumulating shares starting in 2016, and its position is now worth $177.6 billion -- even after it sold 13% of its stake (for tax reasons) earlier this year. Apple makes some of the world's most popular devices including the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, and the Mac line of computers.\n\nThe company is entering the world of AI with its new Apple Intelligence software, which will be released alongside the iOS 18 operating system in September. It was developed in partnership with OpenAI, and it's set to transform the user experience for Apple's devices. Its Siri voice assistant will lean on the capabilities of ChatGPT, as will its writing tools like Notes, Mail, and iMessage, to help users rapidly craft content.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, meaning this company could soon become the largest distributor of AI to consumers. The upcoming iPhone 16 could drive a significant upgrade cycle, because it is expected to come with a powerful new chip capable of processing AI workloads on-device.\n\nApple ticks all of Buffett's boxes for a stock pick. It has grown steadily since Berkshire first invested in 2016, it's consistently profitable, it has a resolute leader in CEO Tim Cook, and it returns truckloads of money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. In fact, Apple just announced a new buyback program worth $110 billion -- the largest in the history of corporate America.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Snowflake right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Snowflake wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia will win the race to a $4 trillion market cap—but the long-term big tech battle might be different, experts say",
        "content": "A surprisingly resilient economy and profit-filled AI boom are driving the United States’ big tech giants toward a milestone that would have seemed impossible just a few decades ago. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple have all surpassed the $3 trillion market capitalization mark, and Google and Amazon are following close behind in the $2 trillion range.\n\nCombined, these five tech giants alone are now worth more than $14.5 trillion and make up roughly 32% of the S&P 500. For reference, in 2002, after the dot-com bubble burst, the total market capitalization of every U.S. stock was $11.1 trillion, according to Siblis Research data. Big tech’s performance has been particularly impressive this year, with Nvidia, for example, surging from a $2 trillion market cap to a $3 trillion market cap in under 100 days.\n\nThat begs the question: which tech giant will hit the next big milestone, $4 trillion in market cap, first? Some bears argue that big tech companies’ record run of performance can’t continue forever, given their elevated valuations and the slowing economy, while the bulls believe this is just the beginning of a streak of AI-induced wins for big tech.\n\n“I think, a year from now, we [will] have three $4 trillion market cap companies: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told Fortune.\n\nHe argued that many of his peers on Wall Street continue to underestimate the AI revolution and the health of the U.S. economy. “Unless you have a telescope, you can't find a recession. And the Fed? Their next move is a cut not a hike. So, to me, all signs are bullish,” he said. “It's 9 pm, and the party goes to 4 am…the haters will hate, continuing to say that this is a bubble.”\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\nNvidia\n\nThere are, of course, a wide range of views on where big tech companies are headed, but many experts are convinced that chip giant Nvidia will be the first to reach the $4 trillion market cap mark, driven by the seemingly unending thirst for its AI-enabling hardware.\n\n“The first one to get there is likely to be the godfather of AI Jensen [Huang] and Nvidia, because they’re the only game in town—their GPUs are the new oil or gold in the tech world with no real competition,” Ives said.\n\nNvidia stock has surged roughly 160% year to date and more than 3,000% over the past five years. That’s led some analysts to warn that the tech giant’s valuation has become stretched, and doesn’t account for rising competition in the semiconductor market.\n\nAs David Trainer, founder and CEO of research firm New Constructs, told Fortune’s Shawn Tully last month: “Nvidia’s valuation is ridiculous. It’s facing the same curse as Tesla. But when Tesla got profitable, loads of competitors entered the EV space, cutting margins and slowing sales. The same will happen with Nvidia.”\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Ives noted that even though Nvidia’s shares have surged, its revenues and earnings have followed suit. Nvidia raked in a record $26 billion in revenues and $14.8 billion in net income in the quarter that ended this April. In 2021, during the same quarter, the company had revenues of just $5.8 billion and net income of $1.9 billion.\n\nLouis Navellier, founder and chairman of family office Navellier & Associates, also brushed off the competition argument, claiming Nvidia essentially has a “monopoly” on key AI chips which will lead to consistent sales and earnings growth for years to come. “And, you know, Jensen is kind of like the new Elon, he’s got kind of a cult status,” he said, adding that will continue to drive retail investors in the stock.\n\nNvidia’s market capitalization as of July 5: $3.14 trillion\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft’s booming cloud business and big investment into ChatGPT creator OpenAI have buoyed its shares over the past few years. But it’s the company’s diverse and sustainable revenue streams that will lead it to a $4 trillion market cap, according to Tim Pagliara, founder and chief investment officer of independent wealth management firm CapWealth.\n\nHe said Nvidia may briefly touch the $4 trillion milestone first, due to what he called the current AI “mania,” but Microsoft will be the “more sustainable” $4 trillion company.\n\n“They're embracing AI, but they also have just a tremendous number of things in the pipeline. And I know as a small business owner, we just gladly keep paying them more per user per month for everything from Azure to some of the additional add ons that they have created for security and things like that,” he added, referencing Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing business.\n\nPagliara thinks Microsoft’s big tech rivals have riskier business models as well. Apple is dependent on consumers buying into its new iPhone offerings every few years, and Nvidia is benefiting from a lack of competition in the near term, he said. Meanwhile, Microsoft has multiple avenues for consistent revenue growth from the Azure cloud business and Office 365 to Windows and Linkedin.\n\nMarket cap: $3.48 trillion\n\nApple\n\nWhen it comes to a longer-term outlook, Apple is high on many analysts’ lists because of its potential to use AI to get customers to upgrade their current phones and lure in more iPhone customers. It may not be the first to reach a $4 trillion market cap, but it will get there soon, these bulls say.\n\n“I think over the next two, three years, the largest market cap that we will see is Apple, because they have 2.2 billion iOS devices,” Ives predicted. “Consumer AI is going to go through the walls for Cupertino—they are only in the beginning of an AI-driven supercycle.”\n\nLouis Navellier was also optimistic about Apple’s future, but he said it will need a few “little breakthroughs” to get more customers to buy new iPhones.\n\nHe pointed to new AI tools and the potential for folding iPhones as examples. “I don't know if they're going to announce that in September, but if they do, it will be a $2,500 phone, and it will sell like crazy and send that stock soaring.”\n\nMarket cap: $3.46 trillion\n\nWhat about Alphabet and Amazon?\n\nThe Google parent’s market cap is currently $2.36 trillion, leaving it well shy of the $4 trillion mark. Analysts said Alphabet will be able to capitalize on the AI revolution, but its missteps with hallucinations have left it behind, and its cloud business isn’t performing as well as others. However, the search giant is taking talent from its peers in an attempt to catch up, recent reports have shown.\n\nIt’s a similar story for Amazon, which just recently passed the $2 trillion milestone, and experts expect it will take time for share prices to nearly double. Wedbush’s Ives argued that Amazon’s cloud business, AWS, has also lost out to Microsoft. “​​I think there was some hubris in underestimating what Nadella and Microsoft are doing, and with the crosstown rivals and in that 2-0-6 area code, it's been a bit of a gut punch for Amazon,” he said.\n\nAnd when it comes to AI, Amazon is just “behind the eightball” too, according to the veteran tech analyst. However, Ives noted that CEO Andy Jassy has made changes to the company’s cloud business, and with a massive base of customers, Amazon should benefit more from AI moving forward.\n\nTo be sure, every tech giant on this list also faces risks. Antitrust regulations, cyber attacks, a slowing economy, and a reduction in AI spending should all be considered. But for now, the bulls remain bullish–and they think you should be too.\n\n“The tech bears with their spreadsheets and valuations will stay in hibernation mode,” Ives said. “But when everyone meets for breakfast at 6 am after this AI party. The bulls [will have] won and the bears just sound smart.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 3 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "Wall Street investors have been paying close attention to the growth of the cloud computing sector. According to a recent survey, 94% of major companies worldwide utilize cloud computing in their operations. Businesses are migrating their operations and data onto cloud platforms, seeking the benefits of scalability, cost-efficiency and enhanced security. From remote workforces to on-demand storage, cloud solutions offer agility and flexibility that traditional IT infrastructure simply can’t match.\n\nMeanwhile, cloud platforms are continuously evolving, offering new features and services such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced analytics. Companies that invest in these technologies can gain a competitive edge, making cloud providers indispensable partners.\n\nFurther highlighting the sector’s strength, the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (NASDAQ:SKYY) has already gained over 12% year-to-date (YTD). SKYY is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) providing exposure to U.S. companies involved in the cloud computing industry. This strong performance reflects the high demand from investors seeking a diversified play on the cloud computing industry. With that being said, here are three best cloud computing stocks that could be prime candidates for significant growth in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst up on our list of best cloud computing stocks is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Unequivocally regarded as the global e-commerce leader, Amazon’s reach extends far beyond online retail. Through Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company has become a dominant player in the cloud computing industry, too. AWS offers a comprehensive suite of on-demand cloud computing services, including storage, compute power, databases, networking, analytics, and machine learning.\n\nAmazon delivered solid first quarter of fiscal year 2024 results, with net sales climbing 13% year-over-year (YOY) to $143.3 billion. Investors noted that AWS revenue jumped by 17% to $25 billion. Furthermore, net income and diluted EPS both skyrocketed around 220% to $10.4 billion and 98 cents, respectively.\n\nIn late April, AWS announced the launch of Amazon Q, a powerful generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) assistant. Amazon Q is designed to improve software development tasks, such as generating, testing and transforming code. This AI tool could also empower businesses to leverage internal data, streamlining data utilization across various departments.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far in 2024, AMZN stock has soared more than 30%.  The shares are trading at 41.2 times forward earnings and 3.5 times sales. Analysts have a 12-month price target of $220 for AMZN, signaling a 10% upside potential.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nWindows and Office, the operating system and productivity suite, have cemented Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a household name. However, a significant growth engine for MSFT in recent years has been Microsoft Azure, its cloud computing platform. Azure offers a robust portfolio of cloud solutions, including virtual machines, storage, databases, analytics and AI tools.\n\nMicrosoft, the second name among our best cloud computing stocks to buy, delivered a robust fiscal third-quarter report with revenue climbing 17% YOY to $61.9 billion. This growth was fueled by surging demand for Microsoft Cloud services, which saw revenue surge 23% YOY to $35.1 billion. Profitability also improved, as net income and diluted earnings per share both increased 20%, reaching $21.9 billion and $2.94 respectively.\n\nCurrently, Microsoft Azure is addressing developer needs with its new stock keeping unit (SKU) for its Azure Bastion service: Bastion Developer. This low-cost, zero-configuration solution offers secure-by-default connectivity to Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). It also eliminates the need for complex configurations, public IP addresses and other security risks traditionally associated with VM access.\n\nMSFT stock has surged more than 22% YTD. The shares are currently trading at 43.3 times forward earnings and 14.4 times sales. Wall Street has a 12-month median price forecast of $480 for MSFT, suggesting 5% upside.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nRounding out our discussion of best cloud computing stocks is ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW). While not directly providing cloud computing infrastructure, ServiceNow instead focuses on a specialized cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform for enterprise workflow management.\n\nIts “Now Platform” streamlines digital workflows across various IT operations functions, including incident management, problem resolution and change management. This cloud-based approach allows enterprises to automate processes, improve efficiency, and gain real-time visibility into their IT operations.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, ServiceNow reported robust financials, with total revenues exceeding $2.6 billion for 24% YOY growth.

        "title": "Amazon Is Now the Best-Performing Stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average In 2024. Is It a Buy Around Its All-Time High?",
        "content": "Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average in late February -- giving the traditionally stodgy, income-oriented index more exposure to growth.\n\nAmazon has continued its torrid run since 2023. As of June 27, it is the best-performing stock in the index.\n\nHere's why Amazon continues to climb higher and whether the growth stock is worth buying around its all-time high. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon is gushing cash\n\nBefore changing its name to Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Google was named after its flagship search engine. But YouTube is arguably Alphabet's crown jewel. Facebook was named after its flagship social media app, but then changed its name to Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Instagram is arguably more valuable than Facebook today. Similarly, Amazon is named after its only retail outlet, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) is where much of the value lies.\n\nAWS is the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure. According to HG Insights 2023 Infrastructure as a Service Market Report, AWS had a 50.1% market share among the top 10 cloud providers and the highest year-over-year customer count growth at 31%. AWS has been tapping into start-ups, with 86% of AWS customers spending less than $1,000 a month on AWS services -- according to HG Insights.\n\nThe impact of AWS on the broader business is undeniable. Here's a look at Amazon's trailing-12-month (TTM) results as of the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same periods over the last five years.\n\nMetric Q1 2020 TTM Q1 2021 TTM Q1 2022 TTM Q1 2023 TTM Q1 2024 TTM North America revenue $181.09 billion $254.52 billion $284.71 billion $323.52 billion $362.29 billion North America operating income $6.06 billion $10.79 billion $2.25 billion ($381 million) $18.96 billion International revenue $77.64 billion $115.96 billion $125.9 billion $118.37 billion $134.01 billion International operating income ($2 billion) $2.37 billion ($3.46 billion) ($7.71 billion) $903 million AWS revenue $37.55 billion $48.65 billion $67.14 billion $83 billion $94.44 billion AWS operating income $10.05 billion $14.62 billion $20.89 billion $21.45 billion $28.93 billion\n\nData source: Amazon.\n\nNotice the inconsistent operating income from Amazon's North America and international segments, as well as the somewhat sluggish top-line growth. Meanwhile, AWS has been a juggernaut, with TTM operating income increasing nearly threefold in just five years.\n\nThe most impressive metric in this table is that AWS operating income has grown faster than AWS revenue, suggesting that margins are improving. Not long ago, one of the biggest red flags for Amazon's investment thesis was that AWS couldn't keep up its margins in the face of mounting competition. But the results tell a different story and are likely a reason why the stock has been crushing the market as of late.\n\nStory continues AMZN Chart\n\nA higher-quality business\n\nAmazon is notorious for reinvesting profits back into the company. So using net income-based metrics like the price-to-earnings ratio can be unhelpful. Traditionally, Amazon's go-to metric was its price-to-sales ratio, which is the value of a company compared to its revenue. In the following chart, you'll notice that Amazon's P/S ratio is higher than historical levels -- suggesting the stock is more expensive. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe P/S ratio can be useful when dealing with a consistent business over a period of time. But the issue with using it to evaluate Amazon is that the company is fundamentally different today than it was even two to three years ago because of the growth of AWS. That's why I think the best way to value Amazon is by looking at its P/S ratio within the context of its operating income and operating margin. AMZN Cash from Operations (TTM) Chart\n\nThis chart is perhaps the simplest way to visualize Amazon's success. Amazon's TTM operating income is nearly $100 billion, and its operating margin is at a 10-year high thanks to AWS and a rebound in its North America and international segments.\n\nPaying a 3.53 P/S ratio for a high-growth, low-margin business is one thing. But that same ratio for a company growing its top line and expanding margins is entirely different.\n\nThe biggest bull case for Amazon is that it is within striking distance of its historical P/S ratio, but the quality of the business is vastly improved, and it is on a path toward consistent profitability. After all, analyst consensus estimates call for $4.55 in 2024 earnings per share (EPS) and $5.78 in 2025 EPS -- giving Amazon a 34.1 P/E based on 2025 estimated earnings. That's not a sky-high valuation -- especially when considering the stock is up 130% in 18 months.\n\nAmazon is stretched thin but is still a good buy\n\nAmazon is at the top of its game, but its stock chart reflects that. Warren Buffett once said, \"You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.\" In other words, consensus positivity toward a company usually results in an expensive stock price, just as an out-of-favor stock can be quite cheap.\n\nLess than two years ago, Amazon was under immense pressure due to slowing growth and recession fears. It was the opposite of a cheery consensus. Today, Amazon is, once again, a darling. But the long-term investment thesis has also gotten stronger as AWS continues to be a high-margin growth engine that can fuel the company's other exploits.\n\nAll told, Amazon is a decent buy, but it is no longer the no-brainer buy it was before. It still must grow into its valuation and prove its higher margins aren't a one-off. If growth slows, expect Amazon to be under pressure.\n\nThe higher a stock runs up in the short term, the more its valuation gets stretched. But over the long term, Amazon certainly has the trajectory needed to compound earnings and benefit patient investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Worth a Read! 3 Hot Publishing Stocks to Buy This Summer.",
        "content": "Publishing stocks are shares of companies that publish books, newspapers, magazines, literature, journals, educational materials and other forms of media.\n\nMost folks tend to overlook publishing stocks because they don’t find them as glamorous as tech or exciting startups. Also, there’s a perception that the publishing industry is circling the drain — due to competition from digital platforms.\n\nAs such, you’re not likely to find the average investor scouring through financial news to identify which publishing stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThough it had to adapt to inevitable technological shifts (cue e-readers, audiobooks and so on), just like any other industry, the publishing industry is thriving — if the companies below are anything to go by.\n\nIf you’re looking to diversify your investment portfolio, publishing stocks could be an interesting option. Here are our top picks for hot publishing stocks to buy this summer.\n\nEducational Development (EDUC) GNS stock: a child in front of a laptop taking notes while viewing an online class\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEducational Development (NASDAQ:EDUC) is a publishing company for children’s books. It sells its books via two business segments. The first is PaperPie — its home business division that sells directly to consumers at parties, book fairs, schools, public libraries and more.\n\nThe other segment is a retail division that sells books and educational materials to bookstores, toy stores, specialty shops, museums and other locations.\n\nThough the company has almost nil analyst coverage, it’s one of the best-performing stocks in 2024. After opening the year at the ballpark price of $1.14, EDUC shares are now going for $1.86 a piece — a change of 63% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nAnd that’s not all. EDUC’s price has more than doubled at various points in the year, returning over 100%. There’s no reason why Educational Development can’t continue with that trajectory throughout the rest of the year. It’s definitely among the best publishing stocks in the market right now.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been dubbed “The Everything Company,” thanks to venturing into pretty much nearly every conceivable market and industry, from e-commerce to cloud computing to entertainment to publishing.\n\nThe company has Amazon Publishing (APub), whose portfolio includes several imprints across different genres, including AmazonEncore, AmazonCrossing, Thomas & Mercer, Montlake Romance and the e-reader Kindle.\n\nObviously, Amazon is not a pure-play publishing stock. But it’s one of the best in the market for investors who want exposure to the publishing sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust last week, the company crossed $2 trillion in market cap for the first time, joining just one of four others to do so. Shares of the company have added 30% YTD.\n\nAs you’d expect, Wall Street analysts overwhelmingly recommend buying Amazon stock. Out of 65 ratings, 53 recommend buying, with 9 rating it Overweight and just 3 rating it Neutral.\n\nWith such a strong market presence and performance, Amazon is a great starting point to dip your toes in publishing stocks.\n\nJohn Wiley & Sons (WLY) text books on a desk with a chalkboard in the background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nJohn Wiley & Sons (NYSE:WLY) is another under-the-radar publishing stock but one you might want to look into this summer. Despite mixed Q4 results for its 2024 fiscal year, the New Jersey-based publisher’s shares have returned over 36% YTD.\n\nThe company reported a Research revenue loss of 3% for the fourth quarter and the year but an 18% increase in Learning for the quarter. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) also sunk 19% for the fiscal year.\n\nHowever, it seems the market shrugged off the mixed results and is focusing on the company’s long-term outlook based on its forecasts. The company expects adjusted EPS to reach $3.43 at the midpoint in Fiscal 2025 — a 23% jump. WLY also said it is on target to hit its 2026 goals.\n\nThe Wiley company has been around for over two centuries and is one of the most trusted publishing brands in the industry. It has partnerships with household names across different industries, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the Culinary Institute of America, the National Geographic Society and the London School of Economics.\n\nOn the date of publication, Hope Mutie did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the stocks mentioned in this article.

        "content": "It's understandable if investors believe that to achieve outsize returns, it's necessary to find under-the-radar businesses that can grow rapidly. But this just isn't true. Compelling investment ideas could be hiding in plain sight.\n\nThere's one fantastic company whose shares have catapulted 1,090% higher in the past decade. This enterprise is currently valued at greater than $2 trillion, but I believe it still deserves a closer look.\n\nHere's the ultimate growth stock to buy with $1,000 right now, which would afford you five shares.\n\nSecular trends\n\nThe business in question is none other than Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The tech titan is one of the most well-known companies on Earth. Despite its scale, as exemplified by trailing-12-month revenue of $591 billion, there is still meaningful growth potential in the years ahead, thanks to multiple secular tailwinds.\n\nWith a whopping 38% share of all online retail sales in the U.S., Amazon is the clear leader in the e-commerce space. This has been true for a long time. The business sells virtually every product category you can think of, a far cry from the days when all it offered was books.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 84% of retail spending in this country is still represented by brick-and-mortar shopping. Amazon is in a prime position to benefit as online shopping increases its penetration rate over time.\n\nAnother growth area is streaming entertainment. The decline of traditional cable TV bundles has made way for new on-demand services to flourish. With Amazon Prime Video, which has more than 200 million members, the company has a top competitor in the so-called streaming wars.\n\nPrime Video also gives Amazon a hand in the digital ad industry. Given that the popular amazon.com site attracts billions of visitors each month, the business has opportunities to monetize this attention via advertising revenue. While Alphabet and Meta Platforms currently dominate the digital ad market, Amazon is in the third position in terms of revenue share.\n\nThe company should see healthy sales growth for a long time as it benefits from long-term tailwinds in the e-commerce, streaming, and digital ad industries.\n\nInvesting in AI\n\nAstute readers will notice that a crucial segment still hasn't been discussed. And that's Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing segment that commands industry-leading market share. It's important to understand that the shift of businesses spending more money on off-premises tech infrastructure will continue to propel Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS is a major growth engine, as sales were up 17% in the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31). Moreover, it's an extremely profitable segment, reporting an outstanding operating margin of 37.6% in Q1. The entire company's profitability can mostly be attributed to AWS.\n\nThis division also positions Amazon favorably in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. I believe that AI, regardless of how much excitement there seems to be, won't necessarily create groundbreaking new products and services. Instead, I think AI can bolster existing offerings that companies already provide to their customers.\n\nBy more aggressively leaning into AI innovation and capabilities, AWS is poised to become an even more mission-critical partner to its client base. With plans to invest $100 billion in data centers over the next 10 years to expand AI capacity, the business is positioning itself for lasting success.\n\nWhat about the valuation?\n\nDespite Amazon's monster performance historically, which has surely made some investors rich, the stock still looks reasonably valued today. This might be surprising to market observers who believe they might have missed the boat.\n\nThe company's market cap is about 20 times the company's estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF) of about $100 billion. Because of the likelihood that FCF is poised to grow for many years, this looks like a compelling entry point.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Jeff Bezos To Sell $5 Billion In Amazon Shares: Could He Be Raising Cash For Seattle Seahawks Purchase?\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos is selling another portion of his stake in the company, which comes years after stepping down from the CEO role.\n\nWhat Happened: Bezos departed from Amazon’s c-suite in 2021, a role he held for the 27 years since the company was founded. The Amazon founder now serves as the e-commerce giant’s executive chair. He’s been selling a portion of his Amazon stake this year.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. Miami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city before that happens. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nBezos sold $8.5 billion in shares in February. A Tuesday SEC filing by Amazon shows Bezos plans on selling 25 million Amazon shares valued at $4.93 billion.\n\nThe new sale would bring Bezos’ total sold to around $13.4 billion in stock in 2024. Bezos owns around 9% of Amazon shares, according to a report from the Financial Times.\n\nWhat's Next: Bezos could be selling shares for a number of reasons. The Amazon founder is spending more time working on his space company Blue Origin and other ventures.\n\nBezos is also set to wed Lauren Sanchez and has spent more time vacationing aboard his $500 million yacht Koru, which costs $25 million annually to operate.\n\nSpeculation could grow that Bezos is raising cash to make a push to own a National Football League team. Bezos was previously linked with making a bid for the Washington Commanders, a D.C.-based NFL team.\n\nReports said Bezos may have been blocked from bidding due to a personal grudge held by former Commanders owner Daniel Snyder. In the end, Bezos didn't formally bid on the team and the Commanders were sold to a group for $6.05 billion.\n\nTrending:How do billionaires pay less in income tax than you? Tax deferring is their number one strategy.\n\nThe sale was the largest in sports history, but could be topped if more NFL teams are sold in the future.\n\nBezos has been linked to making a push to buying the Seattle Seahawks. A previous Washington Post report said NFL owners support Bezos joining the league.\n\n\"Other owners have expressed a desire for Bezos to buy a team. Bezos could get that opportunity if he pursues the Seattle Seahawks. That team is expected to be sold in the coming years,\" the report said.\n\nThe report said, \"Bezos knows that Seattle is sitting there.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Seahawks, who were valued at $5 billion by Forbes last year, are owned by the Paul G. Allen Trust. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen previously owned the team before his death in 2018. The assets are expected to be sold in the coming years. Allen made instructions that the trust would be liquidated after his death with proceeds going to philanthropic efforts.\n\nWhile Bezos may have moved from Seattle to Florida, the Amazon founder will forever be linked to the Washington city and the Seahawks could lure him back to the city, at least on a part-time basis.\n\nOne lingering question mark could be whether the NFL would approve a sale to Bezos with Amazon.com having broadcast rights to Thursday Night Football games.\n\nBezos is worth $222 billion, ranking second in the world in wealth behind Elon Musk ($241 billion), according to Bloomberg.\n\nAMZN Price Action: Amazon shares are down 1% to $197.82 Wednesday after hitting new all-time highs of $200.43 on Tuesday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US.

        "title": "Stocks are at record highs. Investors keep playing the hits.",
        "content": "Stocks are trading at record highs, and the market's main characters haven't changed.\n\nYahoo Finance's data whiz Jared Blikre flagged the stocks making new intraday record highs alongside the index on Friday. The names are a who's who of market leaders with only one exception — Nvidia stock (NVDA) was down after receiving a downgrade from New Street Research.\n\nApple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Costco (COST), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Walmart (WMT), on the other hand, all saw their stocks trade at intraday records on Friday.\n\nInvestors can maybe point to the soft jobs report and the prospect of lower interest rates as a catalyst for the move. At least for a chunk of these winners.\n\nTech was the biggest winner of low-interest-rate environments over the last decade, and the so-called hyperscalers in the AI race — Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet among them — are set to be the arms dealers should another speculative investment boom break out.\n\nBut on Wall Street, it appears that spending too much time in this market teasing out the fundamental particularities of why the same group of market leaders continues to lead the market is no longer a worthwhile exercise.\n\nTo wit: Piper Sandler's chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz on Wednesday dropped coverage of the S&P 500, writing that, \"Talking about the S&P 500 to communicate investment insights to institutional investors has become an exercise in futility.\"\n\nThe 10 biggest stocks in the index account for almost 40% of the index's market cap, Kantrowitz noted. And both the index's returns and earnings growth are being driven by this small handful of companies.\n\nRather than reflecting a broad swath of the corporate world's fortunes, then, the so-called benchmark stock index has become captive to the AI trade. For some, this is not a flaw of the index, but a feature, as argued by strategists at the BlackRock Investment Institute last week.\n\nSure, the S&P 500 may seem to tip out of balance, reflecting the fortunes of a privileged few over the more measured progress (or struggles) of the quieter majority. But the concept of an index is that investors can capture the market return in whatever form that takes.\n\nThis dynamic often benefits the DIY investor class looking for cheap exposure to \"the market,\" but it is a thorn in the side of portfolio managers who charge institutions more for their services as they seek to best the returns available to the masses.\n\nSaid another way, what institutional investors seek are returns — preferably returns that beat the market, of course — but most importantly, returns that do not come in whatever form the market takes. For big-money investors, safety is often paramount. And AI hype minting new multi-trillion dollar winners each week doesn't exactly scream safe by this measure.\n\nStory continues\n\nBack in 2020, before the pandemic turned markets upside down, we talked to Tom Lee at Fundstrat who saw the rally in Tesla (TSLA) stock that year as a sign of investors chasing their benchmark. Tesla stock, at the time, was responsible for a large chunk of the gains in the Russell 1000 Growth index (VONG), an index favored as the benchmark by many of Fundstrat's clients at the time.\n\nIn an effort to make up this gap, clients had a simple card to play: buy Tesla.\n\nFriday's market action — and much of what has been seen in stocks since May — seems reminiscent.\n\nBecause if the benchmark index is no longer a useful benchmark, a portfolio manager has a (seemingly) simple choice to make: either buy more of the stocks leading your benchmark, or find another way to explain your performance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Jeff Bezos, Andy Jassy, and the next 30 years of Cadabra",
        "content": "Happy Friday. This is Fortune tech correspondent Jason Del Rey.\n\nAt Amazon's founding 30 years ago today, its name wasn’t even Amazon. It was Cadabra—short for abracadabra.\n\nAs in magic.\n\nFor the last three decades, when Amazon operates at its best, magic is just what it can feel like for customers. Endless aisles of merchandise available with a click of a button from just about anywhere. Magic. An item showing up at your door mere hours after pressing “Buy Now.” Magic. The ability to grab a juice off the shelf at a corner store and legally walk out without stopping to pay, or maybe you do stop to pay—but with your freaking palm. Magic.\n\nAt one time or another, you could say something similar about an experience across Amazon’s other business lines too, whether it be Kindle, Amazon Web Services, or maybe even Prime Video. Someday, that might be the feeling people also get when they use Amazon’s healthcare service or Kuiper satellite broadband offering or an invention that isn’t even in the works yet, like an Amazon commercial airline or something far afield that only the AI gods could predict.\n\nFor the first 27 of Amazon’s 30 years of existence, Jeff Bezos drove this magic machine. With an entrepreneur’s optimistic eyes consistently fixed on the future, there was much less time spent examining the collateral damage left in the company’s wake: The independent merchants that were burned, the startups that were cloned, the workers grinded through until they felt like just another number swallowed whole by sky-high turnover rates.\n\nReally while only on the way out the CEO door in 2021, in his last annual letter to shareholders, did Bezos seem to grapple with at least some of the more complicated chapters of his Amazon legacy that he long seemed to look past.\n\n“I think we need to do a better job for our employees,” he wrote in the letter.\n\n“[I]t’s clear to me,” he added, “that we need a better vision for how we create value for employees—a vision for their success.”\n\nWith those words, a new Amazon Leadership Principle was born in 2021: Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer. A second new one, Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility, accompanied it.\n\nA few days after that announcement, Bezos handed the CEO reins to longtime protege Andy Jassy. Bezos’ one-time “shadow,” or chief of staff, Jassy was also the founding CEO of Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing division that will generate more than $100 billion in revenue on its own in 2024.\n\nSurely no one needs to feel bad for him but, three years in, Jassy’s job is perhaps more challenging than Bezos' ever was. Not only does he need to protect the $2 trillion empire that a Bezos-led Amazon built, but also invent new magic for customers…and investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll the while, he’ll be the one contending with the fallout from all of Amazon’s empire-building that came before. A historic antitrust lawsuit filed by the FTC. A renewed labor uprising thanks in part to the Teamsters. The list is long.\n\nIf Amazon is still standing 30 years from today, the Andy Jassy era will play a crucial role in determining whatever it evolves into next. One question is how much customer magic will remain. The other: What did Amazon’s leaders do to limit the negative impacts of their quest for cadabra?\n\nJason Del Rey\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThe rest of today’s Data Sheet was written by David Meyer.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon AMZN has experienced a 30.1% surge in its stock price year to date (YTD), outperforming the Zacks Internet – Commerce industry and S&P 500 index, which have returned 21.5% and 16.7%, respectively. The e-commerce giant achieved a milestone by exceeding the market capitalization of $2 trillion late last month for the first time, currently standing at $2.06 trillion as of Jul 3.\r\n\r\nThe company is witnessing growing investor confidence in its cloud business, generative AI capabilities and most importantly its retail business, which contributes the most to its revenues.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s e-commerce dominance, driven by solid Prime momentum, is the primary growth factor behind the success of its retail business. Its distribution strength, expanding fulfillment network, ultrafast deliveries via drones and momentum in cashierless technology are other positives.\r\n\r\nA strong global footprint, along with meaningful progress in emerging geographies like India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, the Middle East and Africa, is a plus.\n\nAMZN’s Year-to-Date Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPrime Momentum Boosts E-commerce Strength\n\nAmazon’s solid Prime momentum, thanks to Prime benefits, including a strong loyalty system, customer-friendly offers, quick grocery delivery services and robust Prime Free One-Day and Prime Free Same-Day Delivery services, are constantly driving its growth in the booming e-commerce market, which, as per a report from IMARC Group, is expected to hit $183.8 trillion by 2032 by registering a CAGR of 27.2% over a period of 2024-2032.\r\n\r\nStrengthening relationships with third-party sellers on the company’s e-commerce platform is a major positive for its online retail business.\r\n\r\nGrowing momentum in ‘Buy with Prime’ on the back of strategic partnerships with Salesforce CRM and Shopify SHOP is helping the company gain solid traction among various merchants.\r\n\r\nAMZN’s offering of same-day delivery of groceries ordered under the Fresh category of its platform is boosting customer engagement further. With Prime, customers also enjoy access to unlimited grocery delivery on orders above $35 from Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh, and other local grocery and specialty stores.\r\n\r\nGrowing pharma business on the back of Prime perks is noteworthy. It offers RxPass, a Prime membership benefit, which enables Prime members to receive all of their eligible medications for one flat monthly fee of $5 and get them delivered for free.\r\n\r\nThe company also recently expanded its same-day medication delivery service to New York City and Los Angeles in a bid to bolster its online pharmacy retail business, Amazon Pharmacy. It intends to expand the same to over a dozen cities in the United States by the end of this year.\r\n\r\nComing to other perks, Amazon recently partnered with Grubhub to include Grubhub+ as an ongoing Prime membership offer. Prime members can place food orders from various restaurants across 50 states in the country with Grubhub directly on Amazon.com and in the Amazon Shopping app.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Prime members enjoy the expanding library of original content, regional content and sports content portfolio on Prime Video with their Prime subscription.\r\n\r\nE-commerce benefits, coupled with online streaming perks, are aiding growth in the Prime subscriber base, which, in turn, is driving Amazon’s subscription revenue growth. In the first quarter of 2024, Amazon witnessed 11% growth in its subscription services sales, which stood at $10.72 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowing Offline Stores Aid Competitive Position\n\nAmazon’s expanding presence in the offline retail space on the back of an increasing number of Fresh and Whole Foods stores is helping it to compete well with retail behemoths like Walmart WMT, Target and Costco, to name a few.\r\n\r\nIt recently inaugurated its second Amazon Fresh store in New Jersey. It is also set to open another Amazon Fresh store in Virginia.\r\n\r\nAmazon gears up to launch a smaller Whole Foods Market concept called Whole Foods Market Daily Shop in Manhattan.\r\n\r\nIts introduction of the smart shopping cart, called Amazon Dash Cart, powered by advanced computer vision technology, to deliver an enhanced shopping experience to its in-store shoppers, is a plus.\r\n\r\nThe growing traction across Amazon Go, which is a cashierless store of the company, is a major positive.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmazon’s near-term as well as long-term prospects are expected to benefit from strong retail strategies, which include bolstering its online and offline retail presence, distribution channels and delivery services. Also, expanding global presence and growing adoption of its Prime program remains a major positive.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company enjoys high market esteem, and savvy investors should consider leveraging AMZN’s potential for sustained long-term growth. It has an impressive long-term expected earnings growth rate of 29.6%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $638.24 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 11%. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 0.9% to $4.58 per share over the past 60 days. The figure indicates year-over-year growth of 57.9%.\n\nEPS Movement Chart Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, AMZN is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 3.05X compared with the industry’s 1.65X and higher than the median of 2.49X, reflecting a stretched valuation. While this might be perceived as a risk, the premium is justified due to the company’s strong capabilities in various fields and high growth potential compared to traditional retailers.\n\nAMZN’s P/S F12M Ratio Graph Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett took a cue from a classic Western film last year when he expanded on the idea of the FAANG stocks, dubbing his new set of the most important companies on Wall Street the \"Magnificent Seven.\" These commanding megacaps are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAll of them remain dominant forces in today's market -- other than Tesla, which is struggling with slowing EV sales. Two of them in particular look like top-tier buys preparing to crush the market right now: Alphabet and Meta Platforms.\n\nGenerative AI is a new tool for each company\n\nWhile both Alphabet and Meta are involved in artificial intelligence (AI), their businesses are far more diverse than that. AI may grab headlines, but the bigger business for both companies is the advertisements they serve up along with the content and search results their users are after.\n\nIn Q1, 77% of Alphabet's revenue came from advertising-related sources. For Meta, an incredible 98% came from ad revenue. This makes the advertising market a key factor in both stocks' investment cases.\n\nFurthermore, each is developing AI technologies to stay at the top of their game. In both cases, that means using generative AI models they have developed in-house to aid advertisers. For example, advertisers on Meta can use its tools to create multiple iterations of the same ad nearly instantly, which allows them to tailor their ads to their viewers. Alphabet offers tools that help advertisers quickly create campaigns that meet all of its internal guidelines. These examples show how each company is trying to stay ahead of its rivals by integrating new AI technologies as quickly as possible.\n\nThese innovations may (or may not) bring any new revenue, as the AI upgrades are essentially required for them to stay at the top of their respective industries. However, each company is doing so well right now that new revenue from new technologies isn't necessarily required for them to excel.\n\nGrowth for each business is strong\n\nIn Q1, Alphabet's ad revenue rose 13% to $61.7 billion. In particular, YouTube excelled, with revenue rising 21% to $8.1 billion. While most of Alphabet's advertising empire is fairly mature, YouTube is still growing quickly. Still, 13% growth companywide is impressive, considering the maturity of the business.\n\nMeta's growth put Alphabet's to shame. In Q1, its ad revenue grew 27% to $35.6 billion. And its revenue increased at a healthy pace in all of its regions worldwide.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese strong results aren't outliers, either. Wall Street analysts project Alphabet's revenue will rise 13% this year and 11% next year. For Meta, Wall Street expects 18% and 13% growth. Both of these are strong projections (considering the companies' size) and are great reasons to invest.\n\nHowever, the last point is just icing on the cake.\n\nYou don't have to pay a fortune to own either stock\n\nWhen you look at the rest of the Magnificent Seven  -- Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla -- every one of them is expensive from a valuation standpoint. Measured by their forward price-to-earnings ratios (which consider earnings projections over the next 12 months), none trades lower than 30.\n\nThat's a historically expensive price to pay, which should give investors pause. However, Alphabet and Meta don't command premiums quite that high. META PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt 24 and 25 times forward earnings, both still command slight premiums to the broader market's average of 22.3 (using the S&P 500 as a benchmark). However, their execution and market dominance justify those slight premiums.\n\nWith both companies excelling, projected to grow at respectable paces, and trading at reasonable valuations, they easily top my list as the best stocks to buy in the Magnificent Seven now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $786,046!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Marking the right stocks to buy is crucial for maximizing returns and securing long-term financial growth. Among the myriad options available, three companies stand out as compelling choices. These companies may have high leads, like a trillion-dollar market cap, by capitalizing on AI and Fintech trends similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nThese companies are in charge of global payment innovation, capitalizing on digital transformation trends and expanding their market presence with innovative payment solutions. They are leveraging their vast user base and advanced AI capabilities and continue to redefine digital engagement and advertising effectiveness across their platforms.\n\nMeanwhile, the strategic focus on AI and semiconductor solutions has propelled revenue growth significantly. This is particularly true in data centers and networking sectors. Pinpointing the underlying fundamentals driving these companies’ leads is pivotal to navigating volatile markets and capitalizing on emerging opportunities. Here, the focus is on these companies’ financial strengths, strategic initiatives and market positions, exploring why these stocks are the investments for today but may continue to be tomorrow’s market leaders.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) holds a grip on digital payments, facilitating secure and efficient transactions worldwide. The company generated $8.8 billion in net revenue (Q2 2024), marking a 10% increase year-over-year (YoY). This growth led to a 20% increase in EPS, highlighting Visa’s effective revenue management and operational edge in driving profitability.\n\nMoreover, Visa’s core business strength lies in its global payment volume. This grew 8% YoY in constant dollars. This growth was driven by a 6% increase in US payment volume and a sharp 11% growth in international payment volume. The 16% YoY growth in cross-border volume is particularly notable, excluding intra-European transactions. This reflects Visa’s strong international presence and ability to capture cross-border transactions efficiently.\n\nAdditionally, Visa targets a massive addressable market, estimating over $20 trillion in global purchase personal consumption expenditure (PPCE), excluding Russia and China. This growth is driven by initiatives like tap-to-pay and converting domestic network cards to Visa credentials. This is particularly highlighted by the success in Europe, with over 20 million credentials converted since 2018.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn short, payment volume growth, market expansion and the resultant top-line boost solidify Visa’s presence on the stocks to buy list.\n\nMeta (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) prevails in social media and digital advertising. In Q1 2024, Meta had a top-line of $36.46 billion, marking a sharp 27% increase YoY. This growth was primarily driven by a corresponding 27% rise in ad revenue, reaching $35.6 billion. This growth emerges from robust online commerce, gaming and entertainment performances. Revenue growth was robust in regions like the Rest of the World (40%) and Europe (33%). Hence, this reflects sharp monetization strategies tailored to diverse geographic markets.\n\nFurther, the company can effectively monetize its vast user base across its family of apps. This signifies its robust engagement strategies and sophisticated AI-powered recommendation systems integrated across platforms like WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram and Facebook. Hence, these AI capabilities may generate revenue by boosting advertising effectiveness and user engagement.\n\nWith billions of daily active people across its Family of Apps in March 2024, up 7% YoY, Meta continues to penetrate online advertising sharply. Overall, with a solid foundation to scale its AI-driven services and capitalize on emerging market opportunities, this global expansion makes Meta a top mark on the stocks to buy list.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Stock Is a Winner With Big Upside Potential\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) dominates AI-driven networking, data center semiconductors and infrastructure. The company’s AI revenue grew exceptionally, increasing by 280% YoY. The company can capitalize on the expanding AI sector. This is particularly true in the data center market, which positions the company well for continued revenue expansion. Following the acquisition of VMware, the annualized booking value (ABV) for VMware products accelerated from $1.2 billion to $1.9 billion from Q1 to Q2. This reflects strong customer adoption under Broadcom’s management.\n\nBroadcom’s semiconductor segment also had solid growth, with revenue reaching $3.8 billion, up 44% YoY. This growth was driven by increased demand from hyperscalers for AI networking and custom accelerators. Broadcom achieved consolidated revenue of $12.5 billion, marking a 43% YoY increase. Moreover, the gross margins for its infrastructure software were notably high, at 88%. This is showcasing its ability to maintain profitability amidst revenue growth. Operating margins for infrastructure software were also solid at 60%. Hence, this indicates sharp cost management and an operational edge in the VMware integration.\n\nBroadcom’s top-line performance, progressive VMware integration and bottom-line improvement led to its presence on the stocks to buy list.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in META.

        "title": "These 5 Stocks Account for 63% of the S&amp;P 500 Returns So Far This Year. Can Their Dominance Continue?",
        "content": "We're officially halfway through 2024, and it's shaping up to be another great year for stock investors.\n\nThe S&P 500 produced a total return of 15.3% through the end of June. That's more than double its historical average for the first half of the year. Its continuous push to new all-time highs bodes well for the second half of the year, too.\n\nIf you look under the hood, the vast majority of the S&P 500's returns have been driven by just five stocks through the first half of 2024. The list isn't too dissimilar from the group of stocks that accounted for the bulk of 2023's return either. If you know about the \"Magnificent Seven,\" you'll be familiar with these names. Can these five continue their dominance through the rest of the year?\n\nThe five stocks accounting for 63% of the S&P 500's returns in 2024\n\nThe S&P 500's aggregate market capitalization increased $5.8 trillion through the first half of 2024.\n\nThe following five stocks generated the biggest market cap increases during the first six months of the year, totaling about 63% of the S&P 500s increase in value for 2024.\n\nStock Market Cap Jan. 1 Market Cap June 28 Increase Increase as a % of S&P 500 Gain Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) $1.223 trillion $3.039 trillion $1.816 trillion 31.3% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) $2.795 trillion $3.322 trillion $527 billion 9.1% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) $1.764 trillion $2.266 trillion $502 billion 8.7% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) $1.57 trillion $2.013 trillion $443 billion 7.6% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) $910 billion $1.279 trillion $369 billion 6.4% Total $8.262 trillion $11.919 trillion $3.663 trillion 63.2%\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nAll of those companies were already among the largest components of the S&P 500 to start the year. Nvidia's continued dominance of the AI chip market has fueled a massive increase in its stock value. Meanwhile, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are four of the biggest companies investing in developing cutting-edge artificial intelligence. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon also provide the cloud platforms required for training and running AI-powered applications.\n\nThe current trend toward generative AI favors the biggest companies. Building large data centers capable of training large language models and running inferences all day requires a ton of capital. Meta leading the group with its plan to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion in capital expenditures this year. That's an investment smaller companies can't even start to compete with, especially in today's interest rate environment where debt isn't nearly as cheap as it used to be.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, the S&P 500 has become increasingly concentrated among just a few companies. Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple account for 20% of the index's value. The next seven components add another 16%. We haven't had this level of concentration among the top-10 companies in the S&P 500 since the 1970s.\n\nWhile there are good reasons for the current level of concentration, investors need to ask if these giant companies can continue to lead the market higher.\n\nWho will lead the next leg up in the market?\n\nRising concentration in the stock market isn't inherently a concern. As mentioned, there are good reasons the biggest companies have gotten bigger. But, investors should remain mindful of valuations and where the market presents good value.\n\nNvidia, for example, trades for a forward PE of around 47. That makes it a risky bet on its continued dominance of the AI chip market. It faces challenges from other chipmakers, and its biggest customers are designing their own chips to reduce their reliance on Nvidia. Analysts currently expect strong bottom-line growth for Nvidia, but its high valuation makes any shortfall extremely damaging to the share price.\n\nNot every member of the above group is expensive. Meta Platforms and Alphabet trade for forward PEs around 25x. While those valuations are higher than the S&P 500's overall earnings multiple, it's not an outlandish multiple relative to their earnings growth prospects.\n\nLooking beyond the biggest companies may present many more opportunities for investors. The S&P 500 equal-weight index historically outperforms the cap-weighted index over the long run. Smaller companies typically grow faster than the giants at the top of the market. A $1 billion increase in the market cap of a $10 billion company is a 10% increase. The same amount of inflows into a $1 trillion company is a 0.1% increase.\n\nTo make a larger bet on the other 495 companies in the S&P 500, investors could buy the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF(NYSEMKT: RSP). Investors could diversify beyond the S&P 500 using a small-cap ETF, too, such as the iShares Russell 2000 ETF(NYSEMKT: IWM).\n\nWhile the first half saw the continued dominance of a small number of large-cap growth stocks, the next leg up in the market could come from a large number of smaller companies.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Opinion: Happy birthday, Amazon? Why one longtime user isn't celebrating the tech behemoth's 30th",
        "content": "I had just started my master’s degree in artificial intelligence when a classmate asked if I’d heard of Amazon, a new online bookstore where you could order basically any book in the world and have it shipped to your front door. Feeling all the excitement of a middle school book fair flooding back, I entered the world of Amazon.com and ordered a beautiful book. It felt revolutionary and futuristic but still cozy and personal. At the end of that year, 1995, Amazon sent loyal customers, including me, a free coffee mug for the holidays.\n\nIt would have been hard to imagine then that the small business famously run out of Jeff Bezos’ Bellevue, Wash., garage would be celebrating its 30th anniversary and a mind-bending $1.97 trillion net worth today. I continue to use Amazon to order gadgets and basic necessities, watch movies and shows and read books on a Kindle. I do all of this even though I know the once-beloved bookseller has become a data-hungry behemoth that is laying waste to personal privacy.\n\nToday, Amazon sells basically everything and knows basically everything, from our favorite toilet paper to our kids’ questions for Alexa to what’s going on in our neighborhoods — and has let police in on that, too! Amazon knows where we live, what our voices sound like, who our contacts are, how our credit histories are, at what temperature we like to keep our homes and even whether we have allergies or other health issues.\n\nRead more:Opinion: Amazon's takeover of the Inland Empire is a textbook case of corporate manipulation\n\nBased on this information, the company infers a whole profile: It potentially knows whether we’re gay or straight, married or divorced, Republican or Democratic, sexually active or not, religious or secular. It knows how educated we are and how much money we make. And it uses this data to sell to us better.\n\nAs a privacy researcher, I advocate for strong consumer privacy protections. After spending the better part of a decade going through privacy policies with a fine-tooth comb, I can safely say that Amazon has been worse for privacy than nearly any other company. It’s not just that Amazon has awful privacy policies; it’s also that, along with Facebook and Google, it co-authored our terrible targeted-ad economy, built on siphoning as much data as possible from users so that anyone with access to it can manipulate you into buying more stuff.\n\nConsidering the importance of freedom to America’s origin story, it’s ironic that the country is so beholden to a company that has manipulation of our free will down to a science.\n\n“Did you just buy these Italian coffee beans?” Amazon asks us. “Here’s what you should buy next.”\n\nRead more:Granderson: Amazon's Prime Day is not to blame for my granola splurge\n\nPrivacy and free will are inextricably intertwined: Both rest on being left to decide who we are, what we want and when we want it without anyone watching or interfering. Privacy is good for our mental health and good for society. Neither corporations nor governments — which have a way of acquiring the data the companies collect — should have access to unlimited knowledge about who we are and what we do all the time.\n\nAmazon has played a pivotal role in making that possible. Its war on privacy took a particularly dystopian turn recently in Britain, where some train stations were using an Amazon artificial intelligence system called Rekognition to scan passengers’ faces and determine their age, gender and emotional state, whether happy, sad or angry; identify supposedly antisocial behavior such as running, shouting, skateboarding and smoking; and guess if they were suicidal. It’s like Orwell's thought police came to life, but instead of Big Brother, it’s Big Bezos.\n\nThe worst part is that we just went right along with this intrusion in exchange for cheap stuff and free two-day shipping.\n\nUnfortunately, Amazon has become almost a basic necessity. But we can take steps to rein in its worst consequences.\n\nConsumers shouldn’t bear the burden of making Amazon better; policymakers and regulators should. A good place for them to start is with the American Privacy Rights Act, legislation currently before Congress. It isn’t perfect, but it would at least address our glaring lack of a federal privacy law. State privacy laws form a patchwork that varies widely in how well it protects consumers.\n\nWe need to start thinking of data privacy as a human right. The idea that companies have a right to all the data they can collect on and infer about us is absolutely bonkers. Thirty years ago, no one would have agreed with it.\n\nThis isn’t how the world should work, and it’s particularly terrifying that this is where we are as we enter the age of artificial intelligence. Generative AI programs, like the chatbots we hear about constantly, are designed to root out as much personal information as they can, supposedly to make them more effective. And Amazon is upgrading its Alexa assistant to incorporate generative AI technology.\n\nNothing I can impulse-buy on Amazon will help me feel better about a future with no privacy, mass surveillance and pervasive monitoring of our feelings and tendencies. What started as a beautiful book and a free mug has yielded a world where everything I buy, everywhere I go and, perhaps in the not-so-distant future, every emotion I feel can be tracked and turned into inferences to sell me more stuff or push dangerous ideologies or advance any other purpose that corporations or governments deem useful. If it sounds dystopian, that’s because it is.\n\nJen Caltrider is the director of Mozilla’s *Privacy Not Included project.\n\nIf it’s in the news right now, the L.A. Times’ Opinion section covers it.

        "content": "Wedbush analysts are bullish on the tech sector, predicting a further 15% upside for the Nasdaq in 2024. They believe the current momentum is just the beginning of an AI-driven tech bull market, with the \"AI party\" just reaching 9 pm.\n\nWedbush highlights Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the early leaders of this \"AI Revolution,\" pioneering the foundation for a wave of new applications and spending. They anticipate a \"tidal wave of $1 trillion\" in tech sector spending related to AI over the next 12-18 months.\n\n\"We believe NASDAQ has another strong 2H ahead as tech stocks will be up 15% the rest of 2024 in our view with tech fundamentals set to accelerate as AI use cases materially expand,\" writes Wedbush.\n\nTheir initial forecast for a 25% growth in tech stocks for 2024 remains on track, fueled by strong performances by tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta (NASDAQ:META). They emphasize this is a new era – a \"1995 moment\" of technological revolution, not a repeat of the dot-com bubble of 1999.\n\nWedbush expects Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to join the party in the latter half of the year, unleashing the consumer side of the AI revolution. The upcoming iPhone 16 is seen as a potential catalyst for this shift, ushering in an era of AI-powered smartphones.\n\nWedbush predicts a race to a $4 trillion market cap between tech giants Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft over the next year. The firm says Nvidia's dominance in GPU chips, considered the \"new gold\" of the tech sector, positions them well for continued growth as enterprises and consumers embrace the AI revolution.\n\nWedbush concludes that they believe the tech sector is poised for significant growth fueled by the ongoing AI revolution.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWedbush sees 15% upside left for Nasdaq, tech stocks\n\nTD's chief compliance officer departs amid US anti-money laundering probe\n\nWorld stocks rise, US yields dip amid jobs data, UK labor landslide\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – July 5, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nMarket Breakout: 3 Leading Stocks to Buy Now\n\nUS stock indexes have staged yet another bullish breakout. The economy is steady, employment is robust, inflation continues to fall, and stocks are making record highs – if you aren’t bullish now, I don’t know what else to tell you.\n\nStock Market Generals Grow Profits, Show Powerful Momentum\n\nLife can be very easy in this market, as some of the largest and most prevalent companies in the world are still trading at appealing levels.\n\nThe 'Magnificent 7' continues to grow earnings at an incredible pace, while the stocks also show encouraging momentum. Q2 earnings for the ‘Magnificent 7’ companies are expected to be up +25.5% from the same period last year on +13.1% higher revenues, while the stock prices on several of them push YTD highs.\n\nMy favorite names from the Mag 7 currently are Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet. Also, Nvidia, gets an honorable mention because it too is still a fantastic stock with a top Zacks Rank.\n\nIn the chart below we can see that each of these stocks is showing significant relative strength against the broad market. Apple, although it trails the market YTD, shows the most significant short-term momentum, up 30% in just the last three months.\n\nRising Earnings Trend Lifts Share Price\n\nApple, a consistently successful company with a strong stock performance, is one whose earnings trends I closely monitor. However, over the past two years, earnings revisions have been flat, and while it remains a decent performer, it hasn't delivered any exceptional growth.\n\nNotably, Apple’s earnings revision trend has begun to turn higher for the first time in a while. This is extremely encouraging action, and Apple now enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\n\nAmazon too has seen its earnings revision trend turn higher, giving it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating as well.\n\nApple, Amazon, and Alphabet all have massive tailwinds coming from the AI boom. We learned about Apple’s new AI software integrations, as well as Alphabets new AI agents over the last couple of months, but there are numerous other ways the technology is being used behind the scenes as well.\n\nAt Amazon, its web services business is going to be a huge beneficiary as technology companies ramp up computing power. But AI will also be used at its fulfillment operations, as the massive scale benefits from optimizations. Amazon is also quietly one of the biggest users of new robotics tech, as its operations continue to be automated.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on these developments it’s no surprise we are beginning to see analysts raise earnings estimates.\n\nReasonable Valuations, Especially Alphabet\n\nAlthough Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting a flat earnings revision trend, it still has a lot going for it. It is currently the relatively cheapest stock in the group.\n\nToday, it has a one year forward earnings multiple of 24.4x, which is just above the market average, and below its 10-year median of 26.1x. GOOGL is also expected to grow its EPS 17.5% annually over the next 3-5 years, plans to buy back some $70 billion in shares this year, and is now paying a tidy 0.43% dividend.\n\nAmazon too is trading at a deep historical discount. At 43x forward earnings it is well below its 10-year median of 98.2x, and EPS is forecast to grow 29.6% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nAt 33.4x, Apple is the only one trading above its historical median valuation, but for a company of its quality it is no surprise it earns a premium valuation.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThis bull market continues to charge, fueled by a robust economy, falling inflation, and stellar earnings growth from industry leaders. The \"Magnificent 7\" stands out with their impressive earnings and momentum, offering attractive entry points for investors seeking exposure to top performers.\n\nMoreover, the growing adoption of AI across these companies, particularly in areas like automation and cloud computing, positions them for long-term dominance in the evolving technological landscape. With valuations remaining reasonable and fundamental strength unwavering, this market rally appears poised to extend its winning streak.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the hot trend on the market today. While there is certainly some hype associated with it, AI looks to have some staying power and is poised to have a real effect on the economy. People and companies are using AI to use and create all kinds of transformative applications. Photo imaging that's never been done before and data analysis at unheard-of speeds are just two examples.\n\nBusinesses are harnessing AI's power to run better and faster, and many of them are disrupting the status quo and capturing market share. Some of these companies are established winners who are using their robust assets to lead the charge, and others are small innovators disrupting the norm in niche segments of the economy.\n\nLet's look at an example from each category -- Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Lemonade(NYSE: LMND) -- and see why each could help you build a millionaire-maker portfolio.\n\n1. Amazon: Leading with generative AI\n\nAmazon has a long history of investing heavily in AI and is now turning its attention and resources to incorporating and expanding generative AI. It uses AI throughout its many businesses, but its most exciting opportunities for AI involve Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud-computing segment.\n\nPeople who know Amazon predominantly as an e-commerce giant may not realize that it is also the leading cloud computing company globally. It's a $100 billion run-rate business and has 31% of the global market. Amazon has developed a competitive set of generative AI tools for AWS users that simplify access and create incredible opportunities. It has an assortment of services in three tiers to meet different needs.\n\nThe foundational layer is for developers to build their own large language models (LLMs), which are the key basis for generative AI. These are models that have been trained on so much data that they can begin to create, or generate, without intervention. That's what OpenAI's ChatGPT is known for, and this is where Nvidia's chips come in. They're powerful enough to handle the necessary data load to make this work, and it's one of the main reasons Nvidia's sales, and stock, have exploded over the past two years.\n\nThe next tier is for developers to use Amazon's LLMs to generate AI for specific businesses, and the top layer involves turnkey solutions for businesses that don't need custom-built services. One example is a tool that creates page descriptions for products on Amazon stores when a user inputs a URL.\n\nAWS accounts for about 17% of Amazon's total sales but 61% operating income. As AWS becomes a greater part of the whole, profitability could soar. Amazon stock typically follows the profits, and this could supercharge Amazon stock over the next several years, leading to incredible gains for investors who buy in now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs with any great stock, becoming part of a millionaire-maker portfolio depends how much you invest and how long you wait. Some stocks can turn into millions on their own; if you'd invested $1,000 in Amazon stock at its initial public offering, you'd have more than $2 million today. I'm not sure it can do that again, but it can outperform the market average and contribute to a diversified portfolio of winning stocks that together can lead to millionaire-maker status.\n\n2. Lemonade: A compelling AI disruptor\n\nLemonade uses AI to power its innovative insurance model. It's a young company in operation for less than 10 years, and it has already attracted more than 2 million members and counting. It has reported steady and strong growth every quarter since it went public four years ago. In the 2024 first quarter, in-force premium, which measures average annual total policies, increased 22% year over year, and revenue increased 25%.\n\nLemonade has a key advantage over legacy insurers because it was built on a digital AI-powered infrastructure. All of its parts work together instantly, and management touts this connectivity as the core reason its model will eventually outdo the competition. Traditional models, which require more human intervention, won't be able to keep up with Lemonade. However, it's still building out its database as it grows quickly and adds new members and policies, so it's taking time to reach that point.\n\nManagement gave one recent example where the AI mechanisms are already producing important results. In insurance, the loss adjustment expense (LAE) ratio measures how efficiently an insurer manages overhead expenses. The standard for large companies is about 10%, but Lemonade's is 7.6% despite its small size. The company attributes this to its reliance on technology to handle claims, which increases efficiency while improving the customer experience. It expects this kind of impact to show up in more of its performance as it gathers more data.\n\nIn the meantime, it's taking longer than investors would like to become profitable, and Lemonade stock still trades down nearly 90% from its all-time highs. Granted, that was when it was trading at a nosebleed valuation. But now it's trading at 2.5 times trailing-12-month sales, which is dirt cheap for a growth stock. It may take some time, but Lemonade could be a standout stock when its algorithms kick in with better data and it starts to report profits.\n\nA large enough investment in Lemonade today could turn into $1 million over many years if Lemonade can turn its business profitable. Consider how small Lemonade is compared to industry leaders like Progressive and Allstate. LMND Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIf Lemonade can grow to where it is generating revenue levels on par with its competitors, its stock could deliver serious returns and turn shareholders who go it early into millionaires.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is beating the market, up 27% as we enter the second half of the year. Investors are enthusiastic about its prospects in artificial intelligence (AI), but that's only the tip of the Amazon iceberg. Where might Amazon be by the end of the year?\n\nWhat happened in the first part of the year?\n\nAmazon had an excellent first-quarter report and many updates about new AI launches. Sales increased 13% year over year in Q1, and operating income more than tripled to $15.3 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) of $0.98 flew past Wall Street's expectations.\n\nAmazon is investing in AI in all sorts of ways. It committed $230 million to invest in an accelerator for AI-based start-ups, awarding $1 million to the top 80 applicants \"that are using generative AI to solve complex challenges.\" Last week, it announced an investment in EvolutionaryScale, an evolutionary biology firm that's using generative AI and machine learning to create transformative pharmaceutical products. Those are just two of the ways it's positioning itself to benefit from real changes using generative AI.\n\nOther updates were the addition of new, popular brands to the e-commerce platform and new spring sale events. In the 60 largest U.S. metro areas, 60% of orders were delivered within 48 hours, and in several global large cities like Tokyo and London, 75% of orders were delivered the same or next day.\n\nAmazon continues its strides in advertising, which once again was its fastest-growing category. Sales were up 24% year over year. Sponsored products were the main driver, which makes a lot of sense. Amazon is leveraging its unmatched shopping platform to make money from ads, and it also makes money when the ads lead to product sales. Amazon can offer incredible data for advertisers based on its decades of machine learning, creating opportunities for pinpoint accuracy and success.\n\nWhat could happen next\n\nAmazon is continuing down the generative AI road, and I wouldn't be surprised if it makes some major announcements over the next few months. It will almost definitely expand its AI services for Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers and improve its AI capabilities for e-commerce and advertising. It's already pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into creating the next level of AI technology, and there are likely to be ongoing results.\n\nIt will probably be making more deliveries faster to more people and signing new high-profile clients for AWS. Amazon is already back on the upswing despite stubborn high inflation, and if inflation does begin to ease, performance could improve even more.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement is guiding for 7% to 11% sales growth in Q2 and operating income to increase from $7.7 billion to about $12 billion. It didn't provide full-year guidance, and it will report Q2 results with a Q3 outlook in late July or August.\n\nThe average Wall Street consensus for 2024 EPS is $4.55, which represents a 57% increase year over year. Amazon has frequently beaten Wall Street's expectations, and if it comes through this year, it will drive another jump in Amazon stock.\n\nBy the end of 2024, expect Amazon to be bigger and better, with more of a focus on AI.\n\nAmazon stock is a no-brainer buy\n\nAmazon stock still offers incredible opportunities for investors. In some ways, it looks like it's just getting started, or at least entering a new chapter that could lead to important changes in its business. But you don't need to bet on AI to feel confident in Amazon's future. There's so much else Amazon is doing right. Keep in mind that buying Amazon stock includes investing in AI, but the difference between Amazon and many other AI companies is that even on the small chance it doesn't work in its favor, Amazon will just get up and move onto the next thing. It's had failures in the past, but it keeps going. With Amazon's tremendous assets, strong lead in several businesses, and ongoing growth drivers, there's plenty to be excited about.\n\nThat's how Wall Street sees it, too. An estimated 95% of 65 covering analysts call it a buy, with an average target price 13% higher than today and a high of 86% over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nIt's important to remember that there are no guarantees, and investing in the future is always an unknown. That's another reason Amazon is a compelling buy -- Amazon has an excellent track record, which makes it low risk. Most investors can find a place for Amazon in their portfolio, and it should keep climbing for the rest of 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amazon marks its 30th anniversary on Friday as a two-trillion-dollar company, capping a remarkable rise from the online bookseller it was founded as, inside a garage in the early days of the internet.\n\nFounder Jeff Bezos stepped down as chief executive in 2021, but he remains the executive chair and largest shareholder of a company now known as an e-commerce and cloud computing giant.\n\nSince its foundation as a bookseller, the company has grown into an online retail heavyweight where consumers can buy almost anything. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stepped down as chief executive in 2021 (Paul Ellis/PA)\n\nIt has also expanded, making many of its own products that it sells online, including electronics, led by a popular range of tablets and smart home hubs and speakers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Seattle-based firm is now also established as a leading technology company through the Alexa virtual assistant that powers its smart home products, but also through Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud computing arm of the company which has data centres around the globe offering server space to many of the world’s other largest companies.\n\nWhen Amazon become one of the few companies to pass the two-trillion-dollar valuation mark last month – behind only Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft – part of its recent share price rise was put down to the increasing demand for cloud computing thanks to the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) services.\n\nAI services are energy and compute-intensive, meaning many firms are having to increase their cloud computing capacity to power these in-demand new tools. The rise of generative AI tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT has set the standard for a new generation of virtual assistants (John Walton/PA)\n\nMr Bezos has now confirmed he plans to sell nearly five billion dollars worth of Amazon shares, which follows a similar announcement in February that he would sell shares worth 8.5 billion dollars – the first time since 2021 he had parted with Amazon shares.\n\nLooking forward, Amazon’s dominance of the online retail space is likely to face increasing competition from a range of alternatives and rivals, including emerging e-commerce firms in Asia, and the growing popularity of second-hand marketplaces as consumers look to save money and prioritise the environment by recycling old goods.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s position in the AI products market also faces intense competition from fellow tech giants and emerging AI firms.\n\nThe rise of generative AI tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT has set the standard for a new generation of virtual assistants which are both text and voice-based, and can find as well as generate images and videos.\n\nCurrently, Amazon’s Alexa is predominately a voice-based assistant, conversational assistant – a set-up many believe the company will need to expand on if it wants to take on ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and Microsoft’s Copilot.",

        "title": "7 High Priced Stocks That Would Benefit From a Stock Split",
        "content": "Several high-profile stock splits have occurred recently. First, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) decided to implement a 10-for-1 stock split which took effect June 10. Shares are up slightly since then after a period of rapid price increases and subsequent cooling.\n\nThe stock more than doubled in 2024 causing the price to own a single share of Nvidia to surge above $1,000. Prices at that level tend to hurt demand, so splitting the stock is a logical choice. Ownership becomes more accessible, increasing demand.\n\nNvidia is not the only high-profile company to recently enact a stock split. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) announced a similar 10-for-1 split that will take effect on July 12. It is expected to have similar positive psychological effects for investors. Broadcom shares currently trade for $1,592, putting them out of the reach of many investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all orchestrated stock splits in recent years. Let’s look at seven companies that might be up next.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) seems to be an obvious choice among stocks that would benefit from a stock split. The company produces high-demand machines for which it is the only supplier globally. ASML can only produce a handful of the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines it manufactures on an annual basis.\n\nThe result is a very valuable firm and stock that has grown rapidly this year. ASML’s EUV lithography machines are used to produce state-of-the-art semiconductors that have applications in artificial intelligence and other high-value sectors.\n\nDue to the extreme demand, ASML shares jumped from $700 in January to above $1,000 today. Those price increases haven’t caused volume to decline but it makes sense for ASML to consider a stock split regardless: High-profile chip companies are splitting their stocks under the notion it will benefit their capital structure in the long run. ASML is a logical potential target to watch next for investors who believe in the power of stock splits.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) mercado libre box\n\nSource: tiagogarciafoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is in my opinion one of the best combination stocks available to investors. The company is part emerging e-commerce champion, part rising fintech star. I’m not the only one who appreciates MercadoLibre as it has become one of the more popular stocks overall. In the process, share prices have ballooned to spectacular highs and currently trade for nearly $1,700. If ever there were a stock in need of a split, MercadoLibre is it.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the company has maintained high prices for several years. That complicates the picture and suggests that the company may not implement a stock split. Prices approached $2,000 near the height of pandemic market madness. They dropped below $700 in the aftermath of austerity measures only to rise again to dizzying heights.\n\nAs with ASML, those high prices don’t appear to be negatively affecting demand as measured by volume. That said, a stock split could prove to be the demand catalyst that MercadoLibre didn’t know it needed.\n\nEven without a stock split, MercadoLibre stock should continue to impress based on its extremely strong fundamental growth.\n\nMicrostrategy (MSTR) A chart of the MicroStrategy (MSTR) logo with a Bitcoin\n\nSource: JOCA_PH / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrostrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock represents a company less known for its enterprise analytics business than its Bitcoin (BTC-USD) holdings. The company has gained massive notoriety for its strong and continued investment into the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nBy March 31, MicroStrategy had purchased $7.535 billion worth of Bitcoin, which was valued at $15.22 billion overall at the time. At that point the average cost paid by the company per Bitcoin was just above $35,000. Although Bitcoin prices have since cooled to $61,000, the company is clearly still in the black.\n\nMicroStrategy continues to accumulate more Bitcoin, recently adding an additional 11,931 BTC to its overall holdings.\n\nThe risky move seems to have paid off for the company, which is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin overall. Share prices have been pushed well above $1,000 in 2024. Arguably, the $1,000 threshold represents a strong psychological barrier for investors. Thus, Microstrategy is another potential target for a stock split.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nI bet the name Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) means very little to most stock investors. Very few people would know the company until they realize that it owns Hoka and Ugg.\n\nMany might then recognize the strength of the company as those brands are growing very fast. The company released its fourth quarter earnings report at the end of May showing sales grew by 21% during the period, reaching $959.8 million. The better-than-expected revenues led to per-share earnings of $4.95, more than $2 higher than analysts had anticipated. Sales of Hoka shoes accounted for $533 million in sales during the period, growing by 34%.\n\nDeckers Outdoor share prices are now approaching the $1,000 threshold. The stock sat in the $250 range two short years ago.\n\nDeckers Outdoor certainly doesn’t need to implement a stock split in order to spike demand: The strength of Hoka and Ugg are doing more than enough. However, it wouldn’t hurt to send a strong message to the market.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) could likely reach $1 trillion in market capitalization much quicker by implementing a stock split.\n\nThe company is currently the 10th most valuable stock as measured by market cap, with a value of $811 billion. The success of weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound has catapulted  Eli Lilly into rarified air: pundits now expect Eli Lilly to reach $1 trillion in market cap at some point in the near future. It’s likely Eli Lilly could reach that threshold quicker if it so chooses.\n\nAll the company has to do is to follow the lead of Nvidia, Broadcom, and others and announce a stock split. A similar 10-for-one split would give shareholders an additional nine shares for every share held and reduce prices to $90 per share.\n\nMany investors wonder whether a pharmaceutical firm is deserving of a $1 trillion valuation. A move by Eli Lilly to assert such confidence might be exactly what is needed.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) The Regeneron (REGN) website is displayed on a smartphone screen over a blue background.\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) is another high-priced stock in the pharmaceutical sector. Currently, a share of REGN stock costs more than $1,000. While the company is nowhere near Eli Lilly in terms of market cap, both companies are potential stock split targets.\n\nA few things pop out about Regeneron Pharmaceuticals that suggest to me that a stock split makes a lot of sense. Simple arithmetic dictates that a 10-for-1 stock split results in updated share prices of approximately $100. That’s an affordable share price that also suggests a lot of strength overall. However, the point I really want to make is that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals boasts per-share earnings of $33.86 over the trailing 12 months. Split by a factor of 10, that still results in impressive per-share earnings of $3.39.\n\nThe point here is that a lot of really strong companies develop monstrous fundamentals when successful. In the case of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals you could argue that EPS that high almost begs for a stock split.\n\nMettler-Toledo International (MTD) scientist wearing virtual reality headset interacts with futuristic holographic interface showing neurological data\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock\n\nMettler-Toledo International (NYSE:MTD) is perhaps the least likely stock on this list to enact a stock split in the near future. The healthcare firm provides diagnostics and research instruments primarily for the laboratory setting.\n\nThe reason I believe Mettler-Toledo International is probably the least likely company to enact a stock split is simple history. Share prices have consistently stayed above $1,000 since late 2020. Furthermore, healthcare stocks often trade for multiple hundreds of dollars and $1,000 is far from unheard of.\n\nAt the same time, a company like Mettler-Toledo International could choose to enact a stock split to drive demand. It would likely grab attention if done correctly. After all, healthcare stocks aren’t exactly the flashiest investments. Point being, Mettler-Toledo International could differentiate itself through a stock split.\n\nIt too boasts strong trailing 12-month per-share earnings that could be split with the result being a remaining $3.57 EPS.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "SPYI ETF: Get Paid Every Month, Enjoy the Massive Yield",
        "content": "What’s better than getting paid a dividend every quarter? How about getting paid one every month? That’s exactly what the NEOS S&P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI) has to offer investors, and it also comes with a massive dividend yield.\n\nI’m bullish on this new monthly dividend ETF from NEOS based on this attractive payout schedule and its show-stopping 11.6% dividend yield, which is an incredible nine times higher than the yield of the S&P 500 (SPX).\n\nWhat Is the SPYI ETF’s Strategy?\n\nAccording to fund sponsor NEOS, SPYI “seeks to distribute high monthly income generated from investing in the constituents of the S&P 500 Index and implementing a data-driven call option strategy.”\n\nThe fund “utilizes a call option strategy that may include both sold and purchased SPX index options, which may provide the opportunity for upside capture in rising equity markets.”\n\nEssentially, SPYI owns the stocks in the S&P 500. It then generates monthly income for its holders through both the dividend payments from these stocks and by selling call options on the S&P 500 to generate additional income via the premiums from these options contracts.\n\nWhile this generates a high level of monthly income, investors should also note that by utilizing this strategy, they are potentially sacrificing some level of upside from capital appreciation. If SPYI’s holding rises above the strike price for the covered call contracts it sells to generate this income, SPYI will forgo much of this additional upside.\n\nYou can see this dynamic in play by looking at the ETF’s results. For example, in 2023, SPYI generated a total return (which includes price appreciation and dividends) of 18.1% for the year. While this was a strong return, it underperformed the S&P 500’s return of 26.3% for the year.\n\nHowever, there’s one thing that SPYI does a bit differently from other ETFs employing this covered call strategy. Rather than investing all of the money it receives from selling call contracts, it has the option to reinvest some of the proceeds back into buying cheaper, further out of the money call options, allowing it to participate in some of this upside if the underlying holding goes beyond the strike price.\n\nAs NEOS explains in the fund’s summary prospectus, the fund seeks to use the S&P 500 call options “to generate a net-credit, meaning that the premium received from the sale of the call options will be greater than the cost of buying the long, out-of-the-money SPX call options.”\n\nIncredible Dividend\n\nWhile the strategy is complex and has some pros and cons regarding capital appreciation and total return, there’s no denying that it’s a powerful way to generate significant income. This is evidenced by SPYI’s mouth-watering 11.6% dividend yield, which is about nine times higher than that of the S&P 500 (currently yielding just 1.3%).\n\nStory continues\n\nNot only that, but SPYI’s yield is easily more than double the 4.35% yield offered by 10-year treasury bonds, making SPYI a compelling income investment no matter what type of interest rate environment we find ourselves in.\n\nETFs employing this strategy have grown in popularity in recent years, and it’s worth noting that SPYI also features a higher yield than many of these. For example, the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI), the largest and most well-known of these ETFs, features a 7.4% yield, and the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) yields 8.8%. These are both impressive yields, but SPYI’s is significantly higher.\n\nIt’s important to note that the level of SPYI’s dividend payout is not set in stone, and the amount can vary from month to month. However, the payouts have been relatively consistent, ranging between $0.47 and $0.50 per month over the past year. Additionally, since its launch in August of 2022, SPYI has paid distributions every month, so it is beginning to build up a strong track record of monthly dividend payments.\n\nSPYI’s Holdings\n\nSPYI offers strong diversification, with 508 holdings. Its top 10 holdings make up a reasonable 38% of the fund. Below, you’ll find an overview of SPYI’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nGiven the fund’s strategy of investing in the constituents of the S&P 500 index, its top holdings unsurprisingly largely mirror those of the broad market index. Its holdings include household names like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nSteep Expense Ratio\n\nOne negative aspect of SPYI is that it features a fairly high expense ratio of 0.68%. This means that an investor in the fund will pay $68 on a $10,000 investment over the course of the year. Assuming that the fund returns 5% per year going forward and maintains this current expense ratio, this investor will pay $379 in fees over a five-year time horizon, a fairly steep total.\n\nThat said, this is a complex, actively-managed ETF, so it is understandable that it has a higher expense ratio than the typical index fund. As long as the ETF keeps paying out large dividends like clockwork each month, most holders will feel comfortable with the above-average expense ratio.\n\nIs SPYI Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SPYI earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 403 Buys, 93 Holds, and nine Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SPYI stock price target of $55.24 implies 9.06% upside potential from current levels.\n\nThe Takeaway: A Strong Option for Income Investors\n\nInvestors should be aware that investing in call options ETFs like SPYI might limit potential capital appreciation. However, with a remarkable yield of 11.6%, it’s hard not to like this ETF anyway. I’m bullish on SPYI as a great option for income investors based on its attractive monthly payout schedule and its massive 11.6% dividend yield. As one part of a balanced portfolio, this is an effective tool for generating frequent, above-average income on a steady basis.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Saks Owner Seals $2.65 Billion Neiman Deal With Amazon Help",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The owner of Saks Fifth Avenue is acquiring Neiman Marcus Group for $2.65 billion — a deal that will unite America’s two largest high-end department-store chains in a bid to grab a bigger share of a slowing industry.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden’s Fourth of July Shrouded by Pressure to Drop 2024 Bid Kamala Harris Is Having a Surprise Resurgence as Biden’s Campaign Unravels House Democrats Consider Demanding Biden Withdraw From Race Newsom Shocks California Politics by Scrapping Crime Measure China Can End Russia’s War in Ukraine With One Phone Call, Finland Says\n\nAmazon.com Inc. and Salesforce Inc. will help facilitate the deal by Saks owner Hudson’s Bay Co. The tech companies will take minority stakes in a new company, called Saks Global, according to a statement Thursday. HBC will also finance the deal with $2 billion raised from investors. And affiliates of Apollo Global Management are providing $1.15 billion in debt financing.\n\nRepresentatives for Salesforce and Amazon declined to comment on an earlier report about the deal. The statement didn’t disclose the size of their investments.\n\nThe combined operations would include 39 Saks Fifth Avenue stores and 36 locations under the nameplate of its Dallas-based competitor, as well as two Bergdorf Goodman stores in Manhattan. Both chains also have outlet stores. The goal of the deal is to cut costs and boost profitability by giving the new company bargaining power with vendors and reducing supply-chain and other shared costs.\n\nMarc Metrick, chief executive officer of Saks Fifth Avenue’s online operations, will run Saks Global. “How do you future-proof a brand like Saks or Neimans or Bergdorf? You do that through technology,” Metrick said in an interview.\n\nThe deal is the culmination of on-again, off-again talks between the two privately-held competitors during the past decade and a half. Momentum began to build when Neiman declared bankruptcy in 2020, shedding debt and making it a more attractive target, and accelerated as luxury sales have weakened in the past year or so.\n\nNeiman’s bankruptcy also brought in new owners — Pacific Investment Management Co., Davidson Kempner Capital Management and Sixth Street Partners — that typically seek a relatively quick return on their investments, rather than spend years in the minutiae of a retail turnaround.\n\nTech Stakes\n\nThe involvement of Amazon “adds a bit of spice to an otherwise predictable deal,” GlobalData analyst Neil Saunders wrote in a research note. Its stake makes sense, he said, “as it has ambitions to play more heavily in the luxury space and this would give it a toehold.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is among Amazon’s first investments in a physical retailer since it bought Whole Foods Market in 2017 to help the online retailer push into the grocery business. The e-commerce giant has tested the waters in other industries, too, taking stakes in cargo carriers behind its Prime Air delivery business, for example.\n\nSalesforce has touted luxury-brand partners such as Louis Vuitton and McLaren but doesn’t usually take direct stakes in the companies. Its venture investments page lists dozens of stakes in software startups, not retailers.\n\nReal Estate\n\nUS department stores are in flux. Nordstrom Inc.’s founding family has said it’s considering taking the retailer private. The new CEO at Macy’s Inc. is rolling out his turnaround plan, which includes shutting almost a third of the company’s namesake stores — part of efforts to address demands from activist investors.\n\nA decline in share prices across department stores has been driving the recent uptick in deal activity, Fitch Ratings analyst David Silverman said. Department stores also have coveted real estate, which is part of what motivated HBC to go after Neiman Marcus. The company owns its namesake Canadian department-store chain, and CEO Richard Baker is also a real estate investor.\n\nThe combined companies will have a US real estate portfolio worth $7 billion, according to the statement. Recent luxury deals have been a bright spot for New York commercial real estate, which has been in the doldrums since the pandemic.\n\nGeographically, there isn’t a lot of overlap in the brick-and-mortar networks of Saks and Neiman Marcus. Saks has more stores on the East Coast, while Neiman has a bigger footprint in the southern and western US.\n\nBoth Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus saw a jump in sales from the end of 2020 through 2022 as consumers spent their extra pandemic savings on expensive handbags and other luxury items. But those gains faded as inflation surged, and quarterly sales at both companies have been falling year-over-year.\n\nCompetition has also been rising, including from the very partners Saks and Neiman have worked with for decades. Luxury brands, such as those owned by conglomerates LVMH, Kering SA and Richemont, have been focusing on selling more of their own products on their own websites and opening stores in recent years, too, pivoting away from department stores.\n\nExecutives at luxury brands have said they prefer to have more control over how their merchandise is displayed and how customers are treated in their stores, as well as where their stores are located — efforts that are helping to drive traffic to their shops. That’s been a further blow to department stores.\n\n“The department-store model has been failing because the whole business was designed for a completely different retail environment than what we have now,” Morningstar analyst David Swartz said. “Every part of department stores has been challenged by competition.”\n\nThose challenges already felled one-time peers such as Barneys and Lord & Taylor. Macy’s-owned competitor Bloomingdale’s, though, is faring better and comparable sales rose slightly in the most recent quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect the Saks-Neiman deal to attract antitrust scrutiny from regulators. Under Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, the agency has brought the highest number of merger challenges since 1976, when the US began requiring antitrust reviews before a deal closes. In April, the FTC sued to stop the owner of the Coach brand from acquiring the parent of Michael Kors, the first time the agency has tried to stop a deal in the fashion-accessories sector.\n\n“I have to respect the process that the FTC is going to go through,” Metrick said in the interview. Saks Global plans to improve the brands’ websites, including making it easier to search for merchandise and make offerings more personalized to each shopper, while also investing in stores.\n\n“As a consumer,” Metrick said, “you’re going to win.”\n\n--With assistance from Spencer Soper and Brody Ford.\n\n(Updates throughout with companies confirming the acquisition, providing details.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing The Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before For Tesla, a Smaller Drop in Sales Is Something to Celebrate Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Finding undervalued breakout stocks in today’s market can be quite a task. Most top-tier blue-chip and long-term investment opportunities, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), are already well-known and heavily purchased.\n\nHowever, as concerns grow about the concentration of investments in a few mega-cap stocks, demand for breakout stocks is increasing. These breakout stocks may not remain so for long and will instead likely turn into the next big media story of runaway growth and strong upward momentum.\n\nDespite the current economic uncertainty, some promising breakout stocks offer a blend of growth, stability, and income. These stocks span various market caps and sectors and could provide significant returns and diversify your portfolio. While no investment comes without risk, these under-the-radar breakout stocks have strong potential to become standout performers in the years ahead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAtlanta Braves Holdings (BATRA) Atlanta Braves stadium\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou don’t need to be a billionaire to own a stake in a sports team. By investing in breakout stock Atlanta Braves Holdings (NASDAQ:BATRA), you can claim a slice of this iconic Georgian sports franchise. Listed in July 2023, this stock provides investors access to the Braves’ sales revenue and income from the associated real estate assets within the Braves ecosystem.\n\nIf you’re looking for high-profile endorsements, just look at some of the company’s major shareholders. Among the backers of Atlanta Braves Holdings is Warren Buffett, who holds a position in this firm as part of his broader investment in SiriusXM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI). The Braves’ former owner, Liberty Media (NASDAQ:LSXMA), is currently in a high-profile merger with SiriusXM. Buffett’s interest in this unique investment ecosystem is a strong endorsement. Additionally, legendary value investor Mario Gabelli is a fan of the stock, predicting that shares could reach $55 in the coming years.\n\nDespite overall market challenges, Atlanta Braves Holdings stands out as a potential home run for investors seeking unique opportunities in the sports and entertainment sectors.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) stands out as more than just a unique breakout stock — it represents a gateway into the burgeoning trillion-dollar space industry. Last year, Rocket Lab gained significant attention with a record-setting number of launches. This year, the company continues to impress with a substantial government contract worth over $500 million and a strong earnings report.\n\nStory continues\n\nRocket Lab’s current launch and contract backlog exceeds $1 billion, providing a promising forecast for potential revenue, even though clients may cancel. With first-quarter revenue hitting $92.7 million, this backlog indicates considerable growth opportunities.\n\nFurther cementing its position in the global space sector, Rocket Lab recently secured a deal with Japanese company Synspective for 10 Electron launches through 2027. This partnership highlights Synspective’s trust in Rocket Lab’s capabilities as a space-based operator and delivery system for its satellites. While the financial terms were not disclosed, the agreement underscores Rocket Lab’s growing role in the space industry, making it a breakout stock with substantial future potential.\n\nGetty Images (GETY) Image of Getty Image logo on gray background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/360b\n\nGetty Images (NYSE:GETY) is an often overlooked breakout stock with significant potential, especially given its unique position in the artificial intelligence sector. Known for its extensive library of stock photos and journalism photography, Getty serves many clients, including creatives, media companies and corporate marketing teams. However, what truly sets Getty apart is its innovative collaboration with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), making it an intriguing AI stock to watch.\n\nEarlier this year, Getty introduced a generative AI image creator powered by Nvidia. This tool simplifies creating customized images for professionals and amateurs, offering a more user-friendly experience than other platforms like Midjourney’s Discord-based service. More importantly to publishers, Getty’s tool also includes robust legal protections for users, addressing growing concerns about copyright issues in AI, as evidenced by ongoing legal battles involving companies like OpenAI.\n\nDespite a slight decline in sales and income in its latest earnings report, Getty saw a significant rise in subscription rates, which now make up 55.4% of its net revenue. This growing subscription base will expand further as Getty’s AI-driven services become more widely adopted. This positions Getty Images as an undervalued stock with promising AI potential, making it a strong candidate among low-priced stocks with upside.\n\nParsons (PSN) Veterans Day. US soldiers. US army. USA patch flag on the US military uniform. United States Armed Forces. Defense stocks\n\nSource: Bumble Dee / Shutterstock.com\n\nParsons (NYSE:PSN) is a defense technology company with a diverse portfolio that positions it as one of the more under-the-radar breakout AI stocks. Unlike companies focusing primarily on software, Parsons integrates AI into hardware-centric technological developments, setting it apart in the industry.\n\nParsons has achieved notable milestones in ballistic missile site development, rocketry hardware, nuclear site management, and large-scale infrastructure projects. These operations demand sophisticated technical data management and oversight, allowing Parsons to lead with AI solutions that enhance its hardware capabilities. This makes Parsons a key player in AI-enabled defense technologies, an area likely to gain more attention as political campaigns bring defense issues to the forefront.\n\nAdditionally, Parsons is expanding its use of AI with innovative drone solutions for infrastructure inspection. These AI-driven tools transform how bridges, roadways, and water treatment facilities are evaluated, making the process more efficient and thorough. As the U.S. faces growing infrastructure challenges, Parsons’ ability to deploy AI to address complex and hazardous environments makes it an essential player in the field, offering significant potential for growth and innovation.\n\nPhotronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) is a small but powerful player in the tech sector with significant growth potential. Unlike typical semiconductor stocks, Photronics focuses on semiconductor photomasks, an advanced technology with substantial future implications.\n\nPhotronics’ photomasks are vital for precision in microchip manufacturing, enabling the development of artificial intelligence and quantum computing through increasingly complex and precise circuitry. These photomasks are essential for shrinking transistors and components, driving Moore’s Law’s progress. This strategic positioning at the intersection of precision and cost-effectiveness places Photronics at the forefront of current and emerging technologies, making it a compelling pick among under-the-radar tech stocks.\n\nValued at just 12x earnings, Photronics offers an attractive entry point for investors. Its steady income stream reflects solid financial health, and despite being relatively young in the semiconductor industry, the company is poised to benefit significantly from the expanding use of semiconductors across various sectors.\n\nPSQ Holdings (PSQH) The façade of the New York Stock Exchange is decorated for the listing of PublicSq (PSQH) via a SPAC with Colombier Acquisition Corp.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those interested in fairly speculative investments, PSQ Holdings (NYSE:PSQH) is a unique breakout penny stock trading around $3.50 per share with a market cap of approximately $110 million. Despite its small size, this company is positioned at the cutting edge of emerging e-commerce trends that could significantly impact the market in the coming years.\n\nPSQ Holdings’ flagship platform is the digital marketplace PublicSquare, which emphasizes helping consumers “shop their values” by aligning purchases with personal beliefs and ethics. While the company’s conservative ethos might initially stand out, the broader concept behind PublicSquare transcends political affiliations. The platform taps into a growing desire among consumers to support businesses that reflect their values and principles.\n\nIn today’s fragmented social media landscape, people often find themselves within like-minded networks or echo chambers. This trend extends to shopping habits, with a rising preference for e-commerce platforms that align with personal values. PublicSquare meets this demand by offering American-made goods, starkly contrasting the declining quality of many overseas products found on giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nNintendo (NTDOY) A yellow Switch Lite from Nintendo (NTDOY) sits in front of a bright pink background.\n\nSource: ESOlex / Shutterstock.com\n\nNintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) consistently makes my list of breakout stocks, and for good reason. The Japanese company exemplifies a business model that stands apart from many American public companies. Instead of focusing on short-term gains, Nintendo takes a long-term approach, prioritizing sustainable growth over immediate profits. This strategy, perhaps, is why Nintendo has been a resilient player in the market since its founding in 1889 as a playing card company.\n\nA look at Nintendo’s balance sheet underscores its commitment to long-term stability. The company maintains a robust cash reserve and carries no debt, providing a solid financial foundation to navigate economic fluctuations and seize new opportunities. This financial strength is so compelling that Microsoft considered acquiring Nintendo in 2020, recognizing its value as a prime low-priced stock with significant potential. Although the acquisition didn’t materialize, Microsoft’s interest highlights Nintendo’s enduring appeal in the market.\n\nRecently, Nintendo has also capitalized on its extensive intellectual property, opening new revenue streams that further enhance its position as a smart investment. The company’s prudent financial management and innovative approach ensure it remains a standout in the gaming industry, making it a compelling choice for investors seeking both value and growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

After all, they do have access to management that is unavailable to the average investor. They can gain greater insight into whether a business will grow or contract. That should be reflected in their ratings.\n\nThat’s why stocks with changed analyst ratings should warrant closer attention by investors. All three companies below were recently upgraded or had coverage initiated on them with a buy rating. Let’s dig a little deeper into the stocks to see if they are right for your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTelecommunications giant AT&T (NYSE:T) just had coverage initiated on it by Goldman Sachs with a buy rating. Analyst Jeremy Schneider assigned a $22 per share price target on the stock, which is inline with the $21.73 per share consensus view. Wall Street as a whole has a moderate buy rating on the telecom.\n\nThere’s a reason Ma Bell sets well with analysts. Its first-quarter results in April showed near-record low wireless customer churn, or the number of customers who left the carrier. AT&T says it had an industry-leading postpaid phone churn rate of 0.72% for the period. In comparison, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) had 0.86% churn while Verizon (NYSE:VZ) reported 0.89% churn.\n\nAT&T said it added fewer net postpaid wireless phone customers during the quarter, or 349,000, versus 424,000 a year ago. Cost-cutting measures and fewer phone upgrades helped raise operating margins by 30 basis points (bps) to 23.4%.\n\nMoreover, it reduced its network investments, which yielded improved free cash flow (FCF) of $3.2 billion. That is a $2.1 billion increase year-over-year (YOY). It expects to generate between $17 billion and $18 billion in FCF in 2024, which will support its dividend that yields a very attractive 6% annually.\n\nAT&T stock is up 12% in 2024 and 18% over the past year. Trading at under $19 a share, Goldman Sach’s price target implies additional 17% upside in the stock.\n\nAmerican Tower (AMT) American Tower Corporation logo on a smartphone with the website in the background on a computer screen. AMT stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nGoldman Sachs’ Schneider also initiated coverage on American Tower (NYSE:AMT) with a buy rating and a $230 per share price target.\n\nThe specialty real estate investment trust (REIT) owns cellular towers around the world and leases them to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, and others under long-term leases. Although the industry fell out of favor due to carrier consolidation, the future looks particularly promising considering the continued growth in demand for mobile data.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, American Tower might have lopped off its own knees by selling its tower business in India, a market with tremendous growth potential. It also entered the data center market and owns 28 facilities. Yet, there doesn’t appear to be a significant connection between its primary tower business and data centers. So, it may prove to be a fruitless venture.\n\nStill, AMT’s tower business is growing. It reported same-tower sales growth of 5% in the first quarter and its ability to impose annual price increases helped expand EBITDA margins by 160 bps to 65.4%. That should continue to improve in the quarters ahead.\n\nLike all REITs, American Tower is required to pay out 90% or more of its profits as dividends. And, it has raised its payout by more than 16% a year for the past decade. Growing FCF at a compounded annual growth rate of 12% over that period, it has plenty of cash profits to support the payout, which yields 3.4% annually.\n\nThe analyst’s price target implies 19% upside in the stock, making American Tower stock worth considering for your portfolio.\n\nDigital Realty Trust (DLR) a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer. data infrastructure stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSpeaking of data centers, the largest data center owner with over 300 locations is Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR), which is also organized as a REIT. Schneider was active here as well, initiating coverage with another buy rating and a $175 per share one-year price target. The explosion in artificial intelligence (AI) has made data centers mission-critical and positions Digital Realty Trust at the epicenter of the technology.\n\nAI drove the REIT’s massive bookings in the quarter, which Digital Realty says will contribute some $252 million in annualized GAAP rental revenue. That was 40% more than its previous record. Hyper-scalers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) have an insatiable need for more capacity. DLR said data center deployments for such customers amounted to $175 million in annualized revenue.\n\nAlso, the REIT was able to increase rental rates on renewal leases by nearly 12% as a result. Yet there is simply so much AI demand that the REIT likely won’t have the capacity to meet it all. Right now, though, Digital Realty Trust is taking on as much as can be thrown its way. It reported earnings of 82 cents per share, a blistering beat ahead of Wall Street’s expectations of just 24 cents.\n\nSchneider’s price target implies 15% upside in the stock, but it could easily blow through that level. The stock is up 33% over the last 12 months. Additionally, Digital Realty pays a dividend yielding 3.3% annually.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in T stock.

        "title": "3 Incredible FAANG Stocks You'll Want to Consider Adding to Your Portfolio in July",
        "content": "It's been a while since the term \"FAANG stocks\" captured investors' attention, mostly because these stocks aren't the red-hot names they used to be. The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" tickers have taken their place as the market's hot-button grouping.\n\nThe thing is, all five FAANG stocks are still incredible investments, and three of them are standout prospects you'll want to consider adding to your portfolio sooner rather than later.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nMost investors know Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has (literally) been the market's most rewarding stock over the past three decades; shares are up more than 260,000% since their 1997 initial public offering. Most investors also understand, however, that the e-commerce giant's highest-growth days are in the past. It's simply too big now to continue growing at its historical pace.\n\nThat doesn't mean its future isn't bright, however. It's just different in a handful of compelling ways.\n\nOne of these ways is a relatively new, intense focus on profitability. Although the company has historically been more interested in expanding its footprint than turning a profit, for the past couple of years it's been closing and canceling warehouses that couldn't operate as cost-effectively as needed. It's streamlining all of its operations to cull costs.\n\nAnd it's working! While its first-quarter top line improved 13% year over year, operating income more than tripled. Notably, its international e-commerce operation swung from a regular loss to an operating profit of $900 million. That's the best this arm's done since early 2021 when the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing. Data source: Amazon Chart by author. Figures are in billions.\n\nAmazon's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, is also firing on all cylinders, bouncing back from soaring operating expenses seen in late 2022 and 2023. Its first-quarter operating income of $9.4 billion is record-breaking and continues to improve. Look for more of the same, too. Mordor Intelligence believes the cloud market is poised to grow at an average annual pace of more than 16% through 2029.\n\nAmazon's newest business is on a roll as well. That's advertising. Amazon.com's third-party sellers forked over $11.8 billion to more prominently feature their products at the website, up 24% year over year.\n\nAmazon shares are already up more than 130% since early last year, reaching new records just last week. Given the profit growth in the near-term and long-term cards though, there's more upside ahead for this FAANG stock.\n\n2. Netflix\n\nIt would be easy to assume the worst for streaming powerhouse Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX). Suspiciously, after a clear slowdown in its customer growth, beginning next year the company will no longer disclose its subscriber numbers. The streaming market itself is also running into a saturation headwind, forcing its leading companies to partner up with peers and competitors to create more marketable bundles. Cable giant Comcast recently unveiled a cable TV package that included Netflix and Apple TV, for example, while Walt Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are pairing up Disney+, Max, and Hulu in a bundle that will be priced at a discount and launched sometime this summer.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust because the crowded industry's maturing, however, doesn't mean Netflix is doomed. It's got a couple of key things working in its favor that could -- and should -- keep the stock's current rally going. One of them is the company's position within the streaming market.\n\nSee, it's not just the original name in the business that gave rise to all the others. It's also still the most popular and \"stickiest\" streaming platform. Nearly 270 million households pay for access to its content ... far more than any of its rivals. Meanwhile, streaming market research house Antenna reports Netflix's customer churn rate stands at only 2%, versus more than 4% for Disney+ and over 6% for Max, for perspective. For most U.S. households that pay for multiple streaming services, a \"Netflix-first and then the others\" kind of mindset still prevails. Habits are powerful.\n\nThe other matter working in Netflix's favor is the rise of ad-supported streaming services. While only about 40 million of its 270 million subscribers (roughly 15%) are paying a lower monthly price in exchange for watching the occasional television commercial, it's an option that will keep its service far more marketable for far longer than it might otherwise have been. Market research outfit Global Market Insight believes the ad-supported streaming market is set to grow at an annualized rate of more than 8% through 2032.\n\n3. Apple\n\nLast but not least, add Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) to your list of FAANG stocks to consider buying before the end of July.\n\nIt's not necessarily an easy name to get excited about owning right now. Although the stock was a must-have for years following 2007's debut of the iPhone, slowing iPhone sales -- which account for about half of Apple's revenue -- have prompted worries regarding its future growth.\n\nThere's a huge new growth catalyst already at work though. That's artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile there's no denying the company was late to the party, it's catching up quickly. Last month Apple unveiled several different AI features for its smartphones, tablets, and computers that will make its wares even more powerful technology (particularly as it pertains to generative artificial intelligence). As Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang writes, \"Apple's introduction of Apple Intelligence will position the company as the leader in the consumer AI experience.\"\n\nIt's not just Apple's consumer-facing artificial intelligence apps that hold so much promise, however. The company's also working on tech that most consumers will never actually see in action firsthand. For instance, it's working on the development of its own chips for use in AI data centers. Although Nvidia's dominance of this market isn't in any immediate danger, The Wall Street Journal reports that these chips could be based on a completely different sort of artificial intelligence called inference rather than the training-oriented architecture that's common right now.\n\nIt remains to be seen exactly what Apple's AI future looks like. But, Apple's got a long history of success. Given Precedence Research's prediction that the worldwide AI market is set to grow an average of 19% through 2032 there's little doubt the company will win at least its fair share of the market's expansion.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "5 Historically Cheap Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks You Can Confidently Buy for the Second Half of 2024 (and Nvidia Isn't 1 of Them!)",
        "content": "For roughly 30 years, Wall Street and the investing community have been waiting for the next great innovation to come along that can rival what the advent of the internet did for corporate America. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) just might be this long-awaited technology.\n\nWith AI, software and systems are used in place of humans to oversee and/or undertake tasks. The true value of AI lies in the ability of these systems to learn over time without human intervention. This allows AI-driven software and systems to become more effective at tasks and perhaps even learn new jobs over time. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence represents an estimated $15.7 trillion opportunity by 2030\n\nAlthough estimates are all over the map, as you'd expect from a still relatively unknown technology, the analysts at PwC released a report last year in which they estimate AI can add up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade.\n\nWith an addressable market this large, a lot of companies can come out as winners. But that doesn't mean you can throw a dart at a written list of AI stocks and automatically make money.\n\nFor the moment, no company is more directly benefiting from the AI revolution than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's stock has gained up to $3 trillion in market value, with the company's board recently approving a 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nNvidia's otherworldly gains and textbook operational scaling are the result of its AI-driven graphics processing units (GPUs) becoming the standard in high-compute data centers. With demand for these chips absolutely overwhelming their supply, Nvidia has been able to meaningfully increase its prices and reap the rewards.\n\nUnfortunately, every next-big-thing innovation over the last 30 years, including the internet, underwent an early-stage bubble-bursting event. This is to say that investors consistently overestimate the adoption and/or utility of new technologies, innovations, or trends. AI will need time to mature, just like every next-big-thing innovation before it, and that bodes poorly for Nvidia's stock.\n\nBut not all artificial intelligence stocks would be in trouble if the AI bubble burst. Thanks to their foundational operating segments, the following five historically cheap AI stocks can be confidently bought for the second half of 2024.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first cheap AI stock that you can gobble up with confidence for the latter half of the current year (and likely hold well beyond 2024) is social media giant Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe beauty of Meta's operating model is that it generates close to 98% of its revenue from advertising. Even though CEO Mark Zuckerberg is aggressively investing in AI data centers, the metaverse, and various augmented/virtual reality devices, Meta's prime social media \"real estate,\" coupled with lengthy periods of expansion for the U.S. and global economy, are what power its operating cash flow and profits at the end of the day.\n\nAs of the end of March, Meta was luring 3.24 billion users to its social media platforms each day. Advertisers are well aware that there's no better alternative to reach users than to advertise with Meta.\n\nEven after more than quintupling from its 2022 bear market low, shares of Meta can be purchased right now for less than 14 times estimated cash flow for 2025. For context, this is a 6% discount to its average forward-year cash flow multiple over the last five years and represents its lowest multiple to cash flow in every year over the last decade, save for 2022. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlibaba\n\nThe next exceptionally inexpensive artificial intelligence stock you can buy without fear in the second half of 2024 is China-based e-commerce juggernaut Alibaba(NYSE: BABA).\n\nAccording to the International Trade Administration, Alibaba is China's top dog in online retail sales, with Taobao and Tmall accounting for an estimated 50.8% share of China's e-commerce sales. Even with China's economy stuck in neutral following the COVID-19 pandemic, an eventual strengthening of the country's burgeoning middle class should lift the long-term prospects for this segment.\n\nFurther, Alibaba Cloud is China's leading cloud infrastructure service platform by revenue. Alibaba Cloud is where generative AI solutions can be offered to customers to support and enhance their businesses. Enterprise spending on cloud services is still in its very early stages of ramping up.\n\nShares of Alibaba are currently valued at less than 8 times forward-year earnings, which is a steal when you account for its $85.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various investments as of March 31. INTC Price to Book Value Chart\n\nIntel\n\nA third AI stock that can shine in the second half of 2024, and likely well beyond, is semiconductor stalwart Intel(NASDAQ: INTC).\n\nThere's no question that Nvidia has left Intel in the dust over the last 18 months. But in the second half of this year, Intel is releasing its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerator chip on a broad scale. With Nvidia unable to meet the demand of all its customers, Intel and its rivals should be able to easily grab share.\n\nBut there's more to like about Intel than just its AI ties. Its legacy central processing unit (CPU) operations for personal computers and traditional data centers remain a cash cow for the company. This cash is being reinvested in various high-growth initiatives, such as the company's foundry services segment. By 2030, Intel anticipates becoming the world's No. 2 chip fabrication company.\n\nIn terms of value, Intel is trading at 25% above its book value of $24.89 per share. With the exception of September 2022-March 2023, Intel stock hasn't been this cheap, relative to its book value, dating back to the mid-1980s!\n\nBaidu\n\nThe fourth bargain AI stock investors can confidently add to their portfolios for the second half of this year is China-based internet search titan Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU).\n\nSimilar to Meta, Alibaba, and Intel, the bursting of the AI bubble wouldn't derail Baidu. That's because it's China's leading internet search engine. Over the trailing-10-year period, it's pretty consistently accounted for 50% to 85% of internet search share for the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. This means predictable operating cash flow and strong ad-pricing power for Baidu.\n\nHowever, AI represents the company's future. Baidu's AI Cloud is China's fourth-largest cloud infrastructure service platform. Meanwhile, Baidu-owned Apollo Go is the world's most successful autonomous ride-hailing service, based on total rides since its inception (more than 6 million). These non-online marketing segments have consistently grown at a faster pace than Baidu's internet search engine.\n\nA forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of only 7 is unbelievably low for a company sporting roughly $26 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments on its balance sheet. AMZN Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\nAmazon\n\nThe fifth historically cheap AI stock begging to be bought for the second half of 2024 is Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), the world's other dominant e-commerce player.\n\nAccording to estimates, Amazon accounted for a nearly 38% share of U.S. online retail sales in 2023. But while this segment brings in plenty of revenue, it does little for Amazon's cash flow or operating income. Where the company generates most of its growth and operating cash flow -- and where AI will come in handiest -- is its ancillary operations.\n\nNo segment is more important to Amazon's long-term success than Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure services platform and recently topped $100 billion in annual run-rate revenue. AWS can deploy various AI and generative AI solutions to help businesses train large language models and run virtual assistants.\n\nDon't forget about advertising services or subscription services, either. These two segments are also growing by a steady double-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis. As Amazon's e-commerce marketplace and content library grow, it should be able to command a premium subscription price for Prime.\n\nAlthough Amazon isn't cheap based on the traditionally used P/E ratio, it is historically inexpensive relative to its future cash flow. Shares can be purchased right now for around 13 times the consensus cash flow in 2025, which is markedly lower than the median multiple of 30 times year-end cash flow investors gladly paid to own Amazon stock throughout the 2010s.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $751,670!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Can Amazon Compete with Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft in the Market Cap Race?",
        "content": "Microsoft regained the title of most valuable company in the world after briefly falling behind Nvidia with the latter's recent stock split. However, it's been playing second fiddle to Apple for years and only recently slid into first place since Apple has been under some pressure.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is only in fifth place on the list of U.S. companies with the highest market caps, also behind Alphabet. It has extraordinary growth opportunities in several of its businesses, and the second-highest sales of any U.S. company behind Walmart. Can it become the most valuable company in the world?\n\nWhat is market cap and why does it matter?\n\nMarket cap is simply the price per share multiplied by the outstanding share count. In other words, it's the total dollar value of all of a company's stock. Amazon stock trades at $193 per share, and there are 10.4 billion shares outstanding, so the market cap is over $2 trillion. That makes it the fifth most-valuable company on the stock market. NVDA Market Cap Chart\n\nAs you can see in the chart above, Apple had been the most valuable company until recently, when Microsoft took over and Nvidia briefly topped it.\n\nMarket cap tells investors a few things. Highly valued companies are best in class, and they have proved that over time. Investors have piled in because these companies perform, quarter after quarter, and they're large businesses that drive the economy. In general, you can count on them to deliver, and they're low risk.\n\nBut highly valued companies might offer less growth for investors, since they're already so valuable. For the top three stocks here to even double at this point, they would be worth more than $6 trillion.\n\nIs it possible? Yes. But that comes with its own risk, since they would need to sustain their high value. It's easier to see Amazon or Alphabet doubling from where they are today.\n\nIn terms of valuation, none of these stocks are cheap. They all get a premium valuation for their reliable track records and incredible businesses. Nvidia tops them, trading at 73 times trailing-12-month earnings, and Amazon comes in second at 55.\n\nWhy Amazon stock can reach the top\n\nAmazon struggled a bit, like many companies, when inflation started soaring in 2022. It rebounded already last year, but the stock only surpassed its previous highs a few weeks ago, and it could be in its best position in a long time.\n\nOne reason is generative artificial intelligence (AI). It's today's hot topic, but it might have more staying power than other recent trends like cryptocurrency and the metaverse, and Amazon is a major player.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has launched a powerful set of AI tools for its Amazon Web Services (AWS) clients, and as the leading worldwide cloud computing company, it stands to benefit in a big way from adoption of these tools. According to consulting company McKinsey, as much as 30% of workplace hours could be automated through generative AI, and it could add $4.4 trillion to the economy.\n\nAmazon is at the forefront of these endeavors, and CEO Andy Jassy recently said, \"I don't know if any of us have seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time.\"\n\nBut it's not just AI, with Jassy adding, \"We have a lot of growth in front of us, and that's before the generative AI opportunity.\" He said that AWS is already a $100 billion run-rate business, and that 85% of global spending on information technology is still on-premises, meaning not in the cloud. That leaves a massive opportunity for further spending in AWS.\n\nAnd AWS isn't even its biggest business, which is still e-commerce. Amazon has an unbeatable lead in that category globally and accounts for nearly 38% of all U.S. e-commerce. It has made strides in improving logistics to get more deliveries out faster, and as it speeds up shipments, more shoppers rely on it for even more of their daily essentials, leading to a positive growth cycle.\n\nThe company's fastest-growing business these days is advertising, which increased 24% year over year in the 2024 first quarter. It's a high-margin business, and with its new ad-supported streaming tier for Prime Video, Amazon is finding more ways to monetize its advertising capabilities.\n\nIt has an edge in this business because when customers see advertisements on the company's platform, they're already looking to buy, and that can lead to incredible conversion rates.\n\nAmazon can certainly muscle its way to the top of the market-value chain, just as it's pushing ahead and getting closer to becoming the largest U.S. company by sales. Regardless, it has tremendous opportunities in many ways, and its stock is a no-brainer buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon.com Inc (AMZN): Why Is It the Biggest AI Story Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stories.\n\nAre Growing Patents in AI from China a Threat to the US?\n\nChina and the United States continue to compete against each other as the AI boom continues to reign in the tech industry. On July 2, Reuters reported that China plans to develop 50 new national and industrial standards for artificial intelligence by 2026. The country aims to standardize systems in the artificial intelligence sector by providing thorough guidelines to companies and budding startups. Furthermore, on July 3, Reuters reported that China filed six times more patents than the United States for inventions in AI like chatbots. On a global scale, more than 50,000 patent applications were filed in the past decade, a quarter of which were filed in 2023 alone. China filed 38,000 generative AI applications between 2014 and 2023, while the United States only filed slightly over 6,200 applications during the same period. Of the total applications, ByteDance, Alibaba Group, and Microsoft filed the largest number of applications. The report added that Chinese patent applications covered a wider range of sectors such as autonomous driving, publishing, and document management. South Korea, Japan, and India were ranked third, fourth, and fifth with the highest number of patent applications.\n\nThe United States, on the other hand, has reportedly accumulated $55.6 billion in venture capital funding in the second quarter of 2024, the highest quarterly total in two years. On July 3, Reuters reported that the surge in venture capital funding is driven by developments in artificial intelligence. Such is a 47% increase from the $37.8 billion raised by startups in the first quarter of 2024. Significant investments include $6 billion by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion raised by CoreWeave. Previously, venture capital funding took a hit, reporting $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 amid high interest rates and sluggish economic growth. While venture capital and investment in AI are increasing, the IPO market remains sluggish.\n\nOpenAI & Anthropic: A Comparative Analysis\n\nWhile the threat of Chinese innovations looms over the United States, startups in the country are disrupting the industry with key innovations. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is a leading artificial intelligence company based in the United States. In February this year, OpenAI closed a deal with venture capital firm Thrive Capital, allowing it to buy some of its shares in a tender offer, bringing its total valuation to $80 billion. This is a threefold increase in its value from a few months ago in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn June 10, OpenAI and Apple announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Users will now be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities on all these devices without having to switch tools. Siri will also be able to reach ChatGPT when a user asks a question and will present them with an answer directly from the chatbot. ChatGPT will be integrated into Apple's writing tools, allowing users to create content when required. The development ensures that user security remains intact. Requests are not stored by OpenAI and IP addresses remain obscured. Users may connect to their ChatGPT account, allowing them to choose their data preferences. The integration will be executed later this year and can be accessed for free without having to create an account.\n\nIn another update, Apple is reportedly positioned to join OpenAI's board. On July 2, Reuters reported that Apple is set to get an observer role on OpenAI's board, part of the agreement made by the two entities a month ago. Phill Schiller, head of Apple App Store and former marketing chief, was selected for this position. The board agreement will take effect later this year. As of yet, Schiller has not attended any meetings.\n\nAnthropic, OpenAI's direct competitor, is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2021. The company is led by Dario and Daniela Amodei as CEO and president. The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.\n\nClaude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models. The company strongly believes that the initiative will enhance AI safety level assessments, improve safety metrics, and develop infrastructure and tools for evaluations. The safety level assessments will encompass cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, model autonomy, national security risks, and social manipulation.\n\nA lot is going on in the AI space and several companies have emerged as interesting AI stories. We have compiled a list of the most interesting AI stories on Wall Street by studying many reports and publications and watching interviews. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, which was sourced from Insider Monkey's proprietary database that tracks over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has become one of the best AI stories on Wall Street. The company is poised for significant growth in AI, thanks to its generative AI tools in Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as Amazon Q, Amazon Bedrock, and Amazon SageMaker. In March, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) invested an additional $2.75 billion in Anthropic, an artificial intelligence safety and research company, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. The company is leveraging Anthropic's models and just launched the Claude 3.5 Sonnet to Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic's most powerful model yet. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is twice as efficient as Claude 3 Opus and is one-fifth of its price. The new AI can perform extremely complex tasks and is well-equipped with skills in producing high-quality and authentic creative content, understanding data and contextual relationships, and developing advanced codes with sophisticated reasoning.\n\nAmazon is also making in-house AI chips such as the AWS Trainium, and AWS Inferentia for deep learning training of more than 100 billion parameter models. The company is on its way to becoming an AI powerhouse. AWS logged $25 billion in revenue, up 17% year-over-year. In 2023, the company spent $48.4 billion in capital expenditure. to advance its generative AI and non-generative AI workloads. As per a recent update, Amazon plans to spend more than $100 billion to fund its projects in artificial intelligence and data centers over the next decade.\n\nMaxim Group's managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte talked about Amazon's AI position in a recent interview on Yahoo Finance. Forte believes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is well positioned to exploit artificial intelligence at the cloud computing and fulfillment center level, especially compared to tech giants like Apple. The company is making advancements in AWS while also employing techniques to automate its operations, which is a positive sign for investors.\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) was held by 302 hedge funds at the close of Q1 2024 with total stakes amounting to $60.37 billion. Of those, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $7.68 billion.\n\nOn July 1, Needham reiterated a buy rating on the stock and maintained its price target of $205. Analysts' median price target of $220 represents an upside of 11% from current levels.\n\nLakehouse Capital is also bullish on the stock. Here are some comments about AMZN from its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered an impressive quarterly result that also came in well ahead of analyst expectations. Net sales increased 13% year-on-year to $143.3 billion and operating profits increased 219% year-on-year to $15.3 billion (vs the high end of guidance at $12.0 billion). As has been the case for several quarters now, the highlight of the result was the significant improvement in profitability metrics, as management continues to drive cost efficiencies across its retail operations and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Bigger picture, we continue to believe that the market underestimates the length of the runway ahead in the core retail business (note that e-commerce sales in the U.S. still only make up 15% of total retail sales) and that there is still significant margin expansion ahead as scale and efficiency benefits continue to come through.\"\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the biggest AI stories right now. You can visit 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Weekto see the other AI stories that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Co-founder and CEO of Ark Invest, Cathie Wood, has been one of our most prolific growth stock investors. Perhaps the narrative around the best Cathie Wood stocks truly peaked during the pandemic. Her investment firm witnessed a dramatic surge in inflows during the pandemic years, but things have been choppy lately. Nevertheless, with interest rate cuts expected later this year, it’s an ideal time to leverage Wood’s insights into aggressive growth investing.\n\nHence, keeping tabs on Cathie Wood’s top stock could be incredibly rewarding for investors looking to take on more risk. That said, here are three red-hot Cathie Wood stocks to buy, ready to benefit from a revitalized market sentiment. These stocks are poised for an impressive showing to close the year, resulting in substantial upside potential at current prices. Their underlying businesses are expected to continue growing on the back of secular tailwinds.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s easy to see why Wood is invested in Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) illustrious growth story. Last month, ARK Invest’s ARK Next Generation ETFacquired 53,368 shares of AMZN stock for $9.9 million.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo be fair, Cathie Wood’s recent pivot towards AMZN stock was long overdue, especially considering how it hasn’t flown under the radar for the past couple of years. The tech giant has been a storied stock over the past decade, with its tentacles spread across multiple sectors, such as advertising, streaming, gaming, and groceries.\n\nMoreover, Amazon’s strategic investments in AI have added new layers to its growth trajectory. These include its AI investments, notably its collaboration with Anthropic, and the critical role of its cloud service in powering the AI revolution.  Last quarter alone, Amazon Web Services (AWS) generated $25 billion in sales, a 17% increase on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. Overall, its sales jumped to $143.3 billion, marking a 13% increase from the prior-year period while exceeding estimates for the fifth consecutive quarter.\n\nJPMorgan analysts are pounding the table over AMZN stock’s prospect, expecting the firm to outpace Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to become the largest U.S. retailer by the end of 2024.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nCathie Wood has been a long supporter of Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), with her stake in HOOD stock valued at nearly $600 million, a sizeable 4.7% of her portfolio’s total.\n\nOver the past year, HOOD stock has been on fire, fueled by the vibrant AI and meme stock trading frenzy and robust crypto market rally. In Q1, the platform’s net sales surged to $618 million, blowing past analyst expectations of $555 million. Moreover, the trading platform’s user base has grown impressively. Monthly active users climbed to 13.7 million from 11.8 million in the prior-year period.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts blowout results have plenty to do with the 232% YOY increase in crypto sales in Q1 to $126 million, as the platform effectively leverages the crypto wave. To further bolster its position, Robinhood recently sealed a $200 million deal to acquire Bitstamp. The top-tier crypto exchange in Europe and Asia diversifies Robinhood’s offerings while positioning it among the leading crypto exchanges.\n\nPagerDuty (PD) image of a cloud surrounded by various symbols related to internet connectivity and interaction\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCathie Wood’s relentless investing approach was on full display last month as she placed bets on PagerDuty (NYSE:PD) stock. Despite the company’s spotty track record, she accumulated PD stock on every trading day. Consequently, her stake in the firm is valued at a whopping $216 million, representing 1.72% of its portfolios.\n\nPerhaps her persistence aligns with Wall Street’s upbeat reaction to PD’s encouraging Q1 results. With the firm comfortably beating its top-and-bottom-line estimates, it announced a massive $100 million share buyback plan.  Though sales have lately risen by just single-digit margins, experts forecast a rebound to double-digit revenue gains for the upcoming fiscal year and beyond.\n\nAnalysts forecast a healthy bump in adjusted profits of 14% next year. That should be followed by a further 24% boost in fiscal 2027. This optimistic financial trajectory positions the enterprise software giant for monumental gains ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "content": "US stock indexes have staged yet another bullish breakout. The economy is steady, employment is robust, inflation continues to fall, and stocks are making record highs – if you aren’t bullish now, I don’t know what else to tell you. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nStock Market Generals Grow Profits, Show Powerful Momentum\n\nLife can be very easy in this market, as some of the largest and most prevalent companies in the world are still trading at appealing levels.\n\nThe ‘Magnificent 7’ continues to grow earnings at an incredible pace, while the stocks also shows encouraging momentum. Q2 earnings for the ‘Magnificent 7’ companies are expected to be up +25.5% from the same period last year on +13.1% higher revenues, while the stock prices on several of them push YTD highs.\n\nMy favorite names from the Mag 7 currently are Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOGL). Also, Nvidia (NVDA), gets an honorable mention because it too is still a fantastic stock with a top Zacks Rank.\n\nIn the chart below we can see that each of these stocks is showing significant relative strength against the broad market. Apple, although it trails the market YTD, shows the most significant short-term momentum, up 30% in just the last three months. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRising Earnings Trend Lifts Share Price\n\nApple, a consistently successful company with a strong stock performance, is one whose earnings trends I closely monitor. However, over the past two years, earnings revisions have been flat, and while it remains a decent performer, it hasn't delivered any exceptional growth.\n\nNotably, Apple’s earnings revision trend has begun to turn higher for the first time in a while. This is extremely encouraging action, and Apple now enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\n\nAmazon too has seen its earnings revision trend turn higher, giving it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating as well.\n\nApple, Amazon, and Alphabet all have massive tailwinds coming from the AI boom. We learned about Apple’s new AI software integrations, as well as Alphabets new AI agents over the last couple of months, but there are numerous other ways the technology is being used behind the scenes as well.\n\nAt Amazon, its web services business is going to be a huge beneficiary as technology companies ramp up computing power. But AI will also be used at its fulfillment operations, as the massive scale benefits from optimizations. Amazon is also quietly one of the biggest users of new robotics tech, as its operations continue to be automated.\n\nBased on these developments it’s no surprise we are beginning to see analysts raise earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nReasonable Valuations, Especially Alphabet\n\nAlthough Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting a flat earnings revision trend, it still has a lot going for it. It is currently the relatively cheapest stock in the group.\n\nToday, it has a one year forward earnings multiple of 24.4x, which is just above the market average, and below its 10-year median of 26.1x. GOOGL is also expected to grow its EPS 17.5% annually over the next 3-5 years, plans to buy back some $70 billion in shares this year, and is now paying a tidy 0.43% dividend.\n\nAmazon too is trading at a deep historical discount. At 43x forward earnings it is well below its 10-year median of 98.2x, and EPS is forecast to grow 29.6% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nAt 33.4x, Apple is the only one trading above its historical median valuation, but for a company of its quality it is no surprise its earns a premium valuation. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThis bull market continues to charge, fueled by a robust economy, falling inflation, and stellar earnings growth from industry leaders. The \"Magnificent 7\" stands out with their impressive earnings and momentum, offering attractive entry points for investors seeking exposure to top performers.\n\nMoreover, the growing adoption of AI across these companies, particularly in areas like automation and cloud computing, positions them for long-term dominance in the evolving technological landscape. With valuations remaining reasonable and fundamental strength unwavering, this market rally appears poised to extend its winning streak.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Retail Stocks to Sell in July Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "In the face of Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) continuous taking of market share in the retail space, many American brick-and-mortar stores are struggling mightily. What’s more, a multitude of brick-and-mortar retailers are having a great deal of trouble competing with the two retail brick-and-mortar behemoths – Target (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). That’s why you may need to consider retail stocks to sell.\n\nMultiple retail sectors have their own individual problems. For example, drug store chains are losing market share to direct mail prescription options and are being hit with massive settlements for their role in the opioid crisis. Home-goods companies are struggling due to the historically low number of home sales. And finally, the spending power of many consumers has been tremendously eroded by elevated inflation and high interest rates.\n\nAdd it all up, and it’s clear that investors should avoid the shares of many brick-and-mortar retail chains in the current environment. Here are three retail stocks to sell.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nKohl’s (KSS) Image of Kohl's logo on a Kohl's store\n\nSource: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.com\n\nKohl’s (NYSE:KSS) is a predominantly brick-and-mortar apparel retail chain that charges relatively high prices. However, it primarily attracts middle-income, rather than wealthy consumers. Therefore, I’ve long believed that the company would struggle at a time when many middle-income consumers are cutting back on their spending due to high inflation and elevated interest rates.\n\nMany on Wall Street apparently have had that view in recent weeks as 32.6% of the float of KSS stock was sold short as of April 27, according to Seeking Alpha.\n\nAnd it turns out that Kohl’s is indeed struggling in the current environment as the firm’s top line slid 5.3% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier while its sales at comparable stores sank 4.4% from a year ago. Also importantly, the company’s operating income slid to $43 million versus $98 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nKohl’s will likely continue to endure tough times as middle-class shoppers look for cheaper options, making it one of the top retail stocks to sell.\n\nHome Depot (HD) Home Depot (HD) sign backdropped by blue sky\n\nSource: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmid very high prices and high interest rates, home sales continue to decline in the U.S. For example, in May, the number of existing homes sold declined 0.7% compared to April. Moreover, the number of existing homes that changed hands last month sank 2.8% compared to the same period a year earlier.\n\nThat’s bad news for Home Depot (NYSE:HD), the home improvement chain, because new homeowners tend to spend large amounts of money improving their new homes.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd Home Depot’s Q1 financial results indicate that it is indeed struggling as its sales dropped 2.4% during the quarter versus the same period a year earlier while its comparable sales in the U.S. slid 3.2% year-over-year. On the bottom line, it generated net income of $3.6 billion in the first quarter, down from $3.9 billion during the same period a year earlier.\n\nAlso negatively for the company, CEO Ted Decker noted that the firm was hurt by “continued softness in certain larger discretionary projects” in Q1.\n\nAnd in another bearish indication for the retailer, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund unloaded all of its shares of HD stock in Q1.\n\nCVS (CVS) The front sign for a CVS Pharmacy, CVS stock\n\nSource: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.com\n\nDrug store chains are being hurt by increased competition from increased utilization of direct-mail prescription plans, including Amazon’s initiative in that area. Moreover, the chains are being undermined by rising theft in certain areas, along with consumers’ aversion to the relatively high prices that their stores charge for many items. Additionally, the large settlements that they’ve had to pay out as a result of their role in the opioid crisis is weighing tremendously on their balance sheets.\n\nGiven all of these points, CVS (NYSE:CVS) is definitely on my list of retail stocks to sell.\n\nAnd indeed, the firm’s Q1 results came in well below Wall Street’s expectations. Specifically, the company generated revenue of $88.4 billion, $800 million below analysts’ average estimate of $88.4 billion. On the bottom line, it reported earnings per share of $1.31, 39 cents below the mean outlook.\n\nThe firm lowered its 2024 earnings per share guidance to at least $5.64 from at least $7.06.\n\nOn the balance sheet, the retailer had, as of the end of Q1, total debt of $81.8 billion and total cash of just $13.1 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a LONG position in AMZN. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor held a LONG position in AMZN.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "The first half of the trading year is in the books, and by all accounts, it was a resounding success. The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 15% from January through the end of June, hitting all-time highs on 31 separate occasions. Market analyst Charlie Bilello notes that, at 5,460, the S&P 500 ended the first half of 2024 above every single year-end price target on Wall Street.\n\nThe takeaway is that this market has defied expectations and in a big way. While it’s hard to know where the market will go in the year’s second half, some stocks look like good bets as we head into July. A number of stocks are benefitting from positive catalysts and appear to have momentum as we make our way through the summer months and the year’s third quarter. Here are the seven best stocks to buy in July 2024.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) The front of a Rivian (RIVN) storefront is seen lined up with Rivian R1T and R1S model trucks out in front.\n\nSource: Michael Berlfein / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) are in full recovery mode after it was announced that German automotive giant Volkswagen (ETR:VOW3) is investing $5 billion in the electric vehicle start-up company. Volkswagen’s investment includes an initial injection of $1 billion. The additional $4 billion will be allocated to Rivian in stages through 2026. The investment creates a joint venture between VW and Rivian to see the two automakers work on electrical architecture and software technology.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nShares of Rivian soared 35% on news of the Volkswagen investment. The cash infusion from Volkswagen could not have come at a better time, as Rivian’s stock had been under pressure this year due to the company’s cash burn and mounting losses. The electric vehicle maker reported a net loss of $1.45 billion in the first quarter of 2024. While RIVN stock is now on the rise, it remains down 30% this year, suggesting that there is an opportunity for investors to take a stake and ride the share price higher.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor the first time, E-commerce giant Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) market capitalization has just surpassed $2 trillion. The company achieved the milestone as its stock finished trading on June 26 at $193.61 per share. Since then, AMZN stock has risen further, nearly above $200 a share. The company’s stock has increased more than 30% this year, with analysts seeing more upside ahead and rating the stock as a “strong buy.”\n\nAmazon’s stock has been rising due to strong first-quarter financial results that showed the company’s dominant cloud computing business was recovering after businesses cut back their spending during the pandemic. Earnings and share price are also benefitting from cost-cutting initiatives undertaken over the last two years. It has taken Amazon four years to go from a $1 trillion market valuation to $2 trillion. The median price target on the stock suggests a further 12% upside from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nFederal Express (FDX) A FedEx employee loads a FedEx Express truck in Manhattan.\n\nSource: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com\n\nA turnaround in FedEx’s stock (NYSE:FDX) also looks to be underway after the shipping and logistics company reported financial results that beat analyst forecasts and raised its forward guidance. FDX stock has gained 20% in the past month after the company announced EPS of $5.41 versus the $5.35 that was expected. Revenue totaled $22.11 billion compared to $22.07 billion that was estimated on Wall Street.\n\nThe strong results at FedEx come as the company implements cost-cutting measures as part of a plan to save $4 billion by the end of the 2025 fiscal year. Regarding guidance, FedEx raised the outlook for its current year, saying it expects low to mid-single-digit revenue growth mainly driven by e-commerce. Also in June, FedEx raised its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by 10%, taking the distribution to $1.38 per share and giving the stock a yield of 1.85%.\n\nFDX stock is up 18% this year.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building. NVO stock\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow would be an opportune time to take a position in pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) after the company’s popular weight loss drug “Wegovy” was approved for use in China, the world’s second largest economy with a population of 1.4 billion people. China’s National Medical Products Administration has approved the weekly injectable drug, noting that half of China’s population is considered overweight.\n\nWegovy will initially be available to people in China with a body mass index indicating obesity. Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic diabetes medication was approved for use in China in 2021, and that drug’s sales doubled in the country last year. Novo Nordisk struggled to keep up with the surging demand for its weight loss drugs before China’s approval. To help ensure it can meet future demand, Novo Nordisk has announced that it is spending $4.1 billion to expand its manufacturing capacity in the U.S.\n\nNVO stock has risen 40% in 2024 and is up 80% over the last 12 months.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign.

CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) have pulled back 7% since the company enacted a 50-for-1 stock split on June 26. Investors may want to take advantage and buy the dip in this leading restaurant stock. The recent stock split was the first ever for Chipotle and lowered the share price from over $3,200 to less than $65. With the post-split decline, CMG stock trades around $61 per share.\n\nThis is the most affordable Chipotle stock in more than a decade, and the current pullback is unlikely to last long. CMG stock has been a long-term winner, having risen more than 300% in the last five years. The company has consistently posted strong same-store sales and grown its retail network. In this year’s first quarter, Chipotle reported that its sales rose 14% year-over-year while its net income increased 20%.\n\nHeico (HEI) The website for Heico is shown with a magnifying glass enlarging the company's logo.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAircraft parts manufacturer Heico (NYSE:HEI) has raised its dividend payment by 10%. In the future, the Hollywood, Florida-based company will pay a distribution of 11 cents per share, up from 10 cents a share previously. Heico pays its dividend to shareholders semi-annually (twice a year). The new dividend will be paid on July 15. Heico has consistently paid its semi-annual dividend since 1979.\n\nThe dividend hike comes as the company’s stock has been on an upswing. Heico, which primarily makes replacement parts for commercial and military aircraft in the U.S., has seen its share price increase 25% since the beginning of 2024. The company also manufactures some medical and telecommunications equipment, though aircraft parts are its main business. Strong earnings and a near monopoly over commercial aircraft components have increased HEI stock.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIs oil producer Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) one of July’s best stocks to buy? Warren Buffett seems to think so. Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B), continues buying OXY stock. In mid-June, Berkshire bought Occidental Petroleum shares for nine consecutive days, pushing his ownership stake to nearly 30%. Buffett now owns more than 255 million shares of OXY stock worth just under $16 billion.\n\nBuffett buys more stock every time the share price falls below $60. With OXY stock down 13% from its 52-week high of $71.18 in April, Buffett has been buying hand over fist. Beyond Buffett, now is also a good time to purchase Occidental Petroleum stock as crude oil prices rise along with summer demand. West Texas Intermediate (NYSE:WTI) crude oil, the U.S. standard, is trading at $83 a barrel, up from less than $75 per barrel this spring. Some analysts see crude prices topping $90 this year.\n\nOXY stock has risen 5% over the last 12 months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Amazon founder and executive chair Jeff Bezos is planning to sell almost $5 billion worth of shares in the e-commerce giant, a regulatory filing showed, after its stock hit a record high.\n\nThe proposed sale of 25 million shares was disclosed in a notice filed after market hours on Tuesday. The stock had hit an all-time high of $200.43 during the session. It has jumped more than 30% so far this year, outpacing the 4% gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index.\n\nAfter the sale plan, Bezos would own about 912 million Amazon shares, or 8.8% of the outstanding stock.\n\nHe sold shares worth roughly $8.5 billion in February, after the stock rallied 80% in 2023.\n\nBezos is ranked the second-richest person in the world with a net worth of $214.4 billion, according to Forbes. He is also the founder of space company Blue Origin, which launched a six-person crew to the edge of space in May.\n\nAmazon posted upbeat first-quarter results in April, as the Seattle-based technology giant rode the artificial intelligence wave. The company recently replaced Adam Selipsky as the head of its cloud computing unit with insider Matt Garman.\n\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Top 3 Social Media Stocks to Own This Month",
        "content": "An average American spends about 2 hours and 23 minutes daily on social media apps. While it has its positives and negatives, we must look at the bigger picture and understand the role of social media in our lives. Given the current times, it is impossible to live without social media, and we have at least one app installed on our phones. Investors know that social media has become a big part of our lives and is here to stay. If you want to make the most of it, invest in top social media stocks.\n\nThey will show steady growth over the next five years, and if you buy the stock at a discount, you can take home bigger gains. Even if we assume that a user accesses only two apps per day, with billions of users, it is a lot of money for the social media giants. I’ve identified three social media companies that are the talk of the town right now, and they are set to continue their rally. Let’s take a look at them.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nCall it an artificial intelligence (AI) push or an improvement in the economy, which has led to higher ad revenue. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been on a rally since the beginning of the year and isn’t done yet.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUp 45% year-to-date and 86% in the past 12 months, META stock is exchanging hands for $504, which could keep roaring higher. Yes, the company has been under regulatory scrutiny and has had to pay fines in the past, but this has not stopped its growth. It has faced many adversities but has bounced back. How?\n\nThe company’s fundamentals show that there could be more momentum coming. It makes most of its money from advertising revenue and has billions of users accessing its apps. Meta could soon become a social media powerhouse with the family of apps it owns.\n\nIn the recent quarter, its daily active users jumped 7% year-over-year to hit 3.24 billion. This growth attracts marketers who want to capture this user base. In the first quarter, the company’s ad volume jumped 20% year over year, and its price per ad increased by 6%.\n\nWith a rise in digital advertising, Meta is set to benefit. Analysts expect healthy revenue growth from the company throughout the year, and this world-class business has a long way to go. The stock could outperform the market in the long term.\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.\n\nSource: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best social media stocks to own right now, Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), is a hot stock to buy and hold for the next five years. The global audio streaming giant has more than 239 million global users and is known as a dominant industry player.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s growth story has been phenomenal, and it offers a free, ad-supported model and premium subscriptions. It recently hiked the premium subscription plans, and Wall Street believes that consumers will absorb this price hike, which only means good news for investors.\n\nFundamentally, Spotify is in an excellent place. In the first quarter, the company saw a 20% YOY jump in revenue to 3.6 billion Euros, and the EPS soared 184% YOY to 97 cents per share.\n\nSpotify’s management is focusing on growing profitability this year. It has enough cash flow to keep investing in the business, and it ended the quarter with a cash balance of 4.7 billion euros. Spotify has also introduced a basic, low-priced plan in the U.S.\n\nTrading at $313, SPOT stock is up 66% YTD and 95% in the past 12 months. There is no stopping Spotify’s rally, and investors who own the stock need to hold it tight. Spotify’s ambitious plans of growing the content library and improving user experience through personalized recommendations sets it apart from the other players in the industry.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo. PINS stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / shutterstock\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) became a hot social media app during the pandemic when we sought ways to decorate our homes or bake bread. The stock soared as high as $85 in 2021 but has dropped since then.\n\nWhen the pandemic subsided, we had to get back to our routines, which led to a drop in the amount of time spent on the app. However, Pinterest is regaining lost ground, up 58% in the past 12 months and 18% YTD. It is exchanging hands for $43 and is close to the 52-week high.\n\nThe company has invested in AI to enhance content recommendations, which will benefit it in the long term. It is also working on building the next generation of machine learning technologies, and the more tech improvements it makes, the higher the revenue will grow.\n\nIn the first quarter, it reported a revenue of $740 million, up 23% YOY, and it is seeing revenue growth from partnerships with the top e-commerce companies, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It enjoys positive cash flow, which allows it the flexibility to invest in business growth.\n\nThe image-focused platform could gain popularity in the coming years. While it is up 18% this year, it is still down from the highs of 2021. This means there is a lot of room to run.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Tyler’s TYL shares jumped 21.7% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Business - Software Services industry’s decline of 0.6% in the same time frame. This indicates the confidence of investors in the company’s persistent client wins and strong financials.\n\nRecently, Tyler and the Arizona Supreme Court have signed an agreement on extending the use of TYL’s Enterprise Supervision solution for juvenile probation. This agreement builds on the previous collaboration in which these two entities are working on streamlining adult probation. The new agreement will enable the Arizona Supreme Court to expand the use of this solution across all 15 counties.\n\nThrough this deal, the Arizona Supreme Court will replace its existing legacy case management system (CMS) with Tyler’s commercial CMS, which uses the latest cloud technology of Amazon’s AMZN Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).\n\nThe Enterprises Supervision solution is deployed to streamline the probation process by simplifying coordination, enabling better communication and implementing tracking. The solution will track cases, monitor finances, automate client check-ins and create detailed reports. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPositive Industry Trends\n\nThe public sector's growing dependence on technology to enhance efficiency and service delivery bodes well for Tyler. Public sector agencies and government bodies at all levels are investing in digital transformation initiatives, which include improving cybersecurity modernizing legacy systems, and adopting cloud-based solutions. Tyler is well positioned to benefit from these industry trends as a trusted partner to the public sector.\n\nTYL is also leveraging its partnership with Microsoft MSFT and Amazon’s AWS and implementing their offerings to deliver its solutions.\n\nTYL has collaborated with Microsoft to develop core public sector functionality in MSFT’s Dynamics 365 for finance and operations. The company recently signed an extended collaboration agreement with its long-standing partner, Amazon’s AWS, to accelerate the migration of its clients from on-premise to the cloud ecosystem.\n\nA robust demand environment, along with its sustained focus on expanding its market presence and enhancing partnerships, is driving Tyler’s financial performance. In the first quarter of 2024, its revenues and non-GAAP EPS jumped 8.6% and 25%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for TYL’s 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 4 cents to $9.19 per share, indicating growth of 17.8% year over year. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $2.12 billion, indicating 8.8% year-over-year growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe long-term expected earnings growth rate is 15%, significantly higher than the industry average of 10.2%. Tyler’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average surprise being 6.7%.\n\nNear-Term Headwinds\n\nTyler faces near-term challenges, such as delayed procurement processes and lengthening sales cycles, caused by ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. Many of its customers are wary of a probable economic slowdown which is evident from their low budget allocation for digital transformation.\n\nTYL faces tough competition from industry leaders like Oracle ORCL and SAP across various market spaces. These include Public Sector Cloud, PeopleSoft ERP solution, JD Edwards by Oracle and S/4HANA, SuccessFactors, Ariba, Analytics Cloud and Integrated Business Planning by SAP.\n\nThe competition from Oracle and SAP forces TYL to continuously invest in research and development. Moreover, the rising competition keeps Tyler’s product pricing under pressure, affecting its gross margin.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe new agreement with the Arizona Supreme Court adds to the continuous flow of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s growing client base, adding to its top line. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nDespite near-term macroeconomic headwinds and consistent competitive pressure, Tyler is continuously expanding its market presence and rolling out innovative solutions to grow its public sector customer base.

        "title": "Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "If the last few years have anything to teach us, it's to never bet against America's big tech. With shares up 104% over the previous five years, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has navigated both the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2022 inflation crisis while keeping shareholder value intact (although it was a bumpy ride). Let's explore what the next half-decade could have in store for the diversified technology conglomerate.\n\nReinforcing the foundation\n\nWhile Amazon has successfully diversified itself into businesses ranging from cloud computing to artificial intelligence (AI), its foundation remains e-commerce. In 2022, this sprawling segment had begun to underperform because of COVID-era overexpansion and high inflation, which squeezed consumer purchasing power. But now, those challenges are in the past.\n\nAmazon's first-quarter net sales rose 13% year over year to $143.3 billion. But more importantly, its operating income surged more than threefold from $4.8 billion to $15.3 billion over the same time frame.\n\nThis transformation was partially driven by significant cost savings in North American e-commerce (where management increased operating income by 455% to $4.98 billion) and international e-commerce (where they swung from a loss of $1.25 billion to a gain of $903 million). Amazon's new decentralized fulfillment network and layoffs are transforming its bottom line, allowing it to focus on exciting new growth drivers.\n\nPivoting to new growth drivers\n\nAmazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), will be the key to its future growth. Like with e-commerce, management has targeted significant layoffs here. And it has paid off, with operating profits jumping 84% to $9.4 billion.\n\nOver the next five years, investors can expect this segment to enjoy continued growth as it benefits from increased AI-related demand -- particularly from start-ups like Anthropic, which uses its industry-leading cloud platform for storage and data management.\n\nAmazon boasts its own custom AI training chips (Inferentia and Trainium), designed to attract clients to AWS's cloud services by offering competitive training speeds at potentially lower costs. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut growth plans aren't limited to AWS. According to the Financial Times, management aims to develop a new retail channel to ship goods to American shippers directly from warehouses in China. Delivery times will be significantly longer than Amazon's typical one-to-two-day waits but will involve significant cost savings for consumers.\n\nUnlike AWS, this new retail channel probably won't generate high-margin growth. However, it could help Amazon protect its market share from low-cost Chinese rivals like Temu (a subsidiary of PDD Holdings) or Shein.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Amazon stock still a buy?\n\nLong-term investors should always consider valuation when picking a stock because this data shows how much of your buy thesis has already been priced in by other market participants. For Amazon, a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 43 means its shares are valued slightly higher than the Nasdaq-100 average of 31.\n\nThis looks like a fair premium to pay, considering the company's bottom-line momentum and new growth opportunities in AI technology. The stock looks likely to continue outperforming over the next five years. And it's not too late to buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Know Your Options: Three Secrets Every Trader Should Know",
        "content": "“Progress always involves risk. You can’t steal second base and keep your foot on first.” – Frederick B. Wilcox\n\nThe world of option trading is a fast-paced and exciting one. It can also be extremely lucrative provided that traders understand the risks involved. Options contain inherent leverage that make them riskier than owning individual stocks and ETFs, but as traders, it’s our job to identify those risks and put the odds back in our favor.\n\nWe are in the business of prudent speculation. We must manage risk as best we can while employing a powerful approach that produces consistent profits. Sounds easy, right?\n\nOf course, trading options successfully is far from easy. Many options traders fail because they attempt to predict the future, and as most options expire worthless, it’s not difficult to see why they have a low rate of success.\n\nFortunately, there are methods you can start using today to reverse conventional wisdom and stack the deck in your favor. Let’s review three secrets that every options trader can benefit from.\n\nSecret #1: Use an Online Discount Broker\n\nOver the past few years, trading commissions have drastically decreased – including those for options. Discount brokers have been competing forcefully with one another, and all this competition has driven down rates. Individuals can now trade stocks for free in most cases, and options contracts cost just pennies on the dollar.\n\nWith today’s investment landscape relying heavily on mobile applications, digital technology and the internet, many investors are opting to buy and sell securities for themselves rather than pay advisors larger commissions to execute trades. These low commissions have reduced investment costs to the point where they are almost insignificant.\n\nWhile there will likely always be a need for full-service brokers (as they do provide a valuable service for investors who need more guidance), the trend is clearly moving away from this method.\n\nThere’s no shortage of options for discount brokers; traders should do their homework and decide which firm is best for their individual situation.\n\nSecret #2: Reduce the Hidden Costs of Trading Options\n\nThere is always another party on the other side of every trade. Similar to when we buy and sell stocks, transacting in options involves dealing with a “market maker” on the other side. For example, when we purchase a call option, the market maker is selling us that same option.\n\nOptions are generally not as liquid as stocks, and therefore the market maker attempts to realize a profit from the bid/ask spread. This spread is typically much wider for options as opposed to stocks. This makes it more difficult to trade options, particularly those with low volumes. It also allows the market maker to be compensated for taking on the risk of the other side of the transaction.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne way we can alleviate this problem is with the use of limit orders. A limit order is a trade order to purchase or sell a security at a specified price or better. In effect, this order specifies the highest price we are willing to pay to buy and the lowest price we are willing to accept to sell a given security.\n\nLet’s take a look at an example. Amazon stock AMZN currently meets our criteria for a call option purchase. We can see below that the AMZN August 16 160-strike call has a bid quote of 41.6 points and an ask of 42 points. As options cover 100 shares of the underlying security, the current asking price for interested buyers is $4,200 per contract, while the bid price for interested sellers is $4,160. Chicago Board Options Exchange Chicago Board Options Exchange\n\nImage Source: Chicago Board Options Exchange\n\nIf you were to use a market order to purchase this call option, we’d expect to be filled at the ask price. But we can use limit orders to discover the best price that a market maker is willing to sell us this option. I’ve often found that we can get filled at the midpoint between the bid and ask, saving us $20 for a total of $4,180 in this example.\n\nFinding a market maker that is able to buy or sell at a more favorable price can result in significant cost savings over time. In this example, the bid/ask spread wasn’t very wide, but keep in mind that these savings can become much more substantial when dealing with underlying stocks (and their associated options) that aren’t as liquid as Amazon.\n\nSecret #3: Quantify the Risk/Reward of Every Trade Beforehand\n\nAmazon is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the time of this writing and is in a price uptrend, making it a good candidate for a call option purchase. When done correctly, trading options provides huge profit opportunities with limited risk.\n\nResuming our example, we’re going to target the AMZN August 16160-strike call. This option has an expiration date of August 16th, which is about a month and a half away. Purchasing this option gives us the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of Amazon stock at $160 on or before the expiration date.\n\nThe table below displays the risk/reward profile for this trade. Amazon is currently trading at $200/share (orange box). We are purchasing 1 August 16 160-strike call at 41.8 points, which is the option premium. Since options account for 100 shares of the underlying stock, the total cost for this call option trade is $4,180 as we can see in the yellow highlighted box. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe top (blue) row shows the performance of AMZN stock based on different percentage scenarios at expiration. The bottom (purple) row shows the corresponding percentage return for our call option trade. We can see that if AMZN remains flat, this trade would encounter a minor loss of 4.3%. If AMZN moves up 5%, this trade will realize a 19.6% profit. If AMZN advances 15%, we would realize a 67.5% profit.\n\nThis illustration shows the inherent leverage that options provide. A stock investor who bought 100 shares of Amazon would have to contribute $20,000, which is a much bigger investment. A 15% increase in the stock price would yield a $3,000 profit.\n\nOn the other hand, in this example the option trader only needs to contribute $4,180 to control the same amount of underlying AMZN shares. A 15% move in AMZN stock would net a $2,820 profit – a nearly identical profit amount with only about one-fifth of the investment!\n\nAlso note that this option contains relatively little time value. The 1.8 points worth of time value (red box) equate to just 0.9% of the Amazon stock price. A good way to manage risk when buying call options is to minimize time value and maximize intrinsic value, as time value decays rapidly in the days leading up to option expiration.\n\nBy managing the risk/reward relationship and using the methods discussed to reduce the costs of options trading, we can effectively put the odds back into our favor.\n\nDisclosure: The author may hold a position in the security mentioned.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Stocks This Amazon-Backed AI Says Will Turn $1K into $1M by 2030",
        "content": "Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has more skin in the AI game than many people would like to think. Of course, the first thing that would spring to mind is the company’s AWS cloud division. But it’s important to also remember that Amazon has invested $4 billion into a company called Anthropic. Anthropic was founded by former members of OpenAI, Daniela Amodei and Dario Amodei.\n\nIf you haven’t heard about it yet, this company is behind an AI model called “Claude.” It is essentially a ChatGPT competitor, and I believe it is leaving OpenAI in the dust. Indeed, this model is much better at coding and understanding humans.\n\nAnthropic’s Claude 3 dominated benchmarks this year, and while OpenAI took the crown back with GPT-4o, I believe we can safely say that Claude 3.5 Sonnet has taken the crown back again. This model features a huge jump in performance. Most impressively, it now has a feature called “Artifacts.” People can build websites, play games, and run code on a separate side window on Claude itself.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI think it is a good idea to see how well this model does when it comes to stock-picking. So, I asked Claude 3.5 to list some stocks it thinks could turn “$1K into $1M.” Here are three it picked.\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) Biochemical/biotech research scientist team working with microscope\n\nSource: Mongkolchon Akesin / Shutterstock.com\n\nI usually stay away from biotech and startup pharma stocks, but again, these are Claude’s choices. Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX) is an AI-enabled drug discovery company that’s using technology to revolutionize how we find and develop new medicines. The company has built an impressive pipeline spanning diverse therapeutic areas and has partnerships with leading biopharma players.\n\nRecursion is probably the best-positioned player in the AI drug discovery space, given its unique industrialized approach. CEO Chris Gibson thinks their strategy positions the company to achieve “TechBio escape velocity” in the coming years. This subtle but critical distinction between TechBio and traditional biotech likely drove Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) recent $50 million investment.\n\nHowever, we can’t ignore the risks with this stock. Like any pre-revenue biotech company, Recursion faces daunting cash burn and dilution risks. The stock could face a significant pullback if the market’s enthusiasm for AI cools. That said, based on my analysis of their cutting-edge platform and robust data assets, I see huge potential upside for the stock.\n\nKey catalysts to watch in the second half include Phase 2 readouts for REC-994 in Q3 and REC-2282 in Q4. Positive data could supercharge another surge in its share price. But for now, Recursion remains a high-risk, high-reward bet on the future of drug development. I would only invest if you can afford to lose the money you put into this stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nLilium (LILM) An image of an orange eVTOL sitting on a helipad, the ocean in the background. best flying car stocks\n\nSource: Chesky / Shutterstock\n\nLilium (NASDAQ:LILM) is developing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for regional air mobility. I believe Lilium is a high-risk, high-reward play in the eVTOL space that could deliver explosive returns if it executes. The company has a business model targeting the most profitable parts of aviation.\n\nWhile Lilium currently generates minimal revenue, analysts expect sales to inflect sharply higher starting next year, potentially reaching $5 billion in 2032 if eVTOL adoption goes mainstream. Profitability could arrive by 2027. However, these projections remain highly speculative given the unproven nature of the eVTOL sector.\n\nOn the positive side, Lilium has $215 million in cash, which management believes provides sufficient runway to reach commercialization. This cash pile should also allow the company to avoid highly-dilutive funding if they deliver on their milestones. I’d agree with Claude saying this is a buy. But again, that’s only if you can stomach the potential downside risk.\n\nBeam Therapeutics (BEAM) OLK Stock.

RSLS stock. Best Biotech Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeam Therapeutics (NASDAQ:BEAM) is a biotech company developing precision genetic medicines through base editing. The company made progress across its pipeline in Q1 2024, but this speculative stock still has a long way to go. Beam completed dosing for the sentinel cohort in its Phase 1/2 trial of BEAM-101 for severe sickle cell disease and advanced BEAM-302 with CTA clearance in the U.K. for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.\n\nWhile these are positive steps, Beam is still in its early innings of development, and is burning cash. Revenue declined 69% to just $7.4 million, missing estimates by more than $7 million. Additionally, the company posted a loss of $1.21 per share. However, on the plus side, Beam has a robust balance sheet with $1.1 billion in cash available to fund operations into 2027.\n\nI’m skeptical that this is enough runway, and that Beam’s sales potential is strong enough. I would not rate this a buy with the current level of losses the company is bringing in. Notably, gene editing and related therapies must take off for Beam to succeed. I believe CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) is a much better bet in this speculative space.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks Set to Soar if TikTok Gets Sold",
        "content": "Currently, ByteDance’s TikTok divestment fiasco is still in limbo. After President Joe Biden signed legislation to force TikTok to either divest or face a ban in the United States, ByteDance filed a lawsuit alleging violation of the freedom of speech.\n\nOriginally, the deadline for the sale was put around January 2025, however, the presence of the lawsuit has now put that timeline in jeopardy, and it’s unknown if the sale would even happen if the case succeeds. One of the other challenges in selling TikTok is keeping its algorithm. China considers the algorithm necessary for national security and is unlikely to allow its transfer to a U.S. buyer. The algorithm is crucial to TikTok’s success, and acquiring TikTok without it would take away from its original value.\n\nYet, should the company sell TikTok off to keep the platform alive, several stocks could jump at the prospect of acquiring the most successful social media platform in the world.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith help from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to provide its cloud capabilities, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) had agreed to acquire TikTok in 2020-2021 with a joint 20% ownership and enter into commercial agreements to provide e-commerce capabilities onto TikTok. However, the deal was off after ByteDance lost interest since Biden took a slower time and investigated national security issues again, lessening the pressure for ByteDance to find an operator for its US operations.\n\nCurrently, Walmart is the second-largest e-commerce platform in the U.S. The industry trend is now combining e-commerce with social media to unlock growth. This is because 69% of consumers trust influencers over information coming directly from a brand. Moreover, data shows that 64% of GenZ consumers use TikTok for information, and nearly 10% prefer it over an online search. The power in short-form content is probably why Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is building out its version of TikTok that links right onto its pages.\n\nWalmart certainly has the cash for this acquisition, with over $9 billion on its current balance sheet, and generates over $15 billion a year in free cash flow. Furthermore, its large size will enable it to secure debt cheaply for the acquisition.\n\nRumble (RUM) Person holding cellphone with logo of Canadian video platform company Rumble (RUM) Inc. on screen in front of business webpage. CFVI\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRumble (NASDAQ:RUM) is an international video-sharing platform denoted as free speech YouTube. It offers users a less-restricted information base and is opening itself to a wider range of users.\n\nThis stock is a risky investment that only pays off if the sale goes through–the issue is that RUM is not making much money and is running low on cash. As of quarter 1, 2024, the cost of goods sold was about $32 million, while revenue was only $18 million. On top of this, its user base is not growing; as of Q1 2024, it is at 50 million MAU, down significantly from its Q4 23’ of 67 million MAU. Without a growing user base, they cannot pay sustainably for their content creators.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe only hope left is their offer to buy TikTok from ByteDance after legislation passed forcing them to sell. In early May, Rumble expressed interest in joining a consortium to acquire and operate TikTok in the United States. But there are some issues. The biggest issue is that Rumble is not offering to buy TikTok stocks and technology, only to serve as its cloud technology partner, so they need a primary buyer to join the consortium, which, as of now, still needs to materialize.\n\nRumble’s business could survive by securing the cloud servicing gig.  However, there is only a tiny chance that this could happen and I am not confident in Rumble’s ability to do so. However, the market was extremely bullish and sent the stock up 18% after this was announced earlier this year, meaning its stock would still soar if the deal goes through.\n\nSnap (SNAP) An image of someone holding a smartphone displaying the Snapchat sign-in page in front of a MacBook.\n\nSource: Puckpao / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a potential TikTok sale, Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) would see its Spotlight feature, a direct competitor with TikTok, taking market share especially if its algorithm is taken out after the sale. In 2023, it was already expected that Snapchat would take over TikTok as the fastest-growing platform. In addition, it’s already beating TikTok by usage in the Gen Z group and is the most popular Gen Z platform\n\nSpotlight is growing fast with a 125% YoY in watch time in Q1 2024. This is helping to contribute to a 21% year-over-year (YOY) increase in revenue. The company also saw EBITDA rise to $46 million from $1 million in the prior year, and while SNAP hasn’t seen a profitable quarter since Q4 2021, the company is improving; it reported a net loss of $305 million in Q1 2024 compared to $329 million in Q1 2023.\n\nSnapchat should be on investors ‘ watchlists with the potential to gain market share in short-video content and improve financials among other acquiring TikTok stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Streaming Stocks at Risk as Cancellations Soar",
        "content": "It turns out running a profitable streaming video service is not as easy as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) makes it look.\n\nThe industry leader reported first-quarter revenue of $9.4 billion, generating net profits of $2.3 billion. Operating margins of 28% are golden. These are numbers the competition can only dream of.\n\nInstead, the landscape is becoming littered with also-rans, services that launched during the Covid lockdown era, when attracting subscribers was easy. Now that out-of-home activities are the norm once more, we’re confronted with more streaming stocks to avoid than to buy. Service cancellations are soaring.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChartr reports industry site Antenna data indicates customers are cutting the cord with streamers at an alarming rate. It says there were “a whopping 50.4 million streaming service cancellations in the first 3 months of the year.” Two years ago, fewer than 28 million subscribers cancelled their services, so churn is accelerating.\n\nTheir biggest hope for recovery lies in free, ad-supported streaming TV (FAST). For the first time, Antenna saw more new subscribers signing up for FAST services than any other option. Over 50% of all new gross additions were in ad-supported tiers.\n\nAs the streaming landscape rapidly evolves, these are the three streaming stocks to avoid now.\n\nDisney (DIS) disney stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDisney (NYSE:DIS) is on this list because CEO Bob Iger failed to follow through on his promise to turn around the company by avoiding embroiling the company in the culture wars. The entertainment giant’s movie and streaming catalog remains steeped in identity politics that turn off large swaths of fans. It seems clear it will eventually impact the whole business.\n\nDisney’s Inside Out 2 hit proves people will flock to a film that doesn’t preach to them. Still, its films continue to rack up large losses, including its once-powerful Marvel franchise. The Disney+ streaming shows have also failed to gain any traction. The recent Star Wars spinoff The Acolyte is the lowest-rated Disney+ streaming show ever, with a 14% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe streaming service heavily contributed to the $2.6 billion in losses Disney services suffered last year, though it did report a small profit in May. While Disney has over 200 million subscribers, that’s spread across Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nThe crown jewel of Disney’s empire is its theme parks. Yet investors need to question if the entertainment stock is turning off fans at the box office and on TV, how long will it be before it trickles down to the parks? For that reason Disney is a streaming stock to avoid.\n\nStory continues\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) The logo of the new Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) company on smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) saddled Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) with a heavy debt load, making it the next streaming stock to avoid. The streamer reported $39.1 billion in long-term debt at the end of the first quarter and another $3.4 billion in short-term debt. It had less than $3 billion in cash.\n\nRevenue from its streaming services HBO and Max was flat year-over-year, though adjusted profits did rise to $80 million as it heavily pared down selling, general and administrative expenses. The streaming segment, though, had fewer than 100 million subscribers, albeit 2 million more than it had a year ago. Executives from all major studios, however, agree the 200 million subscriber mark is the threshold that makes a service viable.\n\n“If you’re going to be a full entertainment service with live sports and tent-pole blockbusters today, 200 million is a number that can give you the scale with the hope for growth over time,” The New York Times quoted Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) chief of Amazon Prime, Mike Hopkins, as saying. Former Disney CEO Bob Chapek agreed, saying 200 million means “you’re big enough to compete.”\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery stock is down 37% this year and off 45% over the past 12 months. While it did make a small profit on streaming, it was only by including HBO sales to cable outlets that it did so.\n\nParamount Global (PARA) In this photo illustration, the Paramount Global (PARA) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast on the list of streaming stocks to avoid is Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA), which has been trying to sell itself to anyone with a wallet. Its stock is down 27% this year and 33% from where it stood one year ago.\n\nThe owner of the Paramount movie studio, CBS, various cable channels and the Paramount+ streaming service, Paramount Global has failed to gain much traction. It lost $1.6 billion on streaming last year. That was fueled by its high subscriber churn rate, which Antenna says was 7% in 2023. Paramount+ has 71 million subscribers, with 3.7 million net additions in the first quarter.\n\nLike other streamers, Paramount is seeing revenue growth because of higher FAST numbers. Its ad revenue jumped 31% last quarter. It also raised prices for its services. Just last month Paramount+ eliminated its $10 tier and created a new $12 level that also included its Showtime service.\n\nWith a sale all but dead, Paramount Global has no clear catalyst for growth. That is why it is a streaming stock to avoid.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in T and WBD stock.

        "content": "Are you looking for the best edge computing stocks to buy? These could be some of the finest picks.\n\nEdge computing is still under the radar, but it will be the next big thing, and a lot of money will be made.\n\nThe edge computing market was worth $16 billion last year and is projected to reach $217 billion by 2032. That’s at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.6%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEdge computing is all about processing data right where it’s generated — at the “edge” of the network, instead of relying on data centers miles away.\n\nAs we move into the future, the world will increasingly rely on edge computing to power trends such as artificial reality (AR), internet of things (IoT), self-driving cars and others that need data relayed at the point of contact.\n\nIn short, edge computing is one of the best investment opportunities this decade. Here are some of the best edge computing stocks you can buy now.\n\nVerizon (VZ) Verizon store sign. VZ stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nVerizon’s (NYSE:VZ) biggest revenue source is still its cell phone and wireless network business. However, edge computing is now a core part of the comms giant’s offerings. And with its brand recognition and stability, it’s one of the best edge computing stocks.\n\nVerizon offers multi-access edge computing (MEC), where a service provider moves mobile workloads nearer to the client to increase throughput and reduce delays.\n\nIts edge computing service can improve various processes in manufacturing, transportation, entertainment and other industries.\n\nVerizon’s share price has traded sideways over the past two years, but analysts are bullish on its long-term growth potential.\n\nBesides having an average Buy rating, Verizon stock saw Goldman Sachs initiate coverage this week — rating it a Buy, while investment analyst firm Morningstar believes “Verizon shares are attractive.”\n\nDeutsche Telekom (DTEGY) an abstract graphic of the earth in the cosmos\n\nDeutsche Telekom (OTCMKTS:DTEGY) is the biggest telecom operator in the EU, with over 252 million users and $100 billion in revenue. The company is now offering edge computing services through its subsidiary, T-Systems.\n\nDeutsche provides fully managed, end-to-end edge computing services to customers via T-Systems. Its edge computing product can also integrate with public cloud services like Azure, Amazon Web Services and Open Telekom Cloud.\n\nThis year, it’s been smooth sailing for the German firm, which reported strong first quarter earnings across all segments, per Reuters. It attributed the strong showing to an increasing customer base, price increases and lower energy costs,\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors will also be happy to know of Telekom’s current Strong Buy rating, which suggests analysts are super bullish on its stock. For investors looking to dip their toes in edge computing, Telekom is one of the best edge computing stocks to bet on.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is a tech company that builds highly scalable data center and cloud networking solutions, including edge computing.\n\nEveryone agrees Arista Networks is the de facto leader in this niche. Bill Gates even touted the company as one that could disrupt tech titans Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in cloud infrastructure.\n\nThings also look good financially for the Santa Clara, Calif.-based firm. Shares climbed 7% after topping earnings expectations and delivering a stronger-than-expected Q1 outlook.\n\nAnalysts are also bullish on Arista. Out of 27 analysts, 16 recommend buying. Two rate it Overweight, eight rate it Neutral and just one rate it Sell.\n\nInvestors will also be enthused by the fact that Arista stock has returned over 50% year to date (YTD). For investors looking for strong-performing edge computing stocks, Arista is hands down one of the best in the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Hope Mutie did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the stocks mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Lakehouse Capital, a Sydney-based investment manager, released its “Lakehouse Global Growth Fund” May 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. May was a positive month for global markets as discussions about inflation and the direction of interest rates went on. The Fund returned 2.2% net of fees and expenses for the month compared to 1.6% for its benchmark. Since its inception in December 2017, the Fund has returned 158.5% compared to 99.1% for its benchmark, the MSCI All Country World Index, Net Total Returns (AUD). In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund highlighted stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides consumer products, advertising, and subscription services through online and physical stores. The one-month return of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was 11.52%, and its shares gained 53.59% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On July 2, 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock closed at $200.00 per share with a market capitalization of $2.081 trillion.\n\nClearBridge Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its May 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered an impressive quarterly result that also came in well ahead of analyst expectations. Net sales increased 13% year-on-year to $143.3 billion and operating profits increased 219% year-on-year to $15.3 billion (vs the high end of guidance at $12.0 billion). As has been the case for several quarters now, the highlight of the result was the significant improvement in profitability metrics, as management continues to drive cost efficiencies across its retail operations and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Bigger picture, we continue to believe that the market underestimates the length of the runway ahead in the core retail business (note that e-commerce sales in the U.S. still only make up 15% of total retail sales) and that there is still significant margin expansion ahead as scale and efficiency benefits continue to come through.\"\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in first position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 302 hedge fund portfolios held Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) at the end of the first quarter which was 293 in the previous quarter. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported strong results in the first quarter and delivered $143.3 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVIDIA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe discussed Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in another article and shared Billionaire Phillipe Laffont’s top “Mostly AI” stock picks. In Q1 2024 investor letter, Meridian Hedged Equity Fund expressed its optimistic views on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

        "title": "These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Make Up 35.9% of the Entire Nasdaq-100 Index",
        "content": "The Nasdaq-100 index is made up of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. It's often used as a barometer for the performance of the technology sector, but it also features stocks from the retail, healthcare, transportation, and media industries.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 is weighted by market capitalization, which means larger companies have a greater influence over its performance than smaller companies. The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving a surge in the value of some of America's trillion-dollar tech stocks, and the following five now make up 35.9% of the entire index:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has a market cap of $3.3 trillion. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a market cap of $3.2 trillion. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has a market cap of $3 trillion. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a market cap of $2.2 trillion. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has a market cap of $2 trillion.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 is up 18.9% so far in 2024. However, the Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted index -- which assigns the same representation to all 100 companies regardless of size -- is up just 6.2%. The difference can be explained (in part) by the outperformance of the above five stocks, which have delivered an average return of 47.3% year to date.\n\nEach of the five companies has a track record of success spanning decades, and they are now deploying their vast financial resources to dominate the fast-growing AI industry. If they succeed, they could have an even greater influence over the Nasdaq-100 in the future.\n\n1. Microsoft: 8.71% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nMicrosoft is the world's largest company, which is an impressive feat given it was founded way back in 1975. To maintain its near 50-year track record of success, Microsoft had to expand beyond its roots in software development by moving into other growth industries like gaming, cloud computing, and now, AI.\n\nMicrosoft agreed to invest $10 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI last year, and it used the start-up's latest GPT-4 models to develop its own virtual assistant called Copilot. It's capable of answering complex questions, and generating text, images, and computer code on command. Copilot is now integrated into some of Microsoft's flagship products including Windows, Edge, Bing, and 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more), to help businesses and consumers increase their productivity.\n\nEnterprises can also access OpenAI's models through the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, which they can use to develop their own AI applications. Microsoft says 65% of the Fortune 500 companies are already using Azure OpenAI Service, which speaks to the surging demand for this new technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft is a widely recognized leader in AI, and the company is likely to continue creating value for investors over the long term.\n\n2. Apple: 8.5% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, which includes the flagship iPhone, the iPad, and the Mac line of computers. Apple recently announced its own AI software called Apple Intelligence, which was developed in partnership with OpenAI, and it could make the company the world's largest distributor of AI to consumers.\n\nApple Intelligence is expected to launch with the iOS 18 operating system in September. It will transform existing Apple features like the Siri voice assistant, which will draw on the powerful capabilities of ChatGPT. Plus, users will be able to instantly craft text content inside writing tools like Notes, iMessage, and Mail.\n\nApple Intelligence could drive a significant upgrade cycle when the new iPhone 16 smartphone is released later this year, which is expected to come with a new chipset designed specifically for processing AI workloads on-device. Apple's gigantic installed base places it at the forefront of AI's shift away from the data center and into the devices we use each day.\n\n3. Nvidia: 7.89% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nNvidia was a $360 billion company at the start of 2023. In just the last 18 months, it added $2.7 trillion to its market cap to join the $3 trillion club alongside Apple and Microsoft. The company's incredible growth stems from surging demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) for the data center, which are the best in the world for training and inferencing AI models.\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU set the industry benchmark, but the company is gearing up to ship a new generation of chips based on its more advanced Blackwell architecture. Its upcoming GB200, for example, can inference AI models 5 times faster than the H100, which could save developers substantial amounts of money as they typically pay for computing capacity by the minute.\n\nNvidia's data center revenue soared 427% year over year during the recent fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), coming in at a record $22.6 billion. Competition is ramping up but Nvidia remains comfortably ahead, so its run of success looks set to continue (at least in the near term).\n\n4. Alphabet: 5.54% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nAlphabet is the tech conglomerate behind Google, YouTube, Waymo, DeepMind, and more. Google Search remains the organization's largest source of revenue, and considering it has been the window to the internet for over two decades, it arguably has more valuable data with which to develop AI than any other company.\n\nAlphabet has developed a series of AI models, culminating in Gemini, which is designed to compete with OpenAI's GPT-4. Gemini operates as a stand-alone chatbot, but it can also be integrated into popular Google Workspace applications like Docs, Sheets, and Gmail for an extra fee, allowing users to rapidly craft content and boost their productivity.\n\nGoogle Search now also uses generative AI to deliver text-based responses to queries, saving users from having to sift through web pages looking for answers. It's helping to fend off threats from competitors like Microsoft Bing, which is powered by ChatGPT.\n\nInvestors seem to appreciate Alphabet's AI progress, because they have catapulted its stock to an all-time high this year and right into the $2 trillion club.\n\n5. Amazon: 5.33% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nAmazon is one of the most versatile AI companies. The technology powers the recommendation engine on its globally dominant e-commerce website, amazon.com, which learns what products customers like to buy and shows them similar ones in an effort to boost sales. Plus, it offers sellers a suite of AI tools to help them craft more engaging product descriptions, images, and advertisements.\n\nAmazon is also home to the world's largest cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which designed its own AI data center chips, called Trainium and Inferentia; its own family of large language models (LLMs), called Titan; and even its own virtual assistant, called Amazon Q. Plus, Amazon invested $4 billion in leading AI start-up Anthropic, which now uses AWS as its primary cloud provider and has committed to training its future models using Amazon's chips.\n\nAmazon hopes this will entice other start-ups and AI developers into the AWS ecosystem, giving it the edge over competitors like Microsoft Azure.\n\nAmazon's valuation surpassed $2 trillion just last week on the back of its surging stock, which currently trades near an all-time high.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in July",
        "content": "A boom in the artificial intelligence (AI) market at the start of 2023 kicked off just when tech stocks needed it most. Companies were dealing with the aftermath of an economic downturn the year before, which led the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector to plunge 40% in 2022. However, the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT seemed to breathe life back into the industry and reminded investors of the vast growth potential of tech stocks. As a result, the same index has soared 88% since Jan. 1, 2023.\n\nCompanies across tech have ventured into AI, an industry projected to hit close to $2 trillion in spending by the decade's end. The generative technology can potentially boost countless sectors as demand for AI services and the chips that make them possible soar.\n\nDespite this explosion of growth in the past 18 months, it's not too late to invest in the market and profit from its long-term development. Here are two AI stocks to buy hand over fist in July.\n\n1. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has been slightly overlooked amid the rally in AI. While rivals like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) have seen their stocks rise 745% and 144% since the start of last year, Intel's share price has increased a more moderate 18%. A series of challenges over the last decade have made Wall Street weary, including lost market share in the chip industry and the end of a lucrative partnership with Apple.\n\nHowever, Intel has announced significant structural changes in its business model over the last year that could trigger a change in fortunes for the chipmaker. The company is shifting its focus to two high-growth markets: AI and manufacturing. Consequently, Intel unveiled its Gaudi 3 AI accelerators this year, which undercut Nvidia in price and offer similar performance.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is building chip plants throughout the U.S. as it works to retake the top spot in manufacturing and become the primary chip fab in the country. The move could allow Intel to profit from rising chip demand across the market as companies like Nvidia and AMD outsource their manufacturing. INTC PE Ratio Chart\n\nMoreover, the data in the table above shows Intel's stock is a bargain compared to its competitors. Its considerably lower price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) suggests its stock offers far more value, making it a no-brainer this July.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nLike Intel, Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock is trading at a significantly better value than its rivals. The company is in steep competition with cloud giants Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) as AI has boosted the entire industry. Alphabet has the third-largest market share in cloud computing (after Microsoft and Amazon), yet is quickly catching up.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, the chart below shows Alphabet's shares potentially offer far more value than its rivals. The Google company's lower P/E and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios suggest Alphabet could be one of the best-valued stocks in AI. AMZN PE Ratio Chart\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Alphabet's revenue rose 15% year over year to $81 billion, beating analysts' expectations by nearly $2 billion. The company profited from a 14% spike in Google Services revenue and a 28% increase in Google Cloud sales. Alphabet's cloud revenue growth is especially impressive as it beat Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services in cloud growth for the quarter, with sales for those platforms rising 21% and 17% year over year.\n\nCloud computing has become a crucial growth area in AI as businesses increasingly use such services to integrate the technology into their workflows. As a result, Alphabet has invested heavily in expanding its AI offerings over the last year, introducing new tools to Google Cloud, adding generative features to Google Search, and improving its ad services.\n\nAlphabet hit $69 billion in free cash flow this year, only strengthening the argument for its stock. The figure suggests the tech giant has the financial resources to continue investing in its business and keep up with its rivals. That, alongside its bargain price point, makes Alphabet a stock to buy hand over fist this month.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Why Is Billionaire Phillipe Laffont Bullish On This Stock?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of Billionaire Phillipe Laffont’s Top 10 “Mostly AI” Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Philippe Laffont's other stock picks.\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont is a Founder & Portfolio Manager at Coatue Management, L.L.C. His fund’s top 10 holdings comprise of mostly tech stocks which depicts his love for technology. His thirst for technology was such that after graduating from MIT with a computer science degree he applied for a job at Apple multiple times but was rejected every time. This pushed him towards another calling, which was to manage a hedge fund and its holdings.\n\nPhilippe Laffont’s journey towards investing started when he moved to Spain where he started working at McKinsey. It was at this time when he learned about the “boom of the PC” and about the three pioneers of PC industry namely IBM, Dell and Microsoft. He decided to invest in these stocks which churned out more money than he was earning at that time. This led to his endeavors as an investor. In order to learn more about being an investor he got a chance to work at a mutual fund without pay where he learned about different terminologies related to the industry to “get his foot in the door”.\n\nAfter his employment ended in Julian Robertson’s organization, he moved on to gather funds to start investing from his friends and family but most of his funds came from professional brokers and people who admired his entrepreneurial spirit. This led to the launch of his company on January 1, 2000, with $50 million at its disposal and the fund's AUM now stands at $50 billion. His investment philosophy is to provide longevity and good returns for the investors; and to have investors that would bet on him for the long term. Philippe Laffont’s philosophy of helping out people is visible in his efforts to advise people on investing and he believes in helping any new tech “kid” that could become the next Tiktok.\n\nIn his interview at the Bloomberg Invest Philippe Laffont said that he is conflicted about whether small or big companies will be the AI winners. According to him the history of technology indicates that the big gets bigger but new companies have also made it through like Facebook or TikTok. He thinks that AI isn't overhyped and the valuations aren't out of whack right now. Here is what he said:\n\n\"It's true that the mentions of AI in every TV and and written form is very high. And so one could say, Wow, if everybody talks about it, it must be priced in. And the only reason why more positive is I remember when I invested in Apple in 2009 when the iPhone first came out and for years people told me, Why are you invested in Apple? Everybody talks about Apple. And obviously it had an incredible run. So I actually think that sometimes because someone speaks a lot about something, it might be actually a good sign versus an overhyped sign.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPhilippe Laffont thinks the next phase of AI will be real estate with data centers and especially utilities with power. Another phase of AI, according to Philippe Laffont would be robots with artificial brains called humanoids. The technology hedge fund manager also made the following prediction which has a huge implication for the semiconductor stocks:\n\n\"I've made a lot of mistakes, You know, betting on these new technologies like AR/VR turns out to be not so big. 3D printing turns out to be not so big. My estimate is $100 trillion was invested in today's dollar in the PC, CPU based infrastructure. All this is going to get ripped out to put $100 trillion or more in our GPU based infrastructure.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of Coatue Management at the end of the first quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the first quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAmazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) witnessed an increase of 12.5% YoY in the first quarter revenue whereas its adjusted EPS more than tripled. In addition to AWS business generating operating margins above 37% in the first quarter, digital ads also contributed to Amazon.com, Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue as the segment reported an increase of 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. The largest shareholder in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), according to Insider Monkey's database of hedge funds, is Fisher Asset Management that holds 42 million shares worth over $7 billion while Coatue Management holds 10 million shares worth $1.8 billion. Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon’s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack – infrastructure with NVIDIA’s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 2nd on our list of billionaire Phillipe Laffont's top stock picks. You can visit Billionaire Phillipe Laffont’s Top 10 “Mostly AI” Stock Picksto see the other stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Social Media Stocks You Can Retire On",
        "content": "Social media is a fast growing market that Goldman Sachs expects to double to $480 billion by 2027. To take advantage of this trend, many invest in the obvious social media stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Meta (NASDAQ:META).\n\nHowever, these companies are trading at all-time highs and there is no way to know if they are overvalued. When planning for one’s retirement, investing in hot stocks of the day is too much of a gamble.\n\nPersonally, I like to look for social media stocks that are already dominating their respective markets. It also doesn’t hurt if they can pay dividends shortly and are reasonably or undervalued.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nZoom Video (ZM) Zoom (ZM) logo on a building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt one point, Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) traded at over $550 per share. Today it trades below $60, 4.5% lower than when it IPOed.\n\nEven though the hype is gone, Zoom is still the leading video conferencing software with 57% of the market share. With hybrid expected to become the most prevalent work arrangement, Zoom isn’t likely to become irrelevant any time soon. The stock is simply not what it was during the pandemic.\n\nIn quarter one of 2024, Zoom’s revenue improved just 3.2% year-over-year (YOY). However, net income improved from $15.4 million to $216.3 million. The key reason is that Zoom is growing its enterprise customers who have higher margins, and because it’s expanding into an area known as Unified Communication as a Service (UCaas) which could mean unifying all of a company’s internal communications like video calls, chats and phone calls all in one place. For example, one of its fastest growing products is the Zoom Phone, which grew from 4 million users in 2022 to over 7 million this year and is essentially a business phone system that is online. It’s able to leverage its existing enterprise customers to sell them\n\nTrading at a 11.63x forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, it is below Cisco’s (NASDAQ:CSCO) 13.5x even though Zoom has more growth potential. Moreover, it’s proof that Zoom certainly isn’t the Covid-19 bubble stock of the past and that it could be undervalued.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Adobe makes a strong investment in the social media economy for one main reason — its industry dominance. 90% of creative workers use Adobe’s Creative Cloud in order to create the content on social media. On top of this, it has strong and proven financials. Since 2015 ABDE has experienced on average over 18% annual revenue growth. Adobe’s net income for Q2 2024 was $1.573 billion, compared to $1.295 billion in Q2 2023, this is a 22% YOY increase, due to the growth of the digital experience segment where it helps companies run digital ads. In addition, this is due to the fact of increased revenue from existing subscribers upgrading to its AI tools. Through Adobe Sensei and Firefly, AI tools are natively implemented and improving users’ productivity.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts valuation isn’t cheap, trading at a forward P/E ratio of 30.86x. However, with it being a dominant player and potentially giving out dividends in the near future due to its strong earnings growth, I think its valuation right now is reasonable and makes it a great option among social media stocks.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) can increasingly be considered a social media stock due to its growing position as a digital advertiser and its short-form content app Inspire.\n\nFirst, let’s establish Amazon’s dominance in its various fields. In e-commerce, it is the largest player with over 40% market share in the U.S. In cloud computing, AWS is the largest player and has 31% of global market share. For video on demand streaming, Amazon’s Prime Video is the largest at 21% of the market share. Lastly, Amazon’s digital advertising business is rapidly growing the world’s third largest digital advertiser at 24% YOY and outpacing competitors.\n\nGrowth in AWS and advertising has driven operating margins to improve from 3.7% in Q1 2023 to 10.7% in Q1 2024, helping Amazon deliver over 200% in net income to $10.43 billion. With strong earnings and better margins, it sets Amazon up to deliver dividend payments soon along with the others in the “Magnificent 7.”\n\nThe thorn lies in Amazon’s valuation, which is hard to argue given its trading at all-time highs. However, I would argue that the premium paid is more justified given the fact its current P/E ratio is lower now than when the stock traded below $100. Essentially, what we are seeing right now is that Amazon stock price is returning to its 2021 levels but this time it’s backed up by strong earnings rather than pure hype. I’m willing to take a bet on valuation for a high-quality company like Amazon.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que held a LONG position in AMZN.

        "title": "3 AI Stock Winners Defying Tech Sector Turbulence",
        "content": "With the kick-off of the year’s second half underway, investors may wonder if the same themes that outperformed in the first half will continue to work. Undoubtedly, AI chip stocks will still stand out as exciting growth bets for investors looking to play the technological revolution.\n\nGiven the likelihood that the artificial intelligence (AI) boom will extend for many years, it’s probably a tad too soon to dump your biggest AI winners just because the first half saw a slight uptick in volatility.\n\nIndeed, for long-term benefit growth in AI, investors will need to face volatility head on. This is not just on a weekly basis, but perhaps over a quarterly basis.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStaying invested in the top AI stocks will entail plenty of turbulence along the way. An example is the odd 15-20% correction like the one recently experienced by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Perhaps expect the near halving of a stock if fear becomes the main emotion on Wall Street.\n\nEither way, let’s examine three stocks that have defied recent tech turbulence and could continue doing for 2024’s second half.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nDespite posting a remarkably strong finish to the second half, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares still trailed the performance of the Nasdaq 100 year-to-date (YTD). With an explosive first day to the second half, with AAPL stock surging close to 5% on July 1, perhaps Apple could be in a position to lead tech higher.\n\nToday, AAPL shares are at new all-time highs, $220 per share, while NVDA stock is off more than 8% after running into a speed bump in June. Indeed, Nvidia was in the driver’s seat of tech and AI in the first half. For the second half, I view Apple as having the better, perhaps less-appreciated catalysts. And these may fuel a second-half surge that could be tops for the Magnificent Seven.\n\nIt’s not just the coming AI features on iOS 18 and the positive impact on iPhone sales, either. Apple seems to be catching a break in China for a change. A Bloomberg report recently noted that iPhone shipments rose 40% for the month of May. Prior discounts seem to have worked in a big way.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) ChatGPT logo seen on the smartphone, Microsoft (MSFT) logo seen on the laptop. Microsoft Copilot\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another tech titan that’s stood tall in the face of slight turbulence. MSFT stock is at new highs of $458.79 per share, with June turbulence barely affecting the $3.4 trillion tech and AI behemoth.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives views Microsoft (as well as Nvidia) as driving the AI revolution. He’s certainly not wrong. These two AI stocks are at the very top of their class right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nIves sees Microsoft as driving a “Bugatti” (a really, really fast car) at “100 mph” in the AI race, where most of its peers drive markedly slower cars. Specifically, Ives noted that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) drives a mere “minivan.” That’s an interesting analogy that tells the story of current happenings in AI.\n\nAs AI supercharges the Azure cloud business, Amazon may struggle to stay atop the cloud. Recently, Amazon Web Services (AWS) doubled the value of credits for startups, which may suggest worry over Microsoft’s cloud momentum. In any case, Microsoft looks unstoppable and perhaps still somewhat affordable, even as the trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio flirts with 40 times.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) Image of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise's building\n\nSource: zakiahza / Shutterstock.com\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprises (NYSE:HPE) stock has been holding strong after some late-June turbulence.\n\nOver the past month, HPE stock has risen more than 18%, marking an impressive finish to the first half, which saw HPE surge close to 25%. Shares are just 3% off their all-time highs, just shy of $22 per share. Perhaps the under-the-radar AI beneficiary is worth watching as the market faces critical tests in the second half.\n\nWith more investor focus shifting to data center plays, HPE stock looks as timely as it does cheap. The stock trades at just 15.45 times trailing P/E, quite a bargain for a firm that could soon feel the full force of AI tailwinds.\n\nTruly, HP Enterprises’ partnership with Nvidia could pay major dividends as enterprise customers look to buy into the new service “Nvidia AI Computing by HPE.” The HPE-Nvidia collaboration is a massive deal that could supercharge HPE’s growth, putting it on the AI fast track.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple and Microsoft.

        "content": "Ever since the Federal Reserve went on a crusade to increase interest rates and slow the progression of inflation at the beginning of 2022, investors have been cheering for a Goldilocks-type of economic soft landing. Last month, this narrative remained intact.\n\nThe S&P 500 index surged +3.5% for the month, the technology-heavy NASDAQ rocketed +6.0% (fueled by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other AI-related companies), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average a more modest +1.1% move thanks to the contribution of older economy stocks.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nDespite the looming presidential election this November and the recent debate, the stock market has continued on a +56% bull market tear since the October 2023-low, eight months ago (see chart below). The not-too-hot, not-too-cold economic data have provided comfort to investors. For example, growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the broadest measurement of economic activity, was positive (+1.4%) during the first quarter and it is expected to modestly accelerate in the second quarter (+2.2%), as forecasted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nIn addition, the job and inflation stories are staying consistent with the soft landing plot line, as well. The unemployment rate has been creeping higher, but currently remains near multi-decade lows at 4.0%. Inflation also continued its downward trend as evidenced by last week's Core PCE inflation data (the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge), which came in at +2.6%, the lowest level since March of 2021 (see chart below). Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nGasoline and food costs are significant inputs to the overall declining inflation dynamics. The two largest crops in the United States are corn and soybeans, and with those prices down significantly year-over-year (see chart below), it should come as no surprise that consumers are finally seeing some relief in skyrocketing food prices. Declining gasoline prices have also chipped-in to the improving inflation outlook. Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nWith all these economic statistics harmoniously aligning with a soft landing scenario, investors are currently comfortable in forecasting one interest rate cut over the next six months, and three and a half interest rate cuts over the next 12 months (see chart below). Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nSource:Yardeni Research\n\nBut a bull market cannot survive on interest rate cut expectations alone. Over the long-run, stock prices generally follow the direction of corporate profits, and as the chart below indicates (red line), fortunately, the path of profits has been rising after a period of stagnation last year.\n\nStory continues Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nSource: Yardeni Research\n\nThe last eight months have been an exhilarating ride in the overall stock market, which has been propelled by the multi-trillion dollar technology companies participating in the A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) buildout revolution (i.e., NVIDIA, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet-Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), et.al.). However, neither trees nor stock markets can grow, uninterrupted, to the sky forever. The recent environment has been jubilant for investors, but party participants cannot go on forever without experiencing a hangover. The best advice is to celebrate responsibly, while managing the risk of your investment portfolio, because eventually the cops will arrive and the party will come to an end.\n\nThis article is an excerpt from a previously released Sidoxia Capital Management complimentary newsletter (July 1, 2024).\n\nDISCLOSURE: Sidoxia Capital Management (SCM) and some of its clients hold positions in individual stocks , certain exchange traded funds (ETFs), including NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL, META, and AMZN but at the time of publishing had no direct position in any other security referenced in this article.

        "content": "Investors are keeping calm and carrying on, as thoughts of a second Donald Trump presidency begin to percolate amid President Joe Biden's prime-time debate debacle.\n\n\"The one takeaway from the debate last week was the market has sort of made its peace with Donald Trump being the next president,\" Bradesco head of equity strategy Ben Laidler said on my 'Opening Bid' podcast (video above or listen here). \"We saw markets sort of edge up a little bit and we didn't see that volatility.\"\n\nTrump and Biden left debate-watchers stunned, with the former spewing falsehoods and the latter appearing frail and out of touch.\n\nSince the debate aired the evening of June 27 though, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average are only down fractionally.\n\nShares of market leader Apple (AAPL) have gained about 1.6%, while Amazon (AMZN) has seen its stock trade sideways.\n\nMorgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson says he received client interest to rotate into 2016 \"Trump Trades\" in the cyclical and small-cap space, the morning after the debate.\n\n\"Market expectations for fiscal expansion, reflation, and less regulation under a Trump presidency drove these initial moves, in our view,\" Wilson said in a client note.\n\nOne area to watch to see if Laidler's thesis is fully correct: the sizzling AI trade.\n\nShares of AI bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) are off by 3% in the wake of the debate.\n\nSays Laidler, \"I think investors are looking back to the first Trump presidency and thinking, you know, that was fairly pro business and I made a lot of money — maybe we're going to get a repeat of that.\"\n\nInvestors generally enjoyed solid returns during the Trump presidency, despite various surprise events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the storm of the Capitol. Not to mention fresh tariffs on key trading partner China.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average returned 56% during the Trump presidency, according to data crunched by LPL Financial. The Dow notched 126 new highs.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed more than 50%.\n\nApple's stock surged in excess of 350% during the Trump presidency, part of a broad rally in tech stocks.\n\nPros say the gains were fueled primarily by the Trump tax cuts boosting corporate profits, and the wealth effect from stocks spurring consumer spending.\n\nBut those expecting sunshine and rainbows in a potential Trump presidency may want to dial back expectations, at least initially.\n\nWilson points out the backdrop for stocks is much different than in 2016.\n\n\"We would argue that the cycle is more mature today than it was in 2016, as evidenced (among other variables) by the two and a half year decline in the Conference Board Leading Economic Indicator series,\" Wilson said.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The market welcomed a reflationary playbook in 2016. Inflation was not a headwind to consumers in the way it is now, and the US economy was recovering from a manufacturing/commodity recession, the recovery of which was aided by the prospects of a pro-fiscal/reflationary policy regime. Today, inflation is a notable headwind to consumers and fiscal sustainability dynamics are top of mind for the bond market.\"\n\nFord (F) CEO Jim Farley says consumers may get a little nervous around the presidential election, but doesn't believe it will materially stunt demand for autos.

        "title": "Why Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) the Best Consumer Cyclical Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Consumer Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other consumer cyclical stocks.\n\nConsumer cyclical stocks are highly correlated with the economic cycle. Ideally, you'd want to buy them near the bottom of a recession when their prices are lower, anticipating a recovery and rising consumer spending. Essentially, owning consumer cyclical stocks is a bet that the economy will be growing in the near future. This is in contrast to consumer staples, or consumer defensive, stocks which allow investors to position their portfolio to hedge losses in the case of an economic downturn.\n\nSince consumer cyclical stocks are riskier than their defensive counterparts, they offer higher returns and also come with the corresponding increase in risk. Additionally, while determining the risk of consumer defensive stocks might be relatively easy and off the bat calculations can be used, conducting the same exercise for cyclical stocks is trickier. Investors determine a stock's risk by calculating its beta (β), which measures the tendency of a stock to move with the broader market. Stocks with a β greater than one are more volatile, those with a β less than one are less volatile, and a few (like gold mining stocks) can even have a negative β that makes their share prices move in opposition to the market.\n\nSo why is measuring the risk of cyclical stocks tricky? Well, research shows that investors can either rely on a 'reasonable' β estimate of 0.7 for defensive stocks or narrow them down by stock sector to define a β that ranges between 0.6 to 0.8. On the flip side, similar shortcuts are unadvised for calculating the β for consumer cyclical stocks. To determine the risk of these stocks, a case by case approach that takes into account the earnings volatility of a firm and the overall business model is recommended.\n\nBuilding on this, consumer cyclical stocks are dependent on the business cycle for their performance. In fact, data shows that if you're able to time the business cycle, then investing in consumer staples stocks can provide an opportunity to lead all other market sectors in terms of return. The business cycle is broadly divided into four phases, the early, mid, late, and recession phases. Each phase is marked by unique economic characteristics, and research shows that consumer cyclical stocks perform the best during the first phase. This phase marks the start of a new business cycle after the previous cycle's recession phase has ended, and its biggest traits are low interest rates and an uptick in economic activity.\n\nStory continues\n\nResearch shows that the first phase of the business cycle is the one that features the highest sector differentiated performance, with the difference between returns spreading to 25 percentage points. The stocks that lead the returns in this period are consumer cyclical stocks since lower interest rates and an uptick in economic activity allow consumers to have higher discretionary spending and enable businesses to expand operations through easy credit. The 'hit rate' (which measures the percentage of time periods in the business cycle periods in different cycles over time where the sector outperformed) of cyclical stocks during the early phase is 100%, which ties in with the performance of consumer staples in the late stage among all seven stock market sector performance across all phases of the business cycle. In terms of average returns, consumer cyclical stocks return roughly 12% as a category, implying that individual stocks will offer higher returns as the data is influenced by outliers to a large extent.\n\nSince consumer cyclical stocks are dependent on business cycles to a large extent and also rely on robust consumer spending, the next step in analyzing their performance is to see how spending varies within the cycle. Estimating what stage of the business cycle we're in is a tricky process, and analysts at the investment bank Morgan Stanley have tried to do so. Their research shows that we are currently in the downturn phase of the cycle, which precedes the early stage we've talked about above. We can also try to determine the business cycle's stage ourselves. Right now, inflation is still trending above trend in America (2.6% PCE in May vs 2% preferred), first quarter GDP growth slowed down (1.6% in Q1 from 3.4% in Q4 2023), and inventories at retailers jumped by 1% annually in February. These three metrics suggest that we might be in the late stage of the business cycle which typically precedes a recession. Consumer spending slows down in the late stages of the business cycles, the downturn and the recession, and neither cycle stage bodes well for consumer cyclical stocks. A key indicator of consumer spending is consumer confidence as it indicates future economic perceptions. On this front, US consumer confidence in March, April, May, and June stood at 103.1, 97, 101.3, and 100.4, respectively. A lower value signals lower confidence, and a value under 80 can signal a recession.\n\nTopping our analysis, let's take a look at how consumer cyclical stocks have recently fared to check whether the conclusions we've reached above are supported by stock market performance. As a refresher, 2024 has been characterized by investors pushing forward interest rate cut expectations and seeking shelter in a few stocks characterized by their strong exposure to the artificial intelligence industry. Two of the most popular consumer staples and defensive stock indexes are those managed by the S&P. Looking at their performance over the past twelve months, these are up by 14.8% and 5.8%, respectively. This is unsurprising since the US GDP has defied expectations during this time period, as it grew by 4.9% and 3.4% in Q3 and Q4 2023 and beat analyst expectations.\n\nHowever, Q1 2024 GDP growth slowed down to 1.6%, which not only missed analyst estimates of 2.4% but also came with some rather ill-boding expectations for consumer cyclical stocks as spending growth slowed down from its 3.3% growth in the previous quarter to 2.5% in Q1. This figure also sat well below Wall Street's 3% estimate. The data was released in April, and the previous release which saw the 0.4% inflation reading for March outdo analyst estimates triggered a 6% drop in the consumer cyclical stock index over the next nine days. Since then, the index has gained 6.57%.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo select the best consumer cyclical stocks to buy, we ranked the 40 biggest consumer cyclical stocks in terms of market capitalization stocks by the number of hedge funds that had held a stake in them during Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 302\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world's largest eCommerce provider, which allows it to command a substantial market. Its market size means the firm has to keep its focus on maintaining efficiency metrics to ensure that it does not lose market share to emerging competitors. Some of the metrics that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) needs to keep its eye on are increasing the number of day deliveries, reducing costs, optimizing its fulfillment network, and improving engagement with sellers to provide them with added value. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also one of the biggest cloud computing providers in America. With considerable resources at its disposal, the firm has a robust semiconductor design division, and its partnership with AI firm Anthropic provides it with runway to make more moves in the AI sphere - particularly when it comes to developing AI chips to reduce dependence on NVIDIA's products. Finally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also relies on its vast user base to run advertisements for its customers, and like the rest of its business divisions (eCommerce and Cloud) this segment is also vulnerable to any economic slowdown that affects business spending.\n\nSince cost control is one of the lesser talked about aspects of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s business success, here's what Alphyn Capital had to say in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\nMy previous analysis (Q4 2022 letter) highlighted the significant growth in Amazon's fulfillment expenses since 2015, masking the true earnings potential of its retail business. Though initially costly, the recent restructuring into regional fulfillment centers has yielded lower fulfillment costs and faster shipping times, leading to increased purchase frequency, especially among Prime members.\n\nFollowing the regionalization effort, over the last couple of years, Amazon prioritized cost control and reduced capital expenditures. At a high level, the North American segment's operating income swung from a $240 million loss in 2022 to a healthy $6.4 billion profit (6% margin) in 2023. Combined with continued strength in AWS and advertising, Amazon's free cash flow (as reported, excluding equipment finance leases and principal repayments) surged from negative $13 billion to positive $36 billion.\n\nAmazon stands out for pioneering the public market strategy of prioritizing long-term growth through sustained low margins and reinvestment, with the ability to later \"turn on the taps\" for profit. While many public tech companies have tried to replicate this approach, Amazon's scale and execution capabilities make it one of the few that have successfully pulled it off.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the consumer cyclical stocks to buy.

        "title": "2 Millionaire-Maker Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "There are about 24 million millionaires in the U.S., which is approximately the population of Florida. And while a million dollars doesn't go as far as it used to, it's still a healthy sum.\n\nThe stock market, and artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in particular, can offer an excellent pathway for those looking to crack the $1 million mark. So, let's examine two AI stocks primed to make (more) millionaires: CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCrowdStrike\n\nLet's face it, cybercrime is out of control. The most recent evidence is the CDK Global ransomware event that affected tens of thousands of car dealerships across the U.S., causing them to revert to pen-and-paper procedures as critical software for sales and repairs became unavailable.\n\nOne way for organizations to prevent these attacks is AI-powered cybersecurity, like the kind developed by CrowdStrike. The company's cybersecurity platform monitors customers' networks and proactively identifies threats. What's more, the platform benefits from a strong network effect -- as more customers sign up with CrowdStrike, the company's AI becomes more effective.\n\nThe benefit of CrowdStrike's software is reflected in the company's outstanding financial results. CrowdStrike's trailing-12-month revenue has skyrocketed from $250 million to $3.3 billion -- a more than 10x increase -- in only five years.In addition, analystestimatesfor next year's revenue haveincreased to $5.1 billion. CRWD Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nSimply put, the company is riding a wave of demand for better, more agile cybersecurity solutions as the number of attempted cyberattacks continues to skyrocket. Growth-oriented investors should consider owning CrowdStrike stock now and for many years to come.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon, a colossal company, has established market leadership in its e-commerce and cloud computing divisions. However, its AI division has yet to make a significant impact. This could be about to change, as Amazon's AI division holds immense potential for growth.\n\nIts Alexa-enabled smart speakers are the most popular brand on the market. However, turning these devices into a profitable venture has proven to be a challenging task for the company. Image source: Statista.\n\nAccording to a recent report from Reuters, Amazon's management is now intensely focused on achieving profitability for its AI division. The company is considering potential solutions, such as a $5 or $10 monthly subscription to access-enhanced Alexa AI, to reach this goal.\n\nAmazon's AI division is not the only avenue for the company to tap into the AI boom. The massive Amazon Web Services (AWS) division, with its extensive network of data centers and advanced high-performance computing clusters, is well positioned to benefit from the generative AI surge. Furthermore, advances in AI could lead to increased e-commerce and advertising revenue for Amazon, as marketers and vendors leverage new AI techniques to drive sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are multiple pathways to AI success. While its smart devices division has struggled to turn a profit, new plans are being hatched that may achieve that goal. Meanwhile, the company's other divisions, including its lucrative AWS and advertising segments, stand to benefit as the AI revolution rolls on.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) the Best AI Momentum Stock to Benefit from Volatility Ahead?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of the 10 Best AI Momentum Stocks to Benefit from Volatility Ahead. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWolfe Research has joined the ongoing market correction chorus as more and more experts warn of volatility ahead amid soaring valuations led by AI. Wolfe Research, however, believes investors would stick to mega-cap tech stocks to survive through this volatility.\n\n“Our sense is that volatility will continue to pick up over the summer. However, we expect this to generally benefit the Mag 7, secular growers, and the overall Momentum Trade in the weeks ahead.”\n\nWolfe analysts expect investors to pile into quality stocks that “they can count on” amid economic “data surprises” ahead. The firm expects “these themes to continue to benefit from an environment in which growth is slowing but the Fed is expected to kick off a deep cutting cycle.”\n\n“Further, our sense is that the biggest companies driving these trends will once again put up very solid results during 2Q earnings season.”\n\nSince Wolfe believes investors are poised to stick with Magnificent Seven stocks in the upcoming volatility and called The Information Technology (SPG1200-45)(XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) “big winners”, we picked Mag. 7 stocks and top 3 AI stocks from the XLK for this article. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) the Best AI Momentum Stock to Benefit from Volatility Ahead?\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nAnalysts at Wolfe Research believe Mag. 7 stocks like AMZN will perform well even during the expected volatility this summer.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Dan Ives of Wedbush thinks have the potential to grow based on the AI revolution.\n\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn’t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled “chatbot recommendations” as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strength in the application layer of AI.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\n\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported a strong quarter. Its focus on streamlining its fulfillment network through regionalization efforts has yielded significant cost savings and efficiency gains. These improvements, coupled with strategic investments in automation and robotics, are expected to further enhance margins and profitability in the coming quarters. We believe the set-up for margin expansion over the coming years is compelling. Driven both by efficiency gains and growth in more profitable businesses like advertising, Amazon continues to invest strategically in innovation and expansion initiatives. These include advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, hello the development of new fulfillment centers and delivery stations, and the expansion of Prime services and digital content offerings. We believe these strategic investments are laying the groundwork for sustained growth and market leadership in the years to come and continue to hold shares in Amazon as an unhedged position.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Momentum Stocks to Benefit from Volatility Ahead. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Technology is constantly evolving, and each trend has its cycles. Cloud computing gained prominence and popularity at the beginning of the last decade, and this trend reemerged during the Covid-19 pandemic. The moment is approaching when cloud infrastructure stocks will show their multiple growth again.\n\nReviews by leading investors may mention that further development of artificial intelligence (AI) requires the latest chips. However, these recommendations often overlook the need for adapted high-powered servers that can be provided by cloud market leaders. Further, the infrastructure and relevant data should be kept in reliable and convenient storage. So, cloud solutions come into play, giving individuals, corporations, and government agencies the ability to thrive in the web environment without the hassle of running their servers. Each of the presented stocks has gained 50% or more over the past year and are not ready to rest on its laurels.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIn investors’ minds, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is associated primarily with profits from the advertising business.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGoogle Search ranks first among the company’s successes and accounts for 90% of the market. Search, display, network advertising and YouTube form the basis of the business and provide the company with super-profits. In the first quarter of 2024, Google Search revenue increased by 14.3% year-over-year (YOY), but Alphabet intends to diversify its interests. Google Cloud strengthens the results of the mega-company, as it has added another thousand products and features to the total number. Alphabet is in a state of constant competition with other cloud infrastructure stocks and is improving to withstand the influence of other tech giants.\n\nAlphabet, the third-largest cloud infrastructure platform, is showing positive profitability, encouraging analysts to make optimistic forecasts. The current P/E ratio is close to 28, indicating a low price compared to other tech players. The company’s revenue is projected to grow by 11% CAGR through 2026. At the same time, earnings per share (EPS) is expected to grow by 20% on an average annualized basis.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile the general public was looking away at the hype of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been climbing step by step to the top of the tech world. The $2 trillion market capitalization is one of its latest achievements, cementing AMZN’s position among the top cloud infrastructure stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter a sharp loss of height in 2022, Amazon has shown that it can draw conclusions and catch up with competitors. It made timely staff changes and cut costs in several areas. In October 2023, the price was close to $120, while in the summer of 2024, it reached $197. Such results seem incredible compared to the starting value of 7 cents in 1997, but the stock is ready to surprise investors in the future.\n\nUnlike new names on the market, Amazon has repeatedly proven its adaptability and capacity to thrive in several areas. It is difficult to imagine the modern market of technological solutions without Amazon Web Services (AWS), which steadily holds its position against the competition from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. With annual revenues of more than $100 billion, Amazon can conduct researches and be among the first to implement global cloud solutions.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree.

IBM (NYSE:IBM) made a jump in the price per share from $138 to $197, proving the feasibility of diversifying its interests.\n\nThe company is generally pursuing a well-thought-out strategy, but several key initiatives have brought it to the top of the tech world’s Olympus. The acquisition of Red Hat for $34 billion in 2019 triggered the growth of the company’s hybrid cloud computing capabilities.\n\nIBM recognized the potential of artificial intelligence in time and launched the WatsonX platform. It has become the home of new AI-based solutions and has satisfied a large share of the demand for AI services. With a strong cloud portfolio and backing from tech-focused investors, IBM has set its sights on the field of quantum computing. In collaboration with Fundación Ikerbasque, the company has entered the forefront of computer science, preparing the ground for unique offerings. Analysts’ estimates elevate IBM among cloud infrastructure stocks.

        "title": "AI meets 'Do no harm': Healthcare grapples with tech promises",
        "content": "Major companies are moving at high speed to capture the promises of artificial intelligence in healthcare while doctors and experts attempt to integrate the technology safely into patient care.\n\n\"Healthcare is probably the most impactful utility of generative AI that there will be,” Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at AI hardware giant Nvidia (NVDA), which has partnered with Roche’s Genentech (RHHBY) to enhance drug discovery in the pharmaceutical industry, among other investments in healthcare companies, declared at the company's AI Summit in June.\n\nOther tech names such as Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Intel (INTC), and Microsoft (MSFT) have also emphasized AI's potential in healthcare and landed partnerships aimed at improving AI models.\n\nGrowing demand for more efficient healthcare operations has had tech companies racing to develop AI applications that assist with everything from appointment scheduling and drug development to billing to assisting with reading and interpreting scans. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger demonstrates an AI-powered ultrasound monitoring heartbeats in real time during his keynote speech at Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 4, 2024. (I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) (I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images)\n\nThe overall market for AI in healthcare is expected to grow to $188 billion by 2030 from $11 billion in 2021, according to Precedence Research. The market for clinical software alone is expected to increase by $2.76 billion from 2023 to 2028, according to Technavio.\n\nPractitioners, meanwhile, are preparing for the potential technological revolution.\n\nSneha Jain, a chief fellow at Stanford University's Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, said that AI has the potential to become as integrated with the healthcare system as the internet while also stressing the importance of using the technology responsibly.\n\n“People want to err on the side of caution because in the oath of becoming a doctor and for healthcare providers, it’s first: Do no harm,” Jain told Yahoo Finance. “So how do we make sure that we first do no harm while also really pushing forward and advancing the way AI is used in healthcare?”\n\nPotential patients seem wary: A recent Deloitte Consumer Health Care survey found that 30% of respondents stated they \"don't trust the information\" provided by generative AI for healthcare, compared to 23% a year ago.\n\nThe fear: 'Garbage in, garbage out'\n\nPatients seem to have reason to doubt AI's current capabilities.\n\nA study published in May evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs), which interpret media like images and videos, found that AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4V performed worse in medical settings than random guessing when asked questions regarding medical diagnosis.\n\n\"These findings underscore the urgent need for robust evaluation methodologies to ensure the reliability and accuracy of LMMs in medical imaging,\" the study's authors wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nDr. Safwan Halabi, vice chair of imaging informatics at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, highlighted the trust issues surrounding the implementation of these models by comparing the use of AI in healthcare without testing to the use of self-driving cars without conducting proper test drives. Doctors and nurses prepare a knee surgery tool that uses artificial intelligence (AI) at a hospital in Bandung, Indonesia, on June 24, 2024. (Ryan Suherlan/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nIn particular, Halabi expressed concern about bias. If a model was trained using health data about Caucasians in Northern California, he said, it may not be able to provide appropriate and accurate care to African Americans on the South Side of Chicago.\n\n\"The data is only as good as its source, and so the concern is garbage in, garbage out,\" Halabi told Yahoo Finance. He added that \"good medicine is slow medicine\" and stressed the importance of safety tests before putting the technology into practice.\n\nBut others, like Dr. John Halamka, president of the technology initiative Mayo Clinic Platform, emphasized AI’s potential to leverage the expertise of millions of doctors.\n\n“Wouldn't you like the experience of millions and millions of patient journeys to be captured in a predictive algorithm so that a clinician could say, 'Well, yes, I have my training and my experience, but can I leverage the patients of the past to help me treat patients of the future in the best possible way?'” Halamka told Yahoo Finance.\n\nCreating guardrails\n\nFollowing an executive order signed by President Biden last year to develop policies that would advance the technology while managing risks, Halamka and other researchers have argued for standardized, agreed-upon principles to assess AI models for bias, among other concerns.\n\n“AI, whether predictive or generative, is math not magic,\" Halamka said. \"We recognize the need to build a public-private collaboration, bringing government, academia, and industry together to create the guardrails and the guidelines so that anyone who is doing healthcare and AI has a way of measuring: Well, is this fair? Is it appropriate? Is it valid? Is it effective? Is it safe?”\n\nThey also stressed the need for a national network of assurance laboratories — spaces to test the validity and ethics of AI models. Jain is at the center of these discussions, as she's starting one such laboratory at Stanford.\n\n\"The regulatory environment, the cultural environment, and the technical environment are ripe for this kind of progress on how to think about assurance and safety for AI, so it's an exciting time,\" she said. An 81-year-old patient undergoes an injected brain scanner to detect a stroke. (BSIP/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) (BSIP via Getty Images)\n\nHowever, training these models also introduces privacy concerns, given the sensitive nature of a patient's medical data, including their full legal name and date of birth.\n\nWhile waiting for rules around the technology to be formalized, Lurie Children's Hospital has instituted its own regulations regarding AI use within its practice and has worked to ensure it doesn't disclose patient information on the internet.\n\n\"My predictions are [that AI is] here to stay, and we're going to see more and more of it,\" said Halabi, the vice chair of imaging informatics at Lurie. \"But we won't really notice it because it's going to be happening in the background or it's going to be happening in the whole care process and not overtly announced or disclosed.\"\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest health industry news and events impacting stock prices\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meet the Unstoppable Stock That Just Joined Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet by Topping $2 Trillion in Market Cap",
        "content": "Six American companies have a valuation of at least $1 trillion, and all of them operate in the technology industry. So far, five of them have graduated into the $2 trillion club or higher:\n\nMicrosoft is valued at $3.3 trillion. Apple is valued at $3.2 trillion. Nvidia is valued at $3 trillion. Alphabet is valued at $2.3 trillion. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is valued at $2 trillion.\n\nAmazon is the newest member, having crossed the $2 trillion threshold last week for the first time. The company generates more revenue than all of its peers on the above list, but that hasn't translated into a higher valuation because of its relatively modest profitability. Amazon's e-commerce business, for example, operates on razor-thin margins.\n\nBut the company is making changes that are driving substantial progress at the bottom line. Combined with its growing presence in artificial intelligence (AI), investors are clearly paying attention. Here's why $2 trillion probably won't be a stopping point for Amazon.\n\nAmazon is in its AI era\n\nAmazon was founded as an e-commerce company, and online sales are still its largest source of revenue. However, investors are keenly focused on its other businesses like streaming, digital advertising, and especially cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's largest cloud platform, and it's preparing to dominate the three core layers of AI.\n\nAt the bottom layer, AWS designed its own chips for both training and inferencing AI models, and they are growing in popularity because they can be up to 50% cheaper to use than some of its other infrastructure, which is powered by Nvidia's industry-leading hardware. Plus, they help AWS ease supply constraints other data center operators like Oracle(NYSE: ORCL) are grappling with.\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) make up the second layer. The AWS Bedrock platform offers developers an entire portfolio of ready-made LLMs they can use to accelerate the buildout of customer-facing applications like chatbots and virtual assistants. That portfolio includes a family of LLMs designed by Amazon itself, called Titan, in addition to LLMs from leading AI start-ups like Anthropic.\n\nThe application layer is third, and it includes completed AI software that is ready for integration into almost any business. The new Amazon Q virtual assistant is a good example, because it can analyze high volumes of data to identify potential revenue opportunities, and it can also analyze, debug, and write computer code to accelerate software development.\n\nBut Amazon's use of AI also extends to its legacy e-commerce business. It powers the recommendation engine on amazon.com to show customers products they are likely to buy, and the company also developed a suite of AI tools to help sellers craft more engaging product pages to boost sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon generates more revenue than each of its peers\n\nAmazon has generated $590 billion in trailing-12-month revenue, which is far more than any of its peers in the $2 trillion club: AMZN Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nHowever, Amazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio -- which is calculated by dividing its valuation by its revenue -- is the cheapest of the bunch: NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nSimply put, investors haven't given Amazon full credit for both sides of its business. In the recent first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), the AWS cloud platform contributed 61.5% of the company's entire operating profit despite accounting for just 17.5% of its total revenue.\n\nIts e-commerce segment, on the other hand, has inflated revenue but often generates operating losses because Amazon charges low prices in order to sell a high volume of products. But the company is making efforts to improve profitability in that segment. Last year, it split its U.S. national fulfillment network into eight regions, so certain geographic locations can stock higher levels of inventory for the most popular products. This means products travel a shorter distance to reach customers, which reduces logistics costs.\n\nBy the end of 2023, Amazon's cost to serve (the cost of fulfilling orders) on a per-unit basis shrank globally for the first time since 2018. Plus, during Q1 this year, almost 60% of Prime members in Amazon's top 60 largest metro areas received their orders on the same day or the next day. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says faster deliveries are prompting customers to order more frequently and spend more money, which is great for both revenue and profitability.\n\nStrong contributions from both AWS and the e-commerce business sent Amazon's net income soaring to $10.4 billion in Q1 2024, an increase of 225% from the year-ago period. That's a key reason investors have piled into its stock lately. Image source: Amazon.\n\n$2 trillion probably won't be a stopping point for Amazon\n\nBased on Amazon's trailing-12-month earnings per share of $3.57, its stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 54.1. The average P/E ratio of the other four stocks in the $2 trillion club is 42.9, which is why Amazon was so late to earn its membership despite its towering revenue (it looks expensive by comparison).\n\nHowever, improving profitability will clear the way for Amazon stock to move higher. Wall Street expects the company to deliver $5.41 per share in earnings during 2025, which places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 35.7. In other words, its stock would have to rise 20% by the end of next year just to trade in line with the current average P/E ratio of the rest of the $2 trillion club.\n\nAI could add further fuel to Amazon's results. The company recently invested $4 billion in Anthropic, and as part of the deal, the start-up is making AWS its primary cloud provider. It also committed to using Amazon's chips to train its future models, which could entice other leading developers to try them. Finally, it will make those models available on AWS for customers to use, which could help the cloud platform win customers who might have selected competitors like Microsoft Azure instead.\n\nIn summary, investors with a time horizon of at least two years are getting a great deal on Amazon stock today, even though it recently set a new record high. But investors who set their sights on the longer term could earn greater rewards as AI unlocks more opportunities for the company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Seeking Growth? 3 Large Cap Stocks Worth a Buy",
        "content": "Large-cap stocks are frequently targeted among investors. They typically have greater stability and a proven track record, two reasons why they're beloved.\n\nAnd in 2024, large-cap technology has launched higher, with small-caps unable to enjoy a sustained positive move.\n\nCurrently, many large-caps carry favorable growth expectations, including beloved Arista Networks ANET, Meta Platforms META, and Amazon AMZN. Let’s take a closer look at each.\n\nAWS Reacceleration Sparks Rally\n\nAmazon’s strong performance in 2024 has seemingly been overshadowed, gaining nearly 30% compared to the S&P 500’s 16% gain. Favorable quarterly results that have recently revealed a reacceleration in AWS has sparked positivity, with analysts also positively revising their earnings expectations across the board. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRegarding its latest quarterly print, Amazon exceeded both Zacks Consensus EPS and Sales estimates, reporting earnings and sales growth of 260% and 12%, respectively. The company was firing on all cylinders throughout the period, with operating income of $15.3 billion 220% higher than the $4.8 billion mark in the same period last year.\n\nAWS delivered great results, with net sales of $25 billion showing 17% year-over-year growth and snapping a recent streak of negative surprises on the metric. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThanks to the positive results, the company’s growth profile remains bright, with Zacks Consensus estimates suggesting 60% EPS growth on 11% higher sales in its current fiscal year. Peeking ahead to FY25, expectations allude to an additional 27% EPS growth on an 11% sales increase.\n\nMeta Platforms Benefits from Improved Efficiencies\n\nMETA shares have been big-time gainers in 2024, with improved operational efficiencies aiding its profitability significantly. Concerning its latest quarterly release, EPS of $4.71 showed 80% growth relative to the year-ago period, with sales also jumping nearly 30% year-over-year.\n\nThe outlook for its current fiscal year continues to remain bullish, with the $20.16 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 35% over the last year and suggesting a 35% year-over-year jump. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that the company’s advertising revenue has positively surprised in six consecutive quarters, with the most recent beat totaling 0.2% (or $46.4 million). Advertising represents the bulk of META’s revenue. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares aren’t expensive despite the strong run, with the current 23.4X forward 12-month earnings multiple comparing favorably to the 28.1X average of the Zacks Computer & Technology sector. Shares have traded as high as 31.5X over the last five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nArista Networks Benefits from AI Trade\n\nArista Networks upped its current year (FY24) revenue growth guidance following its latest quarterly print, causing shares to soar post-earnings. The company provides cloud networking solutions for data centers and cloud computing environments, reflecting an angle to obtain exposure to the AI frenzy.\n\nArista Networks is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reflective of positive expectations stemming from healthy business demand. ANET’s sales growth has been fantastic, with Q1 sales of $1.5 billion 16% higher than the year-ago period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConsensus expectations allude to continued growth, with earnings and revenue for its current fiscal year forecasted to climb 15% and 14%, respectively. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s sales on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nLarge-cap stocks have dominated the market in 2024, undoubtedly boosting many portfolios. Small caps have seen their performance hindered amid the higher interest rate environment, with many pointing to a rate cut as the spark needed to really get going.\n\nAnd for those interested in joining the large-cap trade, all three companies above – Arista Networks ANET, Meta Platforms META, and Amazon AMZN – deserve consideration.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 Budget-Friendly Stocks Getting Ready to Rocket in 2024",
        "content": "Budget-friendly stocks are increasingly hard to find as top-performing mega-caps edge ever closer to overvaluation. And, as we’ve seen with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) over the past week, even moderate underperformance can be devastating when so much of the wider market hinges on their performance.\n\nBut a handful of budget-friendly stocks are floating in the ether, even if we must reevaluate how we define those budget-friendly stocks. In some cases, they’re purely undervalued — even if per-share pricing seems high. In other cases, they’re cheap enough to fall within penny stock territory without all the baggage associated with penny stocks. Of course, the sweet spot for budget-friendly stocks is right in the middle: priced low enough that buying a handful of shares won’t break the bank while also offering some material undervaluation, whether based on current fundamentals or projected future performance.\n\nNintendo (NTDOY)\n\nSource: Nintendo\n\nNintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) is perennially on my list of budget-friendly stocks for a handful of reasons. Primarily, the Japanese company does business better — in my mind — than most public American companies. Specifically, while most U.S.-based public companies fight quarter-to-quarter, Nintendo always keeps the long game in mind rather than squeezing every cent of profit from customers on a short-term basis that ultimately proves devastating long-term. Perhaps that’s why Nintendo has been around since 1889 and continues thriving!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor proof of the company’s commitment to long-term excellence, look at its balance sheet — Nintendo consistently keeps ton of cash on hand with zero debt, providing it a sizable war chest to weather economic uncertainty and take advantage of new opportunities. In fact, a massive cash balance is one of the reasons Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) execs saw Nintendo as ripe for acquisition in 2020. While the buyout didn’t pan out, Microsoft clearly saw Nintendo as one of the best budget-friendly stocks in the market. Little has changed since then, inroads into greater intellectual property utilization that could be yet another cash cow for the budget-friendly gaming stock.\n\nPSQ Holdings (PSQH) The façade of the New York Stock Exchange is decorated for the listing of PublicSq (PSQH) via a SPAC with Colombier Acquisition Corp.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the much more speculative side of the equation, PSQ Holdings (NYSE:PSQH) trades in penny stock territory at around $3.75 per share and a market cap of just $110 million. But the former SPAC’s small size shouldn’t dissuade you — PSQ Holdings is at the forefront of emerging eCommerce trends, which I think will be huge over the next few years.\n\nStory continues\n\nPSQ Holdings’ primary property is the digital PublicSquare marketplace, which affirms a commitment to “help consumers ‘shop their values’ and put purpose behind their purchases.” For now, don’t let the company’s conservative leanings factor into the equation, no matter which side of the political spectrum you fall on. Instead, look to what PSQ’s ethos represents and how that could transform eCommerce.\n\nSocial media’s increased atomization of our online experience means we’re often trapped in a similarly-minded networked ecosystem — if you want to be charitable — and an echo chamber if not. It only makes sense that many would prefer to shop the same way: by picking an eCommerce market that aligns with their values, no matter what they are, and that they can feel good supporting. Factor in the fact that Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) offerings are of increasingly poor overseas quality, and many find PublicSquare’s emphasis on American-made goods even more appealing.\n\nUltimately, I think PSQ Holdings stands out among budget-friendly stocks for what it represents as much as its cheap per-share pricing. Considering it’s a relative newcomer to stock exchanges, I see lots of upside in the company’s future.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike PSQ Holdings, I see Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as one of our budget-friendly stocks because of its long-term potential rather than its current pricing or valuation. First, of course, is the “key man” issue negation as Musk’s pay package panned out. This, of course, cements his focus on Tesla and, no matter how you feel about the man, means that Tesla will benefit from increased personal emphasis on its performance.\n\nThat’s already evident just weeks after the decision as we’re seeing Musk shift his AI emphasis back toward Tesla. Tesla’s Texas gigafactory is building a massive GPU warehouse to position more than 50,000 Nvidia GPUs in a bid to realign AI development under the Tesla umbrella. This comes on the heels of Tesla’s announced $3 – $4 billion AI hardware expenditure, showing that Musk and Tesla are serious about asserting their position as AI leaders. Improved AI will go a long way toward addressing Tesla’s “March of 9s,” which, in turn, is effectively the last remaining hurdle toward full self-driving car capability.\n\nRumble (RUM) Person holding cellphone with logo of Canadian video platform company Rumble (RUM) Inc. on screen in front of business webpage. CFVI\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRumble (NASDAQ:RUM) saw a surge in viewership last week, drawing a diverse audience for the Presidential Debate. The platform’s ability to attract viewers interested in both the debate and their favorite pundits’ opinions sets it apart from alternatives like YouTube. Likewise, its unique user base and content moderation outlook make Rumble a standout among budget-friendly stocks for similar reasons to PSQ Holdings: it captures increased atomization of the Internet. It capitalizes on the trend of scaling the “1,000 True Fans” marketing theory that’s increasingly taking hold among forward-looking companies.\n\nWhile Rumble is not yet a major competitor to YouTube, its growth trajectory is promising. Despite a slight dip in first-quarter monthly active users compared to 2023 highs, Rumble maintains a steady global MAU count above 50 million.\n\nIn its latest quarterly report, Rumble posted a $0.14 loss per share per share, outperforming analyst expectations of a $0.22. Additionally, Rumble has boldly filed an antitrust lawsuit againstGoogle (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). The lawsuit accuses Google of unfair online advertising practices that favor YouTube over competitors like Rumble. Although the lawsuit’s uncertain outcome makes it a risky move, it also positions Rumble as a formidable underdog among budget-friendly stocks.\n\nStem (STEM) Illustration of robot hand reaching for the letters \"AI\" with tech symbols around it. AI tech stock predictions. best artificial intelligence stocks. tech stocks. AI stocks. stocks to benefit from AI growth. AI Stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Allies Interactive\n\nStem (NYSE:STEM) trades roughly within penny stock territory with per-share pricing at $1.10 and a $171 million market cap. But the company’s unique emphasis on both AI and sustainable energy supports a long-term growth trajectory, positioning it among today’s budget-friendly stocks.\n\nStem’s Athena software optimizes the interaction between generators, grid power, renewable energy sources like solar farms, and battery storage. Using an AI framework, Athena autonomously adjusts energy distribution based on weather conditions and energy pricing, making it invaluable for large-scale enterprise clients managing sustainable energy resources.\n\nDespite its penny stock status, Stem has ambitious growth plans. The company’s strategic vision, detailed in its AI & the Future of Energywhite paper, explains how AI integration will drive efficiency and advancement across the sustainable energy market.\n\nWhile Stem faces challenges typical of speculative renewable energy stocks, such as profitability issues and cyclical sales, it has moved beyond its startup phase with a growing portfolio of successful projects. Investing in Stem offers a long-term opportunity among budget-friendly stocks in the sustainable energy sector, capitalizing on the increasing role of AI in green technologies and infrastructure.\n\nFresh Del Monte Produce (FDP) Empty grocery cart in a grocery store aisle. Consumer goods.\n\nSource: gyn9037 / Shutterstock\n\nFresh Del Monte Produce (NYSE:FDP) is a unique budget-friendly stock that’s firmly within the defensive side of stock selection and provides a value-based anchor to a budget-friendly portfolio. Although sales dipped slightly in the latest quarterly report, the seasonal nature of fresh fruit and produce suggests a likely rebound in summer, making the stock an attractive buy at its current price.\n\nFresh Del Monte is strategically optimizing its operations to navigate economic and consumer pressures better. Financially, the company reduced total debt by 15%, saving costs in today’s high-interest-rate environment. Additionally, a renewed focus on fresh and value-added sales resulted in a 5% revenue increase in this segment, with avocado sales soaring by 23% despite overall lower sales. This strategic pivot has proven successful, and management is expected to continue pursuing this direction.\n\nFresh Del Monte offers a solid 5.25% dividend yield, allowing investors to build a budget-friendly position through dollar-cost averaging and capitalize on the company’s growing potential.\n\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock (GLDD)\n\nSource: Istvan Balogh / Shutterstock.com\n\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock (NASDAQ:GLDD) is overlooked compared to many budget-friendly stocks but uniquely operates within a small niche sector that goes mostly overlooked itself — waterway management, a key piece of the global supply chain puzzle. The company specializes in deepening, dredging, and expanding waterways along coasts and ports, which makes it relatively recession-proof, and its efforts in coastal beach reclamation align with climate change management initiatives.\n\nRecent financial performance underscores the company’s resilience in a sector that faced prolonged challenges during the pandemic. Great Lakes reported an EBITDA of $43 million, the highest since late 2021, indicating solid tailwinds ahead.\n\nLooking ahead, Great Lakes is ready to capitalize on a record $8.7 billion budget from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, fostering a strong bidding environment for securing steady contract cash flows. With a dredging backlog of $879 million, the company has a clear projection of future income, further stabilizing its financial outlook as supply chains normalize.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average has undergone many changes since its lengthy history. The index has been tracking 30 companies for more than a century, and recent changes have strengthened it. The Dow Jones has recently been kicking out underperforming stocks and replacing them with big tech companies.\n\nConcentrating on the Magnificent Seven stocks has been a winning formula for several years. There is a fund called the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NASDAQ:MAGS) that only has the Magnificent Seven stocks. It’s up by 40% year-to-date and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this list will feature Magnificent Seven stocks. You don’t have to fix what isn’t broken. However, some non-Magnificent Seven stocks in the Dow Jones are worth your attention. These are some of the top Dow stocks to buy that patient investors should monitor for long-term returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been regularly crushing the stock market as it expands into numerous verticals. Shares are up by 22% year-to-date and have gained 238% over the past five years. Microsoft’s recent gains come as the company perfectly positions itself for AI tailwinds. Copilot has strengthened Microsoft’s product line and makes it easier to explore new industries. Microsoft Cloud is also a beneficiary of artificial intelligence since the technology requires significant computing power and storage.\n\nRevenue increased by 17% year-over-year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Net income jumped by 20% year-over-year during the same timeframe. While Microsoft has many business segments, cloud computing is the most important component. Microsoft Cloud generated over half of the company’s total revenue and grew by 23% year-over-year.\n\nMany Wall Street analysts are bullish about the stock’s long-term prospects. Microsoft is rated as a Strong Buy with a projected 11% upside from current levels.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another Magnificent Seven stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that is worth your attention. The tech conglomerate makes up roughly 3.25% of the price-weighted Dow Jones. Shares have picked up momentum recently and are up by 32% year-to-date. The stock has more than doubled over the past five years and briefly touched a $2 trillion market cap.\n\nThe company is also primed to benefit from cloud computing through Amazon Web Services. This segment generated $25.0 billion in revenue, up 17% year-over-year. Amazon accumulated $143.3 billion in Q1 2024 revenue, which is 13% higher than last year’s revenue. Online marketplace sales achieved double-digit growth rates in domestic and international markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is a leader in multiple verticals that should continue to grow. Advertising, streaming, gaming and grocery shopping are some industries in which Amazon is a top player. The tech conglomerate has multiple ways to expand its revenue.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is the only stock on this list that isn’t a member of the Magnificent Seven. The fintech firm still holds its weight with a 21% year-to-date gain and an 85% 5-year gain. Unlike most fintech firms, American Express still trades at a reasonable valuation. Shares are valued at a 19 P/E ratio and have a 1.23% yield. American Express has regularly maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years, suggesting that cash flow will continue to grow.\n\nThe financial company is poised to withstand economic uncertainty since people always use their credit and debit cards for expenses. These cards are more convenient than cash and come with great rewards, such as cash or points back on every purchase. Revenue and earnings growth are still strong, with those metrics improving by 11% and 34% year-over-year in the first quarter.\n\nMore than 60% of new account openings came from millennials and Gen Z consumers, indicating that American Express is winning over younger generations. Appealing to the next generations is a critical component of companies that survive and thrive for decades and eventually centuries.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT and AMZN.

        "title": "The 3 Best Robotics Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "There are multiple signs that robots are already being used on a very wide scale and will soon proliferate throughout society. For example, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) recently reported that it had begun successfully using two of its humanoid, artificial intelligence-powered autonomous robots in one of its factories. Moreover, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that robots could one day generate more revenue than automobiles. And as of June 2023, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was utilizing 750,000 robots in its warehouses and fulfillment centers, up from 350,000 in 2021.\n\nWhat’s more, robots now carry out many functions in healthcare, including assistance with surgeries, supply delivery, and cleaning. According to one report, the global robotics market generated revenue of $46 billion last year and will grow at a compound annual rate of 15% over the next eight years. As a result, the sector is expected to be worth nearly $170 billion in 2032.\n\nHere are the three best robotics stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\niRobot (IRBT) In this photo illustration the iRobot Corporation (IRBT) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon reportedly wanted to buy iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT), which specializes in making robotic vacuum cleaners, to access the information the company’s products had gathered about the layout of consumers’ homes. According to iRobot’s founder and former CEO,  Colin Angle, the company’s operating system “can identify more objects than any other robot vacuum.” It can purportedly comprehend features of users’ homes better than the firm’s previous operating systems.\n\nAmid opposition to the deal from regulators, Amazon eventually backed out of the transaction. The e-commerce giant likely wanted to buy iRobot to tailor its products and marketing efforts more precisely to each consumer’s home. On its own, iRobot can use its operating system to enhance the performance of other robotic devices that it can sell in the future.\n\n“Other iRobot OS devices could have access to (the data), and through this shared understanding of the home, know how they’re supposed to operate,” Angle, who is no longer with the company, explained in 2022.\n\nWhat’s more, iRobot now has a tiny price-to-sales ratio of just 0.3x, and in May, it appointed a promising new CEO, Gary Cohen. In his previous role as CEO of Qualitor Automotive, Cohen increased “sales and profits by approximately 100% through the design of proprietary wiper technologies, improved supply chain and operations, and the (launch of ) an omnichannel strategy,” iRobot reported.\n\niRobot’s huge potential and tiny valuation make it one of the best robotics stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Person holding smartphone with website of US robotics warehouse company Symbotic Inc. on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. SYM stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs I’ve reported previously, Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) provides autonomous industrial robots powered by its proprietary AI software. These days, its robots are primarily used in warehouses. Among its impressive customers are Walmart (NYSE:WMT), FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Target (NYSE:TGT).\n\nOn May 8, after Symbotic’s strong fiscal second-quarter financial report, Deutsche Bank hiked its price target on the shares to $58, well above the shares’ current level of just over $35. The bank, which kept a “buy” rating on the shares, notes that the company’s robots help its customers utilize less storage space while reducing the amount of money they spend on warehouses. Deutsche Bank believes the firm’s products can meaningfully change the logistics sector.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that the company generated free cash flow of $18 million last quarter, while its EBITDA margin, excluding certain items, was 5.3%, up from 3.5% during the previous quarter.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) An image of a white, grey, and orange sign with the \"Intuitive Surgical\" logo and number \"1020\" on a patch of grass in front of a white, grey, and orange building on a sunny day.\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nA leading developer of robotic-assistance devices for surgeons, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) reported that the number of surgical procedures in which its products were used jumped 16% in the first quarter versus the same period a year earlier. Moreover, the firm now expects the metric to climb 14% to 17% for the entire year.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that, since the end of the coronavirus pandemic, Intuitive’s operating income, excluding certain items, advanced at an impressive compound annual growth rate of about 16%.\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, the new version of the company’s flagship robotic assistance system was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration and features many improvements over the previous iteration.\n\nFinally, Bank of America recently identified Intuitive as one of 26 “best of breed “stocks.\n\nIntuitive’s market-leading position and strong growth make it one of the best robotic stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a LONG position in AMZN.

        "title": "9 Stocks to Sell as AI Surges Ahead",
        "content": "I’ve got a surprising fact for you:\n\nNew technologies are often astonishingly S… L… O… W… to take off.\n\nIn 1950, there were only 25 million registered vehicles in America, or one for every six people. Though Henry Ford had introduced the Model T more than four decades earlier, many families still saw no reason to buy a car.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat’s because, besides “working,” cars — like all new technologies — needed three other ingredients to succeed:\n\nInfrastructure. Cars need roads, gas stations and service centers. Culture. People must want to drive. Incentives. Car-friendly regulations need to be in place.\n\nIn the automobile’s case, the technology required the National Highway System expansion of 1955, suburbanization and a rise of American car culture before it could truly take off. By 1970, there were 118 million cars on the road. By 1990, almost 200 million.\n\nThe automobile also illustrates how these three ingredients develop in phases. The Official Microsoft Blog calls December 20, 1922, “The Day the Horse Lost Its Job” after New York City’s last horse-drawn fire wagon was replaced with a motorized engine. Streetcar usage declined soon after, when motor cars began clogging up streets. It would take several more decades for railways to eventually succumb; between 1967 and 1972, six major railroads went bankrupt after competition from trucks and other intermodal transport options ate into profits.\n\nThe same was true for the fax machine, the personal computer and … even the internet. Infrastructure, culture and incentives are built in stages. That’s why Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) “beat” booksellers decades ago, yet still has trouble competing against fresh grocers and big-box stores like Costco (NASDAQ:COST).\n\nToday, the same battle is taking shape with artificial intelligence.\n\nSome businesses will survive for decades against this new technology. Surgeons, structural engineers and hang-gliding instructors all work with life-or-death situations. So, while AI might enhance the jobs in the near term, it would take significant cultural and regulatory shifts to replace these positions with AI.\n\nBut other companies are already beginning to struggle. These firms are finding themselves on the wrong side of history… and are failing to mount a counteroffensive.\n\nThis week, the writers and analysts at InvestorPlace.com consider three categories of firms – and nine stocks among them – that are especially exposed to “losing their job” in these early days of artificial intelligence…\n\nLow-End Content Creation: Where AI Will Hurt the Most A photo of a person's hands on a laptop keyboard. Several notebooks are on a desk surrounding the laptop.\n\nSource: Undrey / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThe lowest-hanging fruit for an AI takeover may be generic content creation – the stock imagery, clickbait articles and other low-quality content you see online.\n\nThat’s because AI already has the three ingredients to compete:\n\nInfrastructure. AI-generated content is now often indistinguishable from generic human-created stuff. Culture. Consumers are becoming more accepting of low-quality AI-generated content. Incentives. Regulations around AI-generated content is lax, so companies have an incentive to cut costs by using AI.\n\nNBC, for instance, found it wise to launch an AI version of announcer Al Michaels to read sports recaps from the Paris 2024 Olympics. Similarly, here are three companies that could soon see their content-producing “jobs” replaced by AI:\n\nShutterstock (NYSE:SSTK). This week at InvestorPlace.com, Thomas Niel notes that Executive Chairman Jonathan Oringer is selling millions of dollars’ worth of shares into strength – a big red flag in his book. The company specializes in stock images and footage, which are at risk of being replaced by AI-generated content. IZEA Worldwide(NASDAQ:IZEA). InvestorPlace Chief Investment Analyst Luke Lango previously turned bearish on this content creation firm… in 2021. He saw how much trouble the firm’s influencer-marketing-as-a-service was running into. Now, at InvestorPlace.com, we note how the firm is missing on earnings and revenues – a bearish sign of more losses to come. Fiverr International (NYSE:FVRR). In April, Ian Bezek noted that there were good reasons to be skeptical of Fiverr, an online marketplace for freelancers offering their services. He notes that AI will be able to perform many rudimentary tasks offered by Fiverr in coming years. A recent 20% price spike now gives investors an ideal window to take profits.\n\nMidtier Services: The Next to Fall A stack of open textbooks on a table in front of a chalkboard background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nProfessional services will be the next area to worry about. This segment still lacks some of the infrastructure required to turn AI into usable products. (Data collection remains a fragmented and incomplete industry, making it difficult to train specialized AI.) There’s also a culture issue of relying on AI to do important (though nonessential) tasks. The IRS will probably reject “AI did my taxes” as a reason to waive tax penalties.\n\nNevertheless, it’s only a matter of time before AI grows “smart” enough to compete. Our analysts find two companies that are already seeing earnings drop as a result.\n\nChegg (NYSE:CHGG). Louis Navellier and his team note that Chegg is facing some critical problems due to the rise of artificial intelligence. Generative AI platforms are able to help students – and even do work for them – cutting into demand for the homework assistance and online tutoring services that Chegg provides. Earnings are expected to slide 8% this year. 2U (NASDAQ:TWOU). Muslim Farooque warned in January that online education firm 2U was struggling with mounting debt costs and continuous cash burn. Shares have fallen 82% since that article. The rise of AI is now compounding this issue, because chatbots are increasingly able to tutor and help with homework. This month, 2U announced it will do a 1-for-30 reverse stock split, which is a historic sign of more losses to come.\n\nCrowding Out: The Small Become Smaller a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFinally, the rise of AI will favor larger tech companies with access to data and enough computing power to use it. To borrow the same automobile example from earlier, it’s like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) or General Motors (NYSE:GM) using its dominant positions in the 1920s and 1930s to develop more powerful and efficient engines, crowding out smaller players like Brewster, Durant Motors and hundreds of others.\n\nThat puts smaller firms at a disadvantage, as the writers at InvestorPlace.com note this month. AI is already consolidating some fragmented markets, and the trend will only continue as artificial intelligence widens this gap between the “haves” and “have-nots.”\n\nVeritone (NASDAQ:VERI). Muslim Farooque observes that this AI-powered media and advertising company is at the mercy of Amazon. Veritone relies on the tech giant for 30% of its sales, and its data intelligence offerings could be quickly eclipsed if the tech giant horizontally expands into the space. Viktor Zarev goes further and calls Veritone another generic AI service provider with no competitive moat. BigBear.ai Holdings (NYSE:BBAI). Ian Bezek writes how this AI data mining and analytics firm is losing significant contracts at a time when larger rivals are growing. “Stop and think about that for a minute,” he notes in a recent update. “In the midst of the biggest imaginable AI boom possible, BigBear.ai’s revenues plunged 22% over the past 12 months.” The company competes directly against public cloud firms like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which have far greater financial resources. SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN). Tyrik Torres calls SoundHound an overhyped stock to sell before it crashes and burns. He notes that the the company’s product is “not very unique” from what is already on the market, which puts it in direct competition with better-funded firms like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung, which have their own top-tier vocal-recognition software. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Finally, Louis Navellier and his team observe this week that Intel continues to fall behind rivals. “AI and foundry growth revival is far from a near-certainty for INTC,” they say. They see shares falling into the mid-$20s by 2025. Analysts predict the firm will only grow its research and development (R&D) budget in the low single-digits through 2027, right as rivals are upping their R&D spending by 60% or more annually.\n\nThe Internet… but 10X Bigger\n\nThe AI developments I’ve been describing are exactly what happened with the internet in the early 2000s. Poorly run firms without the ability to adapt were the first to get wiped out. Service providers like travel agencies were next. Finally, smaller tech players disappeared as large internet firms took over.\n\nAnd almost all new technologies follow this same arc.\n\nBut major technologies and the investing mania that follow them don’t come around very often… maybe once every generation. In fact, Louis Navellier is predicting that AI will be the last major financial mania that he or anyone over the age of 50 will see in time to capitalize on it.\n\nLouis talks about all that – plus what “financial mania” could lead to the rise of a “New America” that’ll be almost unrecognizable to anyone from our generation – in more detail in his brand-new special event, Prediction 2024.\n\nYou can check out that free event by going here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung owned shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).

        "content": "Most readers would already be aware that Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock increased significantly by 9.5% over the past month. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Amazon.com's  ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:\n\n17% = US$38b ÷ US$217b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.17 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Amazon.com's Earnings Growth And 17% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Amazon.com seems to have a decent ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 20% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This certainly adds some context to Amazon.com's moderate 9.4% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nWe then compared Amazon.com's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 15% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is AMZN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Amazon.com Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nGiven that Amazon.com doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Amazon.com's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Whole Foods CEO on getting employees to support your vision and what to know before entering the corner office",
        "content": "In 2022, John Mackey, Whole Foods' cofounder and CEO of 44 years, was stepping down to be replaced by the grocer’s COO, Jason Buechel.\n\nIt was an exciting moment for Buechel but also a tenuous one. Despite a nine-year C-suite residence at the Austin-based Whole Foods, during which he ascended from CIO to CEO, Buechel was filling the big shoes of a colorful, brash, and enigmatic founder-CEO with many loyalists (and some newfound skeptics) in the organization.\n\nBuechel’s first point of order was to go on a speaking tour across Whole Foods stores, as he says, to assess what employees wanted from a leader five years after Amazon’s $13.7 billion acquisition of the largely organic and natural foods merchant. Those conversations proved fruitful, with workers stating that they wanted more transparency around the company’s strategy following its cofounder’s departure.\n\nThat vision includes creating “delightful” in-store experiences for customers with a wide range of natural and organic merchandise, investing in employee development and improving their culinary expertise, and collaborating with Amazon to make Whole Foods’ digital experience an extension of the physical store.\n\nTo settle on this new plan of action, Buechel enlisted his direct reports. “This was something we co-created together as an executive team and co-created with the rest of our organization,” he said.\n\nBuechel invited his executives and more senior members to some 90 Whole Foods locations. The effort was aimed at connecting executives with rank-and-file employees and helping them ascertain their challenges and understand worker frustrations. For Buechel, it was also an opportunity to earn approval from his direct reports.\n\n“Every single one of our executive team members was part of that process. And so not only did they help create this vision, but they had the responsibility of helping bring it to our stores,” he told Fortune. “It doesn't matter if you're leading operations, or real estate store design and construction, or legal…Your responsibility as a leader in the company is helping support sharing our vision and our strategy with our team members.”\n\nThe approach instilled a sense of shared accountability for the company’s success, said Buechel. “My team would say, 'This is part of our responsibility. We helped co-create it; this isn't Jason's.'”\n\nAlthough Buechel asserts he's ultimately the company's decision-maker, he says mutual respect between frontline employees and executives, as well as a shared mission for nourishing people and doing right by the company’s stakeholders, makes his job easier.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for what launched him to the corner office, Buechel attributes his ascent to CEO to several factors, including an expansive and cross-collaborative approach.\n\n“It was the ability to not just think about one sort of function, but think about the inner workings, the broader system of how things come together, and a passion for wanting to raise the bar, especially in serving customers the very best way possible,” he said. “I'm a systems thinker. By nature, I'm a problem solver, and I'm somebody who [loves] working with people, and I love bringing people together to deliver amazing outcomes.”\n\nRuth Umoh\r\nruth.umoh@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon sidesteps carbon offset standard Bezos helped fund",
        "content": "By Virginia Furness\n\n(Reuters) -Amazon has become the first company to sidestep a global standard for verifying carbon offsets that was developed by a non-profit funded largely by the U.S. technology conglomerate's founder and executive chair, Jeff Bezos.\n\nAmazon is backing the development of a new standard that could allow the online retailer and cloud-computing provider to overcome a dearth of supply for quality-labeled offsets, enabling it to meet its target of cutting its greenhouse-gas emissions to zero on a net basis by 2040. Critics worry that the move could lead to market confusion and a compromise in the standards of carbon offsets.\n\nCompanies under pressure to curb their emissions can buy credits from developers of projects that absorb carbon, such as through reforestation. The market for offsets has remained small due to a limited number of projects that can verify their climate benefits.\n\nAmazon told Reuters it has completed work on Abacus, a framework for verifying the quality of carbon offsets in reforestation and agroforestry. Amazon developed the standard with carbon registry Verra as an alternative to one developed by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM), the world's biggest grouping of private sector and environmental groups dedicated to validating carbon offsets. Verra first announced it was developing the label with Amazon and its Abacus working group in 2022.\n\nBezos, through his $10-billion Earth Fund that he set up to tackle climate change, is one of ICVCM's biggest donors, having plowed at least $11 million into ICVCM and sister organization Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative since their 2021 launch.\n\nJamey Mulligan, Amazon's head of carbon neutralization, said in an interview that the company evaluated and supported ICVCM's work, but that it wanted a more ambitious standard.\n\n\"We want to ensure that every credit investment has a real, conservatively quantified and verified impact on emissions,\" Mulligan said. He declined to comment on whether Bezos was involved in Amazon's decision.\n\nBezos could not be reached for comment.\n\nAlphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Salesforce have said they plan to buy up to 20 million metric tons of Abacus-certified credits.\n\nPedro Martins Barata, co-chair of ICVCM's panel of experts, said he was worried about development of an alternative standard and that he hoped that Abacus would eventually be folded into ICVCM.\n\n\"Otherwise, you get again into a confusing state in the market where each set of companies will find their own standards they want to support and they will say that they're a particular type of quality,\" he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nKelley Kizzier, director of corporate action and markets at Bezos Earth Fund and a member of ICVCM's board, said Abacus is complementary rather than competitive to ICVCM. She also declined to comment on Bezos' role.\n\n\"What we need to focus on is generating high-integrity (offsets). There is room for lots of actors to do that,\" Kizzier said.\n\nThe label will be available within weeks, Verra said.\n\nOFFSET MARKET\n\nThe $2-billion market for voluntary carbon offsets has remained small amid concerns by companies and investors that the underlying projects may not curb as many emissions as they claim.\n\nThe market accounts for offsetting 300 million metric tons of emissions annually, according to an Environmental Defense Fund analysis of data from financial information provider MSCI. Yet only a fraction of those offsets are verified, with ICVCM's main quality label, CCP, accounting for 27 million tons.\n\n\"My main concern with the strategy remains with the idea that the purchase of these credits somehow 'neutralizes' Amazon's impact. I don't think it does,\" said Gilles Dufrasne, policy lead at environmental non-profit Carbon Market Watch.\n\nDeborah Lawrence, chief scientist at credit ratings firm Calyx Global, welcomed the label's requirement to make public data on how much carbon the projects store but said it still had questions about Abacus’ ability to ensure the carbon removals are permanent.\n\n\"Their permanence position requires further investigation,\" she said. \"The way it is phrased is giving us pause, but their annual monitoring and making the results public are great ideas and raise the bar.\"\n\nAmazon generated 71.3 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in 2022, according to its latest sustainability report, of which 54.98 million tons came from its supply chain.\n\nIt will take two to three years for projects to qualify for the Abacus label because many rely on trees growing and then developers proving how much carbon they absorb.\n\nMulligan said Amazon could become one of the biggest carbon-credit buyers, but that it would not use them in place of the company's efforts to decarbonise its business.\n\nHe added that Amazon is currently reviewing more than 70 proposals from developers and expects to restore tens of thousands of hectares of degraded land.\n\nAny developer can apply for the Abacus label provided they meet requirements of Verra's methodology, which the Abacus working group, a team of scientists, non-governmental organizations and industry specialists helped develop.\n\nEron Bloomgarden, founder of Emergent, a not-for-profit organization that mobilises private-sector funding for forest countries, said Abacus would help grow the carbon-offset market.\n\n\"The work of ICVCM is important but it's insufficient for the growth of the market, because what we are trying to do is solve big existential challenges like climate change and biodiversity extinction,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Virginia Furness in LondonEditing by Greg Roumeliotis and Rod Nickel)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Compelling Cloud Stocks to Buy as the AI Boom Rages On",
        "content": "Cloud computing has made it easier and more cost effective for companies to store data online. Businesses no longer have to invest in physical servers and storage space to operate smoothly.\n\nMany tech giant have rolled out cloud platforms over the years, and other companies specialize in keeping those platforms protected. Many cloud computing stocks have delivered exceptional returns over the years, as scalability allows margins to expand rapidly once it becomes profitable.\n\nCloud computing has been hot for several years, but artificial intelligence is adding more fuel to the fire. Artificial intelligence requires significant computing power and data storage capabilities. Cloud platforms help to enable many AI tools and give corporations the opportunity to use this innovative technology.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArtificial intelligence is part of the reason that the cloud computing market is projected to maintain a compounded annual growth rate of 16.40% through 2029. These cloud computing stocks are positioned to benefit immensely from AI tailwinds.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the largest cloud computing provider in the industry. Amazon Web Services has almost one-third of the market. The company is also working on a ChatGPT alternative to expand its reach in the AI market.\n\nThe tech giant’s overall sales increased by 13% year-over-year to reach $143.3 billion in the first quarter. Those sales include Amazon’s online marketplace which has helped the company expand into numerous industries. Amazon Web Services notably grew at a faster rate — 17% year-over-year — to reach $25.0 billion.\n\nAmazon stock has been on a tear. It’s up by 29% year-to-date and has roughly doubled over the past five years. The stock is approaching a $2 trillion market cap and has a 54 P/E ratio. Amazon has several segments that stretch beyond cloud computing. It also offers exposure to groceries, advertising, streaming, gaming and other verticals. Amazon is currently rated as a “Strong Buy” with a projected 18% upside from current levels.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has delivered a 167% gain over the past five years for patient investors. While those returns are quite good, Wall Street analysts believe that the stock can march higher. The cloud computing company is currently rated as a “Strong Buy.” The average price target indicates that the company can gain an additional 15% from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost of the company’s revenue is recurring, which offers a good baseline for rising revenue. ServiceNow exceeded guidance in the first quarter by reporting $2.6 billion in revenue. That’s a 24% year-over-year increase. More than $2.5 billion of the company’s Q1 revenue was recurring.\n\nServiceNow enables digital workflows and helps companies become more efficient. Customers have been flocking to the Now Platform and they’re also paying a lot of money.\n\nThe company closed eight new transactions with annual contract values above $8 million in the first quarter. It has more than 8,100 customers and a 98% renewal rate. Almost 2,000 of the firm’s customers have annual contract values that are greater than $1 million.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the third largest cloud platform and has been growing at a faster pace than Amazon. While AWS reported 17% year-over-year revenue growth, Google Cloud’s revenue increased by 28.4% year-over-year to reach $9.57 billion.\n\nThat’s not the only highlight from Alphabet’s first quarter results. Overall revenue increased by 15% year-over-year while net income surged by 57% year-over-year.\n\nNet income growth is a big highlight, since it prompted the tech conglomerate to offer its first quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. Alphabet reported a 29.4% net profit margin to close out the quarter, and if cost cutting measures continue, the firm can end up with elevated gains in the future.\n\nAlphabet still trades at a reasonable 28 P/E ratio. It’s the online advertising leader and also one of the leaders in cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Wall Street analysts believe that Alphabet shares can gain an additional 9% from current levels.\n\nOracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) offers hardware and software products, but its software segment has been the main growth driver. Cloud services and license support made up 72% of the firm’s revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. This segment increased by 9% year-over-year while Oracle’s other segments reported slight year-over-year declines.\n\nCloud computing is the defining element of Oracle’s investment thesis. Q4 cloud revenue — IaaS and SaaS — increased by 20% year-over-year to reach $5.3 billion. Overall revenue only inched up by 3% year-over-year to reach $14.3 billion.\n\nArtificial intelligence tailwinds should help Oracle’s cloud platform generate a higher percentage of total revenue. This development should result in growth acceleration since the lagging segments won’t have as much of an impact.\n\nOracle shares are up by 36% year-to-date and have gained 138% over the past five years. The stock trades at a 38 P/E ratio and offers a 1.13% yield.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been winning Wall Street analysts for many years. The stock is currently rated as a “Strong Buy” and has a projected 11% upside. Long-term momentum has played a role in bullishness. Shares are up by 21% year-to-date and have gained 226% over the past five years.\n\nThe tech conglomerate offers exposure to many industries: artificial intelligence, advertising, gaming, business software, social media and others. However, none of those segments are as important as Microsoft Cloud.\n\nThe company’s cloud platform generated $35.1 billion in Q3 FY24 revenue, which is a 23% improvement compared to the same quarter last year. Microsoft also reported 17% year-over-year revenue growth across the board and grew its net income by 20% year-over-year.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot allows the company to expand into numerous industries and presents a compelling long-term opportunity. Copilot is slowly being integrated across Microsoft’s software products like LinkedIn and other places.\n\nCopilot also has a cybersecurity division that should increase Microsoft’s presence in that vertical. Artificial intelligence and cloud computing both present long-term growth opportunities for Microsoft.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) makes cloud computing safer with its Falcon Platform. Businesses can detect and address threats before they get serious and fortify their digital defenses.\n\nCloud platforms make it easier to store data and access digital files. While this is a boon for many businesses, putting everything on the web also makes it a target for hackers.\n\nCybercriminals attempt to infiltrate databases and access sensitive information about customers, people within the company and corporate assets\n\nAs such, the cybersecurity firm generates plenty of revenue. Q1 FY25 revenue came in at $921.0 million, which is a 33% year-over-year increase. Crowdstrike’s $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue should support additional growth in the upcoming quarters. Net income came in at $42.8 million compared to a $0.5 million profit in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe stock has comfortably outperformed the market. Crowdstrike shares are up by 55% year-to-date and have gained 470% over the past five years.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) has been reinventing itself for several years. After a lot of hard work, the company now finds itself in the center of cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\n\nUnlike most cloud computing stocks, IBM still has a reasonable valuation. Shares trade at a 19.6 P/E ratio and offer a 3.85% yield. The stock has gained 28% over the past year.\n\nWall Street analysts have rated the stock as a “Moderate Buy” and are projecting a 6% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $215 per share suggests that IBM can gain an additional 24%.\n\nIBM reported 1% year-over-year revenue growth and 69% year-over-year net income growth in the first quarter. Rising profit margins make the stock look more attractive, and the firm is also in the process of acquiring HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP) for $6.4 billion. This acquisition will expand IBM’s hybrid cloud market share and position it to benefit more from AI tailwinds.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AMZN, NOW, GOOG, MSFT and CRWD.

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Screaming Buys for the Second Half of 2024 (and Beyond)",
        "content": "If you've ever wondered why Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett draws in the neighborhood of 40,000 investors to his company's shareholder meeting each year, look no further than his track record. Since taking over the CEO role in the mid-1960s, the \"Oracle of Omaha\" has overseen a nearly 4,964,000% return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), which compares quite favorably to the roughly 36,000% total return, including dividends paid, for the broad-based S&P 500 over the same span.\n\nFor nearly six decades, Buffett and his top-notch investment team have had a knack for picking out time-tested bargains hiding in plain sight. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nAt the moment, Berkshire has stakes in 44 stocks and two exchange-traded funds spanning $388 billion of invested assets. But among these holdings are three Warren Buffett stocks that represent screaming buys for the second half of 2024, and likely well beyond.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe first Warren Buffett stock that stands out for all the right reasons for the second half of 2024 and well beyond is e-commerce leaderAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nThe knock against Amazon has always been its relatively \"expensive\" valuation, at least when using traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. While the time-tested P/E ratio works great when attempting to value mature businesses, this go-to metric tends to come up short when analyzing fast-growing companies that are regularly reinvesting their cash flow back into their operations.\n\nChances are that you're familiar with Amazon because of its superior e-commerce platform. In 2023, Amazon is estimated to have garnered a nearly 38% share of U.S. online retail sales. While this would, in theory, expose the company to weakness if the U.S. or global economy were to fall into a recession, the important thing to recognize about Amazon is that its operating cash flow and income almost exclusively originate from its faster-growing ancillary operations.\n\nFor investors, nothing is more important than Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform, and it recently surpassed $100 billion in annualized run-rate sales. What's noteworthy about this psychological run-rate revenue milestone is that businesses are still in the relatively early stages of ramping up their cloud-service spending. Since cloud-service margins are considerably juicier than the margins associated with online retail sales, AWS is typically responsible for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond AWS, Amazon is also relying on advertising services and subscription services to do some heavy lifting. Amazon draws around 2.5 billion unique visitors to its site each month, which is more than eyeballs enough to attract advertisers.\n\nMeanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has likely added to this total as its content library and e-commerce platform have grown. Like AWS, advertising services and subscription services offer sustained double-digit sales growth.\n\nDespite recently hitting a new all-time high, Amazon is historically cheap relative to cash flow projections. Throughout the 2010s, investors regularly paid 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon. You can buy shares right now for about 13 times estimated cash flow per share in 2025. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nChevron\n\nA second no-brainer Warren Buffett stock that's begging to be bought for the second half of 2024 (and beyond) is global energy giant Chevron(NYSE: CVX).\n\nThe clearest headwind current and prospective Chevron shareholders have to contend with is the prospect of a recession taking shape in the U.S. or abroad. Oil and gas stocks tend to ebb-and-flow with the spot price of crude oil and natural gas. During periods of economic weakness, it's not uncommon for commodity-driven companies to struggle.\n\nThe good news for Chevron is that macro factors are decisively working in its favor. Even with select predictive indicators cautioning of a coming recession -- e.g., the first drop off in U.S. M2 money supply since the Great Depression -- the U.S. economy has remained resilient.\n\nTo add to this point, the unprecedented demand uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic led global energy majors (including Chevron) to scale back their capital expenditures (capex) for a good three years. Even with capex ramping back up, the global supply of crude oil has been constrained. When the supply of an in-demand good is tight, it tends to have a positive effect on the spot price of that good. In simpler terms, it's buoying the price of oil, which in turn is generating more operating cash flow for Chevron's drilling segment.\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest catalysts for the second half of 2024 and into 2025 is Chevron's pending deal to acquire Hess in an all-share transaction valued at $53 billion. If this buyout gets the green light from regulators, Chevron is going to add 465,000 net acres in the oil-rich Bakken Shale, as well as meaningfully increase its oil-equivalent exposure in Guyana. If the price of oil remains elevated, it makes this deal all the sweeter.\n\nAlthough drilling is where Chevron derives its best margins, don't overlook that it's also an integrated operator. The company's transmission pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants act as a hedge in the event that the spot price of crude oil declines. The steady operating cash flow from these ancillary operating segments has played a key role in Chevron being able to increase its base annual dividend for 37 consecutive years.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that Chevron's stock is, also, historically inexpensive. Shares can be grabbed right now for less than 11 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 23% discount to its average forward-year multiple over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nThe third Warren Buffett stock that's a screaming buy for the second half of 2024, and likely well beyond, is beverage behemoth Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO).\n\nWhereas an economic downturn is arguably the biggest enemy for Amazon and Chevron, the prospect of above-average inflation is typically viewed as the most front-and-center headwind for consumer staples companies. When the price of goods and services is rising at an above-average rate, there's always a concern that consumers may be forced to pare back their spending.\n\nThe good news for Coca-Cola is that it provides a basic necessity product. Regardless of what's happening with the U.S. economy or Wall Street, consumers are still going to purchase beverages. Given the company's strong branding, Coca-Cola rarely has any trouble increasing its prices to offset rising expenses.\n\nSpeaking of strong branding, Coca-Cola was named the \"most-chosen brand\" by consumers for a 12th straight year in Kantar's latest \"Brand Footprint\" report. This dominance is a reflection of Coca-Cola's top-tier marketing campaign, which involves using digital channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to reach younger audiences, while leaning on more than a century of history and well-known brand ambassadors to connect with its mature consumers.\n\nFrom an operating perspective, Coca-Cola is firing on all cylinders. Although it's not the growth story it once was, it has the right puzzle pieces in place to deliver consistent mid-single-digit sales and earnings growth. It has more than two dozen brands generating at least $1 billion in annual sales, and is operating in all but three countries (Cuba, North Korea, and Russia). This gives Coca-Cola a steady stream of predictable cash flow in developed countries, and needle-moving organic growth potential in emerging markets.\n\nCoca-Cola is also known for its top-tier capital-return program. In February, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 5.4%, which marked the 62nd consecutive year it's lifted its payout. Berkshire Hathaway is generating a roughly 60% annual yield relative to its cost basis in Coca-Cola stock.\n\nLastly -- and to stay on theme -- the valuation makes sense. Coca-Cola's forward P/E ratio of 21 is roughly 10% below its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

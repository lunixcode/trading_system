        "title": "Meta's Reality Labs posts $4.5 billion loss in second quarter as former employees question its future",
        "content": "Meta (META)’s Reality Labs is still bleeding cash.\n\nThe division, which focuses on the company’s AR, VR, and metaverse initiatives, reported a loss of $4.48B in its Q2 earnings on Wednesday. Reality Labs revenue accounted for less than 1% of Meta’s total revenue.\n\nThe numbers come after Yahoo Finance reported last week that the multi-billion dollar losses at Reality Labs are the result of a lack of a clear vision, frequent restructuring, and leaders who don’t have AR and VR expertise.\n\nWe interviewed more than a dozen former Reality Labs employees who have been granted anonymity due to non-disclosure agreements and fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities. Since that report, more insiders have reached out to Yahoo Finance, confirming the details in the story and offering additional insight.\n\n“A few years ago I would have predicted that holographic AR would be possible before smart AI but now it looks like those technologies will actually be ready in the opposite order,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “We’re well positioned for that because of the Reality Labs investments we’ve already made.”\n\nLosses in the metaverse division have exploded in the last four years, even as Zuckerberg shifts his focus to AI. In 2020 Reality Labs lost over $6 billion. The unit sunk $10 billion in 2021, $13 billion in 2022 and $16 billion in 2023.\n\nIn June, Reality Labs laid off roughly 100 employees, according to two people familiar with the matter. The cuts included several vice presidents, managers, as well as dozens of employees in the research division and technology engineering teams. Insiders tell Yahoo Finance that several “big bets projects” were also canceled.\n\n“A software company is trying to get into hardware and doesn't know how to manage it,” said a former manager in engineering. “They’re getting ahead of themselves with product launches and work teams when they don't even know what the technology is yet.”\n\nMeta’s current hardware products on the market include its Quest 3 and Quest Pro headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses. In April it announced it would offer its operating system, Horizon, to external hardware companies.\n\nThe company has recently been teasing that its prototype augmented reality glasses is nearly ready to unveil. Referred to internally as \"Orion,\" Meta has thrown tens of billions of dollars at the nine-year-old project.\n\nHowever, some former employees who worked on the glasses question whether the company will ever release it to the public.\n\n“I would expect pretty substantial losses per device on the glasses,” a former engineer said. “Probably closer to the $1,000 per unit range, but it depends on what they end up trying selling them for and what features they end up including. They don’t even know if they’ll ever make them to sell.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2021, the metaverse became a buzzword following Zuckerberg’s announcement that his social media company, Facebook, would be renamed to Meta. Zuckerberg enthusiastically claimed that humanity would one day in the near future socialize, work, and play in a shared virtual world.\n\nHowever, recent data suggests the metaverse revolution may be dwindling. Research from consumer analytics firm, CivicScience, found that adoption and intent to purchase AR and VR headsets has plateaued this year.\n\nAccording to market intelligence firm, IDC Global, shipments of AR and VR headsets dropped some 67% year-over-year in Q1 2024. Meta’s market share has plummeted as others like Apple (AAPL) entered the scene, falling from 62% in Q4 2023 to 37% in Q1 2024.\n\n“With AR and VR, Meta came up with a solution when there never really was a problem,” said a former Reality Labs employee. “It’s not worth the amount of investment they’re putting into it. If they’re smart they’ll scale back to 10% the size of the operation they are now. Someone else can come up with the hardware and use Meta’s Horizon OS. That will make Zuck happier - being part of the Metaverse.”\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X @YasminKhorram and on LinkedIn.

        "title": "Asian stocks: Japan tumbles as BOJ vows more rate hikes, China rebound stalls",
        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks were muted on Thursday as Japanese shares plummeted after the Bank of Japan flagged more interest rate hikes, while a rebound in Chinese markets stalled on more underwhelming business activity data.\n\nRegional markets took little support from an overnight rally on Wall Street, where signals on a September interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve and some strong technology earnings powered sharp gains on Wall Street.\n\nUS stock index futures rose in Asian trade, with focus turning to earnings from tech giants Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) later in the day.\n\nNikkei 225, TOPIX plummet as BOJ flags more rate hikes\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 and TOPIX indexes slid 3.1% and 3.8%, respectively, after the BOJ struck an unexpectedly hawkish tone during its Wednesday meeting.\n\nGovernor Kazuo Ueda said the bank will continue to raise interest rates after a 15 basis point hike on Wednesday, especially if the economy and inflation continue to improve in line with the BOJ’s outlook.\n\nJapanese stocks had initially reacted positively to the BOJ meeting, given that the bank struck a somewhat dovish tone by setting a prolonged timeline for reducing its bond buying program.\n\nBut Ueda’s comments, which came after the market close, indicated that the central bank was closer to ending its decades of stimulative measures earlier than initially expected.\n\n“If the economy and prices move in line with our projection, we will continue to raise interest rates,” Ueda said at a press conference. “We don't see 0.5% as any key barrier when raising rates.”\n\nThe BOJ’s benchmark short-term rate stood around 0.25% after Wednesday’s hike.\n\nChina rebound stalls on more negative PMI data\n\nChina’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes moved in a flat-to-low range after rebounding from more-than five-month lows in the prior session. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 0.2%.\n\nCaixin purchasing managers index data on Thursday showed an unexpected contraction in China’s manufacturing sector. The reading came just a day after government PMI data showed a similar trend.\n\nThe Caixin PMI was a major pain point, given that it had so far in 2024 painted a more positive picture of China’s manufacturing sector. But Thursday’s reading brought up concerns over a broader slowdown in the sector.\n\nWhile the weak PMIs and positive comments from Beijing had fueled bets on more stimulus- in part sparking Wednesday’s rebound in Chinese markets- persistent caution over an economic slowdown kept investors mostly averse towards Chinese stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroader Asian markets were marginally positive, tracking overnight strength on Wall Street.\n\nAustralia’s ASX 200 rose 0.4%, briefly hitting a record high at 8,148.70 points after some soft inflation readings from the country triggered a rally on Wednesday.\n\nSouth Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.4%, with local chipmaking stocks tracking gains in their U.S. peers. Taipei shares of TSMC (TW:2330) rose nearly 2%.\n\nFutures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a flat open, as the index struggled to make new highs above 25,000 points.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks: Japan tumbles as BOJ vows more rate hikes, China rebound stalls\n\nBillionaire Ackman pulls IPO of Pershing Square USA days before debut\n\nKeppel profit inches higher, with transformation into global manager 'bearing fruit'\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Catalysts are forming around a lot of the top stocks right now, making this a good time for investors to buy.

Despite the market rotation that’s going on, a lot of companies are seeing momentum build in their share price.\n\nFor investors, the current situation presents an opportunity to take positions in great stocks, some of which are just now starting to come off 52-week lows.

PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the last 5 days, shares of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) are up 13%. This growth has been driven by the announcement of second-quarter financial results that crushed Wall Street’s targets. PayPal reported EPS of $1.19, which beat Wall Street’s forecast of 99 cents. Revenue of $7.90 billion topped the $7.80 billion that was estimated. Additionally, PayPal said that its total payment volumes rose 11% to $416.80 billion, while transaction dollars increased 8% to $3.60 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe strong financial results come after PayPal introduced several payment innovations earlier this year to attract more users and boost its financial performance. Innovations have included a faster checkout experience and A.I. generated recommendations from merchants to keep users engaged and returning to the platform. In terms of guidance, PayPal said that for the current third quarter, it expects mid-single-digit revenue growth and high-single-digit earnings growth.\n\nBefore the Q2 print, PayPal’s stock had declined 22% over the last 12 months. Now, things look to be turning around for the company and its shareholders.\n\nWalt Disney Co. (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nA look now at the summer box office, where Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) is the reigning champ. Disney’s new movie “Deadpool & Wolverine” earned a record amount of money at the box office during its debut weekend, taking in nearly $450 million in worldwide ticket sales. The film had the highest grossing debut ever for an R-rated movie. The strong box office performance is good news for Disney and its movie production and streaming units.\n\nDisney has struggled since the pandemic with declining movie theater attendance and subpar box office performances of its films. However, Disney has now scored two major hits this summer with “Deadpool & Wolverine” and the animated movie “Inside Out 2,” which has earned more than $1.5 billion at the global box office and become the highest grossing animated movie ever. Disney also just announced a new slate of “Avengers” films that has the internet buzzing.\n\nStory continues\n\nDIS stock has been languishing and is only up 3.5% this year. Now might be a good time to buy-the-dip. With the company’s box office receipts piling up, DIS now ranks among the top stocks to buy.\n\nBritish Petroleum (BP) BP stock: the BP company logo on a building\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com\n\nOil major British Petroleum (NYSE:BP) has just increased its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by 10% as it reported a better-than-expected profit for this year’s second quarter. Going forward, BP will pay a quarterly distribution of 8 cents per share, up from 7.27 cents previously. The dividend increase lifts the yield on BP stock above 5%. The company also said that it plans to maintain its current rate of share buybacks at $1.75 billion during the current third quarter.\n\nThe dividend hike and stock buybacks were announced by BP along with decent Q2 financial results. The company announced a profit of $2.8 billion, which beat Wall Street expectations of $2.6 billion. The latest profit was ahead of the $2.7 billion that BP earned in the first three months of the year, and better than the $2.6 billion recorded a year ago. The profit got a boost from cost-cutting measures. In recent months, BP imposed a hiring freeze and halted renewable energy projects as part of efforts to improve performance.\n\nBP stock also looks like one of the top stocks to buy on the dip. BP is flat on the year and trading at just 10 times future earnings estimates.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nU.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) also just blew the doors off their hinges with its Q2 financial results. The company reported EPS of 60 cents, which was much better than the 46 cents forecast on Wall Street. Revenue of $13.28 billion surpassed the $12.96 billion that was expected among analysts. Sales were up 2%. While modest, it was the first time that sales had increased at Pfizer since the end of 2022 when the company’s Covid-19 revenue crested.\n\nThe strong Q2 results were attributed to cost-cutting measures, improved sales of the Covid-19 antiviral pill called “Paxlovid,” and strong non-Covid medication sales. The results represent a turnaround for Pfizer, which has struggled with a decline in demand for its Covid-19 products. As sales of its Covid-19 products have fallen, Pfizer has undertaken a cost-cutting drive that aims to deliver $4 billion in savings by the end of 2024.\n\nLooking ahead, Pfizer expects earnings of $2.45 to $2.65 per share for all of this year, up from its previous guidance of $2.15 to $2.35 a share. The company also raised its revenue outlook to a range of $59.50 billion to $62.50 billion. That’s up from a previous revenue forecast of $58.50 billion to $61.50 billion. The company said the raised guidance reflects its strong performance. PFE stock is up 3% on the year and pays a quarterly dividend that yields 5.50%.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nConsumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has previewed its new suite of artificial intelligence features for its upcoming iPhone and analysts continue to be impressed. The new features include an enhanced Siri digital assistant and the ability to automatically generate both emails and images on the smartphone. There’s also improved photo searches and the ability to create and edit short movies.\n\nAnalysts continue to expect that the addition of AI will lead to a monster upgrade cycle for the iPhone, especially since the AI system will only work on the iPhone 15 and newer. Within the next year, Apple plans to add more AI features to the iPhone, including Emoji generation, automated photo clean-up, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology. It could all lead to big future iPhone sales. AAPL stock is up nearly 20% this year.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building. NVO stock\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nPharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) has had a run of very good news lately concerning its medications. The E.U. has just approved the company’s Wegovy weight loss drug to treat heart conditions in adults. The move opens an entirely new market for Wegovy and comes after clinical trials showed the medication reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 20% and the risk of cardiovascular death by 15%.\n\nThe expansion of Wegovy’s use across Europe came days after medical regulators in the U.K. also approved Wegovy to treat heart conditions and strokes. In June, Wegovy was approved as a weight loss treatment in China, opening a huge new market for the medication in that nation of 1.4 billion people. If all that weren’t enough, a new study has found that another Novo Nordisk drug may slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease in people by protecting their brains.\n\nNVO stock is one of the top stocks to buy. It has risen over 60% in the last 12 months and continues to have momentum.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nAnother quarter and another earnings beat from Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK). The shoemaker behind popular brands such as Hoka and Uggs delivered Q2 financial results that trounced Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines. The company reported EPS of $4.52 per share, which surpassed consensus expectations of $3.46. The profit was up 87% from a year ago.\n\nRevenue totaled $825 million, which topped Wall Street’s estimate of $805 million. Sales rose 22% year-over-year. The company, which also makes Teva sandals, reported that its gross margin during the quarter rose to 56.9% from 51.3%. The latest financial results come shortly after Deckers Outdoor announced a six-for-one stock split that will take place on Sept. 9 of this year. The company also has a new CEO in Stefano Caroti, a long-time executive at Deckers Outdoor who has vowed to continue the strong growth.\n\nDECK stock has risen nearly 70% in the last 12 months and continues to be a runaway growth story and one of the top stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in DECK.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled that an interest rate cut was close, while a slew of strong earnings from the technology sector also boosted stocks.\n\nGains in futures came following a strong session on Wall Street, after the Fed’s comments and some positive earnings sparked heavy buying into technology stocks. Wall Street also rebounded from a bulk of losses logged over the past week.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.6% to 5,588.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.9% to 19,678.50 points by 19:35 ET (23:35 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 41,141.0 points.\n\nFed says rate cuts are close, flags inflation progress\n\nThe Fed kept interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday, as widely expected.\n\nBut Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged progress in bringing down inflation and cooling the labor market- both factors which set the stage for a potential rate cut in September. Powell explicitly mentioned the possibility of a cut in September, although he noted that it was still contingent on positive data.\n\nThe Fed will have some inflation and labor market readings to consider before its September meeting. Markets are almost entirely pricing in a 25 basis point cut in September, according to CME Fedwatch.\n\nFocus is now on upcoming nonfarm payrolls data, due on Friday, for more cues on the labor market. The prospect of lower rates presents more liquidity for stock markets, which bodes well for valuations.\n\nTech rallies with Meta up front; Apple awaited\n\nTechnology stocks surged in aftermarket trade following positive earnings from Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). The stock rose nearly 7% after clocking stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings and also presenting a robust outlook.\n\nTech was also the biggest boost to Wall Street during the session, with major chipmakers rallying on the heels of strong earnings from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM). The two steadied in aftermarket trade after strong gains during the session.\n\nThe positive earnings helped investors largely look past middling results from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which missed estimates. Chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) also clocked weak earnings, sending its stock down 11% in aftermarket trade.\n\nTech earnings are set to continue with majors Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) set to report on Thursday.\n\nStrength in tech sparked strong gains in Wall Street on Wednesday. The S&P 500 surged 1.5% to 5,522.30 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rallied 2.6% to 17,598.79 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged on its limited tech exposure, rising only 0.2% to 17,598.79 points.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut tech stocks were still nursing steep losses over the past three weeks, as they were hit by a mix of profit-taking and as expectations of interest rate cuts sparked a pivot into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures surge on rate cut bets, strong tech earnings\n\nSingapore's Keppel HY profit rises on upbeat infra, connectivity performance\n\nArm stock dives 11% as slow AI gains lead to tepid outlook\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple AAPL and Amazon.com AMZN, two prominent members of the Magnificent 7, are set to report their respective quarterly results on Aug 1.\r\n\r\nInvestors are eagerly awaiting results from these two industry stalwarts to get a glimpse of the growing impact of AI, including Generative AI (GenAI), on top-line as well as bottom-line growth.\r\n\r\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group that also includes Tesla, Meta Platforms and NVIDIA. \r\n\r\nThe Magnificent 7 has been benefiting from the massive proliferation of AI. Demand for AI is escalating, and that has increased the need for data center capacity expansion. The advent of GenAI has further attracted investments.\r\n\r\nGartner estimates spending on AI software to witness a CAGR of 19.1% between 2022 and 2027 to hit $297 billion in 2027. GenAI software spending is expected to surge from 8% in 2023 to 35% by 2027. IDC expects worldwide revenues for AI platforms software to witness a CAGR of 40.6% over the 2023-2028 timeframe. These projections reflect strong growth opportunities for the Magnificent 7.\r\n\r\nLet’s delve deep to find out what Apple and Amazon are expected to report this earnings season.\n\nApple and Amazon: Impressive Earnings Surprise History\n\nAAPL’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 4.14%, on average. Meanwhile, Amazon’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 48.17%.\r\n\r\nApple expects third-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to grow low single digits year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $84.02 billion, indicating growth of 2.71% year over year. \r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for AAPL’s fiscal third-quarter earnings is currently pegged at $1.34 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 6.35% increase from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nAmazon expects second-quarter 2024 net sales between $144 billion and $149 billion, indicating 7-11% growth on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMZN’s net sales is pegged at $148.63 billion, indicating growth of 10.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for AMZN’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.03 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days, which indicates a jump of 63.49% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Amazon.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nAAPL Underperforms AMZN Stock YTD\n\nYear to date, Apple shares have gained 15.4% year to date, outperforming only Microsoft and Tesla. Amazon has returned 21.7% over the same timeframe, outperforming AAPL but lagging NVDA, META and GOOGL.\n\nYTD Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMoreover, AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Style Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment. In comparison, Amazon has a Value Style Score of B suggesting the shares are undervalued currently.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, Apple is trading at 8.14X, higher than its median of 7.17X, the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s 6.18X and Amazon’s 2.78X.\n\nPrice/Sales Ratio (F12M) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple’s Fiscal Q3 to Suffer From Weak China Sales\n\nApple’s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 50.6% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein sales decreased 10.5% year over year to $46 billion. \r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is expected to have struggled in China amid significant competition from domestic handset makers. Per IDC, China’s smartphone shipments grew 8.9% year over year to 71.6 million units in the second quarter of calendar 2024, driven by robust performance from Vivo, Huawei and Xiaomi. Apple is expected to have witnessed a 3.1% year-over-year decline.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. (Read More: Should Apple Stock be in Your Portfolio Pre-Q3 Earnings?)\n\nAmazon’s Q2 Earnings to Ride on Prime Momentum\n\nAmazon is benefiting from solid Prime momentum, owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive.\r\n\r\nThe strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings are tailwinds. The robust advertising business is also contributing well. Its strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain a plus. (Read More: Is Amazon Stock Worth Buying Ahead of Q2 Earnings?)\n\nConclusion\n\nApple and Amazon are both expected to benefit from the strong proliferation of AI in the long haul.\r\n\r\nHowever, ahead of the earnings release, we believe Amazon stock is a better buy, given its current undervaluation, which presents an opportunity for investors to jump in the stock. \r\n\r\nAmazon has a Growth Style Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2, a favorable combination that offers a strong investment opportunity, per the Zacks Proprietary methodology.

        "title": "Apple ETFs to Buy Ahead of its Fiscal Q3 Earnings",
        "content": "All eyes are on technology giant Apple AAPL, which is set to release third-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on Aug 1. Since Apple accounts for nearly 7% of the total market capitalization of the entire technology sector on the S&P 500 Index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of its quarterly results. \r\n\r\nApple reclaimed the most valuable title last month and emerged as one of the strongest performers relative to the other “Mag 7” amid the recent sell-off. The stock has gained about 28.5% over the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 8.4%. The solid trend is expected to continue, given that the tech giant has a strong chance of beating earnings estimates. It has seen positive earnings estimate revision activity, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat (see: all the Technology ETFs here).  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis has put investors’ focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan. Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, iShares US Technology ETF IYW, iShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF IWY and Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation. These ETFs have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nInside Our Methodology\n\nApple has an Earnings ESP of +0.30% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. \r\n\r\nApple saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the fiscal third quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates modest year-over-year growth of 6.3% for earnings and 3.2% for revenues. The company has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 4.14% in the trailing four quarters (read: Tech ETFs Faceoff: Apple Vs. Microsoft). \r\n\r\nThe stock currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.62 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 30 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.68 a month ago based on 30 recommendations. Of the 30 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 66.67% and 10% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 63.33%, while Buy represented 10%.\r\n\r\nBased on the short-term price targets of 32 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $232.22. The forecasts range from a low of $180.00 to a high of $300.00.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nApple, which was way behind its competitors in adopting AI, is finally turning around following the launch of a brand-new AI feature called Apple Intelligence for iPhones, iPads and Macs in June. The introduction of numerous AI-powered features is expected to kickstart the next upgrade cycle, enhancing the company's performance and restoring investor confidence in Apple (read: Apple Jumps on the AI Bandwagon: ETFs to Buy).\r\n\r\nThe technology will help summarize text, create original images and retrieve the most relevant data when users need it. Apple also announced a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which provides customers access to ChatGPT via Siri at no extra cost. The company released a beta version of its new iOS 18.1 to developers early this week, offering the first look of Apple Intelligence and some of the iPhone maker's new artificial intelligence features.\r\n\r\nAccording to LSEG data, the tech titan is expected to win back some customers in China with big iPhone discounts and by selling more high-margin iPads with a refreshed design. iPhone sales are expected to decrease 2.2% in the to-be-reported quarter, a big improvement from the 10.5% decline in the second quarter. This suggests that the worst might be over for Apple.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal third quarter, the iPhone maker expects overall revenues \"to grow low-single digits\" and iPad revenues to grow in double digits.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nVanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) - Apple accounts for a 16.1% share.\r\n\r\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF (FTEC) - Apple accounts for a 16% share in the basket. \r\n\r\niShares US Technology ETF (IYW) - Apple makes up 16.1% of the assets.\r\n\r\niShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF (IWY) - Apple accounts for a 13.8% share in the basket.\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK) - Apple accounts for 12.4% of the total assets\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Apple likely to post higher revenue as discounts aid iPhone demand in China",
        "content": "By Aditya Soni\n\n(Reuters) - Apple will likely report on Thursday that it returned to revenue growth in its fiscal third quarter as it won back some customers in China with big iPhone discounts and sold more high-margin iPads thanks to a refreshed design.\n\nSales of the iPhone, which account for nearly half of Apple's revenue, are expected to have decreased by 2.2% in the three months ended June, a big improvement from the 10.5% decline in the second quarter, according to LSEG data.\n\nAnalysts said the worst may be over for the iPhone.\n\nThey expect a strong upgrade cycle for the iPhone 16 series likely to come in September after Apple said in June it was gearing up to introduce AI features across its devices.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnder pressure from a resurgent Huawei in China, Apple had in May offered discounts of up to 2,300 yuan ($317) on select iPhone models. This helped narrow iPhone sales declines in the country to 3.1% in the April-June quarter, according to IDC, from a decline of 6.6% in the first three months of the year.\n\n\"The company's fate is turning around in the region,\" said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino, adding that Apple's AI plans should appeal to customers in the feature-sensitive market.\n\nAfter lagging rivals Microsoft and Alphabet's Google in the AI race for months, Cupertino, California-based Apple unveiled plans to bring OpenAI's ChatGPT to its devices and burnish its suite of apps including Siri with new \"Apple Intelligence\" technology.\n\nThe commentary helped Apple regain the crown of the world's most valuable company it had lost for a few days to Microsoft. Apple's shares have risen nearly 30% in the past three months, though a recent market selloff led by megacaps led to the stock slipping more than 7% from its July 15 record.\n\n\"Apple's AI strategy announcements were very well received globally and helped improve the declining consumer perception of the brand and generate excitement,\" said Nabila Popal, research director with IDC's Worldwide Tracker team.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I won't be surprised if there was a spike in iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models in the April-June quarter - that are Apple Intelligence ready,\" Popal added.\n\nOverall, Apple's revenue is expected to have risen 3.3% in the third quarter from a year earlier, after a decline of 4.3% in the second quarter.\n\nIPad sales likely jumped 14.1%, the fastest growth since the holiday quarter of 2022, after Apple launched a new AI-focused iPad Pro and a larger iPad Air in May to revive demand for a product line that had languished for the past two years.\n\nMac sales are expected to have ticked up 2.6%, while its wearables and accessories business likely continued its slump with a decline of 6%.\n\nThe company's services business - including App Store and subscription services such as Apple TV and Music - likely grew 13.2%.\n\nGrowth in the segment has outperformed the company's mainstay hardware business in recent years and the services unit now accounts for more than a quarter of Apple's revenue. However, the outlook for the division has been muddied by regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThe European Union's antitrust regulator has accused Apple App Store of breaching the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires Big Tech to ensure a level playing field for rivals and give users more choice. The company is also facing three investigations under the DMA.\n\n\"Apple's services business has been a key part of the bull thesis on the stock. Its growth is particularly important given the very high marginal contribution of the business,\" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said.\n\n($1 = 7.2513 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Shounak Dasgupta)",

        "content": "Investors have always looked at growth stocks to make relatively safe and steady returns. This is because these companies, while well-established, seem to be undervalued, providing a great entry price for investors. Over time, as the overall valuation grows, so does the value of the initial investment. Growth stocks like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have given many of their initial investors more than a thousand times their initial investment.\n\nWhile I can’t promise this for any of the companies on this list, I will say that these companies have a great outlook. This, combined with analysts agreeing that they’re going to grow heavily in the upcoming months, makes these safe bets that investors can trust. Strong fundamentals, when combined with the financials these companies have, set them apart and will make them cornerstones of your portfolio if you play your cards right.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) The Duolingo (DUOL) logo on a smartphone screen with a map in the background.\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock.com\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is an internationally available language learning platform. It is one of the leading providers in this sector, with competitors such as Babble showing up fairly recently. The majority of well-known competitors are privately held. Duolingo’s stock has fallen around 13% in the last month, but analysts predict a possible upside of over 46%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDUOL has some pretty impressive financials and growth. While profit remains a concern, with a margin of just 7.82%, year-over-year quarterly revenue growth was 44.9%, smashing analyst predictions. It also has a debt-to-equity ratio of around 7.97%, which is great for a company with such low profit margins, as DUOL can cover all its debt with its current cash.\n\nAnalysts regularly revise DUOL’s EPS estimates higher, which is incredibly bullish for a company that operates at the scale Duolingo does. The platform also only had a monthly active user base of ~90 million as of Q1 2024, which represents great growth potential going forward. The company is also expanding into the music business, with guitar lessons, among other things. This development allows it to expand through another vertical, which is once again a bullish sign.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (V) are among the world’s leading transaction processing companies. It has a widespread international network that facilitates purchases for both consumers and corporations. According to multiple analysts, the company is trading at $441.30 right now, with an implied upside of 17% over the next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a payment processing company, MA’s cash flow is amazing — operating cash flow was $11.73 billion in the most recent quarter. Revenue growth is solid, at 10.4%, with earnings rising over 27% in the same period, all with a profit margin of a whopping 46.09%. Additionally, over 85% of outstanding shares are held by insiders and institutions, with a short ratio of only 0.47%, which represents an incredibly bullish stance.\n\nMA is starting to expand its digital services footprint. As per an Accesswire article, it is establishing strong digital partnerships to build financial resilience. This shows forward thinking by management, especially as inflationary pressures, while ceasing, are still causing consumers to be more mindful of their spending in the US, which has the potential to hamper MA’s earnings.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a company that provides businesses around the world with Customer Relationship management services. These include data management and client acquisition, among other things. As of the market close on 7/29, CRM was trading at $258.59, with an implied upside of over 14%, according to multiple Yahoo Finance! analysts.\n\nAnalysts have repeatedly raised EPS predictions for the next quarter, which only increases my confidence in this company. It has seen solid revenue growth of 10.7% and impressive earnings growth of 670.4%. This indicates that management has pushed the company towards increasing profitability, which is almost always a great sign for investors.\n\nAdditionally, recently, Workday (WDAY) collaborated with CRM to bring out a new product that uses AI to make workspace tasks more efficient and provides even stronger data analytics tools. This enhances the use case for both of these companies, thereby providing value to both. This, along with many other reasons, is why CRM is a great growth stock to invest in.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Rodrigues held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nTech stocks led the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lower Tuesday as the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) closed at the lowest level since early June.\n\nIt was the fourth day the tech-heavy index lost 1.5% or more in the month of July, especially notable as there had not been any losses of that magnitude in the two prior months.\n\nAhead of June's Consumer Price Index reading on July 11, the Nasdaq 100 had been up 23% year to date. But after the CPI registered its first monthly drop in inflation since 2020, investors kicked off a stomach-churning rotation from large stocks into small.\n\nSince then, the Nasdaq has surrendered half those gains, sending many investors into relative shock upon learning that the laggard Russell 2000 index (^RUT) has nearly caught up to the volatile index known as home to the largest tech players.\n\n\"[I] didn’t have [the] Russell 2000 catching the Nasdaq 100 year-to-date on my bingo card to start this month. Getting close,\" wrote Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets and former NYSE floor governor.\n\nThe Russell 2000 is now sporting a better return this year than the artificial intelligence-fueled S&P Select Tech SPDR Fund (XLK) — and it's only a few points away from catching the S&P 500.\n\nIn the month of June alone, the Nasdaq outperformed the Russell 2000 by over 7 percentage points. Then, in July, the relationship violently inverted such that the Russell outperformed the Nasdaq by nearly 14 percentage points. It's the biggest month-to-month flip in leadership that we have data for, going back to 1988.\n\nThe narrative in the press followed the rotation as grave concerns over market concentration in the Magnificent Seven gave way to a small-cap miracle rally.\n\nTo be clear, sector rotation is a healthy feature of bull markets. When a leading group of stocks takes a back seat, other pockets of the market should take their place such that — at the index level — volatility is subdued. Extremes on either side average out.\n\nBut, given the speed and strength of the recent move, Wall Street is now assessing the damage to institutional portfolios.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley's derivatives team, \"volatility of the last two weeks started out being very rotational.\"\n\nHowever, as the move gained steam, institutions began reining in leverage (borrowed money) and reducing directional bets on stocks. \"What began as a de-grossing event has quickly turned more towards a shift in directional exposure to equities,\" the team continued.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of this, and there's still a Fed meeting later today and a Meta quarterly report to close July.

        "content": "The exclusion of the much-anticipated Apple Intelligence suite from China's market could weigh on iPhone sales in the country, analysts said, especially after the US tech giant dropped out of the mainland's top-five smartphone brand list in the second quarter.\n\nFollowing the debut of Apple Intelligence's beta version on its newly released iOS 18.1, Chinese users expressed disappointment that the highly anticipated suite of artificial intelligence (AI) features is not yet available in their market. The beta version is limited to American users as it requires them to set the language of the device and voice assistant Siri to US English, and the device region to the US, which excludes China and the EU.\n\nNetizens on Chinese social media platform Weibo are taking a wait-and-see approach, with many searching for ways to bypass Apple's restrictions. One Chinese user on X, formerly Twitter, wrote on Tuesday that it won't be necessary to have the \"fear of missing out\" as everyone \"inside the Great Firewall ... is subject to this kind of experience downgrade\".\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday about its plans to launch Apple Intelligence in China.\n\nUncertainties are looming around how and when Apple can bring its AI features to China, as the California-based tech giant will need to tackle major challenges including Beijing's stringent regulations on large language models (LLMs) and data handling in the country.\n\nFulfilling its AI promises has become more pressing as Apple is losing ground in the world's biggest smartphone market. In the second quarter, Apple fell out of the top 5 rankings of smartphone vendors in China, according to data by Canalys, marking the first time in years that the iPhone maker has been out of the top 5 in one of its most important markets.\n\n\"Apple is facing a bottleneck in mainland China,\" Canalys analyst Lucas Zhong wrote in a report last week. \"The localisation of Apple's Intelligence services in mainland China will be crucial in the next 12 months.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nApple adopts a hybrid approach in its AI strategy, with a focus on privacy, promising to handle most of the AI computing on the device, and use its Private Cloud Compute system to handle more complex AI problems.\n\n\"For the on-device LLM developed in-house, compliance is the main challenge, with localisation being a secondary concern,\" said Zhong. \"While the issue of localisation can be resolved through model tuning, the compliance process will take time.\"\n\nIn China, the race to integrate generative AI features into smartphones has already escalated as major Chinese vendors, from Beijing-based Xiaomi to Guangdong-based Vivo, Oppo and Huawei Technologies, have been integrating a variety of AI-powered functions to their devices to help users write text messages, edit photos, answer calls and take notes.\n\nWhile Apple has partnered with Microsoft-backed OpenAI in integrating generative AI in Siri and other tools in its devices outside China, the company has yet to announce a local partner in the Chinese market where ChatGPT is not available.\n\n\"The potential roll-out of Apple Intelligence in China depends on its negotiations with the Chinese government,\" said Arthur Guo, a senior analyst with IDC China. \"We believe that the key difference between the China roll-out and the global version would be in its cloud-based intelligence.\"\n\nApple's South Korean rival Samsung Electronics, which formed a partnership with Google worldwide, also struck a deal with Baidu to provide AI capabilities for its Galaxy S24 phones in China. The Beijing-based internet search giant is also said to be in talks with Apple about a similar partnership.\n\nA sign for 'Galaxy AI' artificial intelligence seen at the Samsung Electronics Unpacked launch in Paris, France, on July 10, 2024.

Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nApple is no stranger to the need for a unique iPhone ecosystem to comply with the heavily regulated Chinese market. For example, it has ceded legal ownership of its customers' data to Guizhou-Cloud Big Data, a company owned by the provincial government. Censorship rules in China also block user access to some of the world's biggest apps and services including Instagram, Google search and X in the local app store.\n\nCanalys' Zhong expects relatively low regulatory resistance for Apple Intelligence in China due to the company's emphasis on compliance during the model training process and its relatively transparent privacy policy.\n\n\"We can expect the launch of Apple Intelligence in China to boost the demand for iPhone upgrades, but the key challenge for Apple is to revitalise Chinese consumers' interest with innovative updates in the features,\" Zhong said.\n\nShenzhen resident Thomas Chen said he would stick with iPhones even without Apple Intelligence, as he has been in the Apple ecosystem for years. \"Currently AI has yet to enter a very intelligent stage, and it's not essential for me to have it on my phone. There are many alternative ways to access AI services that I need,\" he said.\n\nChina's scrutiny over generative AI technology has been tightening, with new guidelines and rules this year to ensure that AI-generated content aligns with what the government permits. Last August, China imposed detailed regulations governing domestic generative AI services, making it one of the first countries in the world to implement rules covering that emerging technology.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – July 31, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM and Tesla TSLA.\n\nTime to Buy the World's Most Valuable Company as Earnings Approach\n\nAs the world’s most valuable company, markets will pay close attention to results for Apple’s fiscal third quarter on Thursday, August 1.\n\nEdging Microsoft with a market cap of over $3.3 trillion, let’s see if it’s time to buy Apple’s stock as earnings approach.\n\nApple’s Q3 Expectations\n\nRanging from games to subscriptions for movies and music, services revenue has helped sustain Apple’s robust top line. Along with its iconic app store, this includes Apple Pay and AppleCare with Q3 Services revenue expected to spike 13% to $23.99 billion.\n\nHowever, Product revenue which is led by Apple’s flagship iPhone is expected to dip to $60.06 billion compared to $60.58 billion in the comparative quarter. Overall, Apple’s Q3 sales are still projected to rise 3% to $84.38 billion.\n\nOn the bottom line, Apple’s Q2 EPS is thought to have increased 6% to $1.34 versus $1.26 per share a year ago. Notably, Apple has surpassed bottom line expectations for five consecutive quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 4.14% in its last four quarterly reports.\n\nApple Intelligence\n\nWall Street will be looking for updates on Apple’s plans to expand into generative AI which will concentrate on personal intelligence systems for the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook. Apple is also testing a ChatGPT-style generative AI tool called “ASK” for AppleCare Support along with upgrading its digital voice assistant Siri.\n\nApple has stated it believes in the transformative power and promise of AI and has the advantages to differentiate itself in the new era of tech. The company has worked closely with Taiwan Semiconductor in this regard which provides the M3 chip for its MacBook Air. Apple deems the MacBook Air as the best consumer laptop for AI with breakthrough performance including a more powerful neural engine.\n\nYTD Performance\n\nYear to date, Apple’s stock is up a respectable +12% although this has slightly trailed the broader indexes and most of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers outside of Microsoft and Tesla.\n\nMonitoring Apple’s Valuation\n\nChecking out one of Apple’s key fundamental valuation metrics, AAPL currently commands a modest premium to the broader market at 33.1X forward earnings compared to the S&P 500’s 23X. It’s noteworthy that Apple trades below its decade-long high of 38.6X forward earnings but noticeably above the median of 18.1X.\n\nStory continues\n\nTakeaway\n\nAhead of its Q3 report, Apple’s stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Reaching or exceeding quarterly expectations may be crucial to more upside in Apple’s stock as its valuation does allude to the notion that there could be better buying opportunities ahead.\n\nThat said, Apple is a cash cow that has the resources to expand and potentially capitalize on artificial intelligence which could be very rewarding for long-term investors.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "As the world’s most valuable company, markets will pay close attention to results for Apple’s AAPL fiscal third quarter on Thursday, August 1.\n\nEdging Microsoft MSFT with a market cap of over $3.3 trillion, let’s see if it’s time to buy Apple’s stock as earnings approach. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple’s Q3 Expectations\n\nRanging from games to subscriptions for movies and music, services revenue has helped sustain Apple’s robust top line. Along with its iconic app store, this includes Apple Pay and AppleCare with Q3 Services revenue expected to spike 13% to $23.99 billion.\n\nHowever, Product revenue which is led by Apple’s flagship iPhone is expected to dip to $60.06 billion compared to $60.58 billion in the comparative quarter. Overall, Apple’s Q3 sales are still projected to rise 3% to $84.38 billion.\n\nOn the bottom line, Apple’s Q2 EPS is thought to have increased 6% to $1.34 versus $1.26 per share a year ago. Notably, Apple has surpassed bottom line expectations for five consecutive quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 4.14% in its last four quarterly reports. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple Intelligence\n\nWall Street will be looking for updates on Apple’s plans to expand into generative AI which will concentrate on personal intelligence systems for the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook. Apple is also testing a ChatGPT-style generative AI tool called “ASK” for AppleCare Support along with upgrading its digital voice assistant Siri.\n\nApple has stated it believes in the transformative power and promise of AI and has the advantages to differentiate itself in the new era of tech. The company has worked closely with Taiwan Semiconductor TSM in this regard which provides the M3 chip for its MacBook Air. Apple deems the MacBook Air as the best consumer laptop for AI with breakthrough performance including a more powerful neural engine.\n\nYTD Performance\n\nYear to date, Apple’s stock is up a respectable +12% although this has slightly trailed the broader indexes and most of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers outside of Microsoft and Tesla TSLA.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMonitoring Apple’s Valuation\n\nChecking out one of Apple’s key fundamental valuation metrics, AAPL currently commands a modest premium to the broader market at 33.1X forward earnings compared to the S&P 500’s 23X. It’s noteworthy that Apple trades below its decade-long high of 38.6X forward earnings but noticeably above the median of 18.1X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway\n\nAhead of its Q3 report, Apple’s stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Reaching or exceeding quarterly expectations may be crucial to more upside in Apple’s stock as its valuation does allude to the notion that there could be better buying opportunities ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, Apple is a cash cow that has the resources to expand and potentially capitalize on artificial intelligence which could be very rewarding for long-term investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the context of this framework, Kupferberg said the Street is mis-modeling warrant expense and share-based compensation.\n\nAs warrant expense and Stock-based compensation (SBC) expense grind lower, the analyst forecasted GAAP profitability to arrive in fiscal 2026 faster than consensus.\n\nKupferberg flagged the increasing market expectations of three rate cuts in 2024 and four in 2025. A lower interest rate environment would be beneficial to Affirm Holdings’ funding costs and for gain on loan sales.\n\nAs per the analyst, Affirm Holdings recently moved its merchants to a 36% annual percentage rate (APR) cap on loans, up from 30% previously, which should remain a tailwind for yields and Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) growth.\n\nGiven recent share price underperformance, Kupferberg noted the fourth-quarter print could be a positive catalyst.\n\nAffirm Holdings may communicate a more bullish message on profitability while delivering fourth-quarter upside and guiding fiscal 2025 solidly in line, as per the analyst.\n\nNew Apple relationships, further scaling of Affirm Card, and potential geographic expansion of existing large partnerships like Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP) should all support fiscal 2025 and 2026 forecasts, Kupferberg added.\n\nThe analyst projected fiscal 2024 sales of $2.27 billion, fiscal 2025 sales of $2.75 billion and fiscal 2026 sales of $3.24 billion.\n\nPrice Action: AFRM shares closed trading higher by 2.31% at $27.46 on Tuesday.\n\nPhoto via Company\n\nLatest Ratings for AFRM\n\nDate Firm Action From To Feb 2022 Barclays Maintains Overweight Feb 2022 Credit Suisse Maintains Neutral Feb 2022 Jefferies Downgrades Hold Underperform\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for AFRM\n\nStory continues\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Affirm's Growth Boosted by Apple and Amazon Partnerships, Lower Interest Rates: Analyst originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "US stock futures mixed before Fed; Microsoft drops on disappointing earnings",
        "content": "Investing.com-- S&P futures were flat and Dow futures fell in evening deals on Tuesday as investors hunkered down before a decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve, while disappointing earnings from Microsoft weighed on major technology stocks.\n\nBut Nasdaq futures rose, aided by a rebound in chipmaking stocks following stronger-than-expected earnings from AMD, which showed artificial intelligence still remained an earnings driver for the sector.\n\nS&P 500 Futures steadied at 5,476.75 points, while Dow Jones Futures fell 0.4% to 40,795.0 points by 19:39 ET (23:39 GMT). Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.4% to 19,021.0 points.\n\nMicrosoft cloud revenue misses estimates despite spending increase\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell more than 3% in afterhours trade after its fourth-quarter cloud revenue growth missed Wall Street estimates. The stock had fallen as far as 7%, but pared losses after it said on an earnings call that cloud growth would accelerate in the coming quarters.\n\nWhile the firm’s overall earnings just edged past estimates for the June quarter, revenue from Azure, the company’s cloud business, grew 29%, missing estimates of 30.2% and also slowing from the 31% rise in the prior quarter. This came even as investment in AI saw capital expenditure surge by $5 billion in the quarter.\n\nAzure is Microsoft’s main platform for its AI offerings, and serves as a barometer for demand for the sector. The Redmond, Washington-based tech giant is among the frontrunners on Wall Street to monetize AI, having tied up with OpenAI to release a slew of products over the past year.\n\nMicrosoft’s earnings sparked losses across most of its heavyweight tech peers, given that they came just a week after earnings from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) showed a similar trend.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), which are set to report earnings on Wednesday, fell 1% and 0.7%, respectively, while Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which will report earnings on Thursday, fell 0.5%.\n\nChipmakers rebound on strong showing from AMD\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) surged over 8%, while rival NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) added 5.4% after AMD clocked stronger-than-expected earnings and forecast upbeat revenue for the current quarter, citing strong demand from AI.\n\nAMD’s earnings sparked gains across chipmaking stocks. But they highlighted a potential division in AI-fueled earnings- where the suppliers of AI-related equipment appeared to be faring better than their customers, especially following Microsoft’s disappointing showing.\n\nStory continues\n\nA measure of bargain buying also aided chipmakers, after heavy losses on Tuesday and over the past two weeks.\n\nWall Street nurses losses with Fed on tap\n\nWall Street indexes ended lower on Tuesday as investors pivoted from tech and into more economically sensitive sectors amid caution over the Fed and major tech earnings.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep rates steady at the conclusion of a meeting on Wednesday. But any signals on its plans to cut rates will be closely watched, as recent inflation data fueled growing conviction the Fed will begin cutting in September.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.5% to 5,436.44 points on Tuesday, while the NASDAQ Composite fell 1.3% to 17,141.98 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, rising 0.5% to 40,743.33 points.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures mixed before Fed; Microsoft drops on disappointing earnings\n\nSamsung flags strong AI demand as second-quarter profit soars on higher chip prices\n\nEarnings call: TriMas Q2 2024 results show mixed segment performance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a laggard in 2024. While other indices roared higher over the first half of the year, the venerable Dow gained only about half of its peers.\n\nEven though Magnificent Seven componentsMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are part of the index because it is price-weighted and not market cap-weighted like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, their movements did not influence its growth as much.\n\nThe Dow Jones is much more diverse in terms of its components than the S&P, where the Magnificent Seven account for nearly a third of the popular index.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat means the more egalitarian Dow provides a better barometer of how the economy is performing. Investors looking for what comes next might want to pay close attention to these Dow stocks to watch.\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt was a bitter pill for 3M (NYSE:MMM) investors to swallow when the industrial conglomerate slashed its dividend in half in May. Beset by mounting legal woes due to faulty earplugs sold to the military and environmental pollution from so-called “forever chemicals,” 3M cut its dividend after more than six decades of increasing it.\n\nYet as I noted at the time, this makes the industrial giant an attractive Dow stock to watch. It was in the process of settling the lawsuits, had spun off its consumer products division into Solventum (NYSE:SOLV) and freed up its cash profits to invest back into the company.\n\nDividend payments were eating up almost all of its free cash flow (FCF), and by cutting the payout, it gave itself greater financial flexibility. That was just proven by the second-quarter results released last Friday. Although revenue was lower by a half percent, adjusted profits surged 39% year-over-year to $1.39 per share as it produced $1.2 billion in adjusted FCF.\n\n3M stock soared 22% after the news as the conglomerate raised the lower end of its full-year guidance. It now sees adjusted earnings per share in a range of $7.00 to $7.30 per share compared to its previous outlook of $6.80 to $7.30 per share. With the stock trading at 16 times earnings estimates and FCF, MMM shares remain attractive.\n\nDisney (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nDid Disney (NYSE:DIS) just remember how to make movies again? On the heels of two smash hits with Inside Out 2 and Despicable Me 4, the just-released Deadpool & Wolverine movie broke some box office records. It grossed an estimated $438 million over the weekend. That’s a record for R-rated movies and the eighth-biggest opening for any film ever.\n\nStory continues\n\nDisney also announced that popular actor Robert Downey Jr. would be returning to the Avengers. Not as his iconic Iron Man character but rather as villain Dr. Doom in two upcoming films.\n\nThe entertainment giant had a horrible string of failures in 2023 where virtually every movie it put out lost money. As moviegoers rejected the overt political and cultural messaging included in its films, people stayed away from the theater. CEO Bob Iger has finally gotten the message after Disney stock has lost half its value over the past three years.\n\nIts theme parks have long been a strong source of income. But to thrive, it needs all of its entertainment arms working properly. Focusing again on making family-oriented fare without injecting messaging into its movies is what the company needed. It will help its streaming business, too, as Disney hasn’t had a hit show and industry cancellations are rising.\n\nKeep a close watch on DIS stock. It has been a part of the Dow since 1991. Although not at risk of being booted, this welcome change of direction could boost its standing.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nHealthcare leader Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the third of the Dow stocks to watch. The drugmaker’s stock is up only 1% so far this year. Until the beginning of July, shares had been deep in the red. Yet it has been a blue-chip worth buying, particularly in a dicey economy.\n\nWell-diversified across pharmaceuticals and medical devices, its drug pipeline is robust enough to support its therapies already on the market. Johnson & Johnson’s medical device business just chugs along.\n\nSecond-quarter results earlier this month showed its pharmaceutical business grew 9% versus a 4% increase in medical devices. While the latter was slowed by pricing in China, sales should pick up in the back half of the year. Johnson & Johnson maintains its long-term growth rate targets of 5% to 7% are intact.\n\nThe pharma’s main immunology drug, Stelara, represents 20% of total sales, but growth will slow as competing biologics come to market. Yet oncology treatment Darzalex, which generated $2.9 billion in sales in the second quarter, continues to take market share. It also has a passel of other drugs that were just released that could see tens of billions of dollars in sales over the next few years.\n\nIt possesses strong pricing for its pharmaceuticals, its medical business continues to gain traction and Johnson & Johnson remains a Dow stock to watch.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in MMM, SOLV and JNJ stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nRich Duprey has written about stocks and investing for the past 20 years.

This has proven to be a buy-and-hold stock that’s worth keeping in the portfolio for the long-term. Furthermore, with various AI catalysts losing the company’s Azure cloud division’s growth, and its diverse cloud approach which offers both on-premise cloud options that can dominate the market, there’s a lot to like about how Microsoft stock is positioned for continued long-term gains.\n\nLast year, Microsoft stock also exceeded market expectations with its 17% revenue growth and 20% rise in net income. This was mostly driven by AI advancements and cloud computing. Strong results make the stock a good opportunity to own.\n\nPartnership with Lumen Technologies An image of the black and blue Lumen Technology logo on a white background.\n\nLumen Technologies (NYSE:LUMN) and Microsoft partnered to enhance Lumen’s digital transformation using Microsoft Cloud. Microsoft selected Lumen to expand network capacity for its AI-driven data centers. This collaboration supports Microsoft’s AI tools and infrastructure.

The company has suggested it will restrict security vendors from accessing the Windows kernel to boost system resilience. CrowdStrike’s software, running at this critical level, caused widespread issues when it malfunctioned. Unlike Microsoft’s past efforts, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has successfully restricted kernel access in macOS.\n\nThe company is revisiting restrictions on kernel-level access in Windows following recent issues with CrowdStrike. John Cable, a VP at Microsoft, emphasized the need for enhanced resilience and closer collaboration with security partners. While specific updates were not detailed, he highlighted innovations like VBS enclaves and Azure Attestation as steps toward improved security.\n\nJohn Cable highlighted that modern Zero Trust practices can enhance development without relying on kernel access. He indicated ongoing efforts to strengthen Windows and collaborate with the security community. Although Microsoft can’t restrict Windows like Apple due to regulatory concerns, the idea of tighter control may spark debate. Cloudflare’s CEO has cautioned about potential impacts, suggesting Microsoft must balance security with vendor needs.\n\nI’m Still Bullish on MSFT Stock Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft investors have outperformed the market by a wide margin wins the company’s IPO, and there are numerous reasons why this is likely to be the case moving forward.\n\nWith strong cash flow generation courtesy of the company’s core software business, and growth ahead for Microsoft’s Azure division (with its various AI integrations underway), this is a growth stock with plenty to prove long-term. It’s my view that buying Microsoft stock on dips and holding long-term is likely to be a strategy that pays off for investors big time.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The UK’s competition regulator has confirmed it is investigating Google’s parent company and its partnership with fellow AI firm Anthropic over concerns it could impact competition in the AI market.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has published an invitation to comment from “any interested party” on the partnership.\n\nAlphabet is reported to have invested more than two billion dollars in Anthropic over several funding rounds for the US start-up – an approach that has become common in the tech sector, with many of the biggest names investing heavily in AI start-ups. Alphabet has invested heavily in Anthropic (Alamy/PA)\n\nBut this approach has caught the attention of regulators in recent months, with the CMA publishing a report earlier this year which warned of potential risks to fair and open competition in the AI space.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt specifically highlighted what it called an “interconnected web” of more than 90 partnerships and strategic investments from the biggest names in tech – including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft – and emerging AI firms, a set-up it warned could be used to consolidate power and resources within the sector among a few companies.\n\nAmazon, as well as Alphabet, has invested heavily in Anthropic, while Microsoft is the largest investor in ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI has also formed a partnership with Apple to embed ChatGPT into future generations of the iPhone as part of Apple’s plans to bring more generative AI tools to its products.\n\nRegulators have argued that these large investments and partnerships could see the biggest tech firms able to gain some control over the direction of emerging AI firms, without attracting the regulatory scrutiny that a full acquisition might.\n\nIn its announcement, the CMA said: “The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering whether it is or may be the case that this partnership has resulted in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that relevant merger situation has resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.”\n\nAlphabet has been contacted for comment.\n\nEarlier this month, the CMA also confirmed that it was investigating Microsoft’s hiring of staff from Inflection AI, after it named the firm’s former boss as the leader of its new Microsoft AI unit, with several other members of staff following him to Microsoft.",

        "title": "My Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Just Proved Again Why It's the Best Buy of the Group",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" has been a dominant group in the market over the past few years. It's made up of:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nMy top Magnificent Seven stock to buy just reported its latest results, and they were outstanding. However, the market didn't reward the stock, and it's down alongside the rest of the group. Is this a buying opportunity for one of the best stocks on Wall Street? I think so.\n\nAlphabet's business is rising steadily\n\nMy favorite stock in the Magnificent Seven right now is Alphabet. Over the past year, Alphabet has posted some excellent results and is starting to perfect its artificial intelligence (AI) product offering.Additionally, its advertising segment (which accounts for around three-fourths of all revenue) is doing well for how mature the business segment is. In the second quarter, sales rose 11% year over year to $64.6 billion. W\n\nWhile some investors may be concerned that this growth isn't nearly as quick as it needs to be for Alphabet to stand out, I don't view it that way. Alphabet's ad segment is a reliable business that creates massive cash flows for the company, allowing it to invest in next-generation technology like AI. It also funds the growth of another vital segment: Google Cloud.\n\nGoogle Cloud is the smallest of the big three cloud computing players. This size disadvantage can be traced back to Google's late entry into this market, but it's still growing quickly. In Q2, revenue grew 29% year over year to $10.3 billion. It also posted an operating margin of 11%, which is still far behind what industry leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) delivered in the first quarter with a 38% margin. Once Google Cloud reaches scale and improves its operating margin to similar levels, this segment will provide a meaningful profit boost, although that is still some years away.\n\nAltogether, Alphabet's quarter was solid, with revenue growing 14% year over year and earnings per share (EPS) rising from $1.44 to $1.89. It was hard to find a fault in the quarter, but it was also difficult to find a \"wow\" moment.\n\nThe stock fell 5% the day after trading, dragging the rest of the market down with it. But I think this pullback is a mistake and provides investors with an opportunity to get into the stock, now that it's down around 10% from its highs.\n\nUnlike its peers, the stock doesn't have an expensive premium\n\nFor the most part, the Magnificent Seven stocks are incredibly pricey when compared to the broader market. However, Alphabet doesn't have the same premium, so investors don't have as much risk on the table by investing in Alphabet. After the pullback, Alphabet's stock trades for 23 times forward earnings.\n\nStory continues GOOG PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile that only retraces its valuation to a few months ago, it prices it in the vicinity of the broader S&P 500 index, which trades at 22.7 times forward earnings. When you buy Alphabet stock at these levels, you're essentially buying an above-average company for a market-average price. That's a great deal, and investors should take advantage of it.\n\nThrough Alphabet's consistent revenue growth, expanding dividend, and aggressive share repurchase programs (Alphabet repurchased over $15 billion in stock during Q2), it's a shoo-in for a company that can grow earnings faster than 10% annualized. That's a fantastic investment proposition, and it's one that investors need to understand.\n\nYou don't have to hit a home run every time you invest. Sometimes, the steady growers that can outperform the market by a couple of percentage points each year are the best investments, and I think Alphabet falls into this category.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing in the technology sector continues to be an excellent choice overall. This chart shows the sector-by-sector returns from the S&P 500 between 2009 and 2023. It indicates that the tech and information technology sector has been the best performer on an annual basis during that period. That alone speaks to the logic for investing in the tech sector for the long haul.\n\nAdmittedly, purchasing buy and hold stocks within the tech sector can feel daunting. The volatility over the past few years does raise concerns for some. And, 2022 was a particularly strong example of such fears. However, it’s necessary to keep the long-term picture in mind. The tech sector remains the best performer during that 14-year period even with the inclusion of dramatic tech downturns of 2022.\n\nToday, long haul tech stocks are likely to be driven by artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors, cybersecurity, blockchain and a host of new innovations. Growth will be high and investing in strong companies is your best bet. Let’s delve into the top performers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) provides the digital oil that fuels a lot of the innovation in tech. The company is the foundry to the world. It provides chip manufacturing services to just about everyone in the rapidly growing chip market. Also known as TSMC, it produces 60% of chips globally and 90% of the world’s most advanced chips. It’s entirely reasonable to consider TSMC as the keystone firm in the tech supply chain.\n\nThat position and its location have made investing in TSMC undeniably risky. Few other firms carry the political risk that TSMC does due to its location in Taiwan. It is front and center in the ongoing battle between the U.S. and China.\n\nAlso, the company could face new tariffs if Donald Trump is re-elected in November. The risks are clear and several. However, no other company is capable of doing that which TSMC does. The U.S. is trying to subsidize chip production back to American soil but that will favor TSMC as it is building foundries in Arizona. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is trying to get onto the same playing field as TSMC, but that seems like a pipe dream at this point. This all suggests that TSMC continues to be an excellent choice for the long haul.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is wavering as I write this article. Fresh concerns about AI profitability and antitrust probes are big factors in that.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough this piece is about buy and hold factors related to Apple, I’d like to briefly point out an opportunity. Apple’s Q3 results are coming out August 1. Revenues and earnings are expected to increase by 10% and 13%, respectively, year-over-year (YOY). Mac sales and Apple’s services segments continue to improve. Further, iPhone sales – which truly drive the stock – are also improving. That should be a strong positive signal to the market that Apple is truly coming back.\n\nA lot has been written about the AI opportunity for Apple. I’ll skip that because all there really is to know at this point is that the company has launched AI. The other exciting piece of news for the long term is that Apple is on the cusp of producing in-house wireless chips. That will move it away from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) in the near future. It should make Apple a more complete tech giant once it has a firmer grasp on chip production. The long term looks very promising for Apple.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) disappointed with its Q2 earnings report released July 23. This snippet explains the trouble for the stock well: “the electric vehicle maker reported a 45% year-over-year decline in profits for the second quarter, missing analysts’ expectations.”\n\nThere’s no doubt that demand for Tesla’s EVs is sagging at the moment. As a result, prices are falling. So, Tesla has to lower production costs while introducing cheaper vehicles. That task creates an opportunity for investors as share prices hit a lull.\n\nWe know Tesla is highly likely to be a long-term beneficiary of the AI boom. The company continues to develop autonomous driving capabilities as well as its AI-enabled humanoid robot known as Optimus. Recently, the company debuted the second generation model of Optimus at a tech conference in Shanghai.\n\nTesla is positioning itself as one of the leaders in the AI robot space. Not only could that drastically reduce internal labor costs in the future, but also it could create a huge external revenue stream in the process. Tesla isn’t the clear-cut EV winner it once was as China rises, and that doubt creates a strong entry point for long-term thinkers.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) dominates the customer relationship marketing space with a market share exceeding that of the next four biggest firms combined. That makes it the king of customer connections for the 11th consecutive year. Further, customer relationship management is forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 14% through 2030.\n\nThat combination of factors alone makes Salesforce a stock to consider for the long term. In the short term, rate cuts are on the horizon. Salesforce is one of a select group of growth stocks that many are fixating on in relation to that opportunity.\n\nAdditionally, Salesforce offers a comprehensive platform that goes beyond CRM alone. It was also one of the first CRMs to utilize a standalone cloud platform.\n\nAI will be a big part of Salesforce’s future. The company is working to address the unreliability of generative AI that has played the tech in its early developmental stages. The company clearly hopes to stand out as a reliable AI service that enterprises can count on. AI hallucinations are relatively inconsequential for individual users. The stakes for enterprises, however, are much higher.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) ChatGPT logo seen on the smartphone, Microsoft (MSFT) logo seen on the laptop. Microsoft Copilot\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best buy and hold stocks of the past decade. It has provided annualized returns of 29.35% over the past 10 years. Per the rule of 72, an investment in Microsoft would have doubled in value roughly every two and a half years during that time frame. And, $10,000 invested in MSFT shares and left untouched over that time would have grown to a value exceeding $131,000 today.\n\nIn short, the precedent for buying Microsoft and holding it over the long haul is sturdy.\n\nThe near future and long-term future for Microsoft will be heavily dependent upon artificial intelligence. in the near term, the markets will be looking for signs that Microsoft’s cloud platform continues to grow due to AI. Customers continue to run and train their respective modelsUsing Microsoft’s Azure platform. The AI Cloud platform, along with the data center opportunity overall, make Microsoft a clear long-term choice worth taking.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) An image of engineers analyzing wind turbines over the hill, data imposed over the image. NEE stock\n\nSource: ConceptCafe/Shutterstock\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is an extremely well-positioned stock overall, one that makes a lot of sense for the long term.\n\nThe company is part utilities firm and part renewable energy leader. It has a unique mix of revenue generation that truly sets it apart. It offers the growth of renewables with the steady nature of utilities stocks.\n\nThe utilities business makes NextEra Energy attractive when concerns about the tech sector arise, as they recently have. The defensive nature of utilities stocks is the reason for that truth. Also, NextEra Energy is attractive because the text sector is increasing renewable energy demand. The company’s Chief Executive Officer expects renewable energy demand to triple by 2030. A lot of that growth will be driven by AI data center demand for clean energy. Those companies simultaneously reduce their carbon footprint while consuming more energy overall.\n\nNextEra Energy remains a uniquely positioned stock with multiple positive factors in its favor.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is another long haul stock to buy for investors who believe in the power of AI and chips in general.\n\nThe Dutch firm is the only company in the world capable of producing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. Those EUV machines are capable of producing the world’s most advanced chips that drive innovation. That makes ASML, along with TSMC, linchpins of the technology sector.\n\nAnd, multiple signs show that ASML will continue to dominate. First, the company enjoys strong gross margins indicative of durable competitive advantage. That is one of many metrics which indicate that ASML is a highly profitable firm overall.\n\nThose powerful margins provide ASML with the cash necessary to invest in R&D that allows it to keep its competitive edge. The company invested four billion Euros in R&D in 2023, up from 3.3 billion in 2022. Also, it’s front and center in relation to geopolitical tensions and has been for quite some time. Investors must consider ASML as among the best long haul tech stocks as chips drive innovation, and the company has an unassailable position in that regard.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): One of the Best Stocks in the Obama Portfolio?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Obama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year Returns. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks in former U.S. president Barack Obama's portfolio.\n\nFormer United States President Barack Obama took office during one of the worst recessions in U.S. history, yet the stock market reached new highs during his tenure. Stepping into office in 2009, the year after stocks plummeted nearly 40% amid the financial crisis of 2007-2008, Obama made a remarkably well-timed market prediction. On March 3, 2009, just days before the S&P 500 hit an intraday low of 666 and a closing low of 676.53, the then-president stated, \"What you're now seeing is profit-and-earnings ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you've got a long-term perspective on it.\" By the time he left office on January 20, 2017, the S&P 500 had soared to 2,263.69, reflecting a gain of about 225% since his predictive remark.\n\nThe \"Obama Years\" coincided with rapid technological advancements that significantly impacted the stock market. Apple Inc.'s iPhone, introduced less than two years before he took office, exemplified this era of innovation. In addition, during Obama's presidency, billionaire Reed Hastings transformed Netflix Inc. from a DVD rental-by-mail company into a video-streaming giant, revolutionizing entertainment consumption. On the other hand, renewable energy, particularly solar energy, struggled during the president's tenure. Despite the administration's solar subsidies, investors were largely disappointed as those subsidies eventually faded. First Solar Inc., one of the largest U.S. solar equipment producers, saw its stock plummet by as much as 74% due to falling solar panel prices, making it the worst-performing S&P 500 stock of the Obama era.\n\nHow Did the Obamas Make Their Money?\n\nFrom speaking at events worldwide to writing memoirs and signing a major production deal with Netflix, the Obamas have led a busy and highly lucrative life post-White House. Michelle Obama's first memoir, \"Becoming,\" published in November 2018, became that year's No. 1 best-selling book. Her second book, \"The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times,\" also achieved bestseller status. Similarly, Barack Obama's latest memoir, \"A Promised Land,\" sold nearly 890,000 copies within 24 hours of its November 2020 release. These ventures, along with the six-figure pension that all former presidents receive, have significantly boosted the Obamas' net worth, which is at least $70 million according to the International Business Times. The New York Post, however, estimates their fortune to be much higher, at $135 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, Barack Obama’s income isn’t limited to speaking fees and pensions. Like many other wealthy individuals, he has invested significantly in the stock market. So what does his portfolio look like? When he took office in 2009, Obama, like all presidents, was required to make financial disclosures by law. At that time, Obama held $200,000-$450,000 in the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares that tracks the S&P 500 index, according to a report by CBS News.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThese investments were selected from the top holdings of the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares, one of Barack Obama's primary investments during his presidency, according to official disclosures. We have provided each stock's trailing 10-year returns to assess their performance over the decade. Data from approximately 919 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024 was also analyzed to determine the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each firm.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple, our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy picks 14 small and large-caps every quarter and it has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNote: The stocks are sorted in ascending order of their trailing 10-year returns.\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 150\n\nTrailing 10-Year Returns: 24.83%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands as a prominent tech giant. Headquartered in Cupertino, California, the company is renowned for its flagship products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Notably, Bloomberg recently reported on May 9 that the tech giant plans to incorporate its own high-end chips in data centers to deliver AI features this year.\n\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\n\n“Consumers may find purchasing Microsoft’s AI PC confusing (calculating whether it reaches 40 TOPS before purchase), whereas Apple directly tells consumers which models can support Apple Intelligence. Regardless of whether on-device AI applications meet consumer needs, Apple has a clear selling advantage from the start,” Kuo said.\n\nOn June 14, Erste Group upgraded its rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from Hold to Buy, citing several positive factors contributing to the tech giant's favorable outlook. The firm highlighted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s strong customer loyalty and continuous product innovation as key strengths. They emphasized the company's advancements in its Mac lineup, particularly the introduction of the M4 chip, as a significant driver of long-term growth.\n\nAs of the first quarter of 2024, Insider Monkey’s database revealed that 150 hedge funds held stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), collectively valued at $205 billion. This represented a notable increase from the previous quarter, where 131 hedge funds held stakes valued at $161 billion.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company’s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company’s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\n\nAlthough near-term trends are a bit muted, Apple is carrying lean inventory into an iPhone refresh cycle later this year. With an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices and significant growth of the company’s recurring revenue Services segment, we believe that Apple remains one of the most innovative, best positioned and most profitable companies in the mobile technology industry.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of former U.S. president Barack Obama's portfolio stocks. You can visit Obama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year Returnsto see the other stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – July 30, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nMagnificent 7 Earnings Preview: Can Investors Buy Tech Now?\n\nGet ready for some action this week in the stock market as four of the Magnificent 7 tech giants — Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple —gear up to report their quarterly earnings.\n\nThese tech titans have been the primary drivers of this year’s return, pushing the market to new heights. But with the recent bout of market volatility, the big question remains: Is now the time for investors to dive into tech stocks?\n\nHere, we will explore the broader picture of the sector and potential outcomes of these quarterly earnings reports and try to figure out if any or all of them are worthy additions to investor portfolios at current levels.\n\nStrong Earnings Growth… But AI Concerns Loom\n\nLast week, following the quarterly report from Alphabet, investors started to grow cautious. Concerns about overinvestment into AI infrastructure and its ability to generate profits moving forward have been the main cause of selling over the last week.\n\nManagement’s comments about Capex regarding AI will be an important talking point for all these stocks.\n\nAlong with weakness in Alphabet, Semiconductor stocks and the other Mag 7 stocks have experienced considerable selling. But are these concerns overblown? I think they may be, and with another quarter of impressive growth likely coming, and reasonable valuations from the group, this dip could be a buying opportunity.\n\nAmazon is expected to post a 63.64% year-over-year increase in earnings to $0.54 per share, with revenue projected at $140.88 billion, driven by robust AWS and North American retail operations. Apple, despite a slight revenue dip to $81.64 billion, is forecasted to achieve earnings of $1.19 per share, bolstered by its services and wearables segments.\n\nMeta Platforms anticipates a significant earnings jump to $3.04 per share, a 45% jump and $31.05 billion in revenue, fueled by strong ad revenue and user engagement. Microsoft is projected to deliver $2.72 per share in earnings and $62.03 billion in revenue, reflecting Azure's impressive performance and continued strength in Office and LinkedIn.\n\nOverall, the Mag 7 is expected to bring in +26.8% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.7% higher revenues.\n\nValuations: Amazon and Meta are Relatively Cheap\n\nLooking at the valuations of these tech giants we see a spectrum of results. Although they are broadly trading at reasonable levels, two of them look much more appealing than the others.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms stands out with a free cash flow (FCF) yield of 4.1%, above its 10-year median of 3.2%, making it particularly attractive. Amazon too boasts an FCF yield of 2.6%, above its 10-year median of 1.8%.\n\nApple, on the other hand, has a FCF yield of 3%, which is below its 10-year median of 5.7%, indicating it may be pricier relative to its historical norm. And Microsoft shows a similar trend with an FCF yield of 2.2%, below its 10-year median of 3.6%.\n\nUncertainty Into Year End but Forecasts are Strong\n\nI think it may be a bit of a crapshoot buying these names ahead of earnings, but the reasonable valuations and secular tailwinds these companies enjoy make them compelling buys if they sell off further following the reports.\n\nCritical to the performance of these stocks through the end of the year is investors' perception of AI. Can these companies turn a profit in their new AI products? The answer is probably yes, but shareholders want to see hard evidence.\n\nAnother worthy consideration is the setup in the broader market and the approaching US Presidential Election. Big tech has been carrying the market higher all year, and it may be time for a pause in this run. Additionally, as the election approaches so does the perceived uncertainty, and investors may rotate into defensive sectors until after it concludes.\n\nHowever, it is hard to understate the long-term growth catalysts at these big tech companies – they are almost all expected to grow earnings faster than the market, which will drive even higher stock prices in the coming years.\n\nAny pause they take now, or in the coming months, is likely an opportunity to acquire shares in these generational assets.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, August 1, with investors likely to be watching for sales results in the China region and updates related to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nHowever, according to Loop Capital, AI isn't the only significant growth driver for the tech giant; the firm’s analysts also see Apple's Services segment \"skyrocketing.\"\n\nMore concretely, analysts emphasize the importance of Apple Music, Apple TV, and iCloud, projecting substantial revenue increases for these products in the coming years.\n\nApple Music currently generates $9.2 billion in revenue and is expected to grow further. Similarly, iCloud, which stands at $8 billion, “is primed for massive growth” driven by AI, Vision Pro, and more data-intensive apps, games, and video content, analysts noted.\n\nMoreover, Apple TV, with nearly 125 million subscribers, generated just under $1 billion in the past year. According to Loop analysts, the growth opportunity within this service is “massive.”\n\n“We expect content gains mainly through acquisition to drive the Apple TV growth,” they noted.\n\nAnalysts also highlighted Apple News, which currently commands about $1.3 billion annually, and has an $8 billion total addressable market (TAM).\n\nOverall, Loop Capital’s analysis suggests that by 2030, the TAM for Apple’s Services could reach $391 billion, out of a total company TAM of $1.659 trillion. For comparison, the current TAM for Apple’s services sits at around $209 billion.\n\nStill, the iPhone remains a cornerstone of Apple's product lineup, analysts said.\n\nThe upcoming iPhone 16 and 17 cycles are expected to benefit from the integration of AI, which will push consumers towards new devices as refurbished and older models will lag in performance.\n\nThe firm forecasts Apple’s total revenue to surpass $500 billion in the next 3-4 years, with iPhones accounting for roughly half of this amount.\n\nBeyond the iPhone, Loop Capital also stressed the importance of Apple’s custom AI chip, which is expected to have “major implications in 2025 and beyond.”\n\nIn addition, the investment bank points to the resurgence of other devices like the Mac and iPad, which are recovering from sales slumps post-pandemic, aided by new designs and increased integration across Apple’s ecosystem.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAI not only driver for Apple, services seen skyrocketing: Loop Capital\n\nEarnings call: Shionogi reports mixed results, optimistic on pipeline progress\n\nEarnings call: DiaSorin reports growth and raises 2024 guidance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Fed meeting, Microsoft earns, BP dividend - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve starts its latest policy-setting meeting, while investors look forward to more corporate earnings, particularly from the important tech sector. BP has already impressed with its second-quarter numbers.\n\n1. Fed starts policy-setting meeting\n\nThe Federal Reserve starts its July policy meeting later in the session, and after a benign June inflation report, investors after looking for the policymakers to lay the groundwork for a September rate cut.\n\nThe U.S. central bank concludes its latest meeting on Wednesday, and is widely expected to maintain its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, as it has done since last July.\n\nInvestors are looking for signals about when and how many rate cuts may occur this year, and will therefore be intently following any policy guidance issued by the central bank, as well as the post-meeting press conference with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nFed officials have repeatedly stated that they are looking for more evidence that inflation is steadily returning to 2% before cutting rates, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated earlier this month that the central bank may not wait until inflation reaches this target before cutting rates.\n\nFutures are fully priced for a quarter-point easing in September, with a small chance of a reduction of 50 basis points, and have 66 basis points of easing priced in by Christmas.\n\n2. Futures edge higher with corporate results in focus\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Tuesday as investors awaited the start of the latest Federal Reserve meeting as well as key corporate earnings.\n\nBy 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 60 points, or 0.1%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 12 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 35 points, or 0.2%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is set to start its two-day policy meeting later in the session, and investors will be looking for clues over the timing and number of rate cuts to expect this year.\n\nThe main earnings release Tuesday will be from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) after the close, but there will also be results from the likes of Merck (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Procter&Gamble (NYSE:PG) before the open, as well as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) post closing bell.\n\nSo far, more than 40% of the S&P 500 companies have reported their results with 79% posting earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to LSEG.\n\n3. Microsoft’s Azure sales in spotlight\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) releases its quarterly results after the close Tuesday - the first of a series of numbers from the tech giants this week, including Facebook-parent Meta (NASDAQ:META) on Wednesday and then both Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors will be looking to see if sales in Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing business have picked up enough to justify the billions of dollars being spent on artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nThe software behemoth is expected to report that Azure's growth stayed steady quarter-over-quarter at about 31% between April and June, according to data from Visible Alpha, helped by its tie-up with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft's capital spending likely surged about 53% year-over-year to $13.64 billion in the period, according to 16 analysts polled by LSEG. A big step up from the $10.95 billion in expenditure it recorded in the previous quarter.\n\nShares of Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell sharply last week after the company reported a quarterly capital spending that exceeded estimates by nearly $1 billion, while the revenue boost from AI integrations remained modest, sparking a selloff in major tech companies.\n\n4. BP (NYSE:BP) lifts its dividend after Q2 results\n\nBP (LON:BP) released impressive second-quarter results earlier Tuesday, resulting in the energy giant raising its dividend after beating profit forecasts.\n\nBP reported an underlying profit of $2.76 billion for the second quarter of the financial year, up from $2.59 billion in the same quarter in 2023, and slightly higher than the $2.72 billion it earned in the first three months of the year.\n\nThe oil major generated substantial cash flow of $8.1 billion, enabling it to lower net debt to $22.6 billion as well as raising its dividend by 10% and announcing another share buyback, worth $1.75 billion, for the last quarter.\n\n“Our decision to increase our dividend by 10%, and extend our buyback program commitment to 4Q 2024, reflects the confidence we have in our performance and outlook for cash generation,” said CFO Kate Thomson.\n\n“We are maintaining a disciplined financial frame and remain committed to growing value and returns for BP.”\n\nAt 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), BP shares rose 2.5% to £4.65, trading largely flat year-to-date.\n\n5. Crude prices remain weak\n\nCrude prices steadied Tuesday, traded near two-month lows on continuing concerns about demand in China, the world's largest crude importer, while traders shrugged off the risk of conflict escalating in the Middle East.\n\nBy 04:00 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.1% to $75.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $79.09 a barrel.\n\nTraders were seen pricing out a risk premium from crude after media reports said Israeli officials were not seeking all-out war with Lebanon in their retaliation for a rocket strike that killed 12 in Israel-occupied Golan Heights.\n\nCrude prices are trading near two-month lows amid persistent concerns over slowing demand, especially in top importer China after last week’s weak growth data.\n\nThat said, the Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, pledged at the end of its July meeting to pursue a \"proactive\" fiscal policy, suggesting more stimulus ahead.\n\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets later in the week to discuss output levels, although recent weakness in crude is likely to see the cartel downplay any plans for scaling back production cuts.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFed meeting, Microsoft earns, BP dividend - what's moving markets\n\nBank of Korea board split on rate cut timing amid hot housing market, minutes show\n\nNew UK government cuts billions of pounds of spending to fix 'unsustainable' finances\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell on Tuesday, reversing a rebound from the prior session as sentiment remained on edge before interest rate decisions from the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve in the coming days.\n\nChinese markets continued to lag their peers, with local benchmarks hitting six-month lows as concerns over a slowing economic recovery showed few signs of easing.\n\nRegional markets took middling cues from Wall Street, which ended flat on Monday as caution over the central bank meetings kept investors from making big bets.\n\nU.S. stock index futures fell in Asian trade ahead of Wednesday’s Fed rate decision, while a slew of heavyweight technology earnings were also in focus.\n\nJapanese stocks sink amid uncertainty over BOJ\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 index fell 0.9% as did the broader TOPIX, amid uncertainty over the BOJ’s upcoming rate decision.\n\nAnalysts were largely split over a potential rate hike by the BOJ, following some mildly positive readings on inflation in the past two months. But underlying inflation- which is a key factor for the BOJ’s rate decisions- remained well below the bank’s 2% annual target.\n\nForecasts for the BOJ meeting ranged from a hold to a hike of 10 or 15 basis points.\n\nBut apart from the rate decision, uncertainty also persisted over the BOJ’s plans to begin tapering its quantitative easing programs. The bank had said it will elaborate on its plans during its July meeting.\n\nAn end to QE heralds less support for Japanese stock markets, with the BOJ set to taper down its asset purchases.\n\nChina stocks test 6-mth low, PMIs awaited\n\nChina’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively, with both indexes at their lowest levels since early-February. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slid 1.2% to an over three-month low.\n\nChinese stocks saw an extended rout through July as concerns over a slow economic recovery were exacerbated by middling signs on stimulus from Beijing.\n\nUncertainty over what the trajectory of the U.S. presidential race, with regards to U.S.-China trade relations, also kept traders averse to Chinese markets.\n\nFocus this week is squarely on a string of purchasing managers index readings from China, which are set to offer more cues on Asia’s largest economy.\n\nBroader Asian markets retreated, with technology stocks dropping in anticipation of earnings from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) later this week.\n\nSouth Korea’s KOSPI lost 1%, while Taipei shares of TSMC (TW:2330), the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, shed 1.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAustralia’s ASX 200 fell 0.8%, retreating before a consumer price index inflation reading for the second quarter. Monthly CPI indicators through the quarter herald a strong reading on Wednesday, which gives the Reserve Bank more impetus to keep rates high, or even potentially hike further.\n\nFutures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a negative open, after the index clocked wild swings in recent sessions as it struggled to make new highs above 25,000 points.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks sink as BOJ, Fed meetings approach; China shares hit 6-mth low\n\nAustralia's government on alert to support airline Rex as it hits turbulence\n\nBHP and Lundin Mining boost copper access, to buy Filo for $3.25 billion\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Apple relied on chips designed by Google rather than industry leader Nvidia to build two key components of its artificial intelligence software infrastructure for its forthcoming suite of AI tools and features, an Apple research paper published on Monday showed.\n\nApple's decision to rely on Google's cloud infrastructure is notable because Nvidia produces the most sought-after AI processors.\n\nIncluding the chips made by Google, Amazon.com and other cloud computing companies, Nvidia commands roughly 80% of the market.\n\nIn the research paper, Apple did not explicitly say that it used no Nvidia chips, but its description of the hardware and software infrastructure of its AI tools and features lacked any mention of Nvidia hardware.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nApple did not comment on Monday.\n\nThe iPhone maker said that to train its AI models, it used two flavors of Google's tensor processing unit (TPU) that are organized in large clusters of chips.\n\nTo build the AI model that will operate on iPhones and other devices, Apple used 2,048 of the TPUv5p chips. For its server AI model, Apple deployed 8,192 TPUv4 processors.\n\nNvidia does not design TPUs but rather focuses its efforts on so-called graphics processing units (GPUs) that are widely used for AI efforts.\n\nUnlike Nvidia, which sells its chips and systems as standalone products, Google sells access to TPUs through its Google Cloud Platform. Customers interested in buying access must build software through Google's cloud platform in order to use the chips.\n\nApple is rolling out portions Apple Intelligence to its beta users this week.\n\nReuters reported the use of the TPU chips in June, but Apple did not disclose the full extent of its reliance on Google hardware until Monday's research paper.\n\nGoogle did not return a request for comment, while Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nApple's engineers said in the paper it would be possible to make even larger, more sophisticated models with Google's chips, than the two models it discussed in the paper.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple unveiled a slew of new AI features at its June developer conference, including integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT technology into its software.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company's stock ticked down 0.1% to $218.24 in regular trading on Monday.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

The stock had tumbled after its earnings.\n\nBeyond Microsoft, tech heavyweights Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are set to report earnings on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nOther major earnings are also on tap this week, with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Merck&Company Inc (NYSE:MRK), Procter&Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) due in the coming days.\n\nWall Street indexes were largely unchanged on Monday amid caution ahead of the earnings. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% to 5,463.54 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.1% to 17,370.33 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1% to 40,539.93 points.\n\nFed meeting awaited for more rate cues\n\nMarkets were also on edge before a Fed meeting this week, with the bank widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of the meeting on Wednesday.\n\nBut any signals on when the bank plans to begin cutting rates will be closely watched, given encouraging signs from inflation and positive comments from Fed officials in recent months.\n\nMarkets are pricing in a 25 basis point cut by the Fed in September, according to CME Fedwatch.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStory continues\n\nUS stock futures fall with Fed meeting, mega tech earnings on tap\n\nAd group WPP lines up former BT boss Philip Jansen as its new chair, FT reports\n\nMeta to let users to create custom AI characters\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Wall Street is still jittery on GLP-1s",
        "content": "Wall Street's concerns about GLP-1s' impact on medical device makers and other sectors were back in full swing after glucose monitoring device seller Dexcom (DXCM) slashed its full-year guidance after an earnings miss last week.\n\nHowever, Dexcom's troubles appear unrelated to the weight loss and diabetes drug frenzy, as competitors such as Abbott (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT) haven't been pressured by the miss, once again allaying Wall Street's fears.\n\nThe company attributed its guidance to a fumbled sales strategy.\n\n\"It was a much more disruptive expansion that we've had in the past, and that did lead to a lot of disruption, particularly at the beginning of the quarter. We saw things getting better toward the end,\" said CEO Kevin Sayer on an earnings call.\n\nThe Street previously pressured food and beverage stocks on fears of long-term declines expected from GLP-1 use. That has proven to not be the case, even as the GLP-1 market is expected to reach $130 billion by 2030.\n\nStill, medical device stocks have been through a roller-coaster ride in the past year, in part on Wall Street's reaction to data and updates about GLP-1s.\n\nTake, for example, an announcement in June from Eli Lilly (LLY), maker of the weight-loss drug Zepbound, that its GLP-1 formula helps reduce incidents of sleep apnea. The data showed greater reduction for those who use pressurized breathing masks, known as CPAP machines, but the news still sent stocks of CPAP makers down.\n\nThat includes ResMed (RMD), a leader in the space. CEO Mick Farrell told Yahoo Finance he sees the news as a tailwind rather than a sign of trouble.\n\n\"They're going to bring more patients into my funnel, and we're going to continue to grow,\" Farrell said.\n\nHe sees the opportunity growing further as tech companies like Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Samsung, and the Oura ring offer sleep monitoring software on their devices. This, he said, will bring more awareness about sleep apnea, and therefore more patients.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nUnderpenetrated market\n\nIn the past year, there have been multiple instances of Wall Street predictions dooming sectors based on GLP-1 data, but experts insist the reality is that the potential frenzy has been tamped primarily by supply constraints.\n\nJPM analysts said in a note in August 2023, in response to one company's earnings showing lower volumes of bariatric surgery in a quarter, \"Unless patients commit to using GLP-1s for life, which many aren’t keen to do, they’ll likely still progress to bariatric surgery, which remains extremely underpenetrated.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe idea of being an underpenetrated market holds true for continuous glucose monitoring devices and CPAP machines, along with bariatric surgery. And it's also true for GLP-1s, which have only been available in a limited number of countries and markets to date, as both the market leaders work to add manufacturing capacity.\n\nWall Street jitters haven't spared the GLP-1 makers, either. The current duopoly of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk (NVO) is being threatened by several hundred clinical trials for rival GLP-1s. Among those being closely watched are Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN), Pfizer (PFE), and the biotech Viking Therapeutics (VKTX).\n\nRoche recently announced positive early-stage trial data, while Viking is beginning its final-stage clinical trial — the news within the span of a week sent Eli Lilly's stock diving. It traded down 14% in eight days and lost $120 billion in market value. But the same news didn't drag Novo's stock as much.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "content": "It’s a confusing moment in time for the world of telecommunications. After spending much of the 21st century experiencing rapid growth, many telecom-focused markets are facing sustained periods of saturation.\n\nIn the United States, smartphone shipments declined in the first quarter for the sixth consecutive quarter. Similar levels of saturation impacted global broadband subscriber growth, which reached its slowest rate has been slowing since 2019.\n\nUntil the technology is replaced by something more advanced, there will always be room for these markets. Still, investors should be braced for a more unpredictable future as consumer trends fall out of love with telecommunications markets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWe’re likely to see a major boost for the telecom industry over the coming months. The continued emergence of generative AI will see the technology work alongside the rollout of 5G to offer far greater capabilities for new smartphones.\n\nWhile this will help drive more consumer interest in smartphone markets lacking innovation, its impact on stocks could be uneven.\n\nThe rise of generative AI in the telecom industry will see new winners and losers emerge, and some stocks could be left behind. With this in mind, these three stocks could face a difficult fourth quarter 2024:\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ) An image of a black, red, and glass store front with the red and white \"verizon wireless\" logo on a black sign above the entrance, with a man and a woman walking by.\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike many telecommunications giants, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) has struggled for momentum in recent years.\n\nThe stock enjoyed some steady growth of a little more than 6% over the first half of 2024, but Verizon undid much of its progress in a matter of days after missing its Q2 earnings estimates.\n\nVerizon reported quarterly revenue of $32.8 billion, falling below average analyst expectations for $33.06 billion. The miss was caused by a historically low volume of consumers upgrading their smartphones.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, the telecom provider saw wireless service revenue and broadband growth, but its performance throughout the rest of the year will hinge on the wider smartphone market recovery.\n\nVerizon may have some hope of plotting better revenue growth. The hotly anticipated launch of Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 16 may represent a watershed moment for telecommunications, with the device set to become Apple’s first smartphone featuring generative AI.\n\nHowever, backing Verizon to recover from a smartphone market upturn based on the launch of the new iPhone represents a gamble, making it a big risk for investors holding the stock moving into October.\n\nStory continues\n\nVodafone Group (VOD) Image of Fiber optical connections with servers\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLooking at the stock’s long-term performance, investors could be forgiven for believing that Vodafone Group’s (NASDAQ:VOD) best days are long gone.\n\nThe British firm’s all-time high value came more than 24 years ago in March 2000, and the stock now sits 88% below its historical peak.\n\nOnce the biggest stock in the U.K., Vodafone’s CEO Margherita Della Valle has spent much of 2024 attempting to curb the telecom firm’s decline by selling off Vodafone’s Italian business, halving dividends, and setting up a share buyback scheme.\n\nIn recent weeks, Vodafone has sold a further 10% stake in its former subsidiary and European mobile phone mast firm, Vantage Towers, for $1.4 billion.\n\nWhile this aggressive restructuring plan could ultimately pave the way for a more sustainable business model for Vodafone, investors should expect far greater price volatility throughout the rest of 2024.\n\nLater down the line, Vodafone may offer potential as a long-term hold for investors, but today, it’s more likely to be worth looking into short positions for the stock.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nFollowing an estimate-beating second-quarter earnings call for AT&T (NYSE:T), it’s clear that the telecom giant has a sustainable plan to continue securing subscriber additions for its range of higher-priced plans.\n\nHowever, the telecommunications provider is facing several challenges moving into the rest of the year\n\nAT&T’s mobility equipment revenue fell 8% in the second quarter, missing estimates, as slower smartphone upgrades affected the company.\n\nPerhaps most worryingly, AT&T also recently suffered a significant data breach in which almost all customer call and text records became exposed to hackers.\n\nIn a year that also saw persistent service blackouts block over 92 million voice calls and over 25,000 attempts to call emergency services, AT&T’s shortcomings could ultimately lead to a fine for failing to provide users with access to 911.\n\nFor the rest of 2024, AT&T will face a battle to repair its reputational damage. As a stock that has plenty of potential, we may see the telecom giant offer greater value to investors later down the line, but moving into the fourth quarter, AT&T may be a stock that’s too risky to pick up.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Apple gives developers first taste of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.1 developer beta",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is giving developers an early look at its upcoming Apple Intelligence AI platform with the release of its latest developer betas for iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS on Monday. The betas, called iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia, are the first to include Apple’s highly anticipated Apple Intelligence software, which the company debuted at its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June.\n\nApple’s developer beta program gives app creators access to upcoming versions of the company’s software to test it and incorporate its features into their own apps. Apple also releases public betas for regular users to try its latest software offerings before making them generally available in the fall.\n\nThe company has already debuted developer and public betas for iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. The developer betas released Monday, however, include a host of Apple Intelligence features including Writing Tools, an improved version of Siri that can understand both voice and text inputs, AI options in Mail like email summarizations and Smart Replies, and AI-powered summarization for transcriptions.\n\nApple’s ChatGPT integration and the ability to use Siri to take certain actions in third-party apps will be available in future developer betas. Apple CEO Tim Cook delivers remarks at the start of the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10, 2024 in Cupertino, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nDevelopers will be able to access Apple Intelligence via a new Apple Intelligence and Siri button in their device’s Settings menu. From there, they’ll be able to join a waitlist that should allow them to start using the feature within a few hours. The wait list is necessary because Apple Intelligence uses both on-device and cloud processing, and Apple wants to ensure it doesn’t overwhelm its cloud services by bringing on too many new users at once.\n\nApple’s announcement follows a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman on Sunday indicating that Apple will launch Apple Intelligence in October rather than in September when the company usually debuts its latest iPhone. That means if you buy Apple’s next-generation iPhone, which is expected to be called the iPhone 16, you might need to wait a few weeks before you can use the AI platform.\n\nAccording to Gurman, Apple is taking more time to develop Apple Intelligence, while giving developers additional time to acclimate themselves to the software and build out new features.\n\nApple Intelligence is a massive undertaking for the iPhone maker, bringing some of the biggest changes to its software platforms in years. It will also be the first time many of the company’s users take advantage of generative artificial intelligence technologies. Nailing the delivery and rollout will be essential to ensuring Apple’s millions of users can not only access Apple Intelligence, but actually enjoy using it.\n\nStory continues Apple is bringing generative AI capabilities to Siri, elevating the voice assistant to a more prominent role across its operating systems. (Image: Apple) (Apple)\n\nSome on Wall Street believe Apple Intelligence will be a boon for Apple. Analysts are anticipating that the technology will boost iPhone sales, leading to an elevated upgrade cycle.\n\nApple has made it so that only the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max can run the software, meaning if you have an iPhone 15 or even iPhone 14 Pro, you’ll need to upgrade to an iPhone 15 Pro or newer to use the AI platform.\n\nOther, however, argued that consumers are simply ready to upgrade the phones they purchased around the onset of the pandemic, and that that pent up demand, not Apple Intelligence, will drive a strong sales cycle in the year ahead.\n\nApple will also have to avoid the same kind of embarrassing incidents that have bedeviled rivals like Google, which launched its AI Overviews service for Search only for the software to end up telling users to put glue in their pizza and eat rocks.\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) and long-time collaborator Samsung have also launched generative AI features for their respective smartphones, with Samsung debuting its Galaxy AI alongside its Galaxy S24 line of phones earlier this year, and Google showing off its Pixel 8 with AI capabilities in Oct. 2023.\n\nGoogle is also set to debut its next-generation Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro Fold phones during an event at its headquarters on Aug. 13. The company is widely expected to focus on how its generative AI software will improve the overall user experience for its devices. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "Perion Network PERI is slated to release its second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 31.\r\n\r\nFor the second quarter, PERI expects revenues of $106-$108 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $106.98 million, suggesting a decline of 40.06% from the year-ago quarter’s levels.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for second-quarter 2024 earnings is pegged at 22 cents per share, unchanged in the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nPerion’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 9.02%.\n\nPerion Network Ltd Price and EPS Surprise Perion Network Ltd Price and EPS Surprise\n\nPerion Network Ltd price-eps-surprise | Perion Network Ltd Quote\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nPerion’s second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from its digital advertising industry, driven by its diversified product portfolio across various advertising channels, including search, CTV (Connected TV) and retail media.\r\n\r\nPerion’s retail media solutions have shown substantial growth, increasing by 134% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2024. This sector is likely to have continued its positive trajectory, driven by both organic growth and the integration of digital out-of-home advertising solutions.\r\n\r\nThe Connected TV (CTV) advertising segment experienced a remarkable 108% growth year-over-year in the first quarter of 2024. This trend is expected to have persisted as more customers adopt Perion's high-impact CTV solutions, such as live and dynamic CTV, branded CTV, and pause ads.\r\n\r\nThe programmatic digital out-of-home advertising sector registered 25% year-over-year growth. This growth is fueled by the strategic acquisition of HiveStack, which enhanced Perion’s capabilities in this area. The increasing adoption of programmatic technologies in out-of-home advertising is likely to have driven further growth.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of SORT 2.0, an AI-based audience segmentation technology, enhances targeting capabilities for web and CTV, offering privacy-focused targeting to connect with receptive audiences. The Wave AI-based dynamic audio technology, now expanded to new verticals and multi-language capabilities, is expected to have driven engagement and sales.\r\n\r\nDespite changes in Microsoft’s MSFT advertising pricing strategies, Perion’s search activity grew by 26% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nThe ongoing collaboration and revenue-sharing model with Microsoft is expected to have continued boosting the top line. \r\n\r\nHowever, PERI expects a decline in search advertising revenues in the next quarter due to recent changes in Microsoft Bing’s advertising pricing and mechanisms, including its decision to exclude a number of publishers from its search distribution marketplace.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

        "content": "Fair Isaac FICO is scheduled to report its third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jul 31.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $448.53 million, suggesting an increase of 12.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $6.37 per share, down by a penny over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nThe company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missing the same on two occasions, the average negative surprise being 2.24%.\n\nFair Isaac Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Fair Isaac Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nFair Isaac Corporation price-eps-surprise | Fair Isaac Corporation Quote\n\nLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nFICO’s fiscal third-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from strong growth in its scores and software solutions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter 2024 scores revenues is pegged at $241 million, indicating 19.3% year-over-year growth.\r\n\r\nThe Scores segment, particularly in mortgage originations, continues to show robust growth. The strong adoption of FICO Score 10T for non-conforming mortgages and the planned rollout of FICO Score 10T for conforming mortgages is likely to have contributed to this segment’s continued growth.\r\n\r\nFICO’s software business, which includes both on-premises and SaaS offerings, is expected to have benefited from its “land-and-expand” strategy. The increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and Net Revenue Retention (NRR) for platform and non-platform solutions indicates a positive trend. The expansion driven by increased customer usage and platform offerings will likely continue to fuel growth.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for third-quarter fiscal 2024 on-premises and SaaS software revenues is pegged at $185 million, indicating a 7.55% year-over-year increase.\r\n\r\nThe company is heavily investing in innovation, particularly in its FICO platform. The recent FICO World event showcased advancements like an open API framework, a FICO marketplace and a more collaborative, composable ecosystem. These innovations are expected to have driven greater adoption and usage of FICO’s solutions, leading to increased customer satisfaction and expanded use cases.\r\n\r\nA strong product portfolio and an expanding partner base are expected to have driven top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

        "title": "Apple reportedly in talks for an ad-supported tier of Apple TV+",
        "content": "Apple may be looking to ad an ad-supported tier to its Apple TV+ streaming service, but U.S. users aren’t likely to see any changes anytime soon.\n\nThe Telegraph reports Apple has met with the Broadcaster's Audience Research Board, the U.K.’s television ratings organization, about bringing advertising to Apple TV+ in that country. There are no reports that the company plans to unveil an ad-supported tier in the U.S., however.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment on the report.\n\nApple TV+ already has some commercials on its service, but only for live sporting events like Major League Soccer. Unlike Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and virtually every other streaming service, though, it does not offer a lower-cost ad-supported monthly option for subscribers. (Those additional offerings have proven quite popular with users, resulting in higher subscriber counts.)\n\nApple has taken some steps in recent months that indicate it is considering an ad-supported subscription model, however. Earlier this year, the company hired Joseph Cady, who previously servied as EVP of advanced advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal. That came after a number of prominent hires of people with experience in television advertising.\n\nAd-supported tiers not only have boosted subscriber counts for other streaming services, they’re a good source of additional revenue for the companies.\n\nThe news of a possible ad-supported tier comes as Apple TV+ is also reportedly talking with Paramount+ about a possible bundle of their streaming services. As subscriber churn has continued to be a problem for many streamers (and viewers have grown weary of the cost of these services), a growing number are teaming up to offer lower-priced options to consumers. Just last week, Disney+, Hulu, and Max unveiled a bundle that offered savings of up to 38% over the stand-alone pricing of those services for viewers.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Costco Is Beyond Overvalued",
        "content": "Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ:COST) has been an investing darling for as long as I can remember. It has also been a darling for shoppers as they have some of the strongest brand loyalty in the market. I know firsthand as I am a card-carrying member of its club and happily pay the membership fee every year to shop in its warehouses. No one can beat its rotisserie chickens, toilet paper and giant box of spinach.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with COST.\n\nThis is not a shopping blog, so let's jump into the company and stock. Costco has been performing wonderfully over the last 12 months, especially compared to its peers. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nCOST Data by GuruFocusIts GF Score is also very high at 90 out of 100. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nLet's dive in to figure out what is driving this performance.\n\nEPS growth is outpacing competition\n\nCostco's three-year growth rate of earnings per share without nonrecurring items was over 16%, which is better than most companies in its sector and the best in its peer group. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nWhat has been driving this growth? I will examine revenue and then costs to figure out what is happening.\n\nRevenue grew post-pandemic\n\nCostco views itself as a single segment company, but it does break out revenue into something called Core Merchandise Categories. Here are those categories:\n\nFood and Sundries - These include sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor and tobacco. Fresh Foods - This includes meat, produce, service deli and bakery items. Warehouse Ancillary and Other Businesses - This includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, tires, business centers and travel. Membership Fees - Fees that members pay to gain access to Costco warehouses. Non-Foods - This is everything else that includes things like appliances, electronics, sporting goods, toys, apparel, furniture, housewares and jewelry (and much more).\n\nBelow is a chart showing the sales growth in each of these categories going back the last few years. Please note that the fourth quarter (quarter ending in August) is longer than the other quarters, which is why there is a jump. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nThe growth is positive but has been declining slightly each quarter. The only exception was in the Warehouse Ancillary and Other Businesses Segment, where the growth rate plummeted from highs in 2022 (this is not in the chart to make it more readable for the other segments). This was largely due to increased travel in 2022 compared to 2021 as Covid-19 travel restrictions were lifted worldwide.\n\nIs Costco growing by adding warehouses or by increasing revenue in its existing locations? The chart below shows that most of the revenue growth is from existing warehouses rather than opening new locations.\n\nStory continues Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nThis is great as it shows Costco is able to grow organically. However, sales, while still positive, are growing less than a few years ago. Analysts are expecting positive sales growth going forward. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nCOST Data by GuruFocus\n\nHowever, they also expect growth to be slightly above 5%, which continues the worrying trend of a declining growth rate.\n\nCosts are steadily rising with revenue\n\nCostco breaks up its operating costs into merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative. Merchandise costs are the costs associated with purchasing the products that are sold in its warehouses. Selling, general and administrative are the costs associated with running the warehouses, such as salaries and benefits paid to employees, marketing expenses or utilities.\n\nOver the last few years, the operating expense as a percentage of sales has been very stable. Merchandise expenses hover around 87% of revenue while SG&A is between 8% and 9%.\n\nOperating income is increasing, but volatile\n\nGrowing revenue with a commensurate increase in costs will lead to an increase in operating income, which Costco has done the last few years. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nHowever, revenue growing at differing rates each quarter has led to operating income growth being all over the place. This is not necessarily a bad thing. I would certainly prefer volatile positive growth over stable negative growth. Even with the volatility, Costco has led its peer group in Ebitda growth over the last few years. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nROE is one of the highest in the industry\n\nCostco's return on equity is one of the major selling points for investors Currently, it is higher than almost 90% of other companies in the industry and 3 times higher than the industry median. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nUsing the five-step Dupont analysis can provide more information on why the company's ROE is so high. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nCostco's net margin is low at just shy of 3%. However, retail is an industry with really tight margins, so it is actually better than the industry median. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nWe do not have an industry-level equity multiplier, but we can use the equity-to-asset ratio as a proxy since that is just the inverse of the equity multiplier. Here, Costco is a little behind the industry median, but it is not so far off to be a cause for concern. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nWhere Costco really stands out is asset turnover. Compared to its peers, the retailer is way ahead of everyone else with an asset turnover that is 20% higher than second place, BJ's Wholesale (NYSE:BJ). Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nThis all sounds great, so what is the problem?\n\nValuation ratios are at all-time highs\n\nCostco's valuation ratios are screaming overvalued at the moment. Just pick one out of a hat, throw it in a chart and you will see it is near anall-time high. Below is a chart showing the price-earnings ratio and it is not pretty. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nCOST Data by GuruFocus\n\nCompared to its peers, Costco's price-earnings ratio is significantly higher at 3 times the industry median. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nThe PEG ratio, which incorporates expected growth, is not any better, and is also 3 times the industry median. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nTo put all of this into perspective, Costco's current price-earnings ratio is higher than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and has a similar price-earnings ratio to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Costco is great, but its growth prospects are not even close to these other companies.\n\nThe company's price-earnings ratio over the last 10 years has averaged around 33. Costco's management does not issue guidance, so I will use analyst estimates instead. Analysts are expecting earnings per share of $16.24 for fiscal year 2025. Multipling 33 by that EPS gives a target price of $535, which is significantly below current price levels.Time to take some profits\n\nCostco's growth has been impressive. Throw in an industry-leading ROE with incredible brand loyalty and the company looks like a slam dunk for investors.\n\nHowever, the price movement has gone a little crazy the last couple of years and valuation ratios are way too high. If I was looking to invest in Costco, I would sit on the sidelines and wait for the price to come back down to Earth. If you already are a Costco investor, it probably makes sense to sell some shares and lock in those profits.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Stay Ahead of the Game With Apple (AAPL) Q3 Earnings: Wall Street's Insights on Key Metrics",
        "content": "The upcoming report from Apple (AAPL) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $1.34 per share, indicating an increase of 6.4% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $84.02 billion, representing an increase of 2.7% year over year.\n\nThe current level reflects an upward revision of 0.1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as a yardstick to evaluate the company's quarterly performance, scrutinizing analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics can offer a more comprehensive perspective.\n\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some Apple metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Revenue- Wearables, Home and Accessories' to come in at $7.51 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -9.3% year over year.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- iPhone' should arrive at $38.74 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -2.3% year over year.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Net Sales- Services' will likely reach $24.00 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +13.1%.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Revenue- Mac' will reach $6.92 billion. The estimate points to a change of +1.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Net Sales- Products' will reach $60.06 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -0.9% year over year.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Revenue- iPad' to reach $6.88 billion. The estimate points to a change of +18.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Geographic Revenue- Greater China' reaching $15.19 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -3.6% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Geographic Revenue- Europe' stands at $20.65 billion. The estimate points to a change of +2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Geographic Revenue- Rest of Asia Pacific' of $6.11 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +8.4% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Geographic Revenue- Japan' should come in at $5.26 billion. The estimate points to a change of +9.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Geographic Revenue- Americas' will reach $36.39 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +2.9% year over year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Gross margin- Services' at $17.44 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $14.97 billion in the same quarter last year.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Apple here>>>\r\n\r\nShares of Apple have demonstrated returns of +3.5% over the past month compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Thinks Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Has Run ‘Too Much’",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation.Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a program last week tried to make sense of the decline in tech stocks, saying companies with the “best fundamentals” got “hammered once again.”\n\n“I did not expect that to happen.”\n\nCramer said that sometimes it’s difficult to own the “winners.” The CNBC host said it’s important to understand the bear cases around stocks otherwise you will never know what “you are up against.”\n\nJim Cramer tried to find out whether the latest decline in top tech stocks was just a “periodic selloff” that presented an “opportunity.”\n\n“When we get this kind of rotation, you never know whether these stocks are selling off because there’s something wrong or because they are up huge.”\n\nJim Cramer pointed to a caveat when it comes to holding winning stocks. When you have the losers, there are no profits, but when you own winners in your portfolio, you can see losses because people want to take some profits off the table, Cramer said.\n\nThe CNBC host said when top stocks go down, people holding those in their portfolios often end up thinking about whether they should also sell these stocks and if something has “changed.”\n\n“From what I can tell you, nothing has changed about the stocks we are going talk about tonight. But it is true that the stocks are a heck of a lot more expensive than they were one year ago.”\n\nIn this article, we took a look at some top tech stocks that fell last week and explained the reasons they lost value according to Jim Cramer. We also discussed these companies’ fundamentals and hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Jim Cramer Talking About Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Falling Stock Amid Latest Market Rotation?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program said people were selling Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock in April when it was trading at around $165 saying the new iPhone won’t resonate. But when Apple revealed its AI features at the WWDC event, the stock came “roaring” back, Cramer said. But then why the stock recently went down? Cramer said that Apple recently “peaked” at $230 and has run too much.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I think that’s what’s ailing it.”\n\nCramer also believes the anti-China “rhetoric” from Donald Trump is also a factor affecting Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares because “they have big China business.”\n\nDoes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) have any AI growth catalysts? Wall Street is turning bullish on the company after Apple revealed Apple Intelligence plans at the WWDC event.\n\nMorgan Stanley expects Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to ship nearly 500 million iPhones in the next two years, marking a 6% increase from the FY21-FY22 cycle. Morgan Stanley said this growth can boost the annual iPhone average selling price (ASP) by 5%, leading to nearly $485 billion in revenue and $8.70 in earnings per share by FY26, exceeding consensus estimates by 7-9%.\n\nWall Street is expecting a new AI-powered refresh cycle for iPhones because it’s been years since millions of users upgraded their iPhones. Wedbush recently said 270 million, of 1.5 billion iPhones, have not upgraded in 4+ years\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also training Siri based on its own language models. These smaller models run on devices, handling various daily tasks, with Apple revealing its on-device model has 3 billion parameters. For more complex tasks, a larger language model runs on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) private servers, though its size is undisclosed and likely smaller than current large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-4, which has around 1.8 trillion parameters.\n\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also contributed to performance after unveiling its AI strategy to its software developers. The Company has been at the forefront of proprietary computer processor development for over a decade. Given the compute-intensive nature of AI applications, Apple is well-situated to develop a suite of compelling, consumer-friendly AI services that are also cost-effective. While revenue growth has been relatively flat post-Covid-19, we expect Apple’s AI value proposition will be compelling enough for consumers to continue growing their engagement in the Apple ecosystem over the next several years.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Hero to Zero: 3 Stocks at 52-Week Highs to Sell Now",
        "content": "Warren Buffett’s favorite market indicator is signaling the stock market has reached the top. By comparing the value of the market to the size of the economy, you get an idea of where stock valuations stand, especially for stocks at 52-week highs.\n\nBuffett once noted the indicator was “probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.” Today, it suggests the stock market is bloated. MarketWatch recently ran the numbers and found the ratio above 2.0, which is a level last seen in 2022. Recall, that was the year the market significantly retraced the gains it had made following the pandemic.\n\nAlthough MarketWatch noted Buffett doesn’t follow the metric anymore, it is still a useful way to gauge if the market is topping out. Investors should proceed with caution when buying stocks, particularly those at 52-week highs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEven though the S&P 500 has pulled back from its all-time high in recent weeks, several stocks continue to push forward. Some are even setting new all-time highs of their own. Thus, the three companies below are stocks at 52-week highs or very close to their peak.\n\nNow might be a good time to sell.\n\nWalmart (WMT) An image of a large tan Walmart store front on a bright clear day with empty handicap parking spaces, trees, bushes, and blue poles in front and a large white \"Walmart\" sign and logo with six yellow lines forming a circle above the entrance.\n\nSource: Tupungato / Shutterstock.com\n\nRetail king Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is on a tear. Shares are at an all-time high of over $70 a stub. First-quarter results were strong with revenue rising 6% year-over-year as both its domestic and international markets expanded. That allowed the retailer to easily surpass analyst earnings estimates, posting profits of 60 cents per share.\n\nWith the business firing on all cylinders, why sell? Higher margin goods are coming under pressure and after decades of expansion, Walmart may be reaching a saturation point in the U.S. That will require the retailer to focus more attentively on its e-commerce operations where it remains large and growing but comes nowhere near Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It is also a much more competitive market.\n\nWhile Walmart is in second place with a 6.4% share, it trails far behind the leader at well over 37%. Third place Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is quickly growing and has a 3.6% share, according to Statista. Walmart is not likely to gain much ground on its rival, and as its digital footprint grows, it will face more margin pressure on those higher margin items that have carried it. The physical side of the business could also see smaller rivals nip off business around the edges.\n\nInvitation Homes (INVH) Residential neighborhood subdivision skyline Aerial shot\n\nSource: TDKvisuals / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvitation Homes (NASDAQ:INVH) is the largest single-family rental real estate investment trust (REIT). Focusing on the new homes market in the starter home and move-up niche, Invitation’s economies of scale have allowed its stock to hit a new 52-week high of just under $37 a share.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet it may have reached its limit. Because it has used its size and the demand for rental homes to quickly raise rates, it may have priced many people out of the market.\n\nInvitation Homes just reported second-quarter results that saw revenue rise 9% but net income plummeted 47% to 12 cents per share and occupancy rates slightly decreased. It still stands at 97.5% but it indicates this could be a trend as renters are tapped out on paying higher costs.\n\nThe homebuilder market also continues to slide. Single-family housing starts fell 2.2% in June, an eight-month low, while building permits declined 2.3%, the lowest point in a year. It was especially acute in the Northeast and West, which is a problem for Invitation, as 37% of its homes are located in the western part of the U.S. This signals a growing problem for Invitation stock.\n\nSpotify Technology (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) logo is on the screen of a smartphone with headphones plugged in.\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe world’s leading music streaming service Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) recently soared to a new all-time high of $346 per share after second-quarter revenue jumped 20% from last year. Total monthly active users (MAUs) rose 14% to 626 million but more importantly, premium subscribers jumped 12% to 246 million.\n\nLike Walmart, it raises the question of why sell now? While digital delivery of music and podcasts is likely to continue growing, Spotify will have to continue paying up for rights to the music. A small cabal of record labels controls 80% of the content thus, the oligopoly will be able to use its leverage to maintain pricing advantages by increasing costs.\n\nSpotify also faces significant competitive pressure from the likes of Apple, Amazon and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Because streaming is not their primary profit driver, they can run their businesses at break-even rates or even a loss.\n\nAmazon Music, for example, is a side benefit of its Prime member loyalty program, though it does also offer a premium service. Apple Music and Apple Podcasts, which has a 21% share of the market, likely will not lose many subscribers to Spotify as its customers tend to stay within its ecosystem. Even bigger is iHeartMedia (NASDAQ:IHRT) with a 24% share for its iHeartRadio platform, according to eMarketer. Some 33% of people also get their music from YouTube.\n\nWith Spotify stock trading at 40 times projected earnings, it is a rich premium to pay even for the industry leader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The S&P 500 fell by 0.8%, while the Nasdaq dropped 2.1%, with both indexes recording back-to-back weekly declines for the first time since April.\n\nLooking ahead to this week, key economic data releases this week include the JOLTS job openings report on Tuesday, the ISM manufacturing index on Thursday, and the employment report on Friday.\n\nThe July FOMC meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, with the much-anticipated post-meeting statement set to be released at 2:00 PM ET, followed by Chair Powell’s press conference at 2:30 PM.\n\n“We think the July Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that concludes Wednesday will signal that the Fed is on track to cut soon and open the door to a cut in September but will stop short of explicitly pre-signaling a rate reduction at that following meeting,” Evercore ISI strategists said in a note.\n\n“We believe Powell will wait until Jackson Hole end August – by which time the Fed will have another month’s data – to deliver the explicit September cut signal,” they added.\n\nIt's that week of the Q2 earnings season\n\nApart from the FOMC’s statement, much of the market’s attention this week will be directed toward the Big Tech earnings results, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) all set to report in the coming days.\n\nWall Street analysts and investors are eager to gain insights into these tech giants' latest AI-driven capital spending and key trends in both enterprise and consumer technology expenditures.\n\nFor Apple, Barclays analysts expect a more favorable outlook for the September quarter, leading to upward revisions in estimates for iPhone, Mac, and Services, as well as their projections for fiscal 2025.\n\nThey said feedback from its Asia checks suggests better-than-expected September-quarter builds, with IP16 production in the low 20 million range. Late cycle demand for IP15 Pro models has slightly improved following WWDC due to their AI compatibility.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The stock has already run in anticipation of iPhones bottoming and the upcoming ramp of AI features,” analysts added.\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nOppenheimer: \"We remain positive on equities and continue to see fixed-income securities as complimentary to stocks in providing portfolio diversification. Some near-term profit-taking in the day-to-day action of the market particularly in segments of the market that have had exceptional run-ups since last year into this year should be expected and continues to appear to us quite normal. Such activity combined with a process of rebalancing and rotation into other segments of the stock market in our view can be healthy and should contribute to the broadening of the markets’ progress that began last year and becomes more evident in the second half of this year.\"\n\nUBS: “Following an impressive run since late last year, investors have increasingly become concerned about the pace and timing of artificial intelligence (AI) revenue and what it may mean for continued investments in AI infrastructure. With results still due from some big firms this week, market volatility is likely to continue. But we think the tech sector should find support in the coming weeks and resume its leadership. In fact, the recent pullback creates a re-entry opportunity, in our view, especially for those companies with strong earnings growth visibility.\"\n\nBTIG: “We can probably drift a bit higher on SPX towards its gap at 5550, before moving lower to fill a gap at 5375. Internally, the rotations remain vicious. The 12-day rate-of-change for RTY vs. NDX is over 20%. Since 1985, that ranks as the 5th biggest such move ever, only eclipsed by a few days in December 2000 and Jan. 2nd, 2001. Tactically we think a 'reversal of that reversion' is likely, with semis (SMH) oversold into support while homebuilders (ITB) are overbought and rallying on anticpated rate cuts, when in fact higher rates were part of their bull thesis over the last couple of years. We are also seeing breakouts among the defensive stocks, and areas like staples, utlities, REITs, and healthcare all look strong.\"\n\nStrategas: \"On average, the market bottoms 213 days later and 23% lower after the first Fed cut in a series of rate cuts. S&P 500 operating earnings decline by about 10% on average in the 12 months following the first easing. In short, be careful what you wish for when it comes to an easing of monetary policy. There is, naturally, a chance, broadly supported by recent policy, that policymakers have decided to effectively “outlaw” recessions. While it seems appealing, such an approach makes it difficult to control inflation. What we don’t know is whether the fact that President Biden is not seeking reelection weakens his resolve or urgency in providing stimulus for the broader economy in the months leading up to the election.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEarnings call: Eni aims for growth and net zero by 2030 amid strategic divestments\n\nEarnings call: ASE Technology sees mixed Q2 results, plans expansion\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com — As all eyes focus on the several mega-cap giants expected to report this week, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it's the value play that's stealing the Q2 earnings season show.\n\nFlying below the radar of most headlines, several of these stocks have gathered significant momentum and are now posting incredible financial results, leading to a repricing of their shares.\n\nBut if finding winners among mega-cap names can be tricky, finding them among lesser-known stocks can be even harder.\n\nNot to our premium users, though, who, for less than $8 a month, have been scoring incredible results on our AI-powered list of value plays for July.\n\nSuch is the case of Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) and Centene Corp (NYSE:CNC), both picked by our AI in July. After posting incredible earnings beats on Friday, they rallied a massive 16.8% and 8.6%, respectively, providing our users with chunky gains.\n\nThese rallies add to the phenomenal list of winning picks for Q2 earnings season so far. Just to name a few of our winners from last week alone:\n\nCharter Communications: +16.9% after reporting. Pool Corporation (NASDAQ:POOL): +10% after reporting. Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH): +9.2% after reporting. Darling Ingredients (NYSE:DAR): +7.2T% after reporting. Manhattan Associates Inc (NASDAQ:MANH): +8.4% after reporting. CNC: +8.6% after reporting.\n\nHonestly, when was the last time you picked so many huge gainers in a single week? (And to be fair, it was not a particularly good week for the broader market.)\n\nBut wait - it gets even better. What if I told you that the bulk of our picks are yet to report in the week ahead?\n\nDon't miss out on these incredible value winners - get'em while they're still cheap by subscribing to our flagship Top Value stock strategy for less than $8 a month using this link.\n\nIn fact, since the start of the month, our Top Value strategy is up a fantastic 4.9%, while the benchmark S&P 500 shed -0.3%, mainly due to the amount of big names weighing the index down.\n\nBut how do we do it?\n\nUnlike other systems, our AI identifies undervalued stocks before they become too expensive. Instead of relying solely on momentum models, our approach integrates decades of comprehensive stock market fundamental and technical analysis a multitude of data sets.\n\nThat's how our composed Tech Titans strategy managed to simply obliterate the market since our official launch in November last year (numbers as of premarket today):\n\nStory continues\n\nTech Titans: +80.69% S&P 500: 28.82%\n\nThis is no backtest; this is real-world performance, unfolded in real time to our users' benefit.\n\nActually, our backtest suggests that going for the long run will give you even heftier gains. See chart below for reference: \r\nSource: ProPicks\n\nThis means a $100K principal in our strategy would have turned into an eye-popping $1,879,800K by now.\n\nAs earnings season kicks into high gear, will you keep on guessing or have an insight into the winners?\n\nFor less than $8 a month, that decision has never been easier. *And since you made it all the way to the bottom of this article, we'll give you a special 10% extra discount on all our plans with the coupon code PROPICKS2024!\n\nRelated Articles\n\nValue plays are crushing Q2 earnings season\n\nInvestment firm Sixth Street to acquire Enstar in $5.1 billion deal\n\nMcDonald's posts surprise drop in quarterly global sales as spending slows\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures rise at the start of a week that includes several major central bank meetings, including the Federal Reserve, as well as earnings from key tech companies. Apple is taking its time incorporating artificial intelligence features into its key products, while the European corporate results season also continues.\n\n1. Fed leads central bank parade this week\n\nThe spotlight this week will be on central banks, with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan all set to hold policy meetings.\n\nThe Fed concludes its July policy meeting on Wednesday, and is widely expected to maintain its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, as it has done since last July.\n\nHowever, markets are overwhelmingly expecting a September rate cut, especially after Friday’s personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s favorite gauge of inflation, showed signs of cooling prices.\n\nThus the statement by Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be studied carefully to see if he sets the stage for a rate cut at the next meeting.\n\nThe Bank of Japan concludes its latest policy setting meeting on Wednesday, and speculation over the prospect of a rate hike is mounting despite a fragile economy and weak consumer sentiment.\n\nThe Bank of England meets on Thursday amid a great deal of uncertainty over whether policymakers will deliver their first rate cut since 2020.\n\nLast month, the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to keep rates on hold, but this decision is expected to be more finely balanced with policymakers having to judge between higher-than-expected service price inflation and weak growth.\n\n2. Futures rise ahead of Fed meeting, earnings\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Monday at the start of a week dominated by a Federal Reserve meeting as well as a number of key corporate earnings.\n\nBy 04:05 ET (08:05 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 60 points, or 0.2%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 12 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 70 points, or 0.4%.\n\nThe major indices slipped lower last week, with the Nasdaq Composite hit hard, in particular, by the cooling off of the tech trade.\n\nBig Tech earnings are set to continue in the coming days, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday, followed by Facebook-parent Meta (NASDAQ:META) on Wednesday and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as well as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday.\n\nDisappointing numbers could reignite the worries that caused a bruising selloff last week, with the Nasdaq suffering its worst day since late 2022 on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Apple’s AI plans take time\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking longer than expected including its recently unveiled artificial intelligence features, known as Apple Intelligence, into its flagship iPhone and iPad devices, and they will not be included in an initial software update, according to a report by Bloomberg.\n\nApple’s AI plans will miss the initial September releases of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, the Bloomberg report showed, but should be included with the October updates.\n\nThe company had in June unveiled a slew of new AI-powered features for its flagship devices, hoping the seemingly insatiable demand for all things AI would help the firm offset steadily slowing sales of its flagship iPhone.\n\nApple is set to report its June quarter earnings later this week, and is expected to log a sustained decline in device sales amid increased competition and saturation in the smartphone market.\n\n4. Heineken writes down Chinese investment’s value\n\nThere are also earnings in Europe to digest, as the second-quarter results season continues.\n\nHeineken (AS:HEIN) shares slumped 7% after the world’s second-largest brewer missed half-year estimates and announced a hefty impairment, as it wrote down the value of its 40% stake in China Resources Beer.\n\nThat said, Heineken also raised its full-year profit guidance, expecting to deliver organic operating profit growth of between 4% and 8% in 2024, compared to its previous guidance of between low and high single-digit growth.\n\nPhilips (AS:PHG) stock rose 10% after the Dutch medical device maker reported second-quarter results that beat expectations, boosted by higher earnings, the implementation of its restructuring program and insurance income linked to its Respironics product liability claims.\n\nPearson (LON:PSON) stock fell 3.5% after the educational publisher posted a drop in pretax profit compared with a year earlier, even as the company said it is on track to meet full-year expectations.\n\n5. Crude gains on raised Middle East tensions\n\nCrude prices rose Monday on concerns of a widening conflict in the Middle East, potentially impacting global supply, after a deadly rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.\n\nBy 04:05 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.1% to $77.20 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $80.38 a barrel.\n\nThe weekend’s strike reportedly killed at least 12 people, and has been blamed by both Israel and the U.S. on Iran-backed Hezbollah, who have denied responsibility for the attack.\n\nIsrael has vowed retaliation against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Israeli jets hit targets in southern Lebanon on Sunday.\n\nThese increasing tensions are also seen diminishing the prospect of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, as hopes of a ceasefire in Gaza had been gaining momentum.\n\nStill, gains are limited as the outlook for crude demand remains bleak.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCentral bank meetings, Apple, corporate earnings - what's moving markets\n\nTake Five: Scores on the doors for Big Tech\n\nJapan to achieve primary budget surplus next year, govt estimate shows\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple's upcoming release of new artificial intelligence (AI) tools is now expected to occur later than originally expected, coming after the initial launch of the new iOS 18 software for iPhone and iPads, according to a report.\n\nBloomberg News reported Sunday that Apple plans to launch Apple Intelligence in a batch of software updates slated for release in October, which will come a few weeks after the initial releases of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 in September. Other Apple Intelligence features are still planned to be released near the end of 2024 and in early 2025.\n\nThe company is expected to make Apple Intelligence available to software developers for the first time as early as this week, which will give them the opportunity to test the software on the beta versions of iOS and iPadOS 18.1, the report said.\n\nBloomberg added that concerns about the stability of Apple Intelligence features contributed to the decision to split its rollout from the launch of the new iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 operating systems.\n\nAPPLE UNVEILS 'APPLE INTELLIGENCE' AT THE WWDC Apple reportedly pushed back the release of Apple Intelligence from September to November.\n\nApple Intelligence uses generative AI to create text, images and other content for users on command. It will be available on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPad and Mac devices with the company's M1 chip and later versions.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nIt also prioritizes certain notifications, features an updated Siri and offers tools that can use AI to summarize content like web pages and voice notes – as well as offering iPhone Mirroring on MacOS Sequoia which allows the phone's screen to be viewed and interacted with on Mac computers.\n\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?\n\nApple announced its plans for Apple Intelligence at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June and touted the new capabilities it will bring to iPhones and iPads as it looks to boost sales of new devices that had been sagging. Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the company's new Apple Intelligence features at the Worldwide Developers Conference.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.\n\nThe report about the delay of Apple Intelligence comes after Apple pushed back the launch of three new AI features because of newly implemented tech regulations in the European Union that require companies to ensure rival products and services can function on its devices.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Apple's new AI features to be delayed after iOS 18 release: report\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Sunday as focus turned to an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting for more cues on interest rate cuts.\n\nFocus was also squarely on a string of June-quarter earnings from Wall Street’s biggest companies, such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which are due in the coming days.\n\nWall Street indexes had rebounded sharply on Friday after PCE price index data- which is the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge- read mostly within expectations for June, driving up optimism that the central bank will begin cutting rates in September.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.2% to 5,512.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.4% to 19,244.50 points by 19:40 ET (00:40 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 40,931.0 points.\n\nFed meeting set to provide rate cut clarity\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nBut any signals from the central bank on when it plans to begin cutting interest rates will be closely watched, amid increasing signs that inflation had cooled in recent months.\n\nA slew of Fed officials also said in recent addresses that the central bank was gaining more confidence in its battle against inflation, and that it did not need to see inflation reaching its 2% annual target to begin cutting rates.\n\nGeneral consensus is that the Fed will keep rates steady this week, but potentially offer signals on a September rate cut. Traders were seen pricing in a 25 basis point cut by the Fed in September, CME Fedwatch showed.\n\nApple, Microsoft set to report earnings\n\nEarnings reports from some of Wall Street’s biggest companies are on tap this week, with Microsoft and Apple set to report on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nOther tech majors including Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) are also set to report earnings through the week.\n\nThe results come in the wake of an extended rout in technology stocks, as the sector was walloped by profit-taking and as expectations of rate cuts saw investors pivot into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nUnderwhelming earnings from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) last week also sparked increased caution ahead of the tech earnings, with investors waiting to see whether increased investment in artificial intelligence was bearing fruit.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.1% to 5,459.10 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 1% to 17,357.88 points on Friday.

        "title": "Apple Intelligence to Miss Initial Launch of Upcoming iOS 18 Overhaul",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s upcoming artificial intelligence features will arrive later than anticipated, missing the initial launch of its upcoming iPhone and iPad software overhauls but giving the company more time to fix bugs.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHarris’ Running-Mate Search Zeroes In on Three Top Contenders Trump’s Campaign Against Harris Is Like Him: Old and Tired That Sudden Market Drop Was Scary for Investors But Long Overdue Trump Gets Upstaged by RFK Jr.’s Claims of ‘Bitcoin Fort Knox’ Casino Tycoon’s Son Builds His Own Fortune With E-Sports IPO\n\nThe company is planning to begin rolling out Apple Intelligence to customers as part of software updates coming by October, according to people with knowledge of the matter. That means the AI features will arrive a few weeks after the initial iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 releases planned for September, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing unannounced release details.\n\nStill, the iPhone maker is planning to make Apple Intelligence available to software developers for the first time for early testing as soon as this week via iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 betas, they added. The strategy is atypical as the company doesn’t usually release previews of follow-up updates until around the time the initial version of the new software generation is released publicly.\n\nThe stakes are higher than usual. In order to ensure a smooth consumer release of its big bet on AI, Apple needs support from developers to help iron out issues and test features on a wider scale. Concerns over the stability of Apple Intelligence features, in part, led the company to split the features from the initial launch of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18.\n\nApple announced the new features and operating systems in June at its Worldwide Developers Conference, saying Apple Intelligence would debut as part of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. The new timing means the AI capabilities won’t be widely launched until a subsequent update to the new operating system. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe tech giant launched a fourth beta of iOS 18.0 to developers last week and is aiming to complete development by the end of July. When Apple introduces new iPhones each September, the company includes the accompanying new software. That necessitates finishing the operating system several weeks earlier so there is time to install the software on the devices before shipping them out of the factory.\n\nThe release plan for Apple Intelligence presents the possibility that the first iPhone 16 models shipped to consumers this year will lack the new AI features and require a software update weeks later. Apple Intelligence includes a range of features, including prioritization of key notifications, web page and voice note summaries, tools to improve writing, a revamp to Siri and integration of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven when Apple Intelligence launches with iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1, it will be missing some features. That includes some of the most significant changes to Siri, such as the ability to use on-device data to help field queries and for the system to use what is on a person’s screen to provide context for answers.\n\nThe company is planning to roll out its full set of Apple Intelligence features via multiple updates to iOS 18 across the end of 2024 and through the first half of 2025, Bloomberg News has reported. Beyond the iPhone and iPad, Apple Intelligence will come to its Mac computers with in-house Apple chips as part of macOS Sequoia. It’s also in development for the Vision Pro, but a release for that device isn’t planned until later.\n\nThe technology giant is betting on Apple Intelligence to help compete in the generative AI space that has taken the world by storm and upended both businesses and consumer devices over the past year. By limiting support to the iPhone 15 Pro from last year and the upcoming iPhone 16 line, Apple also believes the new features could help sell new iPhones this year.\n\nThe iPhone 16 line will have little in the way of design changes so software-related enhancements — in addition to a new button for controlling the camera and a faster chip — will do the heavy lifting to sell the new models.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Miseducation of America’s Nurse Practitioners Joe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy’s New Kingmaker Disney Bets on Deadpool, Wolverine and Dirty Jokes to Save Marvel The $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into The US Economy Is Slowing, Which Is Just Fine With the Fed\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Taiwan’s Premier Cho Jung-tai has announced a sweeping economic and social reform plan, aiming to attract nearly $100 billion in investments. This comes after former President Donald Trump said “Taiwan should pay us for defense.”\n\nWhat Happened: The reform plan would focus on energy, artificial intelligence, and infrastructure. The strategy includes appealing to Taiwanese investors disillusioned with conducting business in China, a trend the government aims to capitalize on, said Premier Cho in an interview with Nikkei Asia.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nHere’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share. Don’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\nThe plan is in line with President Lai Ching-te‘s vision of a “smarter, forward-looking sustainability,” exploring ocean and space industries, and enhancing Taiwan’s global presence.\n\nDespite the opposition’s majority in parliament, Cho is determined to push forward with the reform, which aims to revitalize the Democratic Progressive Party following Lai’s re-election in January.\n\nThe plan includes the establishment of an Economic Development Commission, chaired by Cho, to oversee a $100 billion investment in development.\n\nCho also emphasized the need to address concerns over livelihoods and housing and to attract Taiwanese investors who have turned away from China’s business environment. He stated, “China is no longer an attractive investment environment from a legal or political point of view. Many Taiwanese companies are coming back to Taiwan.”\n\nSee Also:Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nAnother top priority for Cho is energy security. From 2023 to 2026, many existing power plants are scheduled to shut down, making it a critical period.\n\nNext year, the last reactor at Taiwan’s Third Nuclear Power Plant is scheduled for retirement. However, Cho indicated that a proposal to extend nuclear service should have been made five years ago. While the government is open to exploring future atomic energy systems, he emphasized that “tomorrow’s technologies won’t help our power demand today.”\n\nThe urgency has intensified as NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), the world’s leading AI chip developer, along with contract manufacturer and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) biggest iPhone assembler Foxconn Technology Group and server maker Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI), announced plans to build new supercomputer or AI data centers in Taiwan. Additionally, Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) and other chipmakers are expanding their capacity.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending:Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate — This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\n\nWhy It Matters: The announcement comes at a critical time for Taiwan, which is navigating complex geopolitical and economic challenges.\n\nRecently, U.S. President Joe Biden‘s withdrawal from the presidential race led to a dip in shares of major Taiwanese companies like TSMC. This underscores the volatility and sensitivity of Taiwan’s market to international political events. Former President Donald Trump‘s recent comments suggesting Taiwan should pay for its defense have raised concerns about the future of U.S. support.\n\nMoreover, the rapid growth of AI technologies is putting pressure on Taiwan’s infrastructure. Chief Telecom‘s President Jacky Liu has called for a complete redesign of data centers to meet the demands of AI computing, highlighting the urgent need for infrastructure upgrades.\n\nPresident Lai Ching-te has also publicly thanked Micron Technology Inc.‘s (NASDAQ:MU) CEO for ongoing investments in Taiwan, emphasizing the importance of foreign investment in sustaining Taiwan’s technological edge.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWhen today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out.

        "title": "Why the tech stock selloff isn't over yet: Wall Street strategists",
        "content": "The tech rout is far from over.\n\nThat’s the warning from strategists this week as investors dump big tech stocks in favor of previously unloved areas of the market. The Nasdaq 100 closed the week down 2.7%, marking the third week in a row of declines, with the technology sector suffering its largest single-day percentage drop since October 2022.\n\nThe culprits: bets on Fed rate cuts, Tesla’s (TSLA) lackluster earnings, and fears about Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) AI spending ramp.\n\n“Valuations were priced to perfection from an earnings standpoint and from an interest rate standpoint, that eventually we would see some sort of a valuation correction,” Verdence Capital Advisors chief investment officer Megan Horneman told me.\n\nHorneman, who warned the AI trade is “hitting a wall,” added that this week’s rotation out of big tech is only the start of a “valuation correction.”\n\nThe significant shift under way has pushed small caps to the top of investors' buying lists. The Russell 2000 (RUT) recorded weekly gains for the third week in a row, marking its best three week stretch since 2022. Data compiled by Bespoke found that the outperformance spread between the Russell 2000 and the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) over the last 12 trading days, in favor of the small-cap index, is the second most extreme in the history of the two indices.\n\n“With multiples as high as they are for the Mag seven, they're building in earnings growth. And if you don't see that earnings growth, that means that valuations come into question,” Commonwealth Financial Network’s Brad McMillan explained to me.\n\n“There’s a threat of more pressure ahead,” McMillan said.\n\nAnd that risk of slower profit growth, coupled with increased spending on AI, could signal that the “epic momentum reversal” will persist, unless big tech raises forward revenue guidance, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn a note to clients, Goldman Sachs’ David Kostin wrote investors are starting to worry about the prospect of “overinvestment” in AI without timely proven returns, noting that Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet are driving the bulk of the spending.\n\n“Consensus estimates of 2024 and 2025 capex and R&D spending by the hyperscalers have increased by $65 billion compared with expectations at the start of the year. However, analysts have lifted their sales forecasts for 2025 and 2026 by only $36 billion — a gap of nearly $30 billion,” Kostin wrote.\n\n“These firms during the past six months have dramatically increased their planned spending on AI initiatives but it is not apparent when the return will come — in 2027, 2028, 2029, or perhaps not at all,” he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs our markets reporter Josh Schafer noted, two charts in Yahoo Finance’s Chartbook suggest further selling ahead. Analysis by Truist’s Keith Lerner found that the S&P 500 sees an average correction of about 9% in the second half of the year, after the index rallies more than 10% in the first six months.\n\nMeanwhile, BMO Capital Markets chief investment officer Brian Belski’s review of past performance found that stocks usually drop an average of 9.4% in the second year of a cyclical bull market, which started in October 2022.\n\n“This market has become quite frothy with everybody looking to big cap tech stocks and chasing the market,” Belski told me. “It's really difficult to be overweight Apple or overweight Nvidia … especially given how much they've rallied.”\n\nSafe to say, earnings results this coming week from Meta, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft will be a crucial measuring stick. Any sort of disappointment, similar to what we saw from Alphabet and Tesla this week, could trigger more carnage for the tech market.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Big Tech Earnings Arrive With Nasdaq 100 on Brink of Correction",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The violent rotation out of Big Tech has dragged the Nasdaq 100 Index down 8% in just over two weeks, leaving it on the cusp of a correction. Whether it can avoid that dubious milestone will likely come down to earnings from a quartet of companies worth nearly $10 trillion combined.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHarris’ Running-Mate Search Zeroes In on Three Top Contenders That Sudden Market Drop Was Scary for Investors But Long Overdue Trump Gets Upstaged by RFK Jr.’s Claims of ‘Bitcoin Fort Knox’ Casino Tycoon’s Son Builds His Own Fortune With E-Sports IPO Harris Tests Out ‘Weird’ Label in Attack on Trump-Vance Rhetoric\n\nIn a week that also brings a Federal Reserve interest-rate decision, investors will focus primarily on results from Microsoft Corp. on Tuesday, followed by Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. over the next two days.\n\nThe stakes were already high after a torrid first-half rally for Big Tech left the biggest companies with fat share-price gains and stretched valuations. They’ve become downright critical after Alphabet Inc.’s results last week raised concern that spending on artificial intelligence has gotten too rich relative to near-term returns.\n\n“These earnings are really important,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading. “If you can’t beat expectations then I think the interpretation is that AI is not delivering the way people hoped.”\n\nThe results will land in a market roiled by one of the quickest and sharpest rotations in years. Investors finally turned cautious about companies at the forefront of AI after ignoring for months warnings that their run was overextended. They’ve sold the Nasdaq 100 to the tune of $2.6 trillion, and plowed into stocks that had long been laggards, including small companies and financial and industrial firms. The index recovered slightly on Friday, posting a 1% gain, but not nearly enough to make up for losses earlier in the week.\n\nThe rotation into cyclical pockets of the market began in earnest after a reading on June prices showed cooling inflation, stoking bets the Fed will cut interest rates as soon as September. The Russell 2000 has jumped 10% since then, while financial and industrial companies in the S&P 500 are up more than 3.5%. Investors will get a better read on the prospects for any cuts when the Fed releases a policy statement Wednesday and Chair Jerome Powell speaks.\n\nDuring the shift, traders have been bidding up options on the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF that tracks the Nasdaq 100 to protect against a further slide, pushing up the premium for bearish puts to the highest in eight months. The Cboe Volatility Index popped above 18 this week for the first time since April, while a similar measure of turbulence on the Nasdaq 100 touched the highest since October — the last time the index was in a correction.\n\nStory continues\n\n“This is what happens when you have such a small amount of breadth in the market and everyone depending on the same few stocks,” said Michael Matousek, head trader at US Global Investors Inc.\n\nThe first test will be Microsoft. The software giant has been integrating AI services into its suite of software products and has spent heavily to build out data-center capacity. In Microsoft’s fiscal third quarter that ended in March, the company plowed $11 billion into capital expenditures. That figure is projected to rise to more than $13 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms, which reports on Wednesday, and Amazon, which reports on Thursday, have also been big spenders and investors will be looking for signs that AI is moving the needle for revenue.\n\nApple shares have rallied 32% from an April low on optimism about the company’s plans to integrate AI services into its iPhones. Investors will be looking for additional details when it reports on Thursday as well.\n\n“There are growing concerns that the return on investment from heavy AI spending is further out or not as lucrative as believed, and that is rippling through the whole semiconductor chain and all AI-related stocks,” said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management.\n\nThe carnage is mounting among some of the highest flying AI stocks. Nvidia, which is at the forefront of that industry, has fallen 17% from a record high on June 18 when it surpassed Microsoft and Apple to briefly become the most valuable company in the world. Dell Technologies Inc., which makes servers used in data centers, has tumbled 37% from a peak in May. Rival Super Micro Computer Inc. is down 40% since March.\n\nThe six biggest US technology stocks accounted for most of the S&P 500’s 14% first-half advance. The cap-weighted index beat its equal-weight cousin by the most since 1999. Valuations soared, with the S&P 500’s information technology index earlier this month hitting its highest price-to-projected earnings ratio since 2002.\n\n“Big tech was priced for perfection, and it has accounted for nearly all the market’s gains, which just underlines the group’s vulnerability,” Abate said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Miseducation of America’s Nurse Practitioners Joe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy’s New Kingmaker Disney Bets on Deadpool, Wolverine and Dirty Jokes to Save Marvel The $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into The US Economy Is Slowing, Which Is Just Fine With the Fed\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Dow Stocks to Buy on the Dip: July 2024",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average, often referred to as the “Dow” is an index fund composed of 30 influential American companies that represent the most traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE ). These companies include famous Dow stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others.\n\nRecently, as investors have started to rotate from mega and large-caps to small-caps in anticipation of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, the Dow has taken a bit of a tumble. It is down over 3% in the last five trading days. While this may not seem like a lot, for an index fund that tracks the performance of the 30 most active companies on the NYSE, this is a large drop. However, with time, the market will recover. This means that now is the perfect time for investors to buy the dip on companies in the Dow. Here are three companies that you should consider buying the dip on.\n\nNike (NKE) The swoosh logo for Nike Inc (NKE) is displayed on a wall made of wood panels.\n\nSource: pixfly / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) is a brand that needs no introduction. From the world’s top athletes to teenagers, everyone knows about Nike’s shoes. This hasn’t helped the stock recently though, as the company’s valuation has tumbled over 33% from the start of the year. This is primarily due to lackluster, declining sales. However, I am bullish on the company in the long run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile Nike did significantly underperform competitors like ON (NYSE:ONON), Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY), and Hoka (NYSE:DECK), it remains a great value stock for many reasons. Revenue and guidance falling have led to a bearish downtrend– management is aware of this and will be taking action in accordance. This includes the promise to build a “multiyear cycle of innovation”.\n\nAdditionally, the Paris Olympics, which are coming up soon, are going to be a great catalyst for Nike, which has recognized this, and started an extreme ad campaign centered around it. Analysts have taken this, and many other factors into consideration, and have given it an average one-year price target of $92.45, representing a potential of more than 30%, making this Dow stock a buy.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is a global payments technology company. It facilitates electronic funds transfers throughout the world, primarily through Visa-branded credit cards, debit cards, and prepaid cards. Visa also provides payment processing and information services, connecting consumers, businesses, and financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories.\n\nStory continues\n\nV stock has been down 7% over the past month, but the stock is poised for a comeback. The stock is currently trading at $254.17 with a market cap of $494.58 billion. The company is incredibly profitable, with a profit and operating margin of 54.72% and 66.86% respectively. The stock has consistently beaten EPS predictions over the past year, with an average surprise of 2.45%.\n\nAlmost 94% of the stock is held by institutions, with 166 hedge fund investors, indicating strong confidence from major financial entities and suggesting stability and long-term growth potential. The stock will continue to remain profitable as the company makes money off of pretty much every transaction carried out by a Visa-branded card. Given Visa’s profitability, institutional support, and consistent earnings performance, it’s one of the solid Dow stocks to buy for long-term investors.\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nA stalwart consumer tech stock, Apple designs several products including the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and provides services like iCloud, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and Apple TV+. The company has recently announced ‘Apple Intelligence’, its latest initiative to integrate AI and machine learning across its product ecosystem.\n\nAAPL stock is currently trading at $218.54 as of the market close on 07/24/24 with a market cap of $3.315 trillion, making it the largest company in the world by market cap. The stock has fallen over 6% over the past 10 days, but I expect the trend to reverse anytime. The stock has consistently beaten EPS predictions over the past year, with an average surprise of 4%. The company displays impressive profitability with a profit margin of 26.31% and an operating margin of 30.74%.\n\nThe iPhone makes up a huge share of Apple’s revenue, but sales dipped in 2023 compared to 2022 due to heightened competition. However, its revenue could surge with the launch of the iPhone 16 lineup, the only product line compatible with Apple Intelligence features (apart from the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max models). All these factors put AAPL among the strong Dow stocks to buy as its AI advancements will act as catalysts to boost stock value.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Big Tech earnings, a Fed meeting, and the July jobs report: What to know this week",
        "content": "The stock market rally is in its most fragile state in months ahead of Wall Street's busiest week of the summer.\n\nThe S&P 500 (GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) recently had their worst single-day drops since 2022 as the indexes struggled to recover losses during a Friday rally. All three major averages closed the final full week of July lower. The S&P 500 was down more than 1%, while the Nasdaq fell over 2.3%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose about 0.6%.\n\nIn the week ahead, a Federal Reserve meeting, the July jobs report, and earnings from Big Tech stalwarts Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) will drive the direction of markets to kick off August.\n\nUpdates on job openings, activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, and consumer confidence are also on the calendar.\n\nA busy week of corporate earnings awaits, with 171 members of the S&P 500 expected to report quarterly results. AMD (AMD), Arm (ARM), Boeing (BA), McDonald's (MCD), and Starbucks (SBUX) will be among the companies highlighting the schedule.\n\nA September 'signal'\n\nThe Fed will announce its latest monetary policy decision next Wednesday. Markets largely expect the central bank to hold rates steady at its July meeting.\n\nRecent updates in the economy have investors eyeing when the Fed's first cut will come though. In June, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out the cost of food and energy and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 2.6% over the prior year, its lowest annual increase in more than three years. Separate data for the month showed a significant decrease in another inflation metric, the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market has shown signs of cooling. The ratio of job openings to unemployed workers is back at pre-pandemic levels, and last month, the unemployment rate hit its highest level since November 2021.\n\nThis has prompted markets to price in the Fed's first cut in September, and investors will be keenly listening to Jerome Powell's press conference on Wednesday for any confirmation.\n\n\"The overall tone from the meeting, including from Chair Powell's press conference, should signal that a rate cut in September is a reasonable baseline without pre-committing to this action,\" Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti wrote in a note to clients. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell departs after holding a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on interest rate policy in Washington, U.S., May 1, 2024. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nLabor market look\n\nFriday will bring a fresh look at monthly job additions as economists continue to debate whether recent cooling in the labor market represents normalization or more significant deterioration.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe July jobs report is expected to show 175,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy, with unemployment holding steady at 4.1%, according to data from Bloomberg. In June, the US economy added 206,000 jobs while the unemployment rate rose to 4.1%.\n\n\"The 180K increase to payrolls we expect in July would still be a respectable gain, but would underscore that, directionally, the jobs market is deteriorating,\" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients. \"By a range of measures, including the unemployment rate, quit rate, level of temporary help workers and small business hiring plans, the labor market is not only softer than a year or two ago, but weaker compared to its pre-pandemic state.\"\n\nGiven this backdrop, whether unemployment holds steady or ticks up as it has for the past three months will be in particular focus.\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nThe stock market's recent slump has included a big sell-off in tech.\n\nSince July 10, Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) — which tracks Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — has dropped about 12%.\n\nTruist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner recently told Yahoo Finance the pullback has made sense given the runup in Big Tech stocks over the past year and how overstretched positioning in many of the large tech stocks had become. This, combined with investors rotating into less-loved areas of the market rally that could benefit from the Fed cutting interest rates, has become the hallmark of the market action over the past two weeks.\n\nEarnings from four of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple — could change that. But as the sell-off after Alphabet and Tesla earnings showed in the prior week, it's been a tough season to impress investors with earnings.\n\n\"When we look at the earnings that we've seen over the last week, I don't think the earnings are bad,\" Lerner said. \"I don't think the businesses, the fundamental business trends, are bad, but I just think that they were not good enough relative to these really high [expectations].\"\n\nAnd, to Lerner's point, stocks that miss on Wall Street estimates for earnings, revenue, or both are seeing significantly worse price reactions in the next trading day than typically seen over the past five years, according to research from Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel.\n\nFor now, Emanuel wrote in a note to clients, \"earnings remain a catalyst for volatility, not higher S&P 500 prices.\"\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, July (-14.2 expected, -15.1 prior)\n\nEarnings: McDonald's (MCD), Philips (PHG), Tilray (TLRY)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P CoreLogic 20-city year-over-year NSA, May (7.2% prior); Conference Board consumer confidence, July (99.7 expected, 100.4 prior) JOLTS job openings, June (8.14 million prior); Dallas Fed services activity, (-4.1 prior)\n\nEarnings: Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), BP (BP), Caesars Entertainment (CZR), Electronic Arts (EA), First Solar (FSLR), JetBlue (JBLU), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), Merck (MRK), Pinterest (PINS), Pfizer (PFE), Procter & Gamble (PG), Starbucks (SBUX), SoFi (SOFI)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended July 26 (-2.2% prior); ADP private payrolls, July (+168,000 expected, +150,000 prior); Minnesota Chicago PMI, July (44.0 expected, 47.4 prior); Employment cost index, second quarter (1.0% expected, 1.2% prior); Federal Reserve monetary policy decision (no interest rate change expected)\n\nEarnings: Meta (META), Altria (MO), Arm (ARM), Boeing (BA), Carvana (CVNA), Generac (GNRC), Humana (HUM), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC), Mastercard (MA), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), Paycom (PAYC), Qualcomm (QCOM)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, July, (+19.8% prior); Unit labor costs, second quarter (+4% prior); Nonfarm productivity, fourth quarter (+1.6% expected, +5.2% prior); Initial jobless claims, week ending July 27 (235,000 prior); S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, July final (49.5 prior); Construction spending, month-over-month, July (+0.2% expected, -0.1% prior); ISM manufacturing, July (49 expected, 48.5 prior); ISM prices paid, July (52.1 prior)\n\nEarnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Block (SQ), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Canada Goose (GOOS), Coinbase (COIN), ConocoPhillips (COP), Crocs (CROX), DraftKings (DKNG), Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Mobileye (MBLY), Moderna (MRNA), Roku (ROKU) SiriusXM (SIRI), Wayfair (W)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, July (+175,000 expected, +206,000 prior); Unemployment rate, January (4.1% expected, 4.1% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, July (+0.3% expected, +0.3% prior); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, July (+3.7% expected, +3.9% prior); Average weekly hours worked, July (34.4 expected, 34.3 prior); Labor force participation rate, July (62.6% previously); Factory orders, June (+0.5% expected, -0.5% prior); Durable goods orders, June final (-6.6% prior)\n\nEarnings: Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "1 Low-Risk Stock That Should Outperform the S&amp;P 500, According to Warren Buffett",
        "content": "Warren Buffett made Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) what is today through the principles of value investing. One of the main ideas behind value investing is that a stock trading at good value (based on certain valuation metrics) will eventually outperform the overall market while also offering less downside risk than other investments.\n\nThat value investing strategy has paid off wonderfully for Berkshire and its investors. Buffett's produced an average compound annual gain of 19.8% for shareholders since taking over the business in 1965. By comparison, the S&P 500 produced an average total return of 10.2% in that time. That massive outperformance stems from Buffett's ability to identify great companies trading at a fair value, and sometimes an even better-than-fair value.\n\nIn his most recent letter to shareholders, Buffett suggested another stock that should perform better than the average American company, and it could turn out to be a great value stock for investors. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nA portfolio full of incredible businesses\n\nBuffett highlighted several of Berkshire Hathaway's biggest stock holdings in his 2023 letter to shareholders published earlier this year.\n\nHe's continuously bought shares of Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) since the start of 2022. He's built a sizable position in the oil company, amounting to 28.8% of the shares outstanding. Berkshire also holds about $8 billion worth of preferred shares, which it received in exchange for helping finance Occidental's acquisition of Anadarko in 2019. Buffett praised Occidental's management and said he expects to hold the stock indefinitely.\n\nBuffett also called out longtime holdings American Express(NYSE: AXP) and Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) as businesses he never plans to sell. Both have strong international brands that Buffett loves and core products and services that he called \"timeless essentials.\" Despite the fact that Buffett hasn't bought a single share of either company in over 20 years, they remain two of Berkshire's largest holdings.\n\nBuffett mentioned Berkshire's giant stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), but only in passing. The Oracle of Omaha called Apple \"a better business than any we own\" at last year's shareholder meeting. That said, he's sold off some shares recently, purposefully taking the capital gains amid a favorable tax environment. He assured shareholders that he expects Apple to remain the largest holding in Berkshire's equity portfolio for a long time during this year's shareholder meeting.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of the companies above might look attractive at their current share prices. They all have very strong competitive positions and good earnings prospects that should support their current valuations. But not a single one of them is the stock Buffett says has better-than-average return potential with less downside risk. (Although in a way, all of them are.)\n\nIn fact, Berkshire Hathaway itself is the company Buffett calls out in his letter to shareholders. \"After 59 years of assemblage, the company now owns either a portion or 100% of various businesses that, on a weighted basis, have somewhat better prospects than exist at most large American companies,\" he wrote.\n\nBut it's not just that Berkshire's portfolio of stocks and wholly owned subsidiaries are full of great companies, the conglomerate is also well positioned to avoid financial ruin thanks to one more big holding on Berkshire's balance sheet.\n\nA big insurance policy for the insurance company\n\nBerkshire has a massive equity portfolio, which is partly funded by the float from its insurance businesses. But there's another side to Buffett's investment portfolio for Berkshire Hathaway, and it's growing extremely quickly.\n\nOver the last few years, Berkshire has seen its position in short-term Treasury bonds balloon. Buffett said he expected it to reach $200 billion by the end of the second quarter.\n\nThat massive position in cash equivalents means Berkshire \"should also operate with materially less risk of permanent loss of capital,\" Buffett wrote. While some may deem holding that much cash as a drag on Buffett's portfolio, those T-bills are yielding over 5% for Berkshire shareholders. That's an excellent ballast to the equity portfolio and core operations at Berkshire.\n\nAll of it amounts to an insurance policy on the rest of Berkshire Hathaway. On top of that, it puts Buffett and his fellow portfolio managers in a position to be able to seize market opportunities if and when they present themselves. For example, Buffett was in a position to invest $10 billion in Occidental in 2019, seeing a potential opportunity. He previously made a similar deal with another top holding, Bank of America. More opportunities will surely present themselves, and Berkshire is ready for them when they do.\n\nA great company trading at a fair price\n\nIt's important to note that Berkshire isn't just a conglomerate full of great businesses and a massive cash pile on its balance sheet. The stock also trades at a fair price which means it can live up to Buffett's expectation of outperforming the market.\n\nShares currently trade for around 19.6 times forward earnings. That might seem high compared to other financial stocks. But when you factor in Berkshire's cash position, its equity portfolio, the strength of its core operations, and Buffett's ongoing share repurchases, it's a fair valuation. That's evidenced by its price-to-book value ratio of 1.6, which is much more in line with other insurance companies and financial stocks.\n\nWhile the share price has climbed considerably higher since Buffett penned his letter to shareholders earlier this year, investors can still expect better-than-average results from Berkshire stock going forward.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Scored Big on Amazon Prime Day",
        "content": "Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) held its annual Prime Day sales extravaganza on July 16 and 17. Shoppers spent an estimated $14.2 billion this year over the two-day event, an 11% increase from last year.\n\nWhile Amazon is light on details of how much was actually spent, it said it was another record-breaking sale that saw a record number of people sign up for Prime. While some of those undoubtedly signed up just to take advantage of the sales and will cancel afterward, Amazon likely significantly built on its estimated 180.1 million Prime users in the U.S.\n\nYet Amazon is not alone in running a sale. Other retailers realizing the interest consumers have in saving money during the event, piggyback on Prime Day with their own sales. However, it is becoming increasingly common amongst Amazon’s main rivals to avoid directly competing against the e-commerce giant. Instead, many run their own sales events either just before or just after Amazon.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three Amazon Prime Day stocks that benefited from the sales-apalooza either with their own doorbuster event or on Prime Day itself.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) used to compete directly with Amazon by holding sales on Prime Day but it hasn’t for the past couple of years. Now that it has its own member loyalty program, Walmart+ Week is an exclusive opportunity for subscribers to save big. It ran a month ahead of Prime Day, going from June 17 to June 23.\n\nAccording to PYMNTS Intelligence, its survey of Walmart+ members found the fourth annual event was used as a chance to stock up on groceries. Two-thirds of shoppers bought grocery products while the next largest items were health and beauty products where approximately 60% of shoppers purchased them. Clothing and accessories was third with about 50% of members buying.\n\nAs the sales event was both online and in-store, PYMNTS found online shoppers bought 20.6 items on average versus 14.9 items for those who visited a brick-and-mortar store.\n\nWhat the PYMNTS Intelligence survey indicates is that Walmart continues to do well at what it does best. Particularly during periods of elevated inflation, shoppers go to the retailer to get the best deals on essentials, primarily food for their families. As they were also able to take advantage of free shipping, Walmart remains a destination for everyday low prices.\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTarget (NYSE:TGT) was another retailer that used to go head-to-head with Amazon on Prime Day but decided holding its own event separately was a better use of its resources. The retailer has held week-long savings events in the past but this year it launched Circle Week in April. It coincided with Target revamping its loyalty program to include a new $99 tier, Target Circle 360.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts second Circle Week event of the year was held just ahead of Prime Day between July 7 and July 13. It was exclusive only to Target Circle members, whether in the free or paid tier. Like Walmart+ Week, the Target sale was also an omnichannel event letting members shop online, in-store or via the Target app.\n\nTarget may have even gotten a benefit over Amazon but at the expense of the sellers. CNBC reported that Amazon’s pricing algorithm detected the sales price on Target’s website. It caused third-party retailers to lose the “buy box” location on Amazon. That is the listing that first pops up when a consumer searches for a product. While a sale may have been made at Target, merchants found their Amazon sales imploded.\n\nTarget’s sales week success hasn’t translated yet to its stock price. Shares are flat in July though they are up 5% year-to-date and 11% higher over the past 12 months.\n\nBest Buy (BBY) A photo of a Best Buy store front.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectronics retailer Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) held a Black Friday in July sales promotion that coincided with Prime Day. Yet it started one day earlier on July 15. According to the website Tinuiti, many other retailers also ran competing events. However, only Best Buy ranked high enough to register alongside Walmart and Target.\n\nWhere 35% of consumers said they would shop Walmart+ Week and 34% said Target Circle Week was on their radar, Best Buy’s summer sale was being considered by 11%. Yes, significantly less than the others, but miles ahead of other retailers.\n\nIt also offered some incredible deals. TVs were starting at $64, Chromebooks went for $139 and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watches were offered for $299, a $100 savings. And unlike other retailers, you didn’t need to belong to a member loyalty program to score the deals. However, if you were a subscriber, you got additional savings.\n\nAfter falling hard last year, Best Buy stock has been scrambling to recover. From its low point in November, BBY is up 40%. It has found its footing again in the digital space. Best Buy is effectively using its stores as fulfillment centers for online sales. Some 35% of its stores now account for 70% of ship-from-store volume. Best Buy has become a competitive threat again to other consumer electronics retailers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "$135 Billion of Warren Buffett's $332 Billion Portfolio Is in This Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock",
        "content": "No investor is more synonymous with long-term success than Warren Buffett. The legendary chief of Berkshire Hathaway is nicknamed the Oracle of Omaha for a reason: He's so good at making the right picks that it almost seems like he can see into the future. Today, he oversees a portfolio worth $332 billion.\n\nHe believes in picking great companies and sticking with them rather than scouring the market for great prices and actively trading. That's pretty much what I believe, too. As Buffett puts it: \"When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays.\"\n\nOne of his best long-term bets remains his top holding, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Berkshire's stake in the iPhone maker amounts to $135 billion, making up about 41% of the holding company's entire portfolio.\n\nSome might doubt Buffett's belief after he sold 100 million of Apple shares -- about 13% of Berkshire's total -- last quarter, but this was likely for tax reasons, as Buffett himself hinted, rather than a loss of faith.\n\nSo why does Buffett love Apple so much? Why does he believe it's \"an even better business\" than his longtime favorites, Coca-Cola and American Express? For one, it has made Berkshire quite a lot of money. Beyond this, it is the definition of a wonderful business that continues to gain value as it adapts to the times.\n\nSlumping iPhone sales in China look to be reversing as India surprises\n\nGlobal sales are important to Apple. Domestically, the needle is harder to move, with more than 90% penetration of the smartphone market. In China and India, on the other hand, it has penetration rates of 75% and 40%, respectively. This leaves much more room to grow organically without the need to convert an Android user.\n\nThat's why investors were spooked when Apple reported disappointing numbers in first-quarter China sales. However, preliminary data indicates that the situation is reversing. A report in April showed that sales of foreign-made smartphones rose 52% year over year. Most Android phones sold in China are made domestically, so \"foreign-made\" would be primarily referring to iPhones.\n\nMore recently, Bloomberg reported that Apple's India sales jumped 33% in the trailing 12 months from March. Much of the focus was on China sales, so investors were pleasantly surprised by the huge jump in a market Apple had struggled in previously.\n\nLook for the sales numbers from China and India in Apple's upcoming second-quarter report. Continued success in these markets could mean a big boost in revenue, but keep in mind that Apple won much of this market share by reducing prices, I'm interested to see the effect that decision has had on the company's margins and net income.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf Apple Intelligence delivers, U.S. sales could see a big boost as well\n\nApple stood back while Alphabet and other big tech players rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into their products. This worried many investors who believed Apple had simply fallen behind. Now the picture looks a little different.\n\nRoughly a year and a half after ChatGPT-3 went public, Apple finally announced its own AI offering, the cheekily dubbed Apple Intelligence.\n\nApple built its reputation on quality, so the company waited until it believed its AI product would be intuitively integrated, genuinely useful, sleek, and free of errors -- something Google might want to consider in the future.\n\nApple Intelligence hasn't been released to the public yet, so perhaps I'll eat my words, but I have confidence it will deliver. If it does, this could drive renewed demand for Apple products, some from non-iPhone users, but more importantly from iPhone users who have been resisting an upgrade.\n\nApple Intelligence won't work on older products, and only the newest iPhones will be capable of using the most advanced features.\n\nThe company continues to evolve, often leading -- or at least perfecting -- new trends. That is probably why it remains Buffett's biggest bet. It's also why I think Apple is still a buy.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $20,554!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $41,185!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $340,492!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of July 22, 2024\n\nAmerican Express is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

        "title": "Almost Half of Warren Buffett's $400 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Only 1 Stock",
        "content": "Thanks to his unbelievable track record of allocating capital as the longtime CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, it's not a shock that Warren Buffett is one of the most closely watched investors out there. The average person can follow his moves to find potential stock ideas.\n\nThe conglomerate has dozens of holdings, but there's a single position that stands out. After purchasing shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in the first quarter of 2016, this \"Magnificent Seven Stock\" now makes up 43% of Berkshire's $400 billion portfolio. That's thanks to a monster 730% rise in the share price since the start of 2016.\n\nInvestors can learn a lot by figuring out Buffett's thought process when he first made the decision to buy Apple stock.\n\nBuffett's no-brainer investment\n\nBuffett's investment philosophy is well publicized. This makes it fairly easy to understand the key factors that drew him to Apple nearly a decade ago. To sum it up, the Oracle of Omaha saw a great business trading at a cheap valuation multiple.\n\nApple possesses arguably the world's most valuable brand. It sells popular hardware products, most notably the iPhone, that consumers absolutely love and can't live without. Moreover, these devices have historically exhibited pricing power, a trait Buffett certainly appreciates.\n\nAdd this to compelling software and services offerings, and the business has created a powerful ecosystem that essentially locks users in. Buffett likely understood that this combination of hardware and software was not replicable, which is exactly what protects Apple's competitive standing.\n\nWhat's noteworthy is that Apple was performing very well around the time Buffett first bought shares. This was (and still is) an extremely profitable enterprise with a stellar financial profile. In fiscal 2015, the business reported a 30% operating margin. At that time, it had $150 billion of net cash on the balance sheet. There was minimal financial risk.\n\nThat's why it's surprising to know that the stock traded at a dirt-cheap average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 10.6 during the first quarter of 2016. Perhaps the market was worried about the prospect of softer iPhone sales. Who knows? In typical fashion, Warren Buffett took advantage of what Mr. Market offered him at that time. And that move has benefited Berkshire tremendously.\n\nIs it too late to buy Apple stock?\n\nAs of this writing, Apple trades 7% off its peak price, a milestone that was reached earlier in July. Investors appear to be taking a bit of a breather. But this is still a company with a market cap of nearly $3.4 trillion, which generated $382 billion in revenue in the past 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it might be easy to follow blindly in Buffett's footsteps and immediately add this stock to your personal portfolio, I think it's best to be more critical. In fact, I'd argue that now is a terrible time to buy a stake in Apple.\n\nOne reason why I feel this way is due to slowing growth trends. The iPhone still drives a significant chunk of Apple's financial performance. As consumers don't feel the need to upgrade to the newest model as frequently, Apple can feel the pain. Revenue declined 2.8% in fiscal 2023. Over the next three years, sales are projected to rise by just 5% per year.\n\nThose muted growth prospects might not be alarming if the stock traded at a cheap valuation. However, this is far from the case today. Shares go for a steep P/E multiple of 34. That prices in huge growth in the years ahead, which I don't think will come to fruition.\n\nFor now, investors should keep Apple on the watch list until a sizable drawdown happens.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead",
        "content": "Investing.com -- It’s set to be a big week for markets with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan all set to hold policy meetings. Also in the spotlight will be Friday’s U.S. jobs report and more big tech earnings results. Here's your look at what's happening in markets for the week ahead.\n\nFed decision\n\nWith markets currently pricing in an 88% chance of a September rate cut amid signs of cooling inflation and an uptick in the unemployment rate this week’s policy statement by Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be firmly in the spotlight.\n\nThe Fed, which concludes its July policy meeting on Wednesday, has said it wants to be confident inflation is moving sustainably towards its 2% target before cutting interest rates.\n\nInflation data on Friday underscored expectations for the U.S. central bank to set the stage for a September rate cut this week.\n\nThe Fed has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range since last July. It has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points since 2022.\n\nNonfarm payrolls\n\nWednesday’s Fed statement will put the already closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, due out on Friday, under heightened scrutiny as investors try to gauge whether recent signs of cooling in the labor market continued in July.\n\nEconomists are expecting the U.S. economy to have created 177,000 jobs in July, moderating from 206,000 in the prior month.\n\nThe unemployment rate, which has ticked higher in each of the past three months, is expected to hold steady at 4.1%.\n\nAhead of Friday’s report the U.S. will release data on JOLTS job openings on Tuesday.\n\nBig tech earnings continue\n\nBig Tech earnings are set to continue in the coming days and any disappointments could potentially further roil markets already on edge amid worries over stretched stock valuations.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday, followed by Facebook-parent Meta (NASDAQ:META) on Wednesday and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday.\n\nDisappointing numbers could re-ignite the worries that caused a bruising selloff in U.S. stocks on Wednesday, when both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their worst day since late 2022.\n\nThe huge run-up in tech stocks may have set a high bar for their results. Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) whose earnings were one of the triggers for the selloff, actually reported better-than-expected revenue, but investors grew wary that rising spending on AI infrastructure could squeeze margins, sending shares 5% lower.\n\nBank of England meeting\n\nThe BoE meets on Thursday with investors divided over whether policymakers will deliver their first rate cut since 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe level of uncertainty is higher than usual in the run-up to the meeting as key central bank officials have not spoken publicly for over two months due to rules in the lead up to Britain’s July 4's general election.\n\nInvestors have been left guessing whether recent higher-than-expected service price inflation is enough to prevent the BoE cutting rates from their 16-year high of 5.25%.\n\nLast month, the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to keep rates on hold, but minutes of the decision recorded that it had been a \"finely balanced\" decision for some of the policymakers who had not voted for a cut.\n\nBank of Japan decision\n\nThe BOJ concludes its latest policy setting meeting on Wednesday and speculation over the prospect of a rate hike is mounting after high-profile politicians, including the prime minister, hinted at the need for near-term policy normalisation.\n\nThe impact of the weak yen on household and business spending appears to be turning the exchange rate into a central issue for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's leadership convention in September.\n\nThe fact that the currency has rebounded by a staggering 10 yen per dollar from three-decade lows at the start of the month hasn't deterred some from predicting a July hike.\n\nThey argue the BOJ can get the most bang for its buck by hiking into a rallying yen. Others worry a fragile economy and weak consumer sentiment couldn't weather higher borrowing costs, with slowing U.S. growth set to have a knock-on effect already.\n\n--Reuters contributed to this report\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTop 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead\n\nAustralia signs $1.4 billion deal to upgrade navy submarines\n\nBeing boring key to central bank success says SNB's Jordan\n\nView comments",

        "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: PT hikes for Nvidia, Apple; Tesla downside risk flagged",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nAnalysts lift Nvidia PTs ahead of Blackwell launch\n\nPiper Sandler analysts on Monday reaffirmed an Overweight rating for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and raised their target price from $120 to $140 in a move driven by strong expectations ahead of the company's earnings report for the July quarter and guidance for the October quarter.\n\n\"We see the strong business trends exhibited over the prior year by NVDA set to continue aided by the official launch of the Blackwell architecture in the October quarter,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThe investment bank views the launch of the Blackwell architecture as a catalyst for a new phase of growth, anticipating continued strong demand from cloud service providers (CSPs), enterprises, and sovereign entities. Analysts believe that demand for NVIDIA's upcoming B100/B200 products will significantly outpace supply.\n\nIn its bullish scenario, Piper Sandler says NVDA could exceed expectations by more than $2 billion in reported revenue for the July quarter, thanks to a recovery in networking supply.\n\n\"In our view, NVDA continues to be a premier player in the accelerated compute and gen AI end market,\" the analysts added.\n\nSimilarly, Loop Capital analysts increased their price target for Nvidia stock from $120 to $175, citing the company's potential to significantly exceed consensus revenue and earnings estimates for fiscal 2026.\n\nAmazon ‘most favored among mega-caps’ - Wells Fargo\n\nWells Fargo analysts have identified Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as the \"most favored long among mega-caps\" as the tech giant approaches its second-quarter earnings report.\n\nDespite mixed hedge fund positioning for competitors like Meta (NASDAQ:META), Wells Fargo believes Amazon stands out due to strong performance expectations and positive forward commentary.\n\nThe bank's analysts predict an 18% increase in Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue for the second quarter, with a sufficient operating income (OI) guidance of $16 billion for the third quarter.\n\nWells Fargo also plans to closely monitor Amazon's air freight commentary, estimating its impact on third-quarter operating income to be in the $200-$400 million range.\n\n\"See AMZN as the most favored long among mega-caps vs. META with more mixed HF positioning,\" the analysts stated, highlighting strong investor sentiment towards Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey note that the upcoming second-quarter earnings reports will be critical for understanding CapEx allocation and return time frames, especially given potential changes in AI strategy at AWS following the recent CEO change.\n\nApple seen as ‘more stable AI play for volatile times’, PT hiked\n\nRaymond James analysts have raised their stock price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $250 from $200, describing the company as \"a more stable AI play for volatile times.\" The firm maintained an Outperform rating on the stock, expecting a slight beat in F3Q24 results and an outlook in line with previous expectations.\n\nThis optimism is based on recent conversations in the Asia supply chain, TSM results, and China CAICT data, all indicating positive near-term trends for iPhone and Mac sales.\n\n\"We expect a slight beat and largely in-line outlook,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nWhile near-term results may not significantly impact the AI narrative, Raymond James remains \"optimistic that upcoming AI features will drive a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle.\"\n\nThe firm pointed to upward revisions in iPhone 16 builds for the second half of 2024, based on supply chain conversations, and mentioned significant changes to the internals of the iPhone 17, indicating Apple's increased focus on enhancing on-device AI capabilities.\n\n\"Supply chain data also points to material changes to iPhone 17 internals, suggesting that Apple is looking to do more AI on the device,\" analysts noted.\n\nApple's unique position in offering on-device AI features stems from its strong ecosystem, advanced hardware capabilities, and a focus on privacy.\n\n\"We believe Apple is in a unique position to offer on-device AI features given its ecosystem strength, hardware capabilities, and privacy focus,\" the note added.\n\nBaird: Buy QCOM after recent pullback\n\nEarlier in the week, Baird analysts added Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock as a “Bullish Fresh Pick” and increased their target price on the stock to $250.\n\nThis revision follows Baird’s initial channel feedback, which revealed a procurement units estimate of over 90 million for the upcoming iPhone 16, a significant rise from the low 80 million units of previous iPhone launches.\n\n“Similar to the Galaxy S24 launch earlier this year, AI is the driver,” analysts noted.\n\nThey expect strengthening demand trends in Qualcomm's handset business in the third quarter of the calendar year, following a seasonal trough in the second quarter and a year-over-year comparison trough in the first quarter.\n\nBaird’s team believes that AI will drive double-digit increases in Qualcomm's average selling prices (ASPs) for various components, starting with the iPhone 16 in the second half of this year. Moreover, initial AI content in high-end phones from Chinese smartphone OEMs will contribute, followed by the next-generation Galaxy platform in the first half of 2025.\n\nRadio Frequency (RF) ASP and content are also expected to benefit from AI beginning in the second half, driven by higher performance, faster uplinks, and greater integration.\n\nAdditionally, the investment firm pointed out a strong initial response for Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite processor in South Korea, as the chipmaker is the first to market in the initial wave of AI in PCs.\n\nSamsung (KS:005930) has launched Copilot+ PCs based on the X Elite, with demand surpassing initial channel expectations. Besides Samsung, the X Elite is also currently being shipped by HP (NYSE:HPQ), Dell (NYSE:DELL), Acer, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Lenovo.\n\n“We would be buyers of QCOM shares on recent share pullback,” the analysts concluded.\n\nUBS says AI optionality already priced in Tesla stock, sees downside risk\n\nUBS analysts have reiterated their Sell rating on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), citing substantial downside risk due to overvaluation and challenges in the automotive business highlighted in its latest quarterly report.\n\nThey believe Tesla's stock, which is currently trading at over 100 times its run-rate EPS of approximately $2.25, has a considerable amount of AI optionality already priced in, resulting in an inflated valuation.\n\n\"TSLA 2Q24 results showed the stress on the automotive business, just to keep vehicle deliveries ~1.78mm annualized units (which would be -2% y/y),\" analysts noted.\n\nThe bank pointed out that Tesla's aggressive pricing and promotional strategies to stimulate demand have caused its auto gross margin, excluding credits, to drop to 14.6%, the lowest since the first quarter of 2019.\n\nAdjusting for higher-than-normal credits and restructuring charges, UBS estimates Tesla's run-rate EPS to be around $0.56, which still includes a strong but potentially volatile quarter for its Energy business.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are skeptical about the near-term drivers for Tesla's earnings. While the introduction of a new lower-cost model and increased Full Self-Driving (FSD) take rates could provide some support, the analysts argue that even an improvement of $1 per share in earnings would still leave the stock trading at over 75 times its price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nThe analysts assert that Tesla's current stock price heavily relies on future AI initiatives such as robo-taxis and Optimus humanoid robots.\n\nThey believe Tesla's stock faces more downside risk if confidence in these AI initiatives wavers. Upcoming events like Robo-taxi day on October 10 could trigger a \"sell-the-news\" reaction, emphasizing the overvaluation of the stock based on uncertain future opportunities, analysts explained.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: PT hikes for Nvidia, Apple; Tesla downside risk flagged\n\nWhat are the best trades to position for a red wave in the US election?\n\nWould the US outperform if Trump wins a clean sweep?\n\nView comments",

        "title": "How Much Will Apple Pay Out in Dividends This Year?",
        "content": "Consumer technology titan Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been paying dividends to shareholders since 2012. The dividend, however, isn't the reason investors own the stock. This ticker's been incredibly rewarding since the company first unveiled its iPhone back in 2007, up nearly 4,500% during that time, making Apple the world's biggest publicly traded organization (as measured by market cap).\n\nNevertheless, it is a dividend stock. The big question? How much will Apple pay in dividends this year?\n\nApple stock's dividend\n\nAs of May, Apple's quarterly dividend stands at $0.25 per share. That's up a penny from February's per-share payout of $0.24, continuing the company's cadence of yearly dividend growth. Assuming the payout stays at its current level for the rest of the year, shareholders can anticipate getting $0.99 in per-share dividends payable in 2024, which will cost the company something on the order of $15 billion.\n\nIt can afford them to be sure. Despite the headwind currently working against its flagship iPhone business, Apple's still managed to generate $57.6 billion in net income during the six-month stretch ending in March following a bottom line of nearly $97 billion for the fiscal year ending in September.\n\nMore growth than income\n\nThat's an encouraging degree of dividend-supporting profitability. It leaves lots of room for continued payout growth or wiggle room should earnings stumble.\n\nFor investors prioritizing income though, Apple's not your best option. Newcomers would be stepping in while the dividend yield's less than 0.5% of the stock's present price. That's not a lot, particularly given the number of higher-yielding options available right now.\n\nIndeed, Apple remains far better-suited for growth-minded investors if for no other reason than it's investing so much more in reducing its sheer number of outstanding shares. The company spent over $43 billion on stock repurchases alone during the six months ending in March, following the prior fiscal year's $76.6 billion worth of spending on buybacks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $688,005!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "2 AI Stocks That Could Dominate the Rest of 2024",
        "content": "The massive investments companies are making in artificial intelligence (AI) will bring new products and experiences to consumers that could change the world. Investors who put their money in the companies best positioned to profit from this technology could see outstanding results.\n\nHere are two AI stocks that could be ready to take off in the second half of the year and beyond.\n\n1. Apple\n\nWhat better company to change the world with AI than Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) -- a brand built on Steve Jobs' vision to design devices that did just that? Since unveiling new AI features coming to its devices this fall, the stock has surged to new highs over the last month. Wall Street is high on Apple's growth prospects, and for good reason.\n\nMorgan Stanley is one firm that is touting Apple's growth potential in the AI era. The firm sees Apple Intelligence as a \"clear catalyst for a multiyear product upgrade cycle.\"\n\nOut of the 3.1 billion smartphones in use globally, more will be AI smartphones over the next decade. IDC expects smartphones with generative AI capabilities will grow 78% annually through 2028 compared to 2.3% for the broader smartphone market. The adoption of AI smartphones is an opportunity for Apple to convert more smartphone buyers to its lucrative lineup of products, and this opportunity kicks off with the launch of iOS 18 and the new iPhones later this year.\n\nNo smartphone maker is better at profiting from new technology. Apple's net profit totaled $100 billion over the last year. Strong sales of pricier devices with more advanced processors that are capable of running Apple Intelligence could drive its profits even higher. \"We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in generative AI,\" CEO Tim Cook said on the company's last earnings call.\n\nAnalysts forecast Apple's earnings to grow 15% in fiscal 2024 (which ends in September), before increasing 10% next year. If Apple Intelligence drives the level of demand that analysts are expecting, these estimates could prove conservative and fuel Apple stock higher toward the end of the year.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAfter rocketing 128% higher in 2023, shares of Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) are effectively flat so far in 2024. But this top chip supplier has a few catalysts on the horizon that could send the stock to new highs.\n\nAMD's new MI300 AI chip is doing very well in the data center market. The company's data center revenue grew 80% year over year in the first quarter. However, the rest of the business has seen mixed results, which explains the stock's subpar performance this year. However, improving growth in some of the company's other markets could open the floodgates for accelerating revenue growth heading into 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nCitigroup sees a path for the stock to move higher over the next year. The firm sees AMD benefiting from continued growth in the AI chip market, in addition to improving chip demand for PCs. On that note, AMD is working with Microsoft to optimize its Ryzen processors for new AI experiences coming to PCs.\n\n\"We see AI as the biggest inflection point in PC since the internet with the ability to deliver unprecedented productivity and usability gains,\" CEO Lisa Su said on the first-quarter earnings call.\n\nAnalysts currently expect earnings to increase by 31% this year before jumping 59% in 2025. As the end of the year approaches and investors turn their attention to next year's growth estimates, AMD stock could move sharply higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has reached a tentative collective bargaining agreement with retail employees in Maryland, the International Association of Machinists said Friday, a first for the company’s US stores.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Risks Losing Voters He Needs With Loaded Attacks on Harris Paris Sticks to Olympics Opening Event Plans After Rail Sabotage Fed’s Favored Price Gauge Rises at Mild Pace, Spending Holds Up JD Vance’s ‘Cat Ladies’ Insult Sparks Criticism of Trump’s VP Pick Kamala Harris Narrows Gap With Trump in Polls From Her First Week\n\nThe deal is subject to approval by the roughly 85 employees in the bargaining unit, who are slated to vote on it Aug. 6. The agreement includes rules about scheduling, severance, and sub-contracting, and requires that any discipline not be “arbitrary, capricious or without merit,” an IAM spokesperson said. The three-year deal will increase pay by an average of 10% and maintains the status quo on healthcare, retirement, and staffing, according to the union.\n\nThe Maryland store is one of two unionized sites among Apple’s roughly 270 US locations. Both were organized in 2022, and since then contract talks have also been underway at an Oklahoma City store that unionized with the Communications Workers of America.\n\nBoth IAM and CWA have been attempting to expand their footholds to other Apple locations around the country, but efforts have so far come up short. Employees’ assessments of what their peers in Maryland won in their contract talks could either ignite or subdue interest in organizing other stores.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the IAM’s negotiating committee said it planned to “build on this success in store after store and grow the power” it created at the Towson, Maryland site. “We are giving our members a voice in their futures and a strong first step toward further gains.”\n\nIn May, employees at the Towson store voted to authorize a potential strike, accusing the company of refusing to fairly negotiate.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the deal. The company has said it was committed to engaging with the union “respectfully and in good faith.”\n\nIn the ongoing Oklahoma contract talks, only a few issues remain outstanding, according to employee Michael Forsythe, a member of CWA’s bargaining committee. “We view the news of Towson’s contract as a very positive thing for us,” Forsythe said in a text message.\n\nApple is one of many prominent workplaces where unions have scored landmark US organizing victories since the start of the pandemic, including Microsoft Corp.’s gaming studios, an Amazon.com Inc. warehouse, a Volkswagen AG plant, a Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. restaurant, and hundreds of Starbucks Corp. cafes.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost of those unions have yet to reach collective bargaining agreements.\n\n(Updates with union and company comment starting in second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Miseducation of America’s Nurse Practitioners Joe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy’s New Kingmaker The $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Disney Bets on Deadpool, Wolverine and Dirty Jokes to Save Marvel The US Economy Is Slowing, Which Is Just Fine With the Fed\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Between 2015 and 2021, Asia accounted for 57% of global GDP growth. In 2021, it contributed 42% of the world's GDP (at purchasing power parity), surpassing any other region. Asia's dominance in global trade is evident, as it accounted for 53% of global goods trade in 2021, and 59% of trade growth between 2001 and 2021. According to a report by McKinsey, Asian corporations contribute approximately $19 trillion to the global economy annually. The continent is home to some of the world's largest corporations, including semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Back in 2000, Asia accounted for less than one-third of the world’s GDP in purchasing power parity terms. However, by 2040, the continent is expected to constitute more than 50% of the global economy. Additionally, by that time, Asia will also account for about 40% of the world’s consumption. China's role is particularly significant, with 56% of the value flowing through the 20 largest global trade corridors involving China in 2021.\n\nNarrowing on South Asia, the sub-region is projected to experience strong growth at 6.0% in 2024, primarily fueled by robust growth in India and economic recoveries in Pakistan and Sri Lanka. However, persistent structural challenges threaten sustained growth, hindering job creation and climate resilience. That said, the Jobs for Resilience report suggests that the region will remain the fastest-growing in the world for the next few years, with growth projected at 6.1% in 2025. However, despite this positive outlook, South Asia still faces significant challenges. Many countries in the region lack economic freedom, political stability, financial transparency, comprehensive market and labor reforms, and sufficient GDP growth. Growth in most countries remains below pre-pandemic levels and is heavily reliant on public spending. Additionally, private investment growth has slowed sharply across the region, and job creation is insufficient to keep pace with the rapidly increasing working-age population.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the past decade, numerous large corporations have outsourced parts of their operations to Asian countries. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), for example, is deepening its engagement with China while also expanding production in Southeast Asia and India, highlighting the company's delicate balancing act between political pressures and business needs. In 2023, the company increased its number of China-based suppliers and manufacturing sites, reducing its dependence on suppliers from Taiwan, the U.S., Japan, and South Korea. Since 2020, Chinese suppliers have become the largest group within Apple’s supplier network, growing to 52 in the past year from 48 in 2022. As Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) accelerates its supply chain shift to Southeast Asia amid the ongoing U.S.-China tech conflict, its ties with China continue to strengthen. Moreover, CEO Tim Cook emphasized the company's success in South Asian markets, achieving all-time records in countries such as India. Analysts predict that in the coming years, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will increasingly focus on countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and India, which are expected to become significant contributors to the company's global market share. The Most Respected Country in Asia in 2024\n\nPhoto by Jezael Melgoza on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the most respected countries in Asia, we utilized the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Human Rights Index (V-Dem 2023). By averaging the scores from both indices, we derived an overall index score. The HDI evaluates a country's well-being through factors such as education, life expectancy, and income. In contrast, the Human Rights Index assesses respect for human rights, emphasizing civil liberties and political freedoms, providing a comprehensive view that complements the HDI. A country excelling in both indices demonstrates a balanced approach, reflecting a society where individuals thrive economically and within a framework of justice and fairness. Such nations are globally respected for valuing both human development and human rights.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nThe Most Respected Country in Asia in 2024\n\n1. Japan\n\nHuman Development Index: 0.920\n\nHuman Rights Index: 0.93\n\nInsider Monkey Average: 0.925\n\nJapan tops our list as the most respected country in Asia, a reputation built on its innovation and manufacturing prowess. These strengths have helped Japan become one of the largest economies in the world, evidenced by Japan's per capita GDP reaching over $52,000 per year in 2023. With an average salary of $45,000, it is also among the countries with the highest average salaries in Asia.\n\nRegarding tourism, more than 14.5 million people visited Japan in the first five months of this year, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. This represents a 70% increase compared to the same period last year and puts Japan on track to surpass 2019's record of 31 million visitors.\n\nCurious to learn about other most respected Asian countries?

        "content": "The 2024 Q2 earnings season continues to roll on, with next week’s reporting docket stacked with many notable names. The period has remained positive so far, with the big banks’ results not causing any spooks.\n\nConcerning next week’s docket, several Mag 7 members, including Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, and Apple AAPL, all report. All three stocks have been big-time performers in 2024, with many wondering if their momentum can continue.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at how they stack up heading into the releases.\n\nApple’s China Sales in Focus\n\nApple shares were scrutinized for their slow start to 2024 but have picked up considerable steam lately, up 14% overall YTD. Worries surrounding China and falling behind in AI weighed on performance, though these concerns seem to have temporarily subsided.\n\nThe stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with earnings expectations for the period to be reported ticking higher over the last several months. The $1.34 expected suggests a 6% climb from the year-ago period, with sales also expected to be up 2.7% Y/Y. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company experienced woes in China throughout its latest period, but overall, sales came in much closer to expectations relative to other periods, missing our consensus estimate by $220 million vs. a $2.5 billion miss in the previous period.\n\nIn addition, favorable news surrounding iPhone shipments in China has been announced over recent weeks, further easing fears. Investors will also be focused on the company’s Services portfolio, which has been a solid growth driver over recent periods and has helped ease reliance on iPhone results.\n\nAs shown below, Services results have beat our expectations regularly as of late outside of one instance. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon’s AWS in the Spotlight\n\nAMZN was firing on all cylinders throughout its latest period, with operating income of $15.3 billion 220% higher year-over-year. Most importantly, AWS delivered great results, with net sales of $25 billion showing 17% year-over-year growth and snapping a recent streak of negative surprises on the metric.\n\nMany had feared a cloud slowdown, which was present for a few periods, but the recent results overall paint a picture of positivity heading into the upcoming release. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings and revenue expectations for the upcoming release have primarily been muted, but big growth is expected, with EPS expected to be up 63% on 10% higher sales. Easing costs and operational efficiencies have aided profitability in a big way, leading to meaningful margin expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that the chart below is on a trailing twelve-month basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms CapEx Under Scrutiny\n\nMETA’s improved operational efficiencies have boosted its profitability significantly, leading to robust EPS growth over recent quarters.\n\nInvestors will be looking for color on CapEx trends surrounding AI, which was also a focal point in Alphabet’s quarterly release. Earnings expectations for the release have ticked higher over recent months, with the $4.69 per share expected reflecting 45% Y/Y growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning key metrics, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Advertising revenue stands at $37.5 billion, 20% higher than the year-ago period. It’s worth noting here that Alphabet’s Advertising business showed great results, with sales of $64.6 billion climbing 12% year-over-year.\n\nMETA shares plunged following its latest set of quarterly results, with the negativity attributed to a higher CapEx guide for its current fiscal year. As mentioned above, the development will certainly be monitored closely among investors, with peer Alphabet spooking some with its higher than expected CapEx.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe 2024 Q2 earnings season continues to chug along, with a notably stacked reporting docket this week. Another period of positivity is expected, underpinned by another strong showing from Tech.\n\nSeveral Mag 7 members report this week, a list that includes Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, and Apple AAPL. Their results will undoubtedly be scrutinized given the momentum they’ve enjoyed in 2024, perhaps reflecting the most important week of the Q2 cycle overall.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Breaking Down Magnificent 7 Earnings",
        "content": "Market participants showed their disappointment with last Tuesday's results from two of ‘The Magnificent 7’ stocks: Google parent Alphabet GOOGL and Tesla TSLA.\n\nThe worrisome aspect of the market reaction to these two reports, particularly to the Alphabet release, is that this could be a precursor of what to expect this week from four other members of the group – Microsoft MSFT on Tuesday, July 30th, after the market’s close (AMC), Meta Platforms META on Wednesday AMC, July 31st, Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL on Thursday AMC, August 1st.\n\nIt is hard to say anything positive about the Tesla report, but the Alphabet report had a lot of positives. Unlike Tesla, which missed consensus estimates on the back to continued margin pressures, Alphabet beat estimates and had a number of other positives in its results, including search and cloud.\n\nInvestors instead zeroed in on the bigger-than-expected capital expenditure figure, which fed into creeping worries about ever-rising AI-centric capex without a timeline for when the spending will start to pay off. Alphabet management’s comment on the capex question that underinvesting represented a bigger risk than the alternative likely added to the market’s worries. A bigger jump in search growth that could be attributed to the company’s AI investments would have eased some of those worries, but that was not the case.\n\nThe capex will likely be front and center in this week’s Meta and Microsoft reports as well. Concerning Amazon, a leader in the cloud space through its Amazon Web Services business, there are questions about the business’ decelerating growth trend in recent quarters when Microsoft and Alphabet are showing accelerating growth trends.\n\nApple has started making some AI announcements lately, but many in the market appear skeptical of its efforts. The more significant near-term Apple questions are about the evolving iPhone trends in China.\n\nReturning to the Alphabet and Tesla results, Alphabet’s earnings were up +28.6% from the same period last year on +15% higher revenues. Tesla’s Q2 earnings were down -45.3% on +2.3% higher revenues.\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the ‘Mag 7’ stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +26.8% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.7% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group’s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +16.8% from the same period last year on +9.5% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the sector’s Q2 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming four periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the sector’s growth picture on an annual basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks leading the rising estimates trend.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, July 26th, we have seen Q2 results from 207 S&P 500 members, or 41.4% of the index’s membership. Total earnings for these 207 index members are up +0.6% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues, with 79.7% beating EPS estimates and only 57.5% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nThe Q2 reporting cycle really ramps up this week, with more than 1000 companies on deck to report results, including 170 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 stocks, this week’s line-up includes a representative cross-section of reports from different sectors, including bellwethers like McDonald’s, Proctor & Gamble, Pfizer, Starbucks, Mastercard, Boeing, DuPont, Exxon, Chevron, and others.\n\nThe comparisons charts below put the earnings and revenue beats percentages for these companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low level of Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentage of 57.5% is a new low for this group of 207 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these 207 companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6.9% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the year-over-year earnings and revenue growth for 2024 Q2 in the context of what we saw in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the following three periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we have been flagging all along in this space, we experienced a notably favorable revisions trend ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season, with estimates for Q2 holding up far better than other recent periods. In the three-month period from the start of the quarter through June 30th, Q2 estimates for the S&P 500 index fell the least relative to the comparable periods of other recent quarters.\n\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.7% on +1.7% revenue growth.\n\nThe expected revenue growth pace improves to +4% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +8.4% on an ex-Finance basis.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Is Loaded Up On These Three Stocks. Should You Be?",
        "content": "Warren Buffett Is Loaded Up On These Three Stocks. Should You Be?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nFew names in the investing world carry more weight than Warren Buffett's. Since taking over Berkshire Hathaway in 1965, Buffett has generated an estimated $690 billion in profit for himself and his investors. That results in an average return of roughly 20% per year for almost the last six decades. Benzinga looks at the top stocks in Buffett's portfolio and whether they are right for you.\r\n\r\nDon’t Miss:\n\nElon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible. With returns as high as 300%, it’s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires. Uncover the secret.\n\nBuffett's Simple Strategy\n\nAnyone with enough sustained success investing to earn a nickname like \"the Oracle of Omaha\" has crafted a winning investment strategy. That doesn't mean that every decision Buffett has made over the years was correct, but he has been on the right side of more deals than not. Looking at his portfolio (based on recent SEC filings), one aspect of Warren Buffett's strategy makes itself immediately apparent: Buy and hold winning stocks.\n\nBuffett's investing pattern shows that he strongly believes in picking companies with high visibility and large market share. This combination traditionally gives companies an advantage over their competition, allowing them to perform consistently over time, even if they have a bad quarter or year.\n\nThat is a marked contrast to some other traders who hit the sell or buy button with every fluctuation in stock price. It's easy to see this strategy playing out when you look at the stocks that dominate Berkshire Hathaway's Portfolio. Although Buffett firmly believes in diversification, over half his estimated $416 billion portfolio comprises just a few stocks.\n\nApple\n\nIn a world of tech giants, Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is one of the bona fide 800 lb gorillas. In many ways, Apple sparked the tech boom and helped turn Silicon Valley into the land of plenty for investors. Throughout its history, Apple has consistently delivered high-quality products to an intensely loyal customer base willing to pay a price premium for the brand.\n\nThey are also estimated to control over 50% of the American smartphone market (according to Statista). All those things make Apple a prime candidate for a Buffett investment. It is a highly visible company with a fervent customer base of largely affluent consumers. This company has become a near-permanent fixture in its consumers' lives through innovations like the Apple Watch, Apple Vision Pro, and the iPad.\n\nStory continues\n\nBenzinga estimates Apple's current market cap at a massive $3.35 trillion. Buffett has been gobbling up Apple stock since 2016, and it helps explain why Buffett is estimated to own $180 billion in Apple Stock. That means Buffett's holdings in Apple represent around 43% of his $416 billion portfolio.\n\nBank of America\n\nBank of America (NYSE:BAC) is one of the nation's most recognizable financial institutions and has been around since the San Francisco Earthquake. Benzinga estimates B of A has $3 trillion in assets and a current market cap of $329 billion. B of A's operations run the full gamut of financial services. It has branches throughout the country that do traditional banking and mortgage lending.\n\nB of A also has a massive brokerage and wealth-management operation thanks to its 2008 acquisition of Merrill Lynch. In addition to its consumer credit arm, B of A has a robust commercial real estate and corporate lending wing. The bank's size and scope of operations make it a fit for Buffett's strategy.\n\nThat helps explain why his portfolio includes just under one billion B of A stock shares even after a recent sell-off. Earlier this month, Buffett liquidated 33.9 million shares of B of A for $1.48 billion, which somewhat lowered the percentage of B of A stock in his portfolio. However, Yahoo Finance estimates that his $40 plus billion worth of B of A Shares still accounts for almost 10% of Buffett's portfolio.\n\nTrending: Private markets have historically outperformed stocks in every downturn of the past 15 years — build your diversified portfolio.\n\nAmerican Express\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE: AXP) is one of the world's most well-known credit cards, and Buffett has been buying its stock since 1991. The company currently operates in over 120 countries around the world. That means its cardholders can charge for goods and services almost anywhere in the world, something Amex has even used as a selling point in its advertisements.\n\nAmex owns and operates one of the world's largest merchant payment networks. That allows them to make money on global credit card transactions even when the card used for the purchase isn't American Express. Amex's massive presence in the consumer credit business also allows it to double dip on transactions by charging a fee to both the cardholder and the merchant.\n\nIt is another stock that checks off significant boxes on Buffett's list. Amex has tremendous market share, multiple revenue streams, and a loyal customer base it has spent years cultivating. According to a recent article in MSN, Buffett owns about $38 billion worth of Amex shares: roughly 9% of his total portfolio.\n\nThe Tale of the Tape\n\nThese three stocks account for over 60% of Warren Buffett's investment portfolio, and his track record of picking winners is hard to argue with. Each of them is a blue chip stock that is a major force in its chosen business sector. So, should you follow this strategy and invest accordingly? That question is a bit harder to answer. Almost all these companies had lower stock prices when Buffett originally bought them than they do today.\n\nIt would be very expensive to load them up today, perhaps prohibitively expensive. It might be easier to invest in Berkshire Hathaway and let the Oracle of Omaha pick winners. With that said, duplicating Warren's approach of buying and holding stocks that have the potential to develop a dominant market share might help you build your own rock-solid, diversified portfolio.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors.

        "title": "With 56% ownership, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) boasts of strong institutional backing",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Apple implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price 41% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have sold recently\n\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 56% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Apple.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nApple already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Apple's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Apple. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.6% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.8% of common stock, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. holds about 5.1% of the company stock.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur information suggests that Apple Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 38% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nPublic Company Ownership\n\nPublic companies currently own 5.1% of Apple stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 2 warning signs  with Apple , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nUltimately the future is most important.

        "content": "If You Invested $1,000 In TSMC Stock 20 Years Ago, How Much Would You Have Now?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), reported its Q2 2024 earnings last week. The company exceeded expectations and posted growth both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The robust performance reflected a strong uptake of its most advanced processor node technologies for high-performance computing, which is vital for artificial intelligence technology-related applications and machine learning. More importantly, the company sees the strong demand continuing in the second half.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nOprah, Madonna and DiCaprio have turned to the alternative asset that is outperforming the S&P 500. Discover the potential of this market before other investors. Earn 8-15% expected returns by investing in fractional real estate. Get started with only $10.\n\nIf You Bought Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Stock 20 Years Ago\n\nThe company's stock traded around $3.56 per share 20 years ago. If you had invested $1,000, you could have bought approximately 281 shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing stock. Currently, shares are trading at $162.12, which means your investment's value could have soared to $45,539 because of stock price appreciation. But wait, the company also paid dividends during these 20 years.\n\nTSMC’s dividend yield is currently 1.45%. Over the last twenty years, it paid around $11.50 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $3,230 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $45,539 and $3,230, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $48,769. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing stock 20 years ago. This means a total return of 4,776.9%. The S&P 500 total return for the same period is 574.24%.\n\nWhat Could The Next 20 Years Bring?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has a consensus rating of Overweight and a price target of $172.71 based on the ratings of eight analysts. The price target implies a nearly 7% potential upside from the current stock price.\n\nEarlier this month, according to our Benzinga Pro report, two analysts raised their price targets on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Susquehanna increased its target to $250 from $200, reiterating its Positive rating, while Needham raised the target to $210 from $168, maintaining its Buy rating.\n\nTrending: Finance companies are leaving New York for this hot city. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nDuring its most recent earnings call, the company provided its Q3 2024 guidance, expecting revenues from $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Moving into the third quarter of 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our leading-edge process technologies,\" said Wendell Huang, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer of TSMC.\n\nGiven the historical stock price appreciation and expected upside potential, growth-focused investors may find Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing stock attractive. Furthermore, they can earn a passive income from the company's consistent dividend payments, with a solid yield of 1.45%.\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "content": "Apple has fallen out of the top 5 ranking of smartphone vendors in China, according to data trackers, marking the first time in years the iPhone maker has fallen so low in one of its most important markets.\n\niPhone shipments in China in the three months ended June declined 2 per cent year on year, bumping Apple down to No 6 on Canalys' list of top vendors by shipments, putting it behind Vivo, Oppo, Honor, Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi, according to a report from the market research firm on Thursday.\n\n\"It is the first quarter in history that domestic vendors dominate all the top five positions,\" Canalys analyst Lucas Zhong wrote. \"Conversely, Apple is facing a bottleneck in mainland China.\"\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nSince launching the Mate 60 series smartphones last year, Huawei has been resurgent in China. Photo: Reuters alt=Since launching the Mate 60 series smartphones last year, Huawei has been resurgent in China. Photo: Reuters>\n\nThe Chinese smartphone market, the world's largest, is extremely competitive, with the top six brands competing for roughly 95 per cent of the market. Apple is the last foreign brand standing in this group after Samsung Electronics lost relevance.\n\niPhone sales have been slumping in China this year amid fierce competition from local vendors, including Huawei, which has experienced a resurgence in the higher-end smartphone market thanks to an advanced processor produced entirely in China that has ignited patriotic fervour at home.\n\n\"In the first half of the year, Huawei was the leader in the market despite the US trade restrictions, further closing the gap with Apple in the >US$600 segment,\" research firm IDC's senior analyst Arthur Guo wrote in a report published on Friday.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\nHuawei, Vivo and Xiaomi all saw double-digit year-on-year growth in the second quarter, according to both Canalys and IDC.\n\nWhile the Android smartphone market in China grew 11.1 per cent, Apple shipments this quarter decreased 3.1 per cent from the same period a year ago, despite promotions that helped improve iPhone demand in the country, according to IDC, which also ranked Apple 6th in market share for the quarter.\n\nAccording to IDC's data, Apple last dipped out of the top five in the third quarter of 2020, Guo said in response to written questions.\n\nStory continues\n\nA separate report from research firm Counterpoint that tracks sales instead of shipments offered a rosier outlook for Apple, placing the iPhone maker at No 2 in China for the quarter with a market share of 15.5 per cent. It was closely trailed by Huawei at 15.4 per cent, Xiaomi at 15.3 per cent, and Honor at 15.2 per cent.\n\n\"Despite a single-digit year-on-year decline, Apple's performance in the second quarter remains impressive,\" said Counterpoint senior analyst Ivan Lam. \"However, Apple is expected to experience a traditional slump in the third quarter, as consumers awaiting the release of the iPhone 16 may delay their upgrades.\"\n\nApple this year has repeatedly offered discounts, as steep as 23 per cent at one point, through local retailers. It is an important market for the tech giant, which has been trying to navigate the choppy waters of increasing tensions between the US and China.\n\nApple chief operating officer Jeff Williams visited China this week, meeting with officials in Beijing and Shenzhen, where he pledged to deepen the Cupertino, California-headquartered tech giant's cooperation with the country.\n\nIn Beijing, Williams was among American executives who met with Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday as part of the first US business delegation to visit China after a key Communist Party meeting this month, which also included executives from FedEx and Micron.\n\nWilliams also met with Meng Fanli, Shenzhen's Communist Party secretary. The executive reportedly told Meng that Apple would increase its investment in the southern Chinese tech hub, praising the city's smartphone supply chain.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Apple slips from the top 5 in China, as domestic brands take all the top slots for the first quarter in history",
        "content": "Apple is no longer one of the top five smartphone sellers in China, according to independent research, as the iPhone is dragged down by a soft economy, new competition, and reported government bans.\n\nResearch released by Canalys and IDC this week measuring smartphone shipments report that Apple dropped to sixth place in China's smartphone market last quarter. Chinese brands now occupy the top of the rankings, with both firms putting Vivo in the lead. Both Canalys and IDC rank Huawei, Oppo, HONOR and Xiaomi in the top five.\n\nApple shipped 9.7 million iPhones in the second quarter, a drop from the 10.4 million shipped this time last year, according to Canalys data. Overall, China's smartphone market grew by 10% year-on-year, with shipments exceeding 70 million units.\n\nCanalyst reports that Apple has 14% market share, a two percentage point decrease from the same period last year. IDC research shows a 3.1% decline in shipments, despite aggressive discounts in the second quarter of the year.\n\n“It’s the first quarter in history that domestic vendors dominate all the top five positions,” Canalys research analyst Lucas Zhong notes. “Chinese vendors’ strategies for high-end products and their deep collaboration with local supply chains are starting to pay off in hardware and software features.”\n\nAnalysts pointed to competition from Huawei as a reason for Apple's struggles. The U.S.-blacklisted tech company has seen a resurgence in fortunes since it released a new premium smartphone with a domestically-produced processor almost a year ago.\n\n\"Huawei's return did have a certain impact on Apple's performance, especially in the high-end segment,\" Will Wong, senior research manager for client devices research at IDC, said.\n\nXiaomi's smartphone sales surged thanks to the release of its new electric car, according to Canalys. Xiaomi started selling its new electric sedan, the SU7, from late-March.\n\nThe iPhone is an important moneymaker for Apple, making up just over half of its sales last year. The Greater China market, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan represented 19% of Apple’s total 2023 revenue and is Apple’s third largest region by sales.\n\nThere's a growing divide between independent assessments of Apple's business in China and the iPhone manufacturer's own statements. Earlier this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that iPhone sales in China grew in the quarter ending March, though did not provide specifics.\n\nBut even as Apple slips in the rankings, IDC notes that the iPhone maker is still in a better position compared to 2020. IDC estimates Apple now has 13.6% of the Chinese smartphone market, compared to 8.3% in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple’s iPhone Drops From China Top Five as Local Foes Rise",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. lost ground in China’s smartphone market in the June quarter after local companies like Huawei Technologies Co. surged ahead.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Risks Losing Voters He Needs With Loaded Attacks on Harris Paris Trains Hit By Sabotage Hours Before Olympics Kick Off Harris Just Showed Why Trump Is So Afraid of Her Fed’s Favored Price Gauge Rises at Mild Pace, Spending Holds Up Great Rotation Trade Sees Investors Dump AI Giants for Less Obvious Stocks\n\nIPhone shipments there slid 3.1% during the period, compared with an 11% year-on-year rise among Android-powered competitors, according to market tracker IDC. That squeezed Apple out of the top five handset makers in the country for the first time in four years.\n\nThe closely watched iPhone, central to Apple’s consumer electronics empire, has struggled to sustain its usual popularity in China this year, with retailers and Apple itself resorting to deep discounts. The country’s troubled economy has contributed to a slowdown in sales, while domestic champion Huawei led a resurgence in Android alternatives.\n\nMarket research firm Canalys reported a 3.9% decline in iPhone China shipments in the period. Counterpoint Research, which tracks sales to end users, saw a 5.7% drop for the iPhone.\n\nJust months ago, Apple seemed on a path to recovery when Beijing government data showed a surge of more than 40% in April and May. But shipments dropped last month due to profitability concerns among its local partners, according to IDC.\n\nThere’s also a discrepancy between what the government and research firms like IDC report. The national statistics track the number of smartphones registered with the government before getting shipped to retail stores. IDC looks at the actual deliveries to retail partners, which is more closely correlated with sales.\n\n“We did see a YoY growth in the April-to-May shipments, particularly April, to prepare for the 618 shopping festival,” said IDC analyst Will Wong. “Nevertheless, the offline channel partners, which were more reluctant to burn marketing money, slowed down the pace in the last month of 2Q24 to ensure profitability.”\n\nStill, assessing iPhone shipments is a difficult task — particularly in China’s more volatile post-Covid environment. In May, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook surprised many analysts when he said iPhone revenue in the country grew during the March quarter, despite widespread estimates that shipments had fallen.\n\nIn the latest quarter, the resurgence of Huawei, whose shipments improved by 50%, and the bruising contest among local players like Vivo and Xiaomi Corp. pushed Apple into sixth place in the market, according to IDC. It came in a quarter when iPhone shipments globally stabilized. Apple reports its earnings for the period on Aug. 1.\n\nStory continues\n\nGlobally, the company aims to ship at least 90 million iPhone 16 devices in the latter half of this year, counting on AI services to fuel demand for its new lineup after a rocky 2023. The company told suppliers and partners that it’s targeting about 10% growth in shipments of new iPhones compared with their predecessors.\n\n“The company is in much better position today in China than it was back in 2020, with a significantly higher share – 13.6% now vs. 8.3% in 2020 Q3 — and almost 40% higher shipment volume,” said IDC analyst Nabila Popal.\n\n--With assistance from Shadab Nazmi.\n\n(Updates with Counterpoint report in fourth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Miseducation of America’s Nurse Practitioners Joe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy’s New Kingmaker The $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Disney Bets on Deadpool, Wolverine and Dirty Jokes to Save Marvel The US Economy Is Slowing, Which Is Just Fine With the Fed\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Warren Buffett Is Raking in $5.26 Billion in Annual Dividend Income From These 7 Stocks",
        "content": "Few billionaire money managers garner attention on Wall Street like Warren Buffett. Since the affably named \"Oracle of Omaha\" became CEO of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965, he's overseen a greater-than-5,200,000% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A). This works out to a near-doubling of the S&P 500's annualized total return, including dividends, spanning almost six decades.\n\nAlthough lengthy books have been written outlining the strategies Buffett uses to build wealth on Wall Street, his greatest advantage might be his love for dividend stocks. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nLast year, the investment advisors at Hartford Funds published a report that examined the numerous ways dividend stocks have outperformed non-payers over the last 50 years (1973-2023). In particular, \"The Power of Dividends: Past, Present and Future\" showed that dividend stocks more than doubled the average annual return of non-payers over a half-century (9.17% vs. 4.27%), and did so while exhibiting less volatility than the benchmark S&P 500.\n\nCompanies that regularly dole out a percentage of their earnings to shareholders are often profitable on a recurring basis, time-tested, and capable of providing transparent growth outlooks. In short, this is the blueprint we'd expect of businesses that'll increase in value over the long run.\n\nThough a majority of the 44 stocks in Berkshire Hathaway's $399 billion portfolio pay a dividend, just seven holdings are on track to collectively account for $5.26 billion in annual dividend income.\n\n1. Bank of America: $1,038,919,522 in annual dividend income\n\nDespite Buffett and his top aides selling nearly 33.9 million shares of Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) stock last week, Berkshire's No. 2 holding by market value is its dividend king. With BofA increasing its dividend by $0.02 per share following the latest round of Fed stress tests, Berkshire is on pace to collect almost $1.04 billion in dividend income from its nearly 999 million-share stake in Bank of America over the next 12 months.\n\nWhat's made Bank of America such a fantastic stock to own in recent years is its sensitivity to interest rates. No money-center bank will see its net-interest income shift more when interest rates change. The Fed's most-aggressive rate-hiking cycle in four decades, which began in March 2022, has been a big lift to the company's bottom line.\n\nBofA's digitization efforts are impressive, as well. In the June-ended quarter, 77% of consumer households were banking digitally, with 53% of all loan sales completed online or via mobile app. Digital transactions are notably cheaper for banks than in-person interactions.\n\nStory continues WTI Crude Oil Spot Price Chart\n\n2. Occidental Petroleum: $903,767,741 (includes preferred stock dividend income)\n\nOne of Warren Buffett's favorite stocks to buy since the start of 2022, integrated oil and gas stock Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY), is Berkshire's second-most-important dividend stock. The roughly 255.3 million shares of common stock owned will generate in the neighborhood of $224.6 million in annual dividend income. Meanwhile, $8.489 billion in Occidental preferred stock yielding 8% should provide another $679.1 million.\n\nThe interesting thing about Occidental Petroleum is that, despite being an integrated energy company that also has downstream chemical operations, it's heavily reliant on its drilling operations for most of its revenue and operating cash flow. This means it can disproportionately benefit, relative to its peers, when the price of crude oil is climbing. The reciprocal is also true (i.e., disproportionate pain) when energy commodity prices are falling.\n\nThe good news for Occidental is that capital investment by global energy majors was slashed for three years during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has led to a tight oil supply worldwide, which is buoying the spot price of crude oil.\n\n3. Chevron: $801,830,950\n\nBig oil stocks are often known for their robust capital-return programs, and Chevron(NYSE: CVX) is no exception. Its board approved a $75 billion share-buyback program in January 2023 and gave the green light for its 37th consecutive annual dividend hike earlier this year. If Berkshire's stake in Chevron remains static, it'll collect north of $800 million in dividend income over the next 12 months.\n\nWhile the catalysts for Chevron and Occidental are extremely similar, there are some identifiable differences between these two energy titans. For one, Chevron is a true integrated energy operator. Although its best margins derive from its upstream drilling segment, Chevron generates more than half of its collective sales from its transmission pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants. Chevron is well-hedged in the event that the spot price of crude oil falls.\n\nFurthermore, it has what's arguably the best balance sheet among global energy majors. It closed out the March quarter with a net debt ratio of only 8.8%, which gives it the financial flexibility to make acquisitions and expand its asset reserves. AAPL Shares Outstanding Chart\n\n4. Apple: $789,368,450\n\nNot surprisingly, the largest position in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio is also a meaningful dividend payer. Tech-stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which makes up more than 43% of Berkshire's $399 billion of invested assets, is expected to dole out $0.25/quarter over the next year. For Buffett's company, this means more than $789 million in annual dividend income.\n\nInnovation has been the driving force behind Apple's climb to a valuation in excess of $3 trillion. In addition to being the most-chosen smartphone brand in the U.S., Apple is in the process of transforming into a platforms-based company. CEO Tim Cook is spearheading this evolution that should see margins improve over time. Further, a subscription-focused model can smooth out the sales fluctuations that typically coincide with major iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nBuffett is also a huge fan of Apple's capital-return program. Aside from increasing its dividend on a fairly regular basis, Apple has repurchased $674 billion worth of its common stock since initiating a buyback program in 2013. Retiring nearly 42% of its outstanding shares has been a big-time positive for the company's earnings per share (EPS). Image source: Coca-Cola.\n\n5. Coca-Cola: $776,000,000\n\nWarren Buffett's longest-held stock is also one of Berkshire Hathaway's top dividend payers. Consumer staples giant Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) has been a continuous holding for Buffett's company since 1988. Not only is Buffett's company expected to collect $776 million in dividend income over the next year from this position, but the yield relative to Berkshire's cost basis in Coca-Cola stock is a jaw-dropping 60%!\n\nGeographic diversity plays a big role in Coke's success. It has more than two dozen brands generating in excess of $1 billion in annual sales and ongoing operations in every country, save for Cuba, North Korea, and Russia (following its invasion of Ukraine). This allows Coca-Cola to take advantage of faster organic-growth opportunities in emerging markets, while still falling back on the predictable cash flow generated from developed countries.\n\nCoca-Cola's brand power is another reason it's such a rock-solid company. According to the recently released \"Brand Footprint\" report by Kantar, Coca-Cola's brands were the most-purchased brand by consumers for a 12th consecutive year. KHC Goodwill (Quarterly) Chart\n\n6. Kraft Heinz: $521,015,709\n\nThough it's arguably been one of Buffett's worst investments in recent years, consumer-packaged foods and condiments company Kraft Heinz(NASDAQ: KHC) still dishes out a hearty dividend. Its $0.40/quarter payout will generate north of $521 million in annual dividend income for Buffett's company.\n\nIf there's a positive for Kraft Heinz, it's that it sells a basic need good (food) and possesses a portfolio packed with dozens of brand-name packaged foods and condiments. Most businesses were hurt by the pandemic, but when people were forced to isolate, it helped boost interest in the company's easy-to-prepare meals and snacks.\n\nThe big issue for Kraft Heinz is its balance sheet. It's lugging around nearly $20 billion in long-term debt and over $30 billion in goodwill that it may never recoup. All the while, the selling volume for its products is declining amid a wave of higher prices. There isn't going to be an easy way for the company to reignite sustained interest in its brands.\n\n7. American Express: $424,509,960\n\nCredit-services provider American Express(NYSE: AXP) is the seventh big dividend payer in Berkshire's portfolio that, collectively with Bank of America, Occidental, Chevron, Apple, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz, will help Buffett's company rake in $5.26 billion in annual dividend income. AmEx, as American Express is more commonly known, has been a continuous holding in Berkshire's investment portfolio since 1991.\n\nThe not-so-subtle secret to AmEx's long-term success has been its willingness to participate from both sides of the transaction aisle. In the U.S., it's the third-largest payment processor by credit card network purchase volume. It's also a lender and provides consumers and businesses with branded credit cards. This allows American Express to generate fees from merchants for facilitating transactions, as well as annual fees and interest income from its cardholders.\n\nFurthermore, AmEx has a knack for attracting affluent cardholders. Compared to the average consumer, the well-to-do are less likely to alter their spending habits or fail to pay their bills during minor economic disruptions.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bank of America wasn’t one of them.

Key PCE inflation data due\n\nThe spotlight Friday will be on the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, which could test market expectations that the U.S. central bank is all but certain to cut interest rates in September.\n\nJune's personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index is expected to have climbed 0.1% on the month, with the annualized figure at 2.5%, very close to the Fed’s 2% target.\n\nAdditionally, “Friday’s June core PCE inflation report is expected to show a 0.2% m/m increase in prices last month, leaving the year-ago increase unchanged at 2.6%,” JPMorgan economists said in a note.\n\nThe consumer price index fell in June for the first time in four years, cementing market expectations that the Fed is primed to cut interest rates, although next week’s meeting is likely too soon.\n\n2. Futures edge higher; weekly losses likely\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Friday ahead of a key inflation reading, but Wall Street remained on course for hefty losses this week, led lower by the tech sector.\n\nBy 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 210 points, or 0.5%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 35 points, or 0.7%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 170 points, or 0.9%.\n\nThe S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed lower Thursday, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average bucked the trend, adding 0.2%.\n\nHowever, all three indices are set to post a losing week, with the S&P 500 down 1.9% so far, the Nasdaq losing nearly 3.1%, and the DJIA down roughly 0.9%.\n\nAll eyes will be on the release of June’s personal consumption expenditures report, the Fed’s favorite inflation reading, as investors look for more clues pointing to a September rate cut.\n\nThere will be more earnings to digest Friday, from the likes of Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL).\n\n3. Apple suffers drop in Chinese sales\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is facing intensifying competition in China, its third-largest market, resulting in the iPhone maker dropping out of the top five in a list of smartphone vendors.\n\nApple’s smartphone shipments in China fell by 6.7% in the second quarter of 2024, according to data from market research firm Canalys, with total shipments of 9.7 million units, down from 10.4 million units in the same quarter last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s shipments have been declining since the first quarter when they dropped 25% year on year to 10 million units.\n\nChinese consumers are increasingly turning to local suppliers for their smartphones, as these Chinese brands aggressively incorporate generative AI into their products.\n\nThe Canalys data revealed that Apple's market share decreased to 14% from 16% in the same quarter of 2023, with its ranking in the Chinese smartphone market falling from third to sixth place.\n\nVivo was the top vendor with a share of 19%, followed by Oppo, Honor and Huawei with 16%, 15% and 15% respectively.\n\n4. Mercedes-Benz (OTC:MBGAF) disappoints in Europe\n\nThe quarterly earnings season is also continuing in Europe, with investors digesting results from a number of important companies.\n\nMercedes Benz (ETR:MBGn) stock fell after the German luxury automaker narrowed its annual forecast for the profit margin in its core car division, adding to the weakness in the sector in the region after Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) reported on Thursday a sharp fall in net profit for the first half of 2024.\n\nCapgemini (EPA:CAPP) stock slumped 9% after the French IT consulting group forecast a surprise fall in annual revenue, citing persistent weakness in its North American market.\n\nEssilorLuxottica (EPA:ESLX) stock rose 7% after the eyewear maker reported a strong financial performance for the first half of 2024, underpinned by solid revenue growth and margin expansion.\n\nHermes (EPA:HRMS) stock gained 3% after the luxury goods company reported a hefty rise in second-quarter sales, demonstrating the continued appetite for its expensive handbags.\n\n5. Crude on course for negative week\n\nCrude prices stabilized Friday, but were on track for a third straight week of decline, largely due to weak demand in China, the world's largest crude importer.\n\nBy 04:00 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded largely flat at $78.28 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $82.39 a barrel.\n\nThe Brent contract was trading marginally lower this week, while WTI was down over 2%, and the benchmarks have fallen about 5% in the last 3 weeks.\n\nConcerns over waning demand in China have weighed heavily, with data this week showing the Asian giant's apparent oil demand fell 8.1% to 13.66 million barrels per day in June.\n\nGross domestic product data, released last week, showed the Chinese economy grew less than expected in the second quarter, and Beijing has unexpectedly cut a swathe of lending rates this week, suggesting growing concerns over sluggish growth in the country.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPCE release, Apple's Chinese sales, European earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers stopped lowering inflation expectations in June\n\nQ2 GDP, PCE data 'not enough to seriously challenge September Fed cut': Evercore\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Mag 7 group has been at the forefront of many market headlines over the last year, with their robust performance and quarterly results consistently exciting the market.\n\nAnd over the last several weeks, three members of the club – Nvidia NVDA, Apple AAPL, and Amazon AMZN – have seen increased search activity, with investors clamoring to know more. Given their current popularity, let’s take a quick look at how each company currently stacks up.\n\nNvidia\n\nInvestor-favorite Nvidia has faced some pressure recently amid a broader cooldown in the AI trade. Still, shares are up a staggering 130% year-to-date, and its earnings outlook remains positive across the board. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe $2.69 per share expected for its current year suggests a 100% year-over-year pop in earnings, with sales also expected to see a 90% increase. The company’s sales growth has been remarkable thanks to unrelenting demand for chips needed for AI applications.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company’s sales on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple\n\nApple shares were scrutinized for their slow start to 2024 but have picked up considerable steam lately, up 14% overall YTD. Worries surrounding China and falling behind in AI weighed on performance, though its recent set of quarterly results brought post-earnings positivity.\n\nThe stock is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with earnings expectations ticking higher across the board. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStrong cash-generating abilities have allowed consistent dividend growth, with Apple recently delivering its 12th consecutive year of higher payouts. Shares yield a modest 0.5% annually, though the company’s 4.9% five-year annualized dividend growth shows a commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders.\n\nFree cash flow totaled $20.7 billion throughout its latest period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon\n\nFavorable quarterly results that have recently revealed a reacceleration in AWS has sparked positivity for Amazon shares in 2024, with the stock currently holding a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nAMZN was firing on all cylinders throughout its latest period, with operating income of $15.3 billion 220% higher than the $4.8 billion mark in the same period last year. As mentioned above, AWS delivered great results, with net sales of $25 billion showing 17% year-over-year growth and snapping a recent streak of negative surprises on the metric.\n\nThe outlook for Amazon’s current fiscal year has remained bright, with the $4.59 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for its current fiscal year suggesting 60% year-over-year earnings growth.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAll three stocks above – Nvidia NVDA, Apple AAPL, and Amazon AMZN – have remained at the forefront of investors’ minds, all holding a spot in the beloved Mag 7 group.\n\nWhile the stocks have faced pressure as of late, their fundamentals remain strong beneath the hood, with outlooks also remaining positive. The recent pressure is likely a reflection of profit-taking after remarkable runs, with recent small-cap strength also weighing on their performances.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Thursday as heavyweight technology stocks appeared to be easing from bruising losses in recent sessions, with focus turning to key upcoming inflation data.\n\nFutures rose after Wall Street endured another mostly negative session, following some disappointing major tech earnings earlier this week. But the pace of losses in tech stocks now appeared to be slowing.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.3% to 5,456.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 19,049.0 points by 20:16 ET (00:16 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 40,284.0 points.\n\nTech steadies in after-hours trade after bruising losses\n\nHeavyweight technology stocks steadied in after-hours trading after logging steep losses over the past week. Selling in tech intensified this week following underwhelming earnings from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), with the latter potentially setting a precedent for earnings from other internet giants.\n\nTesla, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) all moved in a tight range. But Alphabet saw extended losses after OpenAI unveiled an artificial intelligence search engine aimed to compete directly with Google.\n\nTech earnings are set to continue in the coming week, with Microsoft and Apple due on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. Prints from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) are also due next week.\n\nBut a sustained rout in tech saw the NASDAQ Composite close down 0.9% at 17,181.72 on Thursday- its weakest level since early-June. The S&P 500 fell 0.5% to an over one-month low of 5,399.22 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% to 39,935.07 points, benefiting from some defensive buying.\n\nPCE inflation data on tap\n\nSelling in tech was also driven by increased expectations for interest rate cuts, which saw investors lock profits in the sector and pivot into stocks with more exposure to an economic recovery.\n\nPCE price index data due later on Friday is set to provide more cues on the rates front. The reading is the preferred inflation of the Federal Reserve, and is likely to factor into the central bank’s stance on interest rates.\n\nThe reading comes just days before a Fed meeting next week. The central bank is widely expected to keep rates steady, while investors will be watching for any cues on when it plans to begin cutting rates.\n\nGeneral consensus is for a 25 basis point cut in September.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise as tech rout pauses; PCE data awaited\n\nStory continues\n\nJuniper Networks Falls on Earnings Miss, Q2 Revenue Down 17% YoY\n\nEarnings call: Ameriprise Financial boasts record revenues of $4.2 billion\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Warren Buffett Sells Bank Of America Shares, What Other Financials Does He Still Hold?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nWhenever Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) makes a trade, the financial world pays close attention. Last week, SEC filings revealed that Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its position in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), selling 33.9 million shares with a value of $1.48 billion. It still owns 999 million shares of Bank of America with a value of approximately $29.94 billion and remains one of its biggest shareholders. Because of Berkshire Hathaway's significant stake in Bank of America, it had to file a special notice with the Securities and Exchange Commission outside of its normal 13F filings.\n\nShould investors take any signals from this? What other financial companies is Berkshire Hathaway still heavily invested in? Berkshire Hathaway sold Bank of America when it was close to its 52-week high, and the sale could just be profit-taking. However, it could also signal some concerns with either Bank of America or financial companies in general.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nOprah, Madonna and DiCaprio have turned to the alternative asset that is outperforming the S&P 500. Discover the potential of this market before other investors. Real estate is a wealth builder for the nation’s 1%. You can join top developers and invest like an insider.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Is Still Invested In Financial Companies\n\nBerkshire Hathaway’s investments are famously concentrated. The bulk of its external investments are spread across five companies. As of last quarter’s report, 75% of its investment in equities was spread across just five companies:\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) $34.5 billion Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) $135.4 billion Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) $39.2 billion The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) $24.5 billion Chevron (NYSE:CVX) $19.4 billion\n\nWhile it is best known for its credit card, charge card, and travel services, American Express operates as a financial services corporation and a bank. This includes offering personal savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and other financial products through its online banking platform. In addition, the company offers business financing, payment solutions, and expense management services. As a bank holding company, it is subject to regulations that govern banking institutions. Its total loans grew 15% in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nMuch of American Express's recent growth has come from international activity, which has increased by 13%. It raised its guidance range for the entire year to $13.30 to $13.80, up from $12.65 to $13.15 previously, and is targeting revenue growth of 9% to 11% range for the year. On the most recent earnings call, Stephen Squeri said that while they may see some discretionary pullback, the U.S. consumer has been pretty consistent and thinks that will remain the case for the rest of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway tends to shift its financial holdings depending on what it sees in the market. In 2020, it sold off shares in JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), PNC Financial Services (NYSE:PNC), and M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB). When the Silicon Valley Bank collapse roiled the markets in 2023, Berkshire Hathaway cut its shares in U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and Bank of New York Mellon Corp (NYSE:BK). At that point, it added to its Bank of America shares and started a stake in Capital One (NYSE:COF).\n\nTrending: Private credit offers up to 20% APY. Potential accredited investors are looking to capitalize on this growing asset class. Get up to $500 – just for making your first investment.\n\nAside from financial stalwarts, Berkshire Hathaway has stakes in other financial companies. One of the most intriguing is Nu Holdings (NYSE:NU), a Latin American fintech company. While Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Nu Holdings is a modest 0.26% of its total portfolio, it represents an interesting take on where financials could be headed. Nu Holdings passed the 100 million customer mark earlier this year and is now the fourth-largest financial institution in Latin America.\n\nIt's impossible to know why Berkshire Hathaway has decided to trim its position in Bank of America. It could see exposure to a weakening consumer market or other opportunities in the broader markets it wants to exploit. Despite the relatively large sale, this does not appear to signal any lack of faith in the financial services industry. We will have to wait until Berkshire Hathaway's next 13F filing to peer into the company's latest smaller financial trades.\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "content": "$1,000 A Week In Dividends, Redditor Shares Passive Income Secrets\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMany people dream of earning a steady income from dividends, whether they are looking to retire early or supplement their existing income and grow wealth. Reaching specific benchmarks indicates that you are headed in the right direction. One Redditor posting on the \"Dividends\" forum shared how they have managed to amass a portfolio that will earn $1,000 a week in dividends. The takeaways are simple but valuable for any dividend investor.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nWith returns as high as 300%, it’s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires. Uncover the secret. Don’t miss out: earn 8-15% expected returns by investing in fractional real estate. Get started with only $10.\n\nDividend investing isn't like some of the other investing disciplines. It requires a lot of patience and a steady allocation of capital to reach your goals. In this case, the Redditor has been working on the portfolio for 15 years, steadily adding along the way and reinvesting dividends received until the portfolio was close to the magic million-dollar mark. The 49-year-old Redditor has a plan to reach $125,000 in yield from this portfolio and other investments by the end of 2025 in order not to have to touch the principal after retirement.\n\nIt Doesn't Have To Be All High Yield\n\nYou don't always need high-yielding stocks to significantly impact your portfolio over time. The Redditor posted a portfolio showing a yield of 5.61%. While that is a healthy yield, the Redditor posted that the portfolio is a mix of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and stocks and that nothing is more than 7% of the total. They highlighted three specific stocks.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has a forward dividend yield of 2.99% and an annual dividend payout of $1.94. Because of its modest payout, it would take a substantial outlay of over $40,000 to earn even $100 a month in dividend income. In this case, steadiness is a virtue; the company is a dividend aristocrat who has paid out steadily over time. Coca-Cola recently reported earnings and raised guidance. CEO James Quincey noted, “Consumer sentiment in the aggregate is pretty strong, pretty resilient.\"\n\nAnother dividend aristocrat, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), has a forward dividend yield of 3.26% and an annual dividend payout of $5.42. Like Coca-Cola, Pepsi is very tied to consumer spending habits. However, it has additional exposure to the snacks and prepared foods market through its Quaker Oats and Frito-Lay divisions. After the most recent earnings showed signs of a slowdown in snacking habits, the company plans to reevaluate its pricing and debut new tastes and flavors designed to get people excited about its products again.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: Miami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city before that happens.\n\nPopular fast-food chain Wendy's (WEN) has a higher forward dividend yield than the two mentioned above, coming in at 5.97%, but with an annual payout of only $1.00. Goldman Sachs analyst Christine Cho recently called Wendy's a ‘show-me' story because it has made minimal inroads on its push into better breakfast sales. The company recently announced that it is selling its Honey Buddy honey chicken biscuit for $1 during morning hours.\n\nThe Redditor also relies on various ETFs, including the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSE:JEPI), which has a 12-month rolling dividend yield of 7.98%. It has 135 holdings, a mix of technology, financial services, and consumer goods companies. The portfolio also has exposure to the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSE:JEPQ), which aims to provide monthly distributable income and Nasdaq 100 exposure with less volatility. It currently has 99 stocks and is heavily weighted toward Big Tech companies, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nWhile we can't know a person's entire portfolio from a single Reddit post, a well-thought-out dividend strategy can significantly help build wealth over time. A mixture of reliable dividend payers and ETFs for a broader exposure range can yield substantial gains for patient investors.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors. First-time investors with EquityMultiple can now invest in the Ascent Income Fund with a reduced minimum of just $5,000.

        "title": "Universal Music Group stock plunges 20% after streaming, subscription revenue disappoints",
        "content": "Hollywood's top music label is struggling to grow in the ultra-competitive streaming market.\n\nShares of Netherlands-based Universal Music Group (UMG.AS), which represents A-list artists like Taylor Swift, Drake, Justin Bieber, and Adele, dropped 20% shortly after the opening bell on Thursday. The sharp decline came after the company unveiled sluggish results for its streaming and subscription businesses.\n\nThe stock is currently on track for its biggest one-day loss ever.\n\nThe company's second-quarter subscription revenue slowed to 6.9% growth year over year, excluding foreign exchange (FX). That's down from 12.5% in the first quarter—and a miss compared to Bloomberg consensus estimates of 11% growth.\n\nStreaming revenue, meanwhile, decreased 3.9% ex-FX in the second quarter, a significant reversal from the 10.3% growth it recorded in Q1. The company blamed the decrease on \"a deceleration in growth at key advertising-based platform partners as well as shortfalls on certain platforms related to the timing of deal renewals.\"\n\nDeals with social media platforms, a popular option for music distribution, have become more of a headache for the company in recent months.\n\nIn May, UMG ended its partnership with Meta Platforms (META), which was licensing premium music videos for Facebook. Management said that the product offering \"was less popular with Facebook's user base than other music products.\"\n\nUMG also revealed it lost a month's worth of revenue amid its high-profile battle with TikTok over a new licensing agreement, which the pair eventually resolved.\n\nCiti analyst Thomas Singlehurst, who downgraded shares to Neutral from Buy, said although the volatility \"may prove to be temporary,\" he expects \"disappointment to weigh on sentiment\" in the near term. Slow growth? Taylor Smith at the 2019 American Music Awards in Los Angeles. (Photo: REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nOn the earnings call, UMG vice president and CFO Boyd Muir said the year over year deceleration in subscription growth was \"partially due to the timing of price increases\" from its partners.\n\nUMG's partners include audio streaming giants like Spotify (SPOT), Amazon Music (AMZN) and Apple Music (AAPL) — all of which have raised prices in recent years, which has helped UMG bring in additional revenue for its subscription business.\n\n\"The other factor impacting our subscription revenue growth this quarter is the slowdown in subscriber growth at certain platforms, which is occurring while the overall subscription marketplace continues to experience significant growth in subscribers globally,\" Muir added.\"While Spotify, YouTube and many regional and local platforms have continued to exhibit healthy growth in subscribers, other large partners who have been less successful in driving global adoption have seen a slowdown in new subscriber additions.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe executive did not specifically call out which platforms were seeing a downtick in subscribers, but did say the company is \"engaged with all of our key partners\" in dialogue regarding product innovation.\n\nHe highlighted Spotify's comments from Tuesday around its yet-to-be announced \"super premium\" offering, which Spotify said \"consumers are really asking us to do.\"\n\nMuir backed Spotify's thesis, adding, \"Our research and analysis indicate that as many as 20% of the current subscriber base could upgrade to a super-premium tier at a meaningfully higher price point for a compelling product configuration, one which offers enhanced features and exclusive access to content.\"\n\nDespite the disappointments, the company still saw strong growth in divisions like merchandising revenue, which jumped 44% in Q2 thanks to artists like Taylor Swift. Other top sellers for the first half of 2024 included Morgan Wallen, Noah Kahan, Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande.\n\nTotal revenue rose for the twelfth consecutive quarter to 2.93 billion euros ($3.18 billion), representing roughly 9% year over year growth—and ahead of consensus estimates. Adjusted EBITDA increased more than 11% from the prior-year period (excluding foreign exchange) to 649 million euros, or $705 million.\n\nEarlier this year, UMG launched a restructuring plan in an effort to generate 250 million euros in annual savings by 2026, which included job cuts.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Apple (AAPL) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "The market expects Apple (AAPL) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis maker of iPhones, iPads and other products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.6%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $83.79 billion, up 2.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.09% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Apple?\n\nFor Apple, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.23%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Apple will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Apple would post earnings of $1.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.53, delivering a surprise of +1.32%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nApple appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Market Movers: 3 Stocks With Bullish Analyst Upgrades Last Week",
        "content": "Last week, UBS (NYSE:UBS) raised its year-end price target for the S&P 500 to 5,900, attributing the increase to a conducive environment for U.S. equities. The Swiss investment bank also introduced a mid-2025 forecast for the index, setting the target at 6,200, signaling confidence in the market’s future performance.\n\nThe upgraded targets hinge on several pivotal factors, including robust earnings growth, the trend of disinflation, the prospect of interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve, and a significant rise in investments in artificial intelligence.\n\nUBS strategists believe that despite a high market price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, it is justified by the favorable macroeconomic climate. UBS projects an 11% rise in earnings for the S&P 500 in 2024, which would equate to $250 per share. The firm has also increased its earnings growth estimate for 2025 to 8%, or $270 per share.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe outlook for U.S. stocks is deemed constructive, supported by the ongoing trend of disinflation. Moreover, the anticipation of the Federal Reserve shifting to a rate-cutting stance is considered a boon for the equity markets. Strategists from UBS anticipate that the Fed will implement two rate cuts in 2024, with the first expected in September.\n\nInvestment in artificial intelligence is underscored as a major element contributing to the optimistic view of U.S. equities. This surge in AI investment is expected to play a significant role in shaping the market’s trajectory.\n\nThe brokerage firm also suggested that if conditions remain favorable, and with the Fed likely to reduce rates amid an investment and innovation boom, the market could see even higher valuations. In such a scenario, a year-end target of 6,500 is considered achievable.\n\nBut the broader market isn’t the only thing getting upgrades from analysts. Here are three stocks that recently received well deserved analyst upgrades as well.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nLoop Capital raised its rating on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares from Hold to Buy, setting a new price target of $300, a significant increase from the previous target of $170. The investment and research company’s optimism is rooted in Apple’s potential to become the preferred platform for the next generation of AI technologies. This adjustment represents one of the notable analyst upgrades in the tech sector.\n\nThe upgrade follows analysis by Loop Capital’s supply chain analysts, which indicate that Apple could establish itself as the go-to “base camp” for consumers’ general AI needs. This potential mirrors Apple’s historical positioning at the forefront of major tech trends with its iPhone and iPod devices.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccordingly, these previous shifts were instrumental in driving the company’s stock value, and the emerging AI trend could have a comparable impact. Loop had previously downgraded Apple to Hold in May 2023 due to expectations of a reduction in iPhone builds and shipments throughout the year.\n\nThis forecast was validated as iPhone sales faced challenges in the September quarter of 2023 and continued into February 2024. Loop Capital now expresses hope that their current analysis will prove to be equally insightful.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square Stock May Be Due for a Cooling Off Period\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock Inc. (NYSE:SQ), formerly known as Square, received an upgraded stock rating from William Blair, moving from Market Perform to Outperform. This change is part of a series of positive analyst upgrades that William Blair highlighted, noting several key factors contributing to the upgraded outlook.\n\nBlock has made significant strides in simplifying merchant onboarding and has introduced new solutions in various verticals, including hospitality. CEO Jack Dorsey’s leadership is credited with bringing renewed vigor to the company and driving innovations such as the consolidation of apps and the introduction of Tap-to-Pay on iPhone capabilities.\n\nCash App, Block’s mobile payment service, is also recognized for its growing influence as a neobank leader. The addition of new features like short-term loans is expected to enhance monetization opportunities for the company. The analyst further noted Block’s impressive expense discipline.\n\nThe report suggests that the company’s strong operating leverage is likely to persist. Furthermore, there is potential for further growth through Square distribution deals, although specifics of such deals have not been disclosed.\n\nShopify (SHOP) shopify logo sign on building facade\n\nSource: Beyond The Scene / Shutterstock.com\n\nBank of America Securities issued an update on Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP), raising the stock’s rating from Neutral to Buy and adjusting the price target to $82.00, as part of the recent analyst upgrades highlighting several reasons for optimism. These include Shopify’s improved margin trajectory and balanced growth.\n\nUnder the direction of the new CFO, Jeff Hoffmeister, the company is expected to continue its solid revenue growth and free cash flow (FCF) conversion. The optimism is based on factors such as a robust baseline e-commerce growth, consistent market share gains, and disciplined spending on expenses.\n\nShopify, which provides a commerce platform for businesses of all sizes, has been experiencing years of declining margins. However, the company is now believed to be on a path to recovery, with expectations for sustained revenue increases and better financial management.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nShane Neagle is fascinated by the ways in which technology is poised to disrupt investing.

        "title": "3 Promising Semiconductor Stocks to Scoop Up in July 2024",
        "content": "Semiconductor stocks are about to take off in a big way!\n\nThe semiconductor sector is poised for an exciting resurgence in 2024, powered by advances in artificial intelligence (AI). This surge in AI is increasing the demand for more advanced and efficient chips, resulting in considerable growth in the semiconductor space.\n\nAs the demand for cutting-edge chips increases, investors can score big with semiconductor companies. Statista anticipates a strong turnaround in the industry, with worldwide semiconductor sales expected to reach a whopping $607.4 billion this year, a significant improvement from past declines.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, if the Federal Reserve follows through with rate cuts, it could substantially boost U.S. equities. This is especially true for semiconductor companies leading the push for innovative technologies.\n\nTherefore, these three semiconductor stocks have the potential for high returns on investment, making them suitable for any portfolio.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) The logo for Micron Technology Inc (MU) is displayed on a large white and blue building.\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has established itself as a cornerstone in the semiconductor industry for over four decades. This extensive experience is reflected in its impressive track record, with shares soaring by 34.16% year-to-date (YTD) and a phenomenal 241.8% over the past decade.\n\nThe company’s strength lies in its continuous work on memory and storage technologies, particularly for AI applications. Take its multiplexed rank dual inline memory modules (MRDIMMs), for example. They provide stellar performance, which is ideal for AI inference. Additionally, MU introduced one of the most compact UFS 4.0 mobile storage solutions, which improves mobile users’ experience.\n\nThe increasing demand for these innovations has boosted Micron’s earnings. The company reported $6.8 billion in revenue in the third quarter, up an impressive 81.53% year-over-year (YOY). Profits also escalated to 62 cents per share, a remarkable 48% jump from the previous quarter, far surpassing analysts’ expectations of nine cents per share. This marked Micron’s fifth consecutive earnings beat and reinforced its positive trajectory, setting a strong foundation for even more profits.\n\nASML Holdings (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML) is the technological engine of the industry’s most advanced photolithography systems, which produce microchips. These are the brains of everything from smartphones to high-tech servers. Like the rest of its peers, the stock has performed brilliantly, rising 37.5% annually and a mind-boggling 313% in the last five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML recently released its Q2 results, which showed a robust 18% sequential growth in overall sales to $6.8 billion, slightly above market expectations. However, the company’s projection for the next quarter fell short, leading to a stock pullback. That said, the forecast for 2025 seems positive, with greater industry use of EUV tools for AI-driven DRAM and logic markets putting ASML on track for major expansion.\n\nMoreover, while ASML’s stock trades at a premium trailing-year price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50.48x, the company’s leadership in EUV technology makes up for the valuation. Investors should consider buying the dip, as ASML is well-positioned to benefit from the AI surge and beat its competitors in the coming time.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is a no-brainer among high-potential semiconductor companies. As the world’s largest foundry for advanced semiconductor manufacturing, TSMC has seen its stock skyrocket by 72.37% in the last year, thanks to its key position in the AI revolution.\n\nMost importantly, TSMC remains the backbone of AI-related technology advancements. Their 3-nanometer technology (N3 node) is expected to be a high-volume product for years. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) uses all of TSMC’s N3 capacity for Arm-based smartphone and Mac PC chips. Additionally, TSMC is stepping up a notch by establishing a strong new chip packaging plant, increasing its AI chip production capability.\n\nFurthermore, TSMC’s Q2 results demonstrate its competitive edge, with revenue of $20.82 billion, up 32.8% year over year. Their 3-nanometer shipments accounted for 15% of overall wafer revenue. Earnings-per-share (EPS) came in at $1.48, above forecasts by six cents. This impressive performance positions TSMC toward a $1 trillion market capitalization. They anticipate Q3 sales of $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion, illuminating unstoppable growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 China Stocks to Buy on the Dip: July 2024",
        "content": "The Chinese market has quite a lot of differences when compared to the traditional American or Western market. The extent of government and regulatory control and the “communist” nature of the country make it unattractive to some investors, despite large-scale market activity. However, for investors who are willing to put up with the risks of investing in the Chinese market, the companies present offer immense value for money, along with impressive growth potential.\n\nChina’s economy grew at a reported 5.3% in the first quarter, which came after a long period of the country underperforming compared to the global economy. These underperforming companies are slated to get back to analyst expectations eventually, especially because they have just come out of a period of a market downturn and lackluster growth. Thus, in order to profit off of the economic reversal, here are three Chinese companies you should buy the dip on.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba (BABA) logo on the side of a glass-walled building.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) is a China-centered e-commerce giant. It has seven key segments, each in charge of a different part of BABA and also operates multiple websites, including AliExpress. It has also expanded into network logistics. BABA stock is down over 55% over the last five years, indicating that it might be the time to buy the dip.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile BABA has missed both of the previous earnings estimates by margins of around 1% each time, it remains a solid pick. Revenue grew 6.6% year-over-year last quarter. However, this is not to suggest that it doesn’t have issues. Earnings fell by nearly 86%, suggesting that internal work is necessary. With this being said, analysts still predict an average growth rate of 40.2% for the next year.\n\nIt does face some headwinds as it continues to expand segments such as its cloud computing solutions globally. Additionally, as its “Amazon of China” moniker suggests, it controls the lion’s share of the Chinese e-commerce market. As China continues to grow as a country, bringing the middle class up with it, BABA can expect to see an increase in domestic revenue. Thus, use it as an opportunity to buy this China stock.\n\nYum China (YUMC) YUM stock: the yum logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nYum China (NYSE:YUMC) operates and franchises a portfolio of restaurant brands in China, including KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Little Sheep, Huang Ji Huang, East Dawning, and COFFii & JOY. These offer a wide variety of dishes and beverages tailored to Chinese tastes.\n\nYUMC stock is been down 20% over the past six months but investor confidence in this stock remains positive. The stock is currently trading $29 a share with a market cap of $11.52 billion. Analysts predict a price estimate of $51.19, indicating a significant upside potential of 71%. The company is profitable, with a profit and operating margin of 7.49% and 12.68%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome 88% of the stock is held by institutions, indicating strong confidence from major financial entities. It suggests stability and long-term growth potential. The beta of 0.32 also proves that the stock is relatively stable. If you’re looking for a stable investment option to buy on the dip, YUMC is one of the best China stocks to buy.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY)\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is a Chinese multinational conglomerate known for its various internet-related services and products. It operates in multiple segments, including social networking, online entertainment and e-commerce. The company’s popular products include WeChat, QQ and Tencent Games.\n\nThe stock is currently trading around $47 per share with a market cap of $437.9 billion. Shares have fallen over 4% over the past month but are poised for growth. The stock has consistently beaten EPS predictions over the past three quarters, with an average surprise of 11.6%. The company has $419 billion in cash and $374 billion in debt, indicating a strong liquidity position. This suggests the company can easily cover its debt obligations and invest in growth opportunities.\n\nRecently, China’s publication authority approved a batch of 105 video game licenses for July, which includes titles from Tencent Holdings. Additionally, Tencent’s latest success, Dungeon & Fighter (DnF) Mobile, has generated $270 million in revenue from Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store in China since its launch on May 21, as reported by app intelligence firm Sensor Tower. The company’s quarterly revenue grew over 62% year-over-year. All these factors make TCEHY stock the perfect China stock to buy on the dip.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Best Wireless Charging Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Wireless charging tech is set to have an outsized impact on many industries. With the technology gaining importance in the various fields of consumer electronics, automotive, and more, the best wireless charging stocks are expected to have great growth potential.\n\nNew innovations in wireless charging systems, including inductive and resonant charging, have made the process easier. This is especially true for conductive charging. Conductive charging is currently popular for charging personal devices. It is known to be more effective and charges devices quickly, thus being beneficial to consumers.\n\nWireless charging has become popular among high-end smartphones and other electronics where major manufacturers have set the trend. Also, the automotive segment is expected to generate high revenue. This is due to the rising utilization of wireless charging stations for electric vehicles.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo there are many growth opportunities for the best wireless charging stocks. Here are three companies that investors should keep on their radar.\n\nEnergous Corporation (WATT) A close-up shot of a tablet screen with \"IOT\" text and related emoticons in a connected web.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEnergous Corporation (NASDAQ:WATT) specializes in developing wireless charging systems based on radio frequency (RF) technology.\n\nTheir WattUp system can charge IoT devices over the air. The system may prove to be revolutionary in retail and industrial environments. The company has evolved the system from the ideation stage to the implementation level. They did so with actual products in the stores for inventory management.\n\nFurthermore, Energous’s partnership with Wiliot to develop IoT Pixel tags has the potential for powerful implementations. It opens up the prospect of wirelessly charging low-cost Bluetooth tags. This might prove useful in inventory tracking and in the improvement of customer service. This is still in a nascent stage but one day could alter how we approach charging small gadgets.\n\nOverall, I think WATT’s technology is promising. However, keep in mind that the business faces severe cash flow issues. Furthermore, the stock has plummeted 80.67% over the past year. It should investors should only consider the stock with an extreme risk tolerance.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is for investors interested in hunting for the best wireless technology stocks.\n\nQCOM’s WiPower technology is used for providing efficient wireless charging to mobile devices, wearables, and other electronic gadgets. This approach is based on resonant charging. So users can charge devices without precise orientation and even through materials.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm has been continuously enhancing the application of this technology. They have enhanced the charging features and introduced charging of multiple devices at once. Their solutions are made to complement the existing Qi-enabled products. The goals have the potential of becoming the de facto standard.\n\nStrategic partnerships have been made in order to promote the usage of its wireless charging tech, and the company has partnered with auto manufacturers to incorporate wireless charging in automobiles. They are also focused on industrial and IoT applications.\n\nWireless charging is not the only product that Qualcomm offers which makes it a diversified company; however, it is an area that can present growth as the technology moves forward and is applied in various solutions other than mobile devices.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nBeing an investor interested in Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) wireless charging technology, I am interested in the company’s opportunities in this sphere.\n\nThe company’s MagSafe technology which was unveiled alongside the iPhone 12 has completely transformed wireless charging for Apple devices. The magnetic connection allows for proper energy transfer and gives the user the option of adding different attachments.\n\nThus, Apple has embraced wireless charging not only for iPhones but for AirPods and Apple Watch as well, which means that the company developed an ecosystem of wirelessly charged devices.\n\nApple is also reported to be working on a reverse wireless charging system that could enable the iPhones to charge other devices. Even though Apple was slow in integrating the Qi standard, being a part of the Wireless Power Consortium shows the company’s willingness to conform to standards set by the industry.\n\nWireless charging is expected to become more popular in the future and Apple’s large customer base and the premium segment should enable the company to seize a large portion of the value created in this market. It could boost the sales of accessories and contribute to the company’s service segment.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Alphabet’s earnings set the stage for tech’s AI question",
        "content": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) kicked off Big Tech’s earnings season on Tuesday, giving Wall Street its first look at digital ad and cloud spending in the quarter. The company reported better than expected earnings and revenue, on the strength of Search ads and continued cloud growth, but fell short on YouTube ad sales.\n\nAlphabet also continues to spend billions building out its AI infrastructure. CFO Ruth Porat, who is transitioning to a new role as CIO, told analysts during the company’s earnings call that capital expenditures in the second quarter topped out at $13 billion, up from $12 billion in Q1. And the vast majority of that is going toward servers and data centers for AI capabilities.\n\nThe report sets the tone for the rest of the tech industry, as it prepares to provide Wall Street with the latest on not just AI spending, but also how much that spending is paying off in actual revenue.\n\nSo far, Alphabet says it’s seeing an uptick in cloud revenue with some of that coming from interest in AI products. But CEO Sundar Pichai sidestepped a more direct question about when analysts can expect to start seeing a return on capital investments related to AI, saying that the spending is necessary for a long-term bet like AI, adding that in situations like this it’s better to overinvest rather than underinvest and fall behind.\n\nUBS Global Research’s Stephen Ju wrote in an investor note following Google’s earnings call that it still isn’t entirely clear when Google will start to reap the benefits of its AI investments. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., May 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“The benefits [Google] is seeing in [Google Cloud Platform] on AI productization still seems difficult to discern, as is the full payoff that Google should see (we do not think potential revenue benefits will arrive until [the first half of 2025] at the earliest),” Ju wrote.\n\n“So as far as we are concerned, the [return on invested capital] debate remains only partially resolved, especially as we are now contemplating what is a higher [capital expenditure] estimate for 2025 and 2026,” he added.\n\nOther analysts were more upbeat on Google’s AI efforts, with William Blair’s Ralph Schackart pointing to Pichai’s comment that some 2 billion users are accessing its Gemini AI model and that the company is building the model into its own products.\n\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt, meanwhile, pointed to Google’s AI Overview for search helping to drive better customer engagement and creating more monetization opportunities as a positive in the company’s report.\n\nStill, the one thing missing from all of this is a definitive number pointing to how much Google’s AI investments are actually helping its bottom line. Pichai says investments will make a difference, but when exactly is still rather vague.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet is just the first of the Big Tech names set to report their earnings this quarter, and you can all but guarantee investors will be searching for clues as to how those other companies’ AI moves are paying off as well.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) are slapping AI features onto their various products and services. Now we just have to see if they’ll give any more insight than Alphabet had to offer. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose slightly in evening deals on Wednesday, steadying after disappointing earnings from heavyweight technology stocks sparked deep losses on Wall Street.\n\nMajor technology stocks rose in aftermarket trade, seeing a measure of bargain buying after suffering steep losses over the past week. Positive earnings from South Korean memory chip maker SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) also offered some positive signals on artificial intelligence-fueled demand.\n\nBut sentiment remained largely fragile, with uncertainty over the presidential race and an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting also keeping investors cautious.\n\nFocus this week is also on second-quarter gross domestic product data, while the PCE price index- which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge- is due on Friday.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.2% to 5,483.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 19,261.75 points by 20:03 ET (00:03 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 40,188.0 points.\n\nWall St walloped by tech losses after Tesla, Alphabet earnings disappoint\n\nFutures rose marginally after Wall Street clocked deep losses on Wednesday, as underwhelming earnings from heavyweights Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) rattled markets.\n\nTesla steadied in aftermarket trade from a 12.3% slump during the session, as its second-quarter earnings missed estimates. The electric car maker offered middling cues on its plans for full self driving and robotaxis, while investors were unimpressed by CEO Elon Musk flagging progress in developing a humanoid robot, “Optimus.”\n\nAlphabet steadied from a 5% tumble, as signs of slowing advertising revenue and increased expenditure on AI largely offset an earnings beat.\n\nAnalysts were also concerned that the internet giant’s earnings could herald a similar trend in its peers, especially amid fears that the increased spending on AI now appeared to be providing slowing returns.\n\nLosses in the two had spilled over into their peers on Wednesday, dragging Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) down 3.6% and 2.9%, respectively. AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) slumped 6.8%, although all three stocks rose marginally in after-hours trading.\n\nTech was already nursing steep losses over the past weeks, as the sector saw heavy profit-taking after hype over AI drove a major melt-up in valuation over the past year. Expectations of lower interest rates- on which the Fed is set to provide more cues next week- also sparked a rotation into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nThe NASDAQ Composite slumped 3.6% to 17,345.84 points on Wednesday, largely leading losses among its peers. The S&P 500 fell 2.3% to 5,427.13 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3% to 39,853.87 points.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle, IBM advance on strong Q2; Ford slumps\n\nAmong major aftermarket movers, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) rose 3% after clocking stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter. The fast casual Mexican restaurant chain logged strong comparable restaurant sales in the quarter.\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) rose 2.4% after increased interest in AI helped the tech consulting firm log stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings.\n\nBut on the other hand, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) slumped over 12% after clocking disappointing earnings, as automobile sales slowed sharply amid decreased consumer spending.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures limp higher after tech rout batters Wall Street\n\nBattery firm LG Energy Solution Q2 profit plunges on weak EV demand\n\nBoeing finalizes 737 MAX guilty plea deal, US outlines reasons\n\nView comments()",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors soured on the promise of artificial intelligence Wednesday, sparking a $1 trillion rout in the Nasdaq 100 Index as questions swirled over just how long it will take for the substantial investments in the technology to pay off.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHarris Just Showed Why Trump Is So Afraid of Her I Changed My Mind. The Fed Needs to Cut Rates Now. What Initial Polling Data Show About the Trump-Harris Matchup Stocks Get Hit as ‘AI Trade’ Slams Into a Wall: Markets Wrap Harris Targets Trump by Raising Threat of ‘Extreme’ Project 2025\n\nThe Nasdaq indexes tumbled more than 3% for the worst days since October 2022. The list of laggards was a who’s-who of AI technology darlings, led by semiconductor companies such as Nvidia Corp., Broadcom Inc. and Arm Holdings Plc.\n\nThe selloff was triggered by a middle-of-the-road earnings report from Alphabet Inc. late Tuesday that featured a bloated capital expense. The company’s stock sank more than 5% for its worst performance since January. Tesla Inc. plunged more than 12% after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk offered scant details about his company’s self-driving vehicle initiative.\n\n“The overarching concern is, where is the ROI on all the AI infrastructure spending?” said Alec Young, chief investment strategist at Mapsignals. “There’s a pretty insane amount of money being spent. Maybe it’ll pay off in a few years. But I think investors realize that the payoff is going to take time to materialize and the hyper scalers earnings are being hurt in the short term by how much they’re spending on it.”\n\nAs a result, traders are now paying more to protect against swings in tech. Options volatility on Nvidia rose to the highest level since mid-March, and the premium for puts on Broadcom Inc. is at a three-month high.\n\nThe rout comes two weeks after a cooler-than-expected inflation reading set off a massive rotation from tech winners into companies that would benefit most from Federal Reserve rate cuts, primarily small capitalization stocks. For a fourth straight session — and the 10th time in 11 days — small caps’ performance exceeded that of their larger brethren on Wednesday. The Russell 2000 is up 0.5% this week compared with a loss of 1.5% in the S&P 500 and 2.6% in the Nasdaq 100.\n\nViolent Selling\n\nWhile the rotation from tech remains on display, the moves in tech were violent enough to suggest something else was at play. Specifically, investors appear to be listening to growing chatter in some Wall Street circles that the AI rally that fueled a bubble that added $9 trillion in value to the S&P 500 in the past year is bound to burst. While Wednesday may not mark the start of that, the magnitude of the drop raises alarms.\n\nStory continues\n\n“In the short run, there may be a little AI fatigue, just because some of these investments that the Big Tech companies have made in AI may not be paying off in the time period that investors had in mind,” said Neville Javeri, portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments.\n\nThe makers of hardware used in AI computing suffered some of the biggest drops on Wednesday after soaring this year. Super Micro Computer Inc. dropped 9.15%. Nvidia fell 6.8%, and Broadcom Inc. lost 7.6%. Megacaps also retreated, as Meta Platforms Inc. declined 5.6%, Microsoft Corp. slid 3.6%, and Apple Inc. dropped 2.9%.\n\nOther traders, however, saw the moves as temporary.\n\n“I don’t think you’re seeing anything other than some stocks that have done exceptionally well, have very solid year-to-date returns, seeing some profit taking in the face of not getting a giant beat and raise out of Google,” said Michael Sansoterra, chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management.\n\nThe selloff sent a Bloomberg index of the so-called Magnificent Seven technology stocks down 5.9%, falling below its average price for the past 50 days for the first time since May. It remains up 33% since the start of the year.\n\nAI Bubble Fears\n\nJim Covello, the head of equity research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is among a growing number of market professionals who are arguing that the commercial hopes for AI are overblown and questioning the vast expense required to build out infrastructure required for the computing to run and train large-language models.\n\nTalk of a bubble in AI names was fanned by activity in derivatives markets, where investors piled into bullish options on indexes and individual stocks, especially Nvidia, that acted as rocket fuel during the rally. That sentiment shifted as the rotation from tech picked up speed, and potentially added to the downdraft Wednesday.\n\nLast week, for example, demand for bearish puts in Nvidia outpaced calls by the most in five months. Tail-risk hedges that pay out in a stock crash – perhaps as much as a 30% downturn — were rising at the fastest pace since October. And the cost to protect against a retreat at around 10% or so was at the highest level since August 2023.\n\nTech stock valuations had moved into historically frothy territory. Two weeks ago, the S&P 500 information technology index’s price-to-estimated earnings ratio hit the highest since 2002. Many in the Big Tech group are still priced at nose-bleed levels despite the selloff. Nvidia is priced at 36 times profits projected over the next 12 months, compared with an average of 21 in the S&P 500. Apple and Microsoft are both priced at more than 30 times. That’s raised the stakes for earnings at an awkward time, with profit growth for the tech giants set to slow.\n\nWhile Alphabet’s results dimmed hopes that AI would be a bigger contributor to financial results for megacaps, investors have yet to hear from the rest of the cohort. Microsoft Corp. is scheduled to report on July 30, followed by Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. later in the week. Nvidia, the biggest beneficiary of AI spending, will be the last to report on Aug. 28.\n\n“We are still holding onto our large-cap, quality, growth view,” said Cayla Seder, macro multi-asset strategist at State Street. “Because even if there is trepidation around tech earnings, they are a more attractive option in terms of earnings growth and fundamental strength.”\n\n--With assistance from David Marino, Carmen Reinicke and Alexandra Semenova.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Airbnb Hosts Want Guests to Come to Them Directly Elon Musk Goes All In for Trump The Real Reason Erewhon Is a Cult Brand The US Economy Is Slowing, Which Is Just Fine With the Fed\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments()",

        "title": "Broadcom Stock Alert: Is Now the Best Time to Buy AVGO Shares?",
        "content": "Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is well-known as a leader in 5G semiconductors, but it’s also a chip stock that lags behind many of the top names in this sector — most notably Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe company powers the sort of data throughput and connectivity we all rely on with its advanced chips and RF solutions. In 2023, the company’s 5G and AI revenues hit $5.9 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, out of $28.2 billion total income.\n\nNotably, Broadcom stock has been on a tear of late, nearly doubling over the past year on strong investor demand. Some of this is due to the company’s recent 10-for-1 stock split on July 15, which reduced its share price from $1,600 to $170. Market analysts like those at JPMorgan believe Broadcom has strong growth potential in the semiconductor space due to AI. Aside from that, its cybersecurity capabilities are also strong due to the merger with Symantec and Carbon Black. Of 46 analysts, 83% rate Broadcom stock a buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe question is whether now is the right time to build a position in this chip name, particularly after its recent run. Let’s dive into what to make of this move, and where AVGO stock could be headed from here.\n\nTalks with OpenAI\n\nOpenAI has explored developing its own AI chip, discussing plans with chip designers like Broadcom. The aim of this strategic review is to integrate hardware and software efficiently and address AI chip shortages. The company is recruiting former Google employees for their expertise in Tensor processors. However, the report notes that matching Nvidia’s AI server chips would require years of R&D.\n\nOpenAI aims to expedite AI chip development by leveraging former Google experts. CEO Sam Altman wants to raise as much as $7 trillion to transform the semiconductor industry and advance AI, boosting global services and value.\n\nIf this deal does go through, and Broadcom does play a pivotal role in driving chip design for various AI players, the narrative could completely shift in this sector. That’s more of an outsized probability but it’s one I think investors are starting to at least price in right now.\n\nBroadcom Has Strong Growth Potential\n\nBroadcom excels in data-center networking chips, with an 80% market share, leading in providing high-end ASICs for AI players. The company co-designs custom machine learning chips with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and could add Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a third major client.\n\nBroadcom’s Q2 revenue surged 43% to $12.5 billion, driven by record AI sales, with net income rising 20% to $5.4 billion. Analysts view Broadcom, alongside Nvidia, as essential to AI infrastructure, expecting 21% annual earnings growth through 2026. Despite a valuation of 36 times adjusted earnings, long-term investors might find it worthwhile to consider this chip name, particularly if its growth rate remains high or accelerates further from here.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Broadcom’s ASICs rival Nvidia’s GPUs in AI data centers. Analysts view this as a matchup of different strengths, with Broadcom’s open standards competing against Nvidia’s mixed approach. Broadcom’s strategy is favored by hyperscaler cloud firms, network equipment makers and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThe 10-for-1 Stock Split Difference\n\nGood investments often feature competitive advantages and growth potential, leading to significant share-price gains and stock splits. Research from Bank of America shows that stocks typically outperform the S&P 500 by 13% in the year after a split announcement. Broadcom’s stock price did drop following its 10-for-1 stock split briefly but certainly could have more upside if these trends hold.\n\nI’m of the view that as Broadcom’s investor base widens and more institutional investors add to their positions, this is a stock that could ride its tailwinds higher through the end of the year. While a stock split does nothing to affect a company’s underlying fundamentals, it is something long-term investors should pay close attention to over the near term.\n\nAs a trade, I think Broadcom stock is well-positioned for more upside from here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Bargain Stocks That Can Return 50% in a Year",
        "content": "Investors are always on the lookout for stocks at bargain prices. The thrill of identifying an undervalued asset, purchasing and watching it appreciate in value is as applicable to the stock market as any other market.\n\nBargain stocks offer a lot aside from the thrill of the hunt. Since the price is already low, there’s less room for bargain stocks to fall compared to a stock trading at a high valuation. Such shares can sometimes be companies with strong fundamentals that are temporarily out of favor with the market. By investing early, you’re potentially getting on board with a company poised for long-term growth.\n\nAll of the stocks discussed in this article have the potential to provide returns above 50% based on analysts’ targets. Of course, there’s no guarantee that undervalued bargain stocks depreciate in price. stagnation and declines are possibilities. Nevertheless, these stocks have more upside than downside  and can provide 50% returns in a year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGrab Holdings (GRAB) Motorcycle helmet with Grab logo on a motorcycle parked at the road side\n\nSource: Nor Sham Soyod / Shutterstock.com\n\nPoised for a breakout, Grab Holdings (NASDAQ:GRAB) is a company that continues to grow rapidly on the top line while simultaneously approaching net profitability.\n\nThe company’s most recent financial statements paint a positive picture overall. The company continues to rapidly improve its operating losses leading management to adjust guidance upward. Top line growth near 25%, rapidly narrowing losses and increased guidance create a strong combination suggestive of upward momentum.\n\nGrab Holdings is a ride share super app serving a Southeast Asia region that is growing rapidly. GDP in the region is expected to increase by 4.6% in 2024. It’s part taxi, part food delivery app and part delivery of everything else.\n\nThe region it serves is characterized by favorable demographics as well as massive opportunities due to shifting global supply chains. Those factors supercharge the potential of companies including Grab Holdings.\n\nThe firm could reach net profitability this year and has the potential to double in price based on analyst target prices.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCurrently, Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is either a real bargain stock or a value trap. That’s the puzzle investors continue to try to figure out in the wake of the stock’s tumultuous performance this year. Share prices have gone from $60 to $95 back to $70, then up to $95 again only to fall yet once more back to $46.37. The price chart visually exemplifies the roller coaster ride shareholders have taken with CELH in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nCelsius Holdings has undergone a torrid period of growth. In 2019, the company reported just over $75 million in revenues. By 2023, that figure had multiplied to $1.32 billion. Per share earnings multiplied in the process and Celsius Holdings was suddenly the ‘it’ energy drink.\n\nThe company partnered with Pepsi (NYSE:PEP) giving it a similar distribution network to that Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) enjoys with Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).\n\nRenewed concerns over a weak consumer sent Celsius Holdings plummeting of late. Top-line growth of 23% is expected in Q2 which is reason to take a bullish position. Annual revenue growth is expected to be even higher.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) currently trades near its low target price assigned by analysts with coverage of the stock. It will provide 100% returns if it reaches its consensus target price in the next 12 months. The best case scenario is that the 3D content platform quadruples within that time frame.\n\nAs impressive as those potential returns are, Unity Software has been going through some real troubles. Revenues fell by 8% in the first quarter. Some analysts are concerned that the poor execution to begin the year puts the company’s annual targets in jeopardy. Notably, the company switched Chief Executive Officers recently.\n\nSo, Unity Software is arguably at a low point, and given its strong partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), there is reason for bullishness. Unity Holdings announced support for Apple’s Vision Pro headset and its operating system, visionOS. Apple recently announced its Apple Intelligence generative AI platform geared toward the iPhone. Although I can’t find any evidence of an early partnership, U’s 3D graphical strengths could be leveraged to further develop the already existing relationship between the two.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) is another embattled stock that very well may be in bargain territory at the moment.\n\nOne of the more important narratives surrounding Snowflake is artificial intelligence (AI). The company simultaneously benefits and suffers from AI currently.\n\n“Our AI products are generating strong customer interest,” noted recently appointed CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy. “They will help our customers deliver effective and efficient AI-powered experiences faster than ever.”\n\nHowever, Snowflake also trimmed its operating margin outlook on rising AI costs. Regardless, Snowflake is preparing for growth under its new leadership. Ramaswamy’s strategy to accelerate product growth and velocity is intended to return Snowflake to its former growth levels. Combine that plan with lower lending costs, and it’s reasonable to assume that SNOW stock could look like the SNOW stock of 2022 and 2023.\n\nAlso, investors seem to be discounting the fact that Snowflake will reach net profitability in 2024. So, 50% returns are a distinct possibility.\n\nNio (NIO) The NIO ES8 is an all-electric, 6 or 7-seater full-sized Sport Utility Vehicle manufactured by NIO.\n\nSource: J1TTO / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhat if I told you Nio (NYSE:NIO) was expected to double between 2023 and 2026? Would that make the embattled stock more attractive? After all, purchasing a stock that has fallen by 49% this year is a scary proposition for most investors. You need something really compelling to galvanize action at that point.\n\nThat is the expectation for Nio. The company forecasts that 2023 revenues of $55 billion will more than double by 2026. The company is expected to begin producing per share earnings the year after, in 2027.\n\nNio isn’t a particularly important electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer in China. It maintains the 9th largest market share, at roughly 2% overall. But, the company is addressing increasing competition within the landscape. Neo introduced a more economically priced sub brand recently. It is aimed at providing more affordable options to Chinese consumers. Additionally, the company developed a battery swapping business that radically reduces charging times that continue to present an entry barrier to consumers broadly.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is an intriguing Chinese stock to consider as that market begins to grow with the AI opportunity. The company is the country’s leading search platform and has been likened to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL). Likewise, Baidu offers many other similar services to Google.\n\nBaidu is particularly interesting in relation to AI. The AI boom has been seen throughout the tech market in the U.S. but has yet to reach China with the same intensity. That isn’t to say that Baidu has not invested in AI, because it certainly has. It began investing in AI around the same time as its U.S. counterparts.\n\nERNIE is the most interesting of its AI projects. ERNIE is Baidu’s large language model for various applications including content and search. Also, Baidu offers pre-trained AI models available through its AI-enabled cloud service. At current prices below target lows, Baidu shares offer massive upside potential.\n\nWolfspeed (WOLF) WOLF stock: Person holding smartphone with logo of US semiconductor company Wolfspeed Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nWolfspeed (NASDAQ:WOLF) is a high potential chip stock that arguably remains under-the-radar.\n\nThe company remains focused on silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride technologies. That makes Wolfspeed something of a focused play within the semiconductor sector.\n\nSilicon Carbide chips combine silicon and carbon. That combination results in superior performance over traditional silicon chips. The emerging niche within the semiconductor industry is particularly applicable to the automotive sector. EVs themselves require far more chips than internal combustion vehicles. Wolfspeed is well positioned to capitalize on the rebound in the EV sector which is evident in projections for 2025 and beyond.\n\nAnd, Wolfspeed’s expertise and focus on SiC technology makes it a targeted play on the EV rebound moving forward. If the expected surge in demand for SiC materializes, then WOLF stock will surely benefit. SiC technology is still in the early stages of development, which adds an additional risk factor to WOLF stock. Nonetheless, the potential is great.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com - According to an analyst note from UBS on Wednesday, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) could be working on a \"foldable\" iPhone that could be released as early as 2026. The Information's website suggests that Apple is developing a foldable iPhone that folds widthwise like a clamshell, similar to the Samsung (KS:005930) Galaxy Z Flip.\n\nHowever, consumer preference for a foldable device remains low as per UBS's analysis. In a smartphone survey powered by UBS Evidence Lab, involving approximately 7,500 respondents, it was found that a broken phone, battery wearing out, and a phone running slowly are the primary reasons driving an upgrade.\n\nNotably, a \"foldable\" smartphone was the only attribute that registered a negative net score (-22%). Approximately 83% of respondents cited \"battery life\" as the key driver, followed by price at 79% and network quality at 78%.\n\n⚠️Track your favorite companies with InvestingPro! Our Summer Sale is now on, use coupon code INVPRODEAL and save over 50%!⚠️\n\nTo date, foldable volumes are a tiny percentage of the smartphone market. On a trailing 12-month basis through the end of May, UBS estimates the global smartphone market was roughly 1.2 billion units.\n\nOver the same period, Samsung, the most aggressive vendor selling foldable/flip devices, sold just around 8 million \"foldable\" devices, largely driven by the Galaxy Z Flip 5.\n\nThis translates to less than 70 basis points of the total smartphone market, hardly an endorsement of the form factor in UBS's view.\n\nOther vendors like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with its Pixel Fold also witnessed limited success, selling only approximately 250,000 units on an LTM basis.\n\nAnalysts at UBS maintained their Neutral rating for Apple, with a price target of $190\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUBS: \"Foldable iPhones\" not likely to drive iPhone demand\n\nAmeriprise posts in-line Q2 earnings, revenue falls short\n\n'Fear gauge' hits three-month high as US stocks sell off\n\nView comments()",

        "title": "The hot AI trade is entering a danger zone: Morgan Stanley chief investment officer",
        "content": "One of Wall Street's most influential strategists is sounding the alarm bell on the red-hot AI trade.\n\n\"AI is sucking all of the oxygen out of the room. But now I think we are entering that dangerous part of the story where we need to see it in the numbers,\" Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson said on my Opening Bid podcast (see the video above or listen here).\n\nWilson is credited with numerous big calls on the market, such as the 2022 \"rolling correction\" in stocks — a term he created. More recently, Wilson called out the potential for a 10% stock market correction in the third quarter as investors grow worried about the election and seasonal effects gain hold.\n\nWarned Wilson, \"I see AI everywhere, except in the numbers. Outside of a few companies where it's obviously been dramatic, it hasn't really driven revenues and earnings anywhere.\"\n\nWilson may be on to the start of a key trend that unsettles many AI bulls.\n\nIn late May, Salesforce (CRM) shares were slammed as the company's quarterly sales missed analyst estimates; it served up a lackluster outlook.\n\nAnalysts said Salesforce was seeing a slower-than-expected uptake of its various new AI tools, weighing on its outlook.\n\nAnother AI play, ServiceNow (NOW), had its stock slapped with a rare Sell rating in early June by Guggenheim.\n\nThe reason?\n\nNot enough AI lift in the business to justify the stock's premium valuation.\n\n\"ServiceNow seems to be expecting an uptick in GenAI business in the second half, but our field work indicates this is not likely until 2025, if ever. Partner checks were generally positive for 2Q, but not as positive as they usually are. Several partners expressed concern about 2H24, especially since GenAI monetization is not happening en masse and is not likely to materialize this year, as management has suggested it would,\" Guggenheim analyst John Difucci said in his note to clients.\n\nShaking the AI bulls may take more evidence, however. And it's not without good reason when looking at an AI juggernaut such as Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nOn June 18, Nvidia reached a market cap of $3.34 trillion, making it the highest-valued company globally — briefly surpassing Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). The company's stock has dropped a touch since then, but the market value still hovers around the $3 trillion mark.\n\nVeteran tech strategist Eric Jackson told me on Opening Bid that Nvidia's stock could double before year-end on the back of a shockingly positive quarter this summer.\n\nTesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk wouldn't be surprised by that.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I'm incredibly impressed by Nvidia's execution and the capability of their hardware. And what we are seeing is that the demand for Nvidia hardware is so high that it's often difficult to get the GPUs. And there just seems this, I guess I'm quite concerned about actually being able to get state-of-the-art Nvidia GPUs when we want them,\" Musk told investors on his earnings call Tuesday evening.\n\nConcluded Morgan Stanley's Wilson, \"So it's not so much that AI is not a real theme, it's just that the expectations got ahead of the timing of this development.\"\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business on Opening Bid.

        "content": "Tesla TSLA and Alphabet GOOGL, two of the magnificent 7 stocks, recently reported their quarterly results. While TSLA’s second-quarter 2024 earnings of 52 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.13%, GOOGL reported second-quarter earnings of $1.89 per share, beating the consensus mark by 2.16%.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the magnificent 7 stocks — Meta Platforms META, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon.com AMZN, Apple AAPL and NVIDIA NVDA — are set to report their quarterly results in a few days.\r\n\r\nFollowing the unimpressive second-quarter results, TSLA shares were down roughly 7% in pre-market trading. Alphabet shares are down 2% pre-market. However, GOOGL shares have returned 30.2% year to date.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, META, MSFT, AMZN, AAPL and NVDA have returned 38.1%, 18.3%, 22.7%, 16.9% and 148.6%, respectively, over the same timeframe.\n\nYTD Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI Proliferation Aiding Magnificient 7\n\nThe magnificent 7 has been benefiting from the massive proliferation of AI. Demand for AI is escalating, and that has increased the need for data center capacity expansion. The advent of generative AI has further attracted investments. \r\n\r\nGartner estimates spending on AI software to witness a CAGR of 19.1% between 2022 and 2027 to hit $297 billion in 2027. GenAI software spending is expected to surge from 8% in 2023 to 35% by 2027. Deloitte expects enterprise spending on GenAI to increase 30% in 2024 from $16 billion in 2023.\r\n\r\nLet’s delve deep and find out what the rest of the magnificent 7 stocks are expected to report this earnings season.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has benefited most from the rapid deployment of generative AI (GenAI) thanks to its collaboration with OpenAI. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from its strategic focus on cloud services, particularly Azure and the Office 365 suite. \r\n\r\nStrength in Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes, driven by growth in Azure, Office 365 suite and other cloud services, is expected to have aided top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Microsoft is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jul 30.\r\n\r\nMSFT beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.38%.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-eps-surprise | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nMeta Platforms is set to report its second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 31. META is riding on strong advertising revenue growth prospects. \r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ offerings — WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Facebook — currently reach more than three billion people daily. Its staggering reach and increasing ad impressions (up 20% year over year in first-quarter 2024) make META one of the most important players in the digital ad sales market apart from Google and Alphabet.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ advertising revenues are expected to benefit from strong spending by advertisers as they leverage META’s growing AI prowess. It has been leveraging AI and machine learning to boost the potency of its social-media offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Threads.\r\n\r\nEffective usage of AI has been helping this Zacks Rank #3 company keep its users engaged. AI-driven feed recommendations have been a key catalyst. \r\n\r\nMETA beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 13.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Meta Platforms, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\n\nAmazon is set to report second-quarter 2024 earnings on Aug 1. The e-commerce giant is benefiting from solid Prime momentum, owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive.\r\n\r\nThe strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings are tailwinds. The robust advertising business is also contributing well. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain a plus. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nAMZN beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 48.17%.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Amazon.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nMeanwhile, Apple is expected to report a sluggish third quarter of fiscal 2024 due to weak iPhone sales. Lackluster China sales due to stiff competition are expected to have hurt AAPL’s results, which are scheduled to be reported on Aug 1. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, an expanding user base of more than 2 billion active devices makes Apple’s investment profile attractive. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s Mac sales are expected to have jumped 20.8% year over year in the second quarter of 2024, per the latest data from market research firm IDC. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 5.7 million Macs, thereby grabbing a market share of 8.8% compared with 7.5% in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nMoreover, AAPL shares have been gaining attention from investors thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, at WWDC.\r\n\r\nAAPL beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 4.14%.\n\nApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nLastly, NVIDIA is likely to report its second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug 28. It has been benefiting from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s GPUs are rapidly benefiting from the proliferation of AI. By applying its GPUs in AI models, the Zacks Rank #3 is expanding its base in other untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing, which will support its earnings and revenues. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVIDIA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space, thereby driving top-line growth. \r\n\r\nNVDA beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 18.43%.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Millionaire-Maker Growth Stocks to Consider Adding This Summer",
        "content": "Investors should define their goals before entering the market. For low-risk inflation-beating investments, focus on undervalued blue chips. For regular cash flows, high-dividend stocks are ideal. To build significant wealth, invest in high-growth stocks. The companies I’m going to highlight below are among the groups I’d qualify as millionaire-maker growth stocks, for those looking to generate outsized gains from the higher-risk portion of their portfolios.\n\nThe thing is, these stocks aren’t as risky as many think, with valuation multiples that have come down and cash flow generation profiles that are world-class. Without further ado, let’s dive in and discuss these three names.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most underrated semiconductor companies in the market (in my view) is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). The company’s VMWare acquisition boosted its software capabilities and stock performance, driving strong financial results.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Broadcom’s AI-related revenues are expected to constitute over a third of Broadcom’s total revenues, highlighting its market influence in the world of AI. Collaborations with industry giants like ByteDance and upgrades to VMWare Cloud Foundation for AI workloads underscore Broadcom’s commitment to cutting-edge technology.\n\nThe AI surge has certainly benefited Broadcom in a significant way. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Harlan Sur noted Broadcom holds the second-largest AI chip market share after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and leads in ASIC chip designs. Sur estimated the ASIC chip market at $20 to $30 billion, with Broadcom controlling 55% to 60% of it. Broadcom secured AI ASIC chip deals with major tech companies, further solidifying its market position.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported earnings after the bell on Tuesday, which were a mixed bag. The company brought in 14% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by its search and cloud segments, which beat expectations. However, YouTube advertising revenue did miss the mark, leading to some choppy price action in the after-market session.\n\nAt the time of writing, GOOG stock is down roughly 2% after reporting its earnings. That makes sense, given that Alphabet didn’t necessarily outperform in a meaningful way. However, the company did report relatively strong earnings from its cloud division, which is central to the long-term thesis behind this stock.\n\nIn my view, so long as Alphabet continues to meet expectations moving forward, it’s a stock that can hold its current valuation. That’s partly because, at 25 times earnings, it’s relatively cheap compared to other mega-cap tech names.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the long term, I think Alphabet’s dominant position in search and online advertising positions the company well for cash flow growth, leading to fundamental-led stock price appreciation that may be more stable than other Magnificent 7 names.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeading social media, AI and metaverse sectors, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is truly exceeding expectations through its virtual and augmented reality headsets. The Quest headset, starting at $499.99, became the market leader, praised by critics and consumers, especially kids. It boasted a longer battery life and more applications than competitors like Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro. Rebranded to emphasize its metaverse focus, Meta continued advancing virtual technology.\n\nMETA stock has risen more than 65% over the past year, largely due to the success of its core social media business, but with some investors increasingly focused on the company’s AI and metaverse ambitions.\n\nMeta’s share gains were driven by a 27% revenue rise to $36.5 billion and free cash flow doubling to $12.5 billion. Cost cuts and strong advertising revenue boosted net income by 117% and EPS by 114%. Meta’s dominance in digital ads positions it well for future growth. Upcoming earnings are expected to show similar growth rates, but we’ll have to see how the numbers come in.\n\nMeta Platforms, with over 3.24 billion users, had a strong advantage in product launches. The company also initiated a dividend recently, which I think is likely to grow at a double-digit rate for years. Meta’s rising revenue and net income solidify its position as a leading choice for those looking to bet on the continued growth in online advertising.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Apple’s folding iPhone plans are getting serious",
        "content": "I’ve generally ignored reports that Apple is quietly working on a folding iPhone, because, well, why wouldn’t they be? The form factor is clearly popular with many people—Samsung’s foldables are now onto their sixth generation—and the R&D department at a company of Apple’s size will naturally be playing with a lot of speculative ideas at any given time. Many won’t go anywhere.\n\nBut now it does seem like the folding iPhone will be a thing. The Information reported yesterday that the idea has an internal codename (“V68”) and is in “development with suppliers,” with a view to a potential launch in 2026. Apparently Apple is still trying to make its design thinner, and to flatten the crease in the folding screen.\n\nDigiTimes reports a similar timeline, citing Korean media as saying the device will fold top-down like an old-school flip-phone, rather than sideways like, say, the Google Pixel Fold.\n\nSpeaking as someone who once scoffed at the idea of folding smartphones, before grudgingly relenting on the basis of demonstrable consumer demand, I’m pretty interested to see what Apple comes up with here.\n\nThe design seems to be particularly popular in China, which is a key market for Apple, but also the home country of many rivals in this space. Brands like Honor and Xiaomi are racing to bring out ever-slimmer takes on the category, in the process eating into Samsung’s market share. Their foldables are getting cheaper, too, so Apple will have to deliver something pretty special as a late entrant.\n\nMostly, I’m just keen to see more innovation from Apple. Perhaps there’s only so much you can do with a glass rectangle, but the iPhone design hasn’t seen any big changes since the iPhone X came out in 2017, getting rid of the decade-old physical home button. Adding fancy AI features this year will be a meaningful change to iOS, but let’s see what’s possible on the hardware side, shall we? Hopefully it won’t just be an us-too entry into a field that’s already getting fairly crowded.\n\nApple didn't respond to a request for comment on this week's reports.\n\nMeanwhile, in other Apple news, the Spanish Competition Authority just opened a probe into the allegedly “unfair trading conditions” that Apple imposes on developers who want to get apps into its App Store.\n\nThe antitrust regulator is pretty vague about its specific concerns, and Apple says it would like to understand what the problem is. But I’d be surprised if we’re not talking about similar issues to those being investigated by the European Commission—namely, developers’ inability to freely steer customers from iOS to external platforms where they can offer cheaper deals, and the new fees that Apple is demanding if developers want to offer their apps through third-party iOS app stores.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust like the Commission, the Spanish regulator could hit Apple with a fine of up to 10% of global annual revenue if it decides the company is egregiously breaking competition law, so it’s probably worth keeping an eye on this case.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments()",

        "title": "How To Earn $100 Per Month From Microsoft Stock",
        "content": "How To Earn $100 Per Month From Microsoft Stock\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second-largest company in the world, with a market cap of around $3.3 trillion, slightly behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). In terms of performance over the past year, it is among the top Magnificent Seven stocks, up more than 18% YTD.\n\nMicrosoft has beaten consensus estimates for EPS and revenues for the last five quarters. It will report its Q4 2024 earnings on July 30. Wall Street analysts expect the company to post an EPS of $2.93, up from $2.69 in the year-ago period. According to data from Benzinga Pro, quarterly revenue is expected to be $64.35 billion, up from $56.19 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nDon’t miss out: this property type is nearly recession-proof — see passive income real estate deals for accredited investors.\n\nThe 52-week range of Microsoft's stock price was $309.45 to $468.35.\n\nMicrosoft's dividend yield is 0.87%. It paid $3.68 in dividends during the last 12 months.\n\nThe latest on Microsoft\n\nLast week, a widespread Microsoft cloud service disruption grounded and canceled flights for several airlines, including Frontier Group (NASDAQ:ULCC), Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ:ALGT), and Sun Country Airlines (NASDAQ:SNCY). Microsoft reported issues with its cloud services in the Central U.S. region, which significantly impacted the operations of several airlines.\n\nMicrosoft’s Build 2024 conference in May showcased groundbreaking advancements in AI and boosted investors' optimism in the company’s innovative strides and strategic focus on AI. The three-day event focused on providing developers with in-depth sessions on the latest tools and features for Windows 11 and Microsoft 365. This year, significant emphasis is on new AI innovations and enhancements. Here’s a look at some of the biggest announcements from the conference.\n\nCheck it out: Bezos' favorite real estate platform launches a way to cash in on the private credit boom — get started for just $100.\n\nHow Can You Earn $100 Per Month As A Microsoft Investor?\n\nIf you want to make $100 per month—$1,200 annually—from Microsoft dividends, your investment value needs to be approximately $137,931, around 310 shares at $444.09 each.\n\nUnderstanding the dividend yield calculations: When estimating, you need two key variables – the desired annual income ($1,200) and the dividend yield (0.87% in this case). So, $1,200 / 0.0087 = $137,931 to generate an income of $100 per month.\n\nYou can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the stock’s current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe dividend yield can change over time due to fluctuating stock prices and dividend payments on a rolling basis.\n\nFor instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2/$50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nIn summary, investors may find Microsoft stock an attractive option for making a steady passive income of $100 per month by owning around 310 shares of stock, in addition to the significant gains made on its surging stock price. There may be more upside as investors benefit from the company's consistent dividend hikes. Microsoft has raised its dividend consecutively for the last 19 years.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors.

        "content": "F5, Inc. FFIV is likely to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on Jul 29.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.97 per share, indicating a decline of 7.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for revenues is pinned at $686.6 million, suggesting a 2.3% decrease from the year-ago quarter.\n\nFFIV surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 8.8%.\n\nIn the last reported quarter, FFIV’s non-GAAP earnings of $2.91 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.88. However, revenues of $681 million for the fiscal second quarter missed the consensus mark of $686.9 million.\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\n\nF5, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nF5, Inc. price-eps-surprise | F5, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nThe persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and its impact on customer spending are likely to have affected FFIV’s fiscal third-quarter revenues, especially the Product segment, which comprises Software and Systems sub-divisions. Our estimate of $304.5 million for the Product segment’s revenues indicates a year-over-year decline of 7.2%.\n\nIn the to-be-reported quarter, the Product division’s revenues are likely to have been hurt by the softened demand for its Systems products. Our estimate of $137 million for Systems’ revenues indicates an 11.4% year-over-year decrease.\n\nNevertheless, the FFIV Product segment’s fiscal third-quarter performance is likely to have been aided by the recovering demand for its software solutions, which had been hurt by IT budget cuts amid lingering macroeconomic uncertainties. In the second quarter of 2024, FFIV’s Software revenues increased 28% year over year. The growth in F5’s Software revenues has continued in the past few quarters. This trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for Software’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $167.5 million.\n\nThe acceleration in BIG-IP and NGINX subscription software deals is expected to have remained a major growth driver in the to-be-reported quarter. BIG-IP’s data point performance, automation capabilities and the lower cost of ownership are likely to have helped F5 win multiple deals in the fiscal third quarter. Moreover, FFIV is anticipated to have witnessed strong demand for its NGINX subscription as large enterprises continue to adopt the solution for their cloud and Kubernetes workloads.\n\nAdditionally, the company’s cost-saving initiatives, which include headcount reduction, eliminating portions of its facilities footprint and travel reduction, are likely to have boosted the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for FFIV this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.\n\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate ($3.01 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($2.97 per share), is +1.43%.

But with a high-resolution audio tier still in the works, Spotify is still behind Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) who already have this feature. CEO Daniel Ek addressed this issue during the earnings call, stating that the plan is to offer a much better version of Spotify. Meanwhile, Spotify continued to improve its financials throughout the second quarter.\n\nThe Year Of Monetization Is Going As Planned\n\nSecond quarter results show that the audio giant is effectively executing its turnaround strategy, reducing its costs through layoffs and other saving initatives, improving margins, and growing subscribers while developing strong loyalty with existing ones.\n\nA Sensible Growth Market Strategy\n\nSpotify raised its prices, but accompanied the hikes with new offerings to boost top line growth, including a music-only streaming and audibooks only plan, along with a higher-priced audio bundle of all of its offerings, including music, podcasts, as well as audiobooks.\n\nSecond Quarter Highlights\n\nRevenue grew 20% YoY to 3.81 billion euros which is about $4.14 billion, while ad-supported revenue alone grew 13%, recording double-digit growth across all regions.\n\nDue to a lower marketing spend and lower personnel costs, operating income of 266 million euros or $289 million is a great improvement from last year’s loss of 247 million euros. The figure surpassed even Spotify's own guidance of 250 million euros.\n\nNet income amounted to 274 million euros or $298 million, resulting in earnings per share of 1.33 euros or $1.44 per share, compared to last year’s comparable quarter when Spotify reported a loss of 302 million euros or $327.77 million, or more precisely, a loss per share of 1.55 euros or $1.68. Gross margin came in stronger than expected at a record 29.2%, also surpassing even Spotify’s own guidance of 28.1%.\n\nTotal monthly active users grew 14% YoY to 626 million, but were below Spotify’s guidance of 631 million. Premium subscribers jumped 12% YoY to 246 million, topping Spotify’s own guidance of 245 million.\n\nThird Quarter Guidance\n\nFueled by YoY improvements in music and podcasts, Spotify guided for revenue to grow 19% YoY to 4 billion euros, while expecting an operating income of 405 million euros and margin to hit 30.2%. Monthly active users are expected to grow to 639 million and premium subscribers to 251 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough user growth softened, Spotify overall showed progress in expanding its margins, monetization, posting its second consecutive quarterly profit and record free cash flow.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "If you’re among investors hoping for a robust return of the Trump trade, it might be wise to hold off for a while and stay disciplined.\n\n“People are way too bullish on Trump at this point,” TastyLive founder and CEO Tom Sosnoff told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (see the video above or listen here).\n\nThose jumping on the Trump trade bandwagon are “making a huge mistake,” Sosnoff added. “This thing is going to go back and forth” and could be a money-losing trade, Sosnoff warned.\n\nThe Trump trade is a market phenomenon where investors bet on possible benefits (see lower taxes, fewer regulations) of a Trump presidency.\n\nTechnology and finance were two sectors that flourished during Trump's first term, as did industrials and energy as he passed tax cuts and focused on domestic energy production.\n\nDuring Trump’s term, between 2016 and 2020, the S&P 500 rose by over 50%. The tech sector rose well over 150%, and consumer discretionary rose over 103%. Individual winners were many, chief among them chip player AMD (AMD), which rose 1,000%. Apple's (AAPL) stock advanced more than 365%.\n\nA second Trump presidency could bring a favorable environment for industries such as clean coal, nuclear energy, fossil fuels, consumer finance, and the defense sector, according to Isaac Boltansky of BTIG. Think a broadening of the old Trump trade.\n\nOn the flip side, a Democrat victory looks to favor green energy, global trade, and the defense sector, among others.\n\n“All else being equal, the US economy has continued to grow no matter who controls the White House,” wrote Boltansky in a note to clients. MIDDLETOWN, OHIO - JULY 23: A campaign sign hangs in the window of the Butler County Republican Party headquarters on July 23, 2024 in Middletown, Ohio. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) (Scott Olson via Getty Images)\n\nPolitical headlines have flown fast and furious over the past two weeks, with an assassination attempt, returning COVID-19 reports, President Joe Biden's decision to not seek reelection, and Kamala Harris' rise.\n\nIn the wake of the assassination attempt, private prison and gun stocks went up, while Trump Media and Technology (DJT) enjoyed a bounce as well.\n\nThe Trump trade in full effect.\n\nIf buzz and headlines make investors dizzy, it’s understandable. Still, “it’s not so much about the news,” said Sosnoff, a former CBOE floor trader and founder of trading platform Thinkorswim. “It’s about how the markets are reacting to whatever’s happening.”\n\nInstead of trading “the political house of cards,” he said, “I would just trade as you would normally trade.”\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled, market-focused conversations and chats with the biggest names in business on Opening Bid.

        "content": "From a technical perspective, Apple (AAPL) is looking like an interesting pick, as it just reached a key level of support. AAPL recently overtook the 20-day moving average, and this suggests a short-term bullish trend.\n\nThe 20-day simple moving average is a popular trading tool. It provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period, and is beneficial to short-term traders since it smooths out price fluctuations and provides more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.\n\nLike other SMAs, if a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend. Moving Average Chart for AAPL\n\nOver the past four weeks, AAPL has gained 7.6%. The company is currently ranked a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), another strong indication the stock could move even higher.\n\nThe bullish case solidifies once investors consider AAPL's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 2 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.\n\nInvestors should think about putting AAPL on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimate revisions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) the Best AI Stock for the Long Term?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF.Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nOver the past few months the market has seen a massive influx of AI-related ETFs as investors look to ride the bandwagon of AI investing. A report from Wall Street Journal in June said that all ten AI ETFs tracked by website ETF.com saw inflows this year. One major AI ETF, launched by Roundhill, saw its assets grow to $35 million from under $1 million in just two weeks.\n\nAmid the craze of AI ETFs, does it make sense to start investing in every new ETF? Analysts offer some guidance. A Wall Street Journal report quoted Morningstar analyst Kenneth Lamont, who said that we should look for “thematic purity” while investing in AI ETFs. The ETF you choose, according to the analyst, must be investing in “bellwether” stocks positioned to benefit from the AI industry trends.\n\nThere is a new AI ETF in town. KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), launched earlier this month, tracks the Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index, which captures the performance of AI tech companies. The index seeks exposure to three main AI categories: hardware, infrastructure, and applications. The index picks companies by assigning  AI Exposure Score, which assesses each company’s relevance to AI tech. You can get exposure to AI companies focusing on data centers, LLMs, AI tech to reduce costs and improve customer experience.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the top 10 holdings of this new AI ETF and see whether they have the potential to rise in the coming months and weeks. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Best AI Stock to Buy Based on New AI ETF?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) accounts for about 6.14% of the total assets of KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX).\n\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\n\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in “denial” about Apple’s AI potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 31X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock is overvalued, given Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales growth expectation of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) skeptics have long believed that the company is a laggard in the AI race, but experts say Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) almost always makes its own way and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will come roaring back in the AI competition and surpass Microsoft and Alphabet. The company recently revealed new M4-powered iPad Pro and claimed that its devices, powered by Neural Engine,  will be “more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.” Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Neural Engine is Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) neural processing unit (NPU) that accelerates AI workloads.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "2 Top Tech Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "The tech industry made many millionaires, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index up 385% over the last decade. The market earned a reputation for offering investors consistent gains over the long term as it benefits from innovative companies that never cease to drive their technology forward.\n\nMeanwhile, budding sectors like artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, self-driving cars, and virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) have massive growth potential over the long term and are likely to continue fueling the tech market. As a result, it could be worth dedicating a portion of your portfolio to the tech companies active in these industries.\n\nAs the world's two most valuable companies by market cap, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) are compelling options. These tech giants have long growth histories and heavily invest in some of the fastest-growing areas of technology and are two top tech stocks that could make you a millionaire.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nShares in Microsoft tumbled 4% the week of July 15 due to a tech sell-off that brought down dozens of stocks. Microsoft's declining share price was brought down further by a CrowdStrike outage on July 19 that took down IT systems globally.\n\nThousands of Windows PCs, which are critical to the workflow of many businesses, were affected. The outage also impacted consumers' access to Microsoft 365 services, forcing many companies to halt work for the day.\n\nHowever, the dip in Microsoft's stocks appears to be an overreaction, compared to its potential. The company built itself into one of the biggest forces in tech, with growth catalysts throughout the industry.\n\nMicrosoft's main strength is software, which it has used to achieve prominence in multiple sectors, from operating systems to productivity services, cloud computing, gaming, and AI. For instance, Windows accounts for over 70% of the operating-system market. Its Office suite has become the gold standard in productivity software, with Microsoft 365 amassing 345 million subscribers.\n\nThe diversification of Microsoft's business has led to consistent earnings growth. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the tech giant posted revenue growth of 17% year over year, with operating income soaring 23%. AI was a major growth driver during the quarter, boosting Microsoft's productivity and cloud segments, thanks to generative updates. The company also enjoyed a 17% jump in its more personal computing segment, reflecting a 51% rise in Xbox content sales.\n\nMicrosoft's stock rose 456,500% since the company went public nearly 50 years ago, undoubtedly creating more than a few millionaires. However, the company's history of innovation and reinvestment in its business suggests its stock is still nowhere near hitting its ceiling and is worth considering after a recent dip.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple's stock hasn't been unscathed by investor pullback in the tech market, with its share price also down 4% since July 15. However, the company has some exciting months ahead that could boost its stock, from reporting its Q3 2024 earnings on Aug. 1 and unveiling its next iPhone in September.\n\nMultiple reports in recent months have hinted that Apple could post improved product sales in its coming earnings release. Sales in Apple's third-largest market, China, fell 8% year over year in Q2 2024 amid increased competition from domestic rivals.\n\nApple responded to the decline with a series of discounts in the region, which appear to be paying off. According to a Reuters report, iPhone shipments in China increased 52% in April and 40% in May.\n\nThen in mid-July, Bloomberg reported that sales in India surged 33% in the 12 months through March, jumping from $6 billion to nearly $8 billion. iPhones accounted for more than half of those sales as Apple attempts to gain market share in the Android-dominated country.\n\nData from IDC also revealed Apple saw a 21% rise in Mac shipments in Q2 2023 as a recovery in the PC market spurs sales.\n\nBoosts in product sales are promising, considering Apple has yet to launch Apple Intelligence, an AI platform that will bring generative features across its product lineup. Apple Intelligence is slated for a Fall release, just in time for the debut of its latest iPhone in September. The company hopes its AI offerings will trigger an upgrading frenzy among consumers as the generative features will only be available on newer devices.\n\nApple has hit some roadblocks over the last year but appears to be back on a growth path. Despite a recent dip, its stock is up 35% in the last three months and will likely continue delivering gains over the long term as it expands its reach and develops its AI technology. As a result, now is an excellent time to invest in this millionaire-maker stock before it's too late.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 French Luxury Stocks You Can Snag for a Bargain",
        "content": "After a tough few weeks of market action, the French luxury stocks seemed to have found themselves in the bargain bin. Indeed, the macroenvironment has been far from perfect for high-end luxury product companies. Last month’s French election uncertainties have also added to the volatility wave hitting the names.\n\nWith iconic, prestigious and incredibly old brands at their side, the French luxury stocks are likelier than not to land on their feet. Even if demand stays mixed, the margins of these French luxury firms are the envy of most other firms in high fashion and apparel.\n\nOver the next 18 months, perhaps a recovering Chinese consumer could help French luxury firms return to growth. At the end of the day, China’s booming middle class looks like a secular tailwind for the luxury darlings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn any case, I think there’s a nice entry point after the latest slip, especially for investors seeking to diversify their portfolios beyond the tech sector. In this piece, we’ll examine three top-tier French luxury stocks worth going into the over-the-counter markets for!\n\nHermès (HESAY)\n\nSource: Apple\n\nHermès (OTCMKTS:HESAY) makes a strong case for why it’s the most luxurious of the French high-end brands. Undoubtedly, many middle-class consumers may know the brand name best for being behind those incredibly expensive (but very nice-looking), high-end Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch bands. Depending on the Apple Watch model you go for, the Hermès bands can be pricier than the actual watch itself!\n\nIt’s hard to argue that Hermès is a massive status booster for those with extra disposable income sitting on the sidelines. The name screams extreme luxury. While demand for such splurges could fluctuate as what’s left of inflation weighs some consumers down, I continue to view the name as a solid holding for any portfolio that seeks exposure to high-margin growth.\n\nUnlike Hermès’ upscale goods, HESAY stock looks very affordable at today’s prices. With a strong international growth narrative, momentum in China, and the ability to stay resilient amid economic uncertainty, the name may very well be a top July buy now that it’s down over 12% from its March peak.\n\nKering (PPRUY) A close-up shot of a woman walking down the street with several paper shopping bags. retail stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOf the trio of French luxury names, Kering (OTCMKTS:PPRUY) stock is under the most pressure, now down close to 63% from its all-time high hit almost three years ago. The company’s main brand, Gucci, has endured some tough sledding in recent years.\n\nIndeed, Gucci in the bargain bin seems like a quick and easy way to boost sales as status-seeking consumers look for fancy status symbols at a reasonable price. That said, discounting can cause long-lasting damage to a luxury brand.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s a major reason why CEO François-Heri Pinault seeks to pull back on the discounts as his firm aims to focus more on the high-net-worth consumers rather than aspirational ones who’d be more inclined to buy Gucci attire at a discount.\n\nOf course, discounting isn’t the enemy of luxury brands per se. However, it does entail greater risks. As management better understands these risks, I do view Kering as an intriguing name to buy on a turnaround.\n\nLVMH (LVMUY) Louis Vuitton storefront featuring an LV handbag. LVMUY stock.\n\nSource: Vietnam stock photos / Shutterstock\n\nLVMH (OTCMKYS:LVMUY) is a far more diversified luxury goods play than Kering or Hermès. Despite this, Dior and Louis Vuitton are still the heavy hitters for the firm. If they go down, the odds are that LVMH stock will be under pressure.\n\nIn any case, the two high-end brands have been performing relatively well, even in the face of the “uncertain” environment that the firm cautioned about many months ago. With shares of LVMUY down 24% from their 2023 all-time highs, perhaps now’s as good a time as any to pick up the name.\n\nAt a 20.6 times forward price-to-earnings ratio, LVMH shares look quite cheap as they head into quarterly results with expectations of “flat” revenue growth. Should Chinese demand surprise to the upside, I’d not be surprised if the name were to reverse course in a hurry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held a long position in Apple.

        "title": "Get Your Money Out of These 3 Overhyped Stocks by 2025",
        "content": "The U.S. equities rally seems to be fizzling out. Over the past five days, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has tumbled 4.3%, while the S&P500 has fallen by a smaller 2.4%. Anyone familiar with historical market movements would understand that, towards the end of July and into August, U.S. equities typically post a string of losses. According to Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs’s top tactical strategist Scott Rubner said, “I am not buying the dip,” pointing out that much of the “good” macroeconomic news and the possibility of rate cuts are already priced in. This means there could be little catalysts to keep equities going. Not to mention, U.S. stocks have rallied to increasingly higher and stretched valuation multiples.\n\nWhile the incoming sell-off won’t last forever, there are still some stocks investors should consider avoiding. Certain stocks carry with them much hype that has led to a surge in their prices. Below are three overhyped stocks investors should cash out of before 2025.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir‘s (NYSE:PLTR) share price has rallied 66.4% since the start of the year, and the data analytics firm could very well extend its gains. However, as I have pointed out in a few articles in the past, analysts and enthusiastic investors have branded Palantir as a key artificial intelligence stock. Still, the company’s recent financial performance has failed to live up to the hype. First-quarter results for fiscal year 2024 underwhelmed investors because guidance came in lower than most analysts had expected. This should have put a balloon into the Palantir AI bubble and forced investors to rethink better justifications for Palantir’s valuation. Still, nevertheless, the company’s share price has continued to rally.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Palantir, the firm develops and services the Gotham and Foundry data analytics platforms for the U.S. government and other agencies within the defense apparatus, on the one hand, and for enterprises across different sectors, including financial institutions and healthcare, on the other hand.\n\nIf Palantir’s new AI Platform continues not living up to the hype, it’s surely a stock to sell by 2025.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the magnificent seven stocks, boasting a $3.4 trillion market capitalization. At the beginning of 2024, the iPhone maker’s shares were underperforming the market by a significant margin, for good reason. Apple failed to spark growth in its iPhone sales, and the company also had to worry about the resurgence of an old foe in China: Huawei. Huawei began to gain market share towards the end of 2023, extending into 2024. Apple’s market share in China dropped from 20% in the first quarter of 2023 to 15.7% in the first three months of this year. In contrast, Huawei’s market share ballooned from 9.3% to 15.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s first-quarter results were also nothing to gloat about. Net sales declined 4.3% year over year. Investors have been gleeful about Apple’s announcement of new AI features in iOS and a new partnership with OpenAI to see ChatGPT integrated into the iPhone maker’s voice assistant, Siri.\n\nStill, new AI features will probably not be enough to revitalize sales, as consumers have begun to feel fatigued a new smartphone iteration that’s has little meaningful difference with the prior version yet comes with a large price tag. You should probably exit Apple’s stock by 2025 if you’re a retail investor.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is a Silicon Valley-based cloud networks services company. In particular, Arista’s cloud networking solutions consist of an Extensible Operating System (EOS), which Arista offers in combination with other network applications. Arista’s EOS is essential to helping networks work efficiently and dynamically. The company has also noted that EOS helps with the scalability and resilience of cloud networks. Moreover, Arista offers data center and cloud networking systems, including newer artificial intelligence (AI) ethernet switching platforms and a suite of value-added software solutions.\n\nArista’s development of AI network solutions has recently caught the attention of investors. The cloud networking solutions provider believes it can address the “at least $60 billion TAM in data-driven client-to-cloud AI networking,” according to its most recent earnings transcript. ANET shares have rallied 40.4% year-to-date, but its valuation is stretching, now trading at 41.5x forward earnings. Cashing out before 2025 would be a good idea if the company’s shares continue to balloon.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Best Next-Gen Display Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "With the age of generative AI, well and truly here, it can be easy to forget the technologies that power today’s innovations. Next-generation displays will always serve a purpose in future iterations of cutting-edge technology, making them a key consideration for long-term investment.\n\nThe global electronic display market value was expected to top $173.7 billion in 2023, and its compound annual growth rate was forecasted at 3.7%. This illustrates a valuable industry that’s steadily growing.\n\nThe expected emergence of the metaverse is set to offer digital transformation for remote collaboration and gaming in a way that demands more next-generation display technology.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this in mind, the future is bright for these three next-gen display stocks that are well-positioned to leverage growth on Wall Street over the coming years,\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough the stock has experienced some recent volatility due to news that the Biden administration is set to tighten restrictions on computer chips due to concerns over dealing with China, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) has shown plenty of long-term outperformance on Wall Street in 2024.\n\nThe stock closed the first half of 2024, 84.4% up, and the computer giant has become a U.S. leader in producing gaming monitors to high-performance specifications.\n\nWith the recent unveiling of its first AI-powered XPS laptops, we’re likely to see Dell’s display credentials gain fresh resonance among consumers.\n\nDell saw solid earnings growth in the first quarter of 2024 and better-than-expected sales; however, its long-term prospects may hinge on its performance in artificial intelligence.\n\nWith Q2 2024 forecasts suggesting a 5% dip in adjusted earnings of $1.65 per share, the firm’s ability to drive AI innovation is likely to sustain its impressive performance of late.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts remain bullish on Dell. In a recent note to clients, Bank of America raised its price target for DELL to $180 from $130, citing a clearing outlook moving into 2025.\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s been a challenging year for FAANG mainstay Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Following downgrades and an EU lawsuit in the first half of 2024, the stock showed some strong resilience in the second quarter, rallying 23.87%.\n\nApple is among the most innovative next-gen display stocks to buy now because of the somewhat tumultuous launch of the Vision Pro headset, which boasts a remarkable 23-million-pixel resolution micro-OLED display for each eye.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Vision Pro hasn’t been a roaring success. Recent data suggests that unit sales won’t surpass 500,000 in 2024, but this shouldn’t detract from the technology’s potential for the future of virtual reality, spatial computing and remote collaboration.\n\nAlthough 2024 hasn’t been a strong year for the Vision Pro, we will likely see the technology gain more resonance. With the prospect of the metaverse opening the door to more headset usage, the high-quality display resolutions featured in the Vision Pro could become more prevalent.\n\nAs for Apple’s stock itself, much of its recent outperformance stems from high investor expectations for the arrival of the first AI-powered iPhone, which has seen some analysts predict an unprecedented $5 billion valuation for the stock should its utility of artificial intelligence become a hit.\n\nUniversal Display Corporation (OLED) OLED screen representing OLED stock\n\nSource: Daniel Pieterson / Shutterstock.com\n\nNo company is more innovative than Universal Display Corporation (NASDAQ:OLED) when it comes to manufacturing and researching organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) display technology.\n\nThe company has also been largely successful in recent months, recording growth of 12.69% over the first half of 2024.\n\nCrucially, OLED has shown strength in its fundamentals in recent months. According to its Q1 2024 earnings, the company has generated revenue of $165 million, representing a boost of 27% from Q1 2023. Additionally, earnings per share (EPS) rallied to $1.19 per diluted share, up from $0.83 in Q1 2023.\n\nThis level of outperformance has seen Universal Display Corporation gain several admirers, including Jupiter Asset Management, which opted to acquire 8,989 shares in OLED in July.\n\nWith the generative AI boom and the prospect of the metaverse still offering a tantalizing level of opportunity in next-gen display innovation, we’re likely to see OLED continue to experience growth into the future. Some of the best value could be found in display stocks for investors ready to add long-term holds to their portfolios.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nTesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) kicked off Big Tech earnings on Tuesday with mixed results. Each fell in after-hours trading.\n\nBut for all the hand-wringing about the concentration of outsized gains in the hands of a magnificent few, stock bulls have two reasons to cheer as earnings season intensifies.\n\nFirst, markets just completed a violent rotation that shifted winnings from the seven largest US stocks — Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla, and Alphabet — to small-cap stocks and interest rate-sensitive names.\n\nSectors like real estate, homebuilders, and regional banks are among those now leading the way.\n\nThe severity of the move — which accelerated with the latest weak inflation numbers — shouldn't be discounted.\n\nLiz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, wrote that June was the Russell 2000's worst month versus the Nasdaq in over a year. Yet, she notes that July is already tracking the best since 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, in the land of giants, the Magnificent Seven lost $1.25 trillion in market cap value over seven sessions recently — just as the small-cap stocks started asserting strength.\n\nThe trillion-plus drop in valuation by the Mag Seven represented an 8% fall in price — yet the overall market (the S&P 500) was off only 2% over the same time. Timing is everything.\n\nThe other tailwind favoring bulls is a game of earnings catch-up.\n\nThe S&P 493 (the S&P 500 minus the Mag Seven) is finally climbing out of an earnings recession, as noted by the BofA US Equity & Quant Strategy team. S&P 493 EARNINGS GROWTH TURNING POSITIVE\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) for the S&P 493 have been \"flat to down for the past five quarters,\" wrote BofA, even as EPS growth for all 500 names turned positive three quarters ago.\n\nThis newfound strength for the rest of the market comes just as earnings growth is \"expected to slow for the Magnificent Seven for the second straight quarter and again in the [third quarter].\"\n\nIt appears that even earnings growth is rotating on a higher time frame.\n\nThe very fact that overall market volatility remains subdued despite these tectonic shifts taking place under the market's hood is a testament to the resilience of the bull market itself.\n\nAnd BofA expects the rally to continue through breadth expansion.\n\n\"Given the high correlation between Tech's outperformance in stocks vs. earnings,\" the bank wrote, \"we expect the narrowing growth differential to be the catalyst for the market to broaden out.\"\n\nStory continues morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments()",

        "title": "3 Disruptive Tech Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple: July 2024",
        "content": "It’s hard to imagine now considering that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) represents one of the world’s elite enterprises. Even with the turbulence in the broader technology sphere, AAPL commands a market capitalization of $3.43 trillion. Yet back in the early 1980s, shares traded for well under a buck. And that brings us to the concept of disruptive tech stocks.\n\nNo, not every cheaply priced equity will rise to become the next Apple. The chances of complete failure are much higher than it is to assume that a startup could command a trillion-dollar market cap, let alone over $3 trillion. Still, if you want extreme upside over a number of years, you can’t focus your holdings on the established blue chips.\n\nInstead, you’re going to have to take some risks. That’s the nature of the game – greater unpredictability may yield greater profitability potential. If you’ve got some spare change lying around and are willing to speculate, these are the disruptive tech stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLemonade (LMND) Lemonade stock logo displayed on smartphone laying on top of computer keyboard.\n\nSource: Stephanie L Sanchez / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in New York City, Lemonade (NYSE:LMND) falls under the property and casualty insurance industry. It’s a financial technology (fintech) provider, offering a convenient mechanism for customers to acquire renters, homeowners, auto, pet and life insurance products. In addition, Lemonade provides landlord insurance policies.\n\nFrankly, the old, traditional way of acquiring insurance is boring. Instead, with so many people utilizing their smartphones, it only makes sense that the insurance ecosystem moves over to the mobile realm. That said, there are challenges ahead for Lemonade. In particular, it’s not a profitable enterprise. However, its average loss of 78 cents per share in the past four quarters was smaller than the anticipated loss of 89 cents.\n\nMoreover, in the most recent quarter, Lemonade posted a quarterly sales growth rate (year-over-year) of 25.1%. For fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate that sales may rise to $515.86 million, up 20% from last year’s print of $429.8 million. And in the following year, sales could see a bump up of 28.3% to $661.86 million.\n\nSonos (SONO) Image of a Sonos (SONO) branded speaker\n\nSource: ClassyPictures / Shutterstock.com\n\nFalling under the consumer electronics space of the tech ecosystem, Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) designs, develops, manufactures and sells audio products and services in the Americas and other international markets. Primarily, the company offers wireless, portable and home theater speakers, components and accessories. Given the rise of streaming services, Sonos may enjoy a robust growth trajectory.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile a promising entity, Sonos finds itself in tricky financial waters. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average loss per share of nine cents. It’s not the greatest thing to offer investors red ink. However, it must be said that analysts anticipated a loss per share of 11 cents. Therefore, the “earnings” surprise came out to 3.38%.\n\nA saving grace, though, could be Sonos’ price-to-sales ratio, which sits at 1.13X. In the period between the first quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, the average metric stood at 1.34X. Some context is necessary. By year’s end, sales may land at $1.65 billion, which may be slightly lower than last year’s print of $1.66 billion.\n\nHowever, in fiscal 2025, revenue might rise to $1.79 billion. That would imply growth of 8.2%, making SONO one of the disruptive tech stocks to consider.\n\nInseego (INSG) top Tech stocks to watch : Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing. tech stocks\n\nSource: Peshkova / Shutterstock\n\nOperating in the communication equipment industry, Inseego (NASDAQ:INSG) engages in the design and development of cloud-managed wireless wide area network (WAN) and intelligent edge solutions. Its clients cover the spectrum of businesses, consumers and government agencies worldwide. As a specialist in the field of 5G and 4G mobile broadband solutions, Inseego plays a key role in the connectivity ecosystem.\n\nAs with the other disruptive tech stocks, one of Inseego’s main financial challenges is finding its way to profitability. In the past four quarters, the company posted a loss per share of 64 cents. What made this print not pleasant was that analysts were only anticipating a loss of 37 cents. Therefore, the quarterly surprise sat at 155.6% below parity.\n\nHowever, analysts anticipate progress in this department. By year’s end, Inseego is projected to deliver a loss per share of 20 cents, which would be much better than the prior year’s result of $1.37 below parity. On the top line, sales may rise to $203.75 million, up 4.1% from 2023’s tally of $195.69 million. For those that want to speculate on disruptive tech stocks, INSG should be on your radar.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Foxconn Technology Group, which runs the world's largest iPhone factory in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou, has started building a \"trial\" electric vehicle (EV) plant there, as it aims to replicate its success as Apple's top smartphone contractor when it comes to cars and other products.\n\nThe company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, on Tuesday held a groundbreaking ceremony for an \"trial manufacturing centre\" for electric vehicles in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, the provincial government announced on its website.\n\nThe EV production centre will cater to \"well-known domestic and foreign automobile brands\", with the goal of building the Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone, where Foxconn's biggest iPhone factory is based, into a \"core production base for Foxconn's new energy vehicle segment\", the Taiwanese company said in a social media post on Wednesday.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Foxconn's production activity in Zhengzhou suffered major disruptions in 2022 after a Covid-19 outbreak led to mass walkouts and worker protests over stringent pandemic controls and wages.\n\nThe debacle caused shipment delays for the iPhone during that year's holiday season in Apple's home market as well as Europe, prompting the Californian giant to accelerate the shift of some production outside China, to areas including India and Vietnam.\n\nStory continues\n\nYoung Liu (centre), chairman and chief executive officer of Foxconn Technology Group.

Last April, the company picked Zhengzhou as the headquarters for its new businesses, with plans for a 70,000-square-metre complex with an investment of 1 billion yuan (US$137 million).\n\nIt established the Foxconn New Business Development Group in Zhengzhou in June 2023, with registered capital of 1 billion yuan, to conduct business in EV sales and battery production. Another company, Foxconn New Energy Vehicle Industry Development (Henan) Co, was established in January with a registered capital of 500 million yuan.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Williams reportedly told Meng that Shenzhen is an important market for Apple, which intends to deepen its cooperation with the city.\n\nMeng welcomed Apple to increase its local business and investment, adding that Shenzhen would strengthen its supply chain for the company to produce more mutually beneficial results, according to the Chinese readouts.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

While Apple has joined rival firms like Samsung Electronics in building up production capacity in countries such as Vietnam and India, China has remained a key assembly location for the iPhone maker, as no other country yet has the same level of manufacturing sophistication and scale.\n\nWilliams was among the US executives who met with Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing on Monday as part of the first US business delegation to visit China after a key Communist Party meeting this month. The official statement on the visit did not mention Williams, but a photo published by China's foreign ministry showed him in the group.\n\nThe meeting between Meng and Williams came four months after the Cupertino, California-based company unveiled a plan to open a new applied research lab in Shenzhen this year. The Shenzhen lab is expected to boost Apple's testing and research capabilities in developing important products such as the iPhone, iPad and Apple Vision Pro, with deeper collaboration with local suppliers, according to the company.\n\nApple has also invested in other research and development facilities in the country. It has established R&D centres in Shanghai, Suzhou, Beijing and Shenzhen. Apple said in March that it has so far invested 1 billion yuan (US$137.5 million) in its Shanghai applied research lab, which it is expanding.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile in Beijing, Williams visited an Apple Store in the Wangfujing shopping district to greet staff and customers, Isabel Ge Mahe, Apple's vice-president and managing director of Greater China, said in a Weibo post.\n\nHe also met with team members of Migu, China's digital entertainment service provider, who were at the store to showcase their app developed for the Apple Vision Pro, which just hit the shelves in China last month.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Just Sold $1.5 Billion of Berkshire Hathaway's Second-Largest Holding. Here's Why.",
        "content": "Warren Buffett keeps selling stocks. The Oracle of Omaha has been a net seller of equities for his company's portfolio in each of the last six quarters, as reported by Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). The odds are good he'll make it seven in a row when Berkshire reports next month, and now he's going for eight with another major stock sale.\n\nA recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that Buffett sold $1.5 billion of Berkshire Hathaway's second-largest equity holding, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). The sale represents just a 3.3% reduction in Berkshire's stake in the bank but could be just the start.\n\nThere's no doubt Bank of America has been a very successful investment for Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. And Buffett is famously quoted as saying his favorite investment holding period is \"forever.\" So why is he selling shares now? Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nTaking the money out of the bank\n\nThere are a few reasons Buffett might have sold Bank of America stock.\n\nAfter the stock's strong performance over the last eight months, shares are currently trading at levels unseen since the start of 2022. Despite the strong financial and operational performance underlying that price appreciation, Buffett may believe the shares are now fully valued, so he's taking money off the table as a result.\n\nAnother reason may have less to do with the current valuation and more to do with locking in gains at a favorable tax rate. Buffett's cost basis on those Bank of America shares is just over $14, on average. That means over two-thirds of the proceeds from Buffett's sales are taxable gains.\n\nBuffett hasn't been shy about taking gains on some of his favorite stocks lately. He sold billions worth of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares in the fourth and first quarters.\n\nWhen asked why he sold Apple shares at the annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett explained that he was happy to pay taxes at the current favorable tax rate of 21%. He expects the rate will increase in the future. However, he said he expects Apple to remain Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity holding for some time.\n\nThe same factors may have led him to take the tax hit on Bank of America shares now. That may suggest Buffett still likes the business and the stock but doesn't see it growing as quickly as it has in the recent past -- at least not enough to justify paying higher taxes on the gains later.\n\nShould you buy or sell Bank of America stock?\n\nBank of America saw its shares fall in price as interest rates climbed. That's because the bank has high exposure to longer-duration bonds, which currently carry low interest rates. As a result, the bank missed out on opportunities to buy securities with higher coupons as interest rates climbed.\n\nStory continues\n\nBank of America's decision to invest in longer-duration bonds has an outsized effect on a metric called net interest income (NII). That's the difference between the revenue generated by the bank's interest-bearing assets and the expense it pays on interest-bearing liabilities. Since the bank holds long-term bonds but has to pay market rates, NII declined as interest rates increased.\n\nBut management says NII has hit its trough. It's forecasting growth in the third and fourth quarters this year, reaching $14.5 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe good news is Bank of America is poised to do well, relative to its peers if the Fed cuts interest rates (as it is expected to later this year). The knife cuts both ways, so to speak.\n\nWith a price-to-book value of 1.25, Bank of America's shares look fairly priced. Buffett's sale appears to be more about taxes than anything specific about the company or its stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bank of America wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "TSMC's Latest Results Show It Is More Than A Beneficiary Of The AI Hype As It Is One Of One Its Creators\n\nLast Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM) reported its second quarter results, surpassing both top and bottom-line estimates. Surging demand for advanced chips used for developing gen-AI applications has boosted Taiwan listed shares of the world’s leading producer of advanced chips found in everything from smartphones to AI applications, whose clients are the titans Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), among others, by almost 70% year-to-date.\n\nSecond Quarter Highlights\n\nFueled by its exclusive partnerships with Apple and Nvidia, TSMC reported net revenue grew 40.1% YoY to 673.51 billion New Taiwan dollars ($20.82 billion), surpassing LSEG’s consensus estimate of NT$657.58 billion.\n\nFor the June quarter, net income grew 36.3% YoY to NT$247.85 billion which is about $7.59 billion, also surpassing LSEG’s consensus estimate of NT$238.8 billion.\n\nThird quarter guidance shows continued growth is expected.\n\nTSMC projects third-quarter revenue between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion, which would represent growth of about 30% to 33%.\n\n2024 is expected to be a strong growth year due to strong smartphone and AI-related demand. As for the annual capital budget, TSMC narrowed the range to between $30 billion and $32 billion, while it previously guided for $28 billion to $32 billion. 70% to 80% of the budget will be allocated to advanced technologies.\n\nTSMC is not only benefiting from the AI hype, it is one of those helping to create it.\n\nTSMC’s latest financial results and optimistic forecasts paint a picture of a leading company at the forefront of the AI revolution, together with Nvidia, which it counts among its clients. Samsung Electronics and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTEL) are trying to challenge its dominance. While TSMC has been the world’s first chip contract maker for years and world’s biggest foundry, its earnings have long been lagging those of Intel, but in 2023, its revenue surpassed those of both Intel and Samsung. It also leads in the operating profit arena. But Intel, who led the industry for decades, is determined to make a comeback and go beyond just fabrication and assembly with an ambitious foundry strategy. Foundry competition is heading up but for now, TSMC is still leading the way and it has the best partners, Apple and Nvidia, on its side.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Are Melting Up. Is There Room to Run?",
        "content": "Occasionally, hot stocks can get that much hotter in a move that can only be described as a “melt-up.” Such extreme share price action can be like the reverse of a stock meltdown, whereby a stock crashes rapidly, like in late February 2020.\n\nIndeed, stock melt-ups and meltdowns tend to catch many off-guard. And while such moves may be rapid to reverse, investors shouldn’t be inclined to overreact either way. The great Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock melt-up of 2022-24 is a prime example of why it’s a terrible idea to go against the grain with a short position on some of the market’s fastest-moving melt-up names.\n\nOf course, not every high-momentum play can be an Nvidia. However, I think it’s worthwhile to keep tabs on the melt-up names, even if you have no plans on initiating a position until after a significant pullback.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis piece will examine three stocks that have shown significant momentum in recent months. Though the chance of correction has likely increased, I find the names to be a must-watch for the second half.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nIt did not take long for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares to pick up the pace after many years of choppy action. Indeed, whenever AAPL stock fails to break through a ceiling of resistance, it tends to sink steadily for many months until its next attempt to break through.\n\nOn the back of a big Apple Intelligence reveal, Apple shares finally managed to break through resistance levels just shy of $200 per share in a big way. AAPL stock entered the summer season in melt-up mode (up over 40% from the April through to the July peak), catching many first-half profit-takers by shock. Where have all the bears gone?\n\nAfter pulling back 4.5% off recent all-time highs of $234 and change, perhaps latecomers have another shot at punching their ticket at a reasonable price before Apple’s fall iPhone event (likely September 2024).\n\nAt 34.8 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), shares are not cheap. Still, if Apple’s generative AI tech is as good as it looked in WWDC 2024, perhaps AAPL stock has a path to $300 per share, the current Street-high target held by Loop Capital’s Ananda Baruah.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Apple, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock is retreating modestly (around 4%) after peaking this month. The recent mini-correction seems like a tiny blip when you zoom out to the five-year chart. Over the past five years, shares have more than tripled thanks to management’s ability to deliver value in a heated inflationary environment when it’s incredibly hard to stay within budget.\n\nStory continues\n\nCostco offers more than just a good bang for the buck; it also gives consumers a wonderfully curated selection of goods. These days, Costco isn’t just a place to grab many gallons of iced tea at a bulky discount; it’s a place to buy precious metals amid the latest bullion gold rush and, pretty soon, Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN) gift cards.\n\nReportedly, Stifel noted that Align may enable Costco members to get $400 credit for Invisalign treatment for just $100.\n\nFor Costco members on the fence about straightening their teeth, such a deal may be too good to pass up. Indeed, the perks of being a Costco member are sweet. And that alone will likely make people not think twice about renewing even after the latest membership price hike.\n\nAmgen (AMGN) the Amgen (AMGN) logo on a building during daylight\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is an intriguing biotech innovator at fresh all-time highs of $335 and change per share. After soaring more than 22% in the past three months, perhaps the $180 billion health juggernaut is worth buying again now that it’s looking up.\n\nPerhaps the biggest reason to stick with AMGN stock is its shot at taking on the bulky weight-loss drug market with its oral treatment that goes by AMG786. Some analysts, like Matt Phipps of William Blair, are bullish on Amgen’s chances to take on the heavyweights (pardon the pun) in the weight-loss drug market.\n\nSure, it’s too early to tell if AMG786 or any other pipeline candidates will evolve to become big-time money-makers for the firm. Either way, the stock has a good amount of momentum behind it and a forward P/E multiple that’s way too lean at 17.2 times. And let’s not forget about the juicy 2.7% dividend yield, which sweetens the pot further for long-term investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held a long position at Apple.

        "title": "Meta CEO Zuckerberg calls on industry to adopt open-source AI, debuts high-powered Llama AI model",
        "content": "Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to Instagram on Tuesday to call out the tech industry, saying it should focus its generative AI efforts on open models rather than closed ones like those developed by OpenAI, Google, and others.\n\nIn a blog post on the topic, Zuckerberg said open-source AI models would ultimately prove more secure and efficient as developers and researchers around the world fine-tuned them over time.\n\nTech giants are currently in a battle over whether closed-source or open-source AI models should be the path forward for AI. Closed-source models are, generally, those that are only available to a company's customers and limit how much they can be manipulated at a base level, if at all.\n\nOpen-source AI models are available to any interested researchers or developers who can manipulate the models' code. Think something like the difference between Apple's (AAPL) iOS operating system, which is closed, and Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Android, which is open.\n\n\"Open source will ensure that more people around the world have access to the benefits and opportunities of AI, that power isn’t concentrated in the hands of a small number of companies, and that the technology can be deployed more evenly and safely across society,\" Zuckerberg wrote in his post.\n\nIn calling for the industry to rally around open-source AI, Zuckerberg is also rolling out the latest version of Meta's open-source Llama AI model, Llama 3.1, which the CEO says is among the most advanced in the industry. What's more, he says he anticipates the model will become the most advanced beginning next year. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers a speech during the Meta Connect event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., Sept. 27, 2023. (REUTERS/Carlos Barria) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nZuckerberg's Meta is going up against some of the biggest names in AI, including OpenAI and Google. Both companies offer their flagship AI models as closed-source software options, though they provide open-source models as well.\n\nZuckerberg says that making flagship AI models open source will improve security and overall capabilities, since a larger number of researchers and developers will be able to examine them from a base level, allowing them to catch flaws over time.\n\nThere are also concerns that open-source models will give the US's rivals, including China, easy access to high-powered AI technologies. But Zuckerberg claims that the US's adversaries could simply steal the code related to closed models and gain access to them that way. Closed models, he says, would also limit availability of AI technology to a small group of powerful companies.\n\nZuckerberg writes that leading companies should work with the government to help ensure they can take advantage of open-source AI models, ensuring they have a lead over other countries' governments.\n\nStory continues\n\nPart of Zuckerberg's emphasis on open-source technology has to do with his distaste for Apple's iOS and the iPhone maker's ability to control how Meta updates its apps. Meta also offers its own open-source programming languages that have proven popular across the web, including React.\n\nIt's difficult to tell whether open-source or closed-source AI models will win out at the moment. In reality, it's unlikely either will dominate the market in the long run. Ultimately, we'll likely see a split between closed-source and open-source models, just as we've seen with enterprise and consumer-level software programs throughout the years.

        "title": "RIVN Stock CEO: Apple CarPlay Isn’t Coming to Rivian EVs Anytime Soon",
        "content": "Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock is just slightly in the red today after an announcement that some fans are likely unhappy with.\n\nThe electric truck maker has enjoyed an excellent month as share prices have more than doubled, following multiple positive catalysts. Today brought some news that will probably disappoint some prospective buyers and electric vehicle (EV) enthusiasts. According to Electrek, Rivian will not be integrating Apple CarPlay into its vehicles, at least not in the near future.\n\nWhat does this mean for Rivian’s winning streak in the coming months? Let’s take a closer look at this development and assess what investors should be expecting.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat’s Happening With RIVN Stock\n\nWhile it began today by falling significantly, RIVN stock has since mostly reversed course and is now just a little in the red. As of this writing, it is down 0.5% for the day but looks primed to climb into the green. After a difficult start to the year, the company has made impressive progress over the past month, making clear that it can bounce back in due time.\n\nSome prospective EV buyers have probably been hoping to see Rivian begin offering Apple CarPlay as part of its vehicles. But Rivian’s leader has made it clear that it likely won’t happen. On a recent podcast appearance, CEO RJ Scaringe noted that although his company has a “great relationship” with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), a CarPlay integration isn’t one of Rivian’s priorities right now. Per Electrek:\n\n“At its most basic level, Apple CarPlay is a universal UI for automakers that cannot or have yet to develop viable infotainment software. Some automakers have embraced it, while others, like Tesla, have avoided it from day one.\n\nIn the past year, we’ve seen legacy automakers like GM move on from CarPlay, while others like Mercedes-Benz continue to dodge it in favor of its own technology. According to the interview [], Rivian will continue to pave new paths in the EV market without the customer appeal (for some) of Apple CarPlay.”\n\nWhat It Means\n\nThe short answer to the question of what this news means for RIVN is probably “not much.” Rivian has made impressive progress over the past year, even as share prices have struggled. Now, the stock is rockily making up the ground it lost, and demand for Rivian EVs is growing. Pre-orders for its affordable R2 electric SUV are rising steadily, reportedly to be “well over 100,000” so far. This focus on delivering high-quality, affordable EVs has served it well so far. Now that the EV market is rebounding, sales are likely to keep increasing.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Rivian has survived so far without Apple CarPlay. There’s no reason to worry that this update will significantly impact share prices now or in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Samuel O’Brient did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nSamuel O’Brient is a Reporter for InvestorPlace, where his work focuses primarily on financial markets, global economic trends, and public policy.

        "title": "Top 3 Digital Advertising Stocks for Your July Buy List",
        "content": "As companies allocate more of their marketing budgets to digital platforms, digital advertising stocks show promise for future expansion.\n\nIn 2024, the digital advertising market is valued at close to $670 billion. It accounts for approximately 69% of total media ad expenditure – an impressive 10.9% increase from the previous year. This upward trend is expected to continue, with projections suggesting the market will reach $870 billion by 2027. The rise of mobile and data-driven advertising, along with innovations like generative artificial intelligence (AI), is driving this expansion.\n\nGiven this growth potential, here are the top three digital advertising stocks for your July buy list.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntegral Ad Science (IAS) a programmatic ad is served up on a smartphone\n\nSource: shutterstock.com\n\nIntegral Ad Science (NASDAQ:IAS) focuses on digital ad verification and optimization. Its cloud-based platform, IAS Signal, ensures ads reach real audiences in safe environments with insights and independent measurement across various formats.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, IAS reported $114.53 million in revenue, a 7.9% increase from the previous year. Management highlighted a 40% rise in social media revenue and new industry-first partnerships. Despite this growth, the company posted a net loss of $1.3 million, or 1 cent per share, reversing from a prior-year profit of 2 cents per share.\n\nLooking ahead, Integral Ad Science anticipates strong demand for AI-driven solutions in the latter half of 2024. The company recently introduced deepfake measurement capabilities. It also expanded collaborations with industry giants such as Microsoft(NASDAQ:MSFT), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), Reddit (NYSE:RDDT), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Its partnership with Microsoft includes improved campaign measurement, brand safety, and invalid traffic verification across ad platforms.\n\nDespite these developments, IAS stock declined over 28% so far this year. The shares are trading at 58 times forward earnings and 3.4 times sales. Meanwhile, analysts’ 12-month median price forecast for IAS stock stands at $16, presenting an upside potential of 52% from current levels.\n\nInvesco Next Gen Media and Gaming ETF (GGME) Invesco logo in blue with mountain image\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInvesco Next Gen Media and Gaming ETF (NYSEARCA:GGME) deserves a spot on today’s list of digital advertising stocks. This exchange-traded fund gives access to companies at the forefront of media and gaming innovation, including those heavily involved in digital advertising. Its diversified investment approach helps mitigate risks while capturing sector growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nGGME was launched in June 2007 and currently holds 89 stocks. The fund’s portfolio is top-heavy. The top 10 largest holdings comprise 60% of its $37.5 million net assets. Several of the leading names include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The fund’s sector allocation is predominantly large-cap growth stocks (42%), followed by large-cap blend stocks (30%), providing a blend of stability and high growth potential.\n\nSo far in 2024, GGME has delivered a 21% return. The fund’s expense ratio is 0.6% or $60 annually per $10,000 invested, which is competitive for a specialized fund. Currently trading at 17.1x trailing earnings and 2.1x book value, GGME stands out as a strong investment in the digital advertising space.\n\nTaboola.com (TBLA) TBLA stock: Taboola company website with logo close up\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nTaboola.com (NASDAQ:TBLA) is a rising force in the sector. Leveraging its AI-powered platform, Taboola drives content recommendations across the web, helping websites and apps connect with targeted audiences.\n\nIn its first-quarter report, Taboola posted $414 million in revenue, marking an increase of 26% from a year ago. The net loss was $26.2 million, or 8 cents per diluted share, an improvement from a loss of 9 cents per share last year. The company repurchased $28 million in shares during the quarter, with $92 million remaining under a buyback authorization, set to continue through 2024.\n\nTaboola recently launched Taboola Select, a premium editorial partnership for large advertisers. It also secured exclusive deals with major partners like Foundry and a360media. Furthermore, Taboola has been selected by Apple to sell ads on Apple News and Apple Stocks apps. This global ad management role will enhance the company’s market presence and revenue potential.\n\nHowever, TBLA stock has dropped over 22% so far this year. As a result, the shares are trading at attractive valuations of 11x forward earnings and 0.8x sales. Finally, analysts are bullish, projecting a 12-month median price target of $6, implying a potential 75% upside. As Taboola prepares its earnings report on Aug. 7, its growth prospects offer an enticing risk/reward opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Meta's reality check: Inside the $45 billion cash burn at Reality Labs",
        "content": "Nearly $50 billion.\n\nIn just over four years, Meta (META)’s Reality Labs division — focused mainly on its products in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the metaverse — has lost as much money as the market caps of Snap (SNAP) and Pinterest (PINS) combined.\n\nInsiders tell Yahoo Finance that the staggering cash burn is not the price of innovation, but rather the result of a “chaotic” culture that features frequent reorganizations and installation of top leaders without AR or VR expertise.\n\nWith Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg warning that operating losses in Reality Labs will only continue to “increase meaningfully,” Yahoo Finance spoke to a dozen former high-level employees (mostly executives or managers across multiple segments including engineering, research, product management, hardware, content, and operating systems) who say the lack of a clear vision and mismanagement are largely to blame for Reality Labs' financial pitfalls.\n\nThe former employees Yahoo Finance spoke with left within the last three years, with the earliest departing in February of 2021 and the most recent ones this year. The majority left on their own because of what they called discord within Reality Labs, but some left due to structural layoffs.\n\nThey asked not to be named because of nondisclosure agreements and a fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities.\n\nMeta did not respond to Yahoo Finance’s multiple requests for comment on this story.\n\nThe question for investors is how to reconcile Reality Labs' multibillion-dollar expenses within the context of Zuckerberg’s “year of efficiency” promise for Meta. Despite implementing cost-cutting measures and scaling back spending in Q1 of 2023, Meta saw its shares tank 20% after its most recent earnings report, thanks to a significant increase in AI investment.\n\nWith Zuckerberg back to breaking open the checkbook, is there enough room on the balance sheet for his AI pivot and Reality Labs' steep losses? Although analysts and investors have remained patient on the long-term potential of AR and VR, how long is that leash more than 10 years on?\n\nBack in 2014, Meta (then Facebook) made its two largest acquisitions ever in just over a month. The first was its $16 billion purchase of WhatsApp. The second was of a smaller outfit out of Irvine, Calif., that had only developed a prototype of its revolutionary VR headset. The company’s name was Oculus and the promise of its technology was enough for Mark Zuckerberg to shell out $2 billion — only a fraction of what he’d spend on its development over the next decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn its first few years under the Facebook umbrella, Oculus's financials were grouped in with every other product in the business. But during the COVID-19 pandemic, Zuckerberg became enamored with the potential of the Metaverse — so much so that he changed the name of his company from Facebook to Meta.\n\nMeta also began breaking out its revenue and expenses into two separate divisions: “Family of Apps” (which included Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp), and “Reality Labs” (a combination of Oculus and its other mixed-reality investments). In 2020, the former reported a profit of more than $39 billion, while Reality Labs lost just over $6 billion.\n\nThe numbers only became worse for Meta over the ensuing years: a $10 billion loss in 2021, $13 billion in 2022, and $16 billion in 2023. Furthermore, slumping sales and poor mainstream adoption caused Reality Labs’ revenue to decrease annually. Since 2021, Reality Labs' annual revenue has been falling despite significant increases in spend.\n\nIn just the first quarter of 2024, Meta has reported a loss of $3.8 billion, about equal to its total revenues in the last two years combined. Analysts Yahoo Finance surveyed projected Q2 losses for the division would be closer to $5 billion. The lowest forecast we received was $4.6 billion.\n\n'Employee Bingo'\n\nSeveral of the people interviewed blamed the dysfunction and cash burn at Reality Labs on chain of command reorganizations they say took place every three to six months. This included the promotion of “local heroes” — or individuals that had succeeded elsewhere within Meta, such as Instagram or Facebook — who were then asked to replicate those results inside of Reality Labs. The lack of understanding of the technology often led to tension between new managers and the existing staff.\n\n“It was pretty chaotic,” said a former employee who worked on the research team and said leaders were often pulled from the apps division with little VR experience. \"In software you can get away with that because you make mistakes and change things all the time. In hardware, you’re stuck with your mistakes for a long time.”\n\n“If you’re a senior director, they forklift you into any position,” said a former executive in engineering. “You can lead an organization, set priorities, take on anything from Instagram ads to AR software design. It creates this really weird dynamic where the people in the trenches doing the work don’t have respect for the senior leaders and the senior leaders don’t really speak the language of the technology they’re building.”\n\n“They play employee bingo,” said another employee responsible for AR/VR content. “They move people into AR that don’t really understand it. It’s hardware and experience, not a news feed in your hand.”\n\nOne former executive in product management told us, “There's an arrogance there that says, ‘Look how much money I was accountable for making because of this role I played in Facebook’s Family of Apps — therefore I can obviously be successful at this new thing.’\"\n\n\"I think that’s probably the real story as to why there’s been so much money thrown at this thing with such limited success today,” they said.\n\nJust last month, several senior managers and vice presidents were quietly let go from the company, according to two people familiar with the matter. Their positions at Reality Labs included head of AR glasses hardware, head of hardware partnerships, vice president of supply chain organization, vice president of technology engineering, and head of silicon partnerships.\n\nAnother challenge is the lack of traction AR and VR products have had in gaining a wider audience. Meta also competes in the segment with Snap, Tik Tok parent Bytedance, and now Apple (AAPL).\n\nCircana Research analyst Ben Arnold says total AR and VR device sales in the US were just over $1 billion last year — a year in which Meta’s Reality Labs expenses alone topped $18 billion. According to IDC's analysis, global shipments of AR and VR headsets dropped 67.4% year over year in 2024 Q1.\n\nMeta’s current product lineup includes two VR headsets (the Quest 3 and Quest Vision Pro) and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. But Arnold says software gains will be critical to the industry, specifically “in content and applications that appeal to people beyond gamer.\"\n\n\"That’s always been the challenge for this category,” he said.\n\nA former employee said that at one point, there were 24 hardware products on an 18-month roadmap. \"You might be able to do that if you’re shipping software experiences, but highly unlikely for an organization that has never really shipped outside of the Oculus space.\"\n\nThe source said management did not realize until too late that shipping \"a wrist [watch], sunglasses, new controller models, new VR experiences, new mixed-reality experiences\" was unrealistic, leading to low morale among the workforce.\n\n“I had severe doubts about leadership,” they said.\n\nEmblematic of that lack of direction was the scrapped development of Meta’s in-house chips for its Ray-Ban smart glasses and other devices. In 2021, after over a year of design and build, Meta’s vice president of AR Alex Himel abruptly canceled the project, instead returning to using an external Qualcomm (QCOM) chip.\n\nThe team was incensed. “All of us in the room that were software and chip people were like, ‘You’re insane,’” said a former executive who was directly involved in the project. “People were livid over this. People left the company. This guy basically flushed millions of dollars down the toilet.”\n\nThe cost of the internal chip was cheaper than Qualcomm's chip, according to another executive involved. \"It's illustrative of this mindset of not really taking the innovation piece seriously and not wanting to invest in long-term deep technology on the hardware side,\" they said. Himel did not respond to Yahoo Finance’s request for comment.\n\nAnother executive put Meta’s spontaneous decision making more succinctly: “I had anti-confidence in the roadmap. Zuck gets excited. Everyone rallies around what Zuck gets excited about. Boz [Reality Labs head Andrew Bosworth] gets a budget based on Zuck’s excitement, and then we go off and try to figure out what the product looks like. Over and over and over again.” Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth did not respond to a request for an interview.

(Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nAs for Zuckerberg's vision for his multibillion-dollar bet, sources say he sees the metaverse as another community he can own, similar to how he revolutionized social media with Facebook. \"He's really big on the notion of an immersive presence across boundaries,\" a former executive who worked closely with Zuckerberg said.\n\n\"When we were working on the Orion [AR] glasses, the top Zuck scenario was always immersive video calls. We did all the modeling on the heat and battery performance and we told him, 'Dude, we can do a call like this for five minutes and then the person's head catches on fire.' It's a power-hungry thing, but it's one of those goals he's chasing.\"\n\nAnother former executive said Zuckerberg is at the mercy of Apple — due to its anti-data-tracking efforts and Vision Pro development — so he's playing \"a big chess game.\"\n\n\"His bet is that the next thing after phones will be augmented reality glasses. Apple is making moves and he's trying to protect by investing in the future and hoping to own the next platform.\"\n\nWall Street, meanwhile, has its own mixed reality on the stock. Gene Munster, co-founder of Deepwater Asset Management, called Reality Labs “a disaster from a financial perspective.” Munster told Yahoo Finance that the stock would be higher if not for the significant cash burn inside the division.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives agreed, referring to Reality Labs as the “black eye of spending at Meta.” Yet, both remain bullish on the stock, despite Munster believing that Reality Labs won’t play a real role in Meta’s future for at least a decade.\n\nMeta investor Dan Niles of Niles Investment Management called Reality Labs “a giant insurance policy,” saying Meta could always cut spending in the division if its other businesses falter.\n\nFor those insiders with “Reality Labs” on their resumes, it’s a different conclusion. “It just doesn’t seem responsible,” said a former executive. “If I was a shareholder, I would rather see Zuckerberg putting all their metaverse infrastructure on top of somebody else burning at those rates. Let Samsung or Apple build that hardware.”\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X @YasminKhorram and on LinkedIn.

        "title": "4 Solid Tech Stocks to Buy as S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq Resume Rally",
        "content": "Wall Street rallied on Jul 22 after suffering for over a week as investors rotated out of mega-cap tech stocks and rushed toward small-cap and cyclical stocks, hoping that the Federal Reserve would soon start its rate cuts.\n\nSmall-cap stocks are still holding up with the Russell 2000 closing 1.7% higher on Monday. However, tech stocks rebounded Monday as investors rotated back into the growth stocks. This saw the S&P 500 closing up 1.1% on Monday to settle at 5,564.41 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed 1.6% higher at 18,007.57 points.\n\nThis was the S&P 500’s best day since Jun 5. Tech stocks have been responsible for the broader rally in 2023, which has also continued this year.\n\nThis year’s rally has primarily been fueled by the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI, led by the industry darling NVIDIA Corporation NVDA.\n\nExperts believe that AI has immense potential that has yet to be fully realized. NVIDIA's remarkable success in the past year has inspired many tech companies to explore AI's possibilities to gain long-term business advantages.\n\nThe progression of various smart devices is crucial in this field, as they require powerful computing and learning capabilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition and video analysis. These tasks need high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and better graphics processors, which is benefiting the semiconductor industry.\n\nAlso, the Federal Reserve is gearing up for the first rate cut this year, which will mark the beginning of the easing cycle. Market participants are pricing in a 25 basis point rate cut in September. Lower interest rates reduce borrowing costs, which is favorable for growth stocks.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in mega-cap tech stocks such as Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Netflix, Inc. NFLX, QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM and Apple, Inc. AAPL whichhave strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN’s online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company’s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish its footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. AMZN also enjoys a dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service space, thanks to Amazon Web Services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com has an expected earnings growth rate of 57.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last 60 days. AMZN currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nNetflix, Inc. is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. NFLX has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping Netflix sustain its leading position despite the launch of new services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video.\n\nNetflix’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 57.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 3.7% over the past 60 days. NFLX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated designs, manufactures and markets digital wireless telecom products and services based on the Code Division Multiple Access (“CDMA”) technology. QCOM’s products include CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications as well as global positioning system products. QUALCOMMalso offers development and other product-related services to U.S. government agencies and their contractors.\n\nQUALCOMM’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 17.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the past 60 days. QCOM currently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nApple Inc.’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone. However, the Services portfolio of AAPL, which includes revenues from cloud services, the App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services, has now become the cash cow. Moreover, non-iPhone devices like Apple Watch and AirPod have gained significant traction.\n\nApple has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.5% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 60 days.

        "title": "Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) the Best Trump Trade According to Jim Cramer?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Top 11 Trump Trades: Winners and Losers. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program talked about the consequences of the failed assassination attempt on Donald Trump and mentioned a few stocks that could benefit if the former President comes to power again.\n\n“You are sticking your head in the sand if you think nothing has changed after the failed assassination attempt on the now-official Republican nominee for President.”\n\nCramer said that the “frightening moments” of the assassination attempt have indeed “cut in the favor” of Trump’s win and he was “already leading in the polls.”\n\nCramer recalled the days when he was the anchor of Kudlow & Cramer show and Biden was a senator from Delaware. Cramer said Biden once told him that he was the “poorest senator out of one hundred because he owned no stocks.”\n\n“He was actually bragging about it,” Cramer said.\n\nCramer said that Joe Biden is not the “champion” of stocks and he’s “on board with labor.”\n\nJim Cramer’s Thoughts on Donald Trump\n\nHere’s what Cramer said about Trump:\n\n“In the many years I’ve known Trump and I have known him fairly well, he’s been wildely pro stock market, always watching it like a hawk. He loves bantering about the stock market.”\n\nCramer said that even though Trump was in “real estate, he enjoyed stocks.”\n\nJim Cramer added that Trump always thought there was too much regulation and was also “wildly” pro-oil and gas.  The CNBC host said since Trump cannot see the stock market going down and sees the market gains as a positive factor even for his presidency, his arrival in the White House could boost stock portfolios.\n\n“Hate him or like him, he’s good for your portfolio.”\n\nFor this article watched the latest programs of Cramer where he mentioned stocks that could benefit from a Trump presidency. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) among Jim Cramer’s Top 11 Trump Trades: Winners and Losers?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks that could see troubles if Donald Trump comes to power because of the China factor, according to Cramer. He said that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has high exposure to China as the company makes “Chinese phones with Chinese labor”\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, there’s a positive factor for Apple, too, if Trump comes to the White House, according to Cramer. He thinks Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  has been “abused” by the government on several regulatory issues.\n\n“Neither of the candidates seems like Big Tech but Trump administration will certainly be more circumspect about hammering great American tech companies.”\n\nDoes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) have any AI growth catalysts? Wall Street is turning bullish on the company after Apple revealed Apple Intelligence plans at the WWDC event.\n\nMorgan Stanley expects Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to ship nearly 500 million iPhones in the next two years, marking a 6% increase from the FY21-FY22 cycle. Morgan Stanley said this growth can boost the annual iPhone average selling price (ASP) by 5%, leading to nearly $485 billion in revenue and $8.70 in earnings per share by FY26, exceeding consensus estimates by 7-9%.\n\nWall Street is expecting a new AI-powered refresh cycle for iPhones because it’s been years since millions of users upgraded their iPhones. Wedbush recently said 270 million, of 1.5 billion iPhones, have not upgraded in 4+ years\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also training Siri based on its own language models. These smaller models run on devices, handling various daily tasks, with Apple revealing its on-device model has 3 billion parameters. For more complex tasks, a larger language model runs on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) private servers, though its size is undisclosed and likely smaller than current large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-4, which has around 1.8 trillion parameters.\n\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also contributed to performance after unveiling its AI strategy to its software developers. The Company has been at the forefront of proprietary computer processor development for over a decade. Given the compute-intensive nature of AI applications, Apple is well-situated to develop a suite of compelling, consumer-friendly AI services that are also cost-effective. While revenue growth has been relatively flat post-Covid-19, we expect Apple’s AI value proposition will be compelling enough for consumers to continue growing their engagement in the Apple ecosystem over the next several years.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer’s Top 11 Trump Trades: Winners and Losers. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "It's not only their politicking that draws interest these days. With politicians demonstrating a remarkable ability to outperform the market, investors are increasingly interested in the stock picks of senators and representatives. Take the Peach State representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, for instance, who has been an avid buyer of stocks so far in 2024.\n\nBut it's artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in particular that seem to be the focus of Greene's interest in the first half of 2024. In addition to AdvancedMicroDevices(NASDAQ: AMD), Greene also picked up shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM).\n\nGreene gained broad exposure to the AI industry\n\nStarting her 2024 stock purchases in April, Greene bought shares of both Qualcomm and Microsoft. Although the exact value of the transactions isn't known, Greene reported in regulatory filings that each transaction was valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Both buys provided Greene with notable -- yet diverse -- exposure to the rapidly burgeoning AI industry.\n\nA leading semiconductor manufacturer, Qualcomm is targeting generative AI applications for mobile devices with its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Mobile platform. In addition, its providing AI functionality to personal computers with its Snapdragon X Elite Platform and automobiles with Snapdragon Digital Chassis. Focused on software, Microsoft's commitment to offering sophisticated AI solutions is demonstrated with Copilot -- an AI tool that is available across Microsoft's suite of products from Word and Excel to Designer, where users can create unique images with DALL-E 3.\n\nThe following month, Greene broadened her AI exposure with positions in Apple and Advanced Micro Devices in two transactions that were each valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Making a concerted effort to offer more AI capability, Apple has been working on its own large language model (LLM), dubbed Ajax. In early June, moreover, Apple revealed Apple Intelligence. Available on its various devices, Apple states that Apple Intelligence \"combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that's incredibly useful and relevant.\"\n\nLike Qualcomm, AMD also produces the hardware that's powering AI. In addition to its MI300 accelerators (specialized microprocessors) that are designed for generative AI and large language models, AMD manufactures Ryzen PRO 8000 processors, which the company characterizes as \"the first processors with dedicated, on-chip AI accelerators for commercial desktop [personal computers].\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn late June, Greene clicked the \"buy\" button on cybersecurity specialist CrowdStrike. Powered with AI, CrowdStrike helps clients protect a variety of devices including laptops, mobile devices, and those connected on the Internet of Things. In addition, CrowdStrike has developed a generative AI security tool, Charlotte AI, that integrates with various aspects of the company's Falcon platform.\n\nYou may be green with envy over Greene's picks, but that doesn't mean you should buy these AI stocks too\n\nWhile following politicians' stock picks is a smart strategy, blindly mimicking their buys is foolhardy at best. It's important for individual investors to do their due diligence and evaluate whether the stocks in question are smart choices for them. That being said, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Apple, and AMD are all industry leaders that are trading at premiums to their historical valuations.\n\nTherefore, value investors may want to keep these names on their watch lists instead of rushing to add them to their portfolios. Of course valuation isn't the only factor that investors should consider, so long-term investors may not want to investigate these tickers further before deciding to watch them from the side of the road.\n\nCrowdStrike, however, is in a different boat since it caused a global outage last week. With the sell-off that followed news of the global outage, CrowdStrike's stock is a lot less expensive today, giving back most of its 2024 gains. Inauspicious as the news may be for CrowdStrike, it's critical for investors to remember that this event, in and of itself, doesn't spell doom for the company.\n\nComputer code is complicated, and the flaw that was in the company's update is unfortunate but not an indication that there's something fundamentally wrong with the company. For those with the resolve to weather some near-term volatility, CrowdStrike may be a great addition for investors looking for a leading cybersecurity stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Warren Buffett's investment approach has proven wildly successful over time. Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) stock performance has consistently outpaced most major market indices since Buffett took control in 1965. His strategy involves concentrating investments in companies with strong business models and ultra-long-term growth trajectories.\n\nThree of Buffett's largest holdings stand out for their stability and growth potential in the current market. These companies -- Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), and American Express(NYSE: AXP) -- represent a significant portion of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio and are well-positioned to deliver above average returns for shareholders. Read on to find out more. Image Source: The Motley Fool.\n\nApple: A wide-moat tech giant\n\nApple represents a substantial 43.5% of Berkshire's stock portfolio, underscoring Buffett's confidence in the tech giant. While the stock's dividend yield is modest at 0.43%, its price-to-earnings ratio of 34.8 reflects high market expectations.\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about Apple's future, particularly with the anticipated rollout of Apple Intelligence. This development is expected to significantly boost earnings and revenue. Forecasts suggest a 15.6% increase in top-line growth over 2024 and 2025, an impressive projection for a mature company with a $3.44 trillion market cap.\n\nApple's strength lies not just in its hardware but also in its software and services segment, which generated $85.2 billion in revenue in fiscal 2023, accounting for 22% of total revenue.\n\nThe company's ecosystem, encompassing cloud services, digital ads, Apple Pay, Apple Card, Apple Music, Apple TV+, and the App Store, creates a robust platform for customer retention and profitability.\n\nIn early May 2024, Apple made headlines with a $110 billion share repurchase authorization, the largest in U.S. history. While this is a budget rather than a guarantee, Apple's track record of significant buybacks -- more than $20 billion in three of the past four quarters and $81.82 billion over the past year -- suggests strong potential for shareholder value creation.\n\nBank of America: A tier 1 bank\n\nBank of America stock accounts for 10.5% of Berkshire's stock portfolio. The financial services company pays a generous 2.25% annualized yield and shares trade at 15 times trailing earnings, well below the S&P 500's 27.5 price-to-earnings ratio. Wall Street is forecasting top-line growth of over 16% over the course of 2024 and 2025.\n\nBank of America is poised to succeed on a nationwide scale, and there seems to be no structural reason it can't be one of the strongest bank franchises going forward. Bank of America is seeing exceptional digital adoption, and there still seems to be something left in the tank for expense savings, potentially helping the bank better absorb costs associated with inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmerican Express: A core Buffett holding\n\nAmerican Express comprises 9% of Berkshire's stock portfolio. The company trades at 18 times trailing earnings, with analysts forecasting a 17% revenue surge over the next two fiscal years.\n\nAmerican Express's key advantage is its closed-loop network, allowing it to capture more revenue per transaction than many competitors. This unique model enables the company to act as both card issuer and payment processor, potentially leading to higher profit margins.\n\nThe company has shown strong performance in net interest income and loan growth. High card member spending and successful expansion among younger consumers have driven recent revenue increases.\n\nAmerican Express continues to adapt to the shift toward digital payments, investing in its mobile app and online services. The company's focus on affluent customers and businesses provides some insulation against economic downturns.\n\nAmerican Express faces competition from traditional banks and fintech start-ups. However, its strong brand recognition, customer loyalty programs, and unique business model continue to set it apart. The company's ongoing innovation and service expansion maintain its significance in Buffett's portfolio, blending established success with growth potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "5 Subtle Reasons Warren Buffett Just Sold $1.48 Billion Worth of Bank of America Stock",
        "content": "Few, if any, billionaire money managers garner attention on Wall Street quite like Warren Buffett. Since becoming CEO of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965, he's overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares of a scorching-hot 5,268,713%, as of the closing bell on July 19. When you're effectively doubling up the annualized total return of the benchmark S&P 500 over nearly six decades, you're going to get noticed.\n\nInvestors intently wait for Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly Form 13F filings to spill the beans on what stocks the affably dubbed \"Oracle of Omaha\" and his investment team have been buying and selling. But for select stocks -- those where Berkshire holds at least a 10% stake -- Buffett is required to show his proverbial hand anytime a move is made. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nOn Friday, July 19, Berkshire Hathaway filed a Form 4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission detailing trading activity in one of Buffett's core holdings, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). BofA, as Bank of America is more commonly known, has been Berkshire's second-largest holding by market value for years, trailing only Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nAlthough Buffett and his top investment advisors (Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) entered 2024 with a little over 1.03 billion shares of BofA held in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, this isn't the case any longer. From July 17 through July 19, Berkshire's brightest investment minds sold 33,890,927 shares of Bank of America stock, totaling $1.476 billion.\n\nWhile this sale represents a relatively small percentage of one of Buffett's core holdings -- Bank of America still accounts for almost $43 billion of invested assets in Berkshire's 44-stock, $407 billion investment portfolio -- there are a multitude of subtle reasons this $1.48 billion share sale makes complete sense.\n\n1. Buffett's $56 billion silent warning implies stocks are pricey\n\nTo begin with, the Oracle of Omaha hasn't been shy about his belief that the stock market is pricey. Though neither he nor his investing \"lieutenants\" would ever bet against the American economy, Berkshire investment team has been a net-seller of equities for six consecutive quarters. Between Oct. 1, 2022 and March 31, 2024, Berkshire Hathaway's cash flow statements show $56.09 billion in net-equity sales. S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio Chart\n\nWhat's more, data shows that the stock market is historically pricey. The S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is also known as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE ratio, ended July 19 at a reading of 35.5. This is more than double its 153-year average of 17.14, and the third-highest reading during a continuous bull market when back-tested to 1871.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it's impossible to predict when stock market corrections and bear markets will begin, history tells us that extended valuations aren't well-tolerated for lengthy periods on Wall Street.\n\nDuring Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in May, where the company's first-quarter operating results revealed it had an all-time record $189 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, Buffett opined that his company's cash pile could approach $200 billion in the second quarter. In other words, opportunities to raise cash in a pricey market by selling stock are on Buffett's radar.\n\n2. Bank of America is no longer a screaming bargain, relative to its book value\n\nWarren Buffett selling $1.48 billion of Bank of America stock also makes sense because BofA is no longer the screaming bargain that it's been for much of the last 15 years.\n\nOn one hand, Bank of America's book value has been moving higher, which is precisely what you'd want to see from a time-tested business that benefits from long-winded periods of economic growth. BAC Price to Book Value Chart\n\nHowever, its share price has been rising at an even faster pace. When Buffett and Co. sold shares of BofA last week, they were doing so at a 26% to 28% premium to the company's book value of $34.39 per share. While this isn't egregiously expensive, Bank of America stock has traded below its book value for much of the last 15 years.\n\nA premium to book value of around 30% has also marked a top for BofA's stock on numerous occasions since the start of 2018.\n\nThough Bank of America stock isn't expensive by any means, it's also not the phenomenal bargain it was as recently as late October.\n\n3. BofA's buybacks may have warranted an adjustment by Berkshire's investment team\n\nThe third subtle reason that might justify why Buffett dumped close to $1.5 billion worth of Berkshire's second-largest holding is share buybacks.\n\nWhen the U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders, money-center banks are known for rewarding their shareholders with hearty capital-return programs. When given the green light by the Federal Reserve, Bank of America has been known to return in excess of $20 billion annually to its shareholders via dividends and share buybacks (on a combined basis). BAC Shares Outstanding Chart\n\nSince the start of 2018, a steady stream of share repurchases has allowed BofA to reduce its outstanding share count by 24.42%, including a 2.16% reduction over the trailing year. These buybacks are incrementally increasing Berkshire's stake in Bank of America without the Oracle of Omaha or his team having to lift a finger.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's stake in Bank of America can increase to as much as 24.9%, per the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, without it being considered a bank holding company -- and its current stake is nowhere near this level (12.8%, as of July 19). However, Buffett may have preferred to keep his company's stake in BofA below 13%. In other words, Bank of America's continued buybacks may have coerced Buffett's decision to sell 33.89 million shares. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. A historically favorable corporate tax rate encouraged profit-taking\n\nThe fourth logical reason the Oracle of Omaha may have chosen to part ways with almost $1.5 billion worth of Bank of America stock is tax related.\n\nDuring the first quarter, Buffett and his crew sold more than 116 million shares of tech stock Apple, equating to roughly 12.8% of Berkshire's stake, as of December 31. During Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, Buffett had the following to say about selling Apple stock and the current corporate tax rate:\n\nWe don't mind paying taxes at Berkshire, and we are paying a 21% federal rate on the gains we're taking in Apple. And that rate was 35% not that long ago, and it's been 52% in the past when I've been operating... [I] would say, with the present fiscal policies, I think that something has to give, and I think that higher taxes are quite likely.\n\nIn other words, Buffett justified locking in gains in Apple because the corporate tax rate is making it advantageous to do so. With his company also sitting on massive unrealized gains with its BofA position, it might make sense to take some profit off the table while corporate tax rates are still favorable.\n\n5. A shift in monetary policy may adversely impact Bank of America's net interest income\n\nA fifth and final subtle reason Warren Buffett and his top aides sent nearly 33.9 million shares of Bank of America to the chopping block may have to do with an expected shift in Federal Reserve monetary policy.\n\nIn March 2022, the nation's central bank kicked off its most-aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the early 1980s. While higher interest rates have been a positive for virtually all bank stocks, no money-center bank is more interest-sensitive than Bank of America. Increasing the federal funds target rate by 525 basis points in a little over a year added billions of dollars in net interest income to BofA's bottom line each quarter.\n\nAlthough core inflation (which excludes energy and food expenses) has remained stubbornly high, the Fed is a lot closer to kicking off a rate-easing cycle than it is to further raising rates. Just as BofA benefited more than its money-center peers when interest rates were climbing, it'll probably be adversely impacted more than other major banks when interest rates begin declining.\n\nLocking in some gains, especially with Bank of America valued at 25% above its book value, might be a smart move with an easing cycle expected to begin in mere months.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bank of America wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Apple stock has surged 30% since the second quarter, and now all eyes will be on the tech giant’s upcoming earnings report scheduled for August 1.\n\nBernstein analysts expect Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Q3 earnings to align closely with consensus estimates, projecting revenues of $83.7 billion, a 2.3% year-over-year increase, compared to the consensus estimate of $84.3 billion.\n\nThe anticipated revenue growth is supported by improving iPhone sales in China and strong performance in the iPad and Mac segments.\n\n“That said, we do not expect material revenue upside in the quarter,” the investment firm’s analysts added.\n\nLooking ahead to Q4, the consensus models higher-than-seasonal growth, which Bernstein views as aggressive. They predict that Apple might guide lower on revenue for Q4, estimating $89.3 billion compared to the consensus of $92.3 billion. However, they believe this guidance might not heavily impact investor sentiment, as attention is shifting toward the iPhone 16 and FY 2025.\n\n“A key question is whether an upgrade cycle could get pushed out beyond FY 25,” Bernstein analysts continued.\n\n“We continue to expect AI functionality to lead to a strong upgrade cycle, and that it may not be a bad thing for the stock if AI tailwinds are spread out between the iPhone 16 and 17 cycles,” they added.\n\nAnalysts highlighted several key areas to watch in Apple’s upcoming earnings print.\n\nAmong those is growth in the company’s Services unit, which has outgrown the rest of Apple's business, contributing significantly to revenue. They project Services revenue growth for Q3 at 13% and 12% for the year, supported by strong growth in iCloud, licensing, and the App Store.\n\nMeanwhile, the health of Apple's China business remains a concern, despite stronger iPhone volumes in May. There are doubts about the accuracy of third-party data and the sustainability of this strength, given that it partly resulted from discounting.\n\nApple’s product gross margins have also improved significantly, driven by various factors including higher iPhone mix and lower depreciation expenses. However, Bernstein analysts caution rising memory prices and price concessions on iPhones could pressure margins in the future.\n\n“While the impact might not be felt until the iPhone 16 cycle, we believe investors should closely monitor commentary around the gross margin forces at work. We forecast Q4 gross margins to decline sequentially from 46.3% to 46.1%,” analysts wrote.\n\nMoreover, any changes to R&D and capex spending plans – particularly related to the build-out of private cloud compute – and broader commentary on Apple Intelligence will also be closely scrutinized, they noted.\n\nStory continues\n\nBernstein has reiterated an Outperform rating on AAPL stock ahead of its Q3 report, with a price target of $240.\n\n“We believe recent enthusiasm is likely to persist in the near term, as Apple is increasingly seen as an AI leader rather than a laggard, and the stock is also in its seasonally strong trading period,” the firm’s team explained.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple stock is up 30% since Q2.

It's a gamechanger for them,\" he added.\n\nOther manufacturers such as Samsung would also benefit, but to a lesser degree as the majority of their smartphones are locally made, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nApple and Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nApple has a 6% share of India's smartphone market, according to Counterpoint.\n\nIndia's deputy IT ministry in January privately argued for a reduction on import taxes on mobile phones, saying the country risks losing out to China and Vietnam in the race to become a major smartphone export hub and must \"act fast\" to lure global companies with lower tariffs, Reuters has reported.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years promoted India as a smartphone manufacturing hub and the nation's $24-billion local production scheme covers mobile phones, prompting companies such as Apple, Xiaomi, Samsung and Vivo to expand local operations.\n\nChina's Xiaomi has also in the past asked for tariff reductions on sub-components used in batteries, USB cables and phone covers.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil, Editing by Louise Heavens)",

He urged American firms to “participate aggressively in China’s further reform and modernization process,” according to state-owned media.\n\nIn a separate meeting, Wang talked about the outcomes of the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s Third Plenum, a key meeting that set the country’s economic course, and expressed a desire for members of the US-China Business Council in Beijing to help drive “a correct understanding” of China in the US. Williams and Mehrotra are directors of the group.\n\nThe readout from the Chinese foreign ministry did not name the Apple and Micron officers, though they were shown in photos of the gathering.\n\nThe gathering comes as Washington leads an international campaign tightening trade restrictions to prevent advanced technology making its way into China. US companies have had to tread a careful path, as they face pressure to decouple from China, which still provides an indispensable production base and a key market for their products. Apple relies on the country for about a fifth of its sales, while Micron has been facing an uphill battle after Beijing banned its products from critical infrastructure last year.\n\nAn Apple representative for China did not respond to a request for comment, while Micron did not respond to an email seeking comment outside of regular office hours.\n\nTapping the political pulse of Beijing has became a critical job for foreign tech firms operating in the world’s No.2 economy.

        "title": "2 Stocks That Can Help You to Get Richer in 2024",
        "content": "The stock market has fluctuated greatly this year. The S&P 500 is up 15% since January yet has dipped 3% since mid-July after a slight sell-off in the tech market.\n\nTech stocks became a haven for many investors amid economic uncertainty in recent months. However, easing inflation has seen Wall Street reshuffle its investments and venture outside the long-term security of tech. As a result, now could be an excellent time to take advantage of the dip and make an investment in some of tech's best performers.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are two attractive stocks, dipping 5% and 4%, respectively, since mid-July. These companies have made promising inroads in their respective markets this year and could see significant stock growth as we head into earnings season next month. They're both stocks that can help you get richer in 2024.\n\n1. Amazon: Trading at one of its best values over the last decade\n\nIt seemed as if Amazon could do no wrong over the last year. The company has delivered multiple quarters of impressive earnings growth alongside significant investments in some of the fastest-growing markets. Amazon has benefited from a long list of cost-cutting measures that brought its retail business back to profitability and a steady expansion in the budding artificial intelligence (AI) market.\n\nThe company's revenue increased 13% in the first quarter of 2024, beating Wall Street forecasts by $750 million. Meanwhile, operating income spiked 220% to more than $15 billion. The solid gains came from key parts of its business, such as third-party seller services, selling ads on its streaming platform Prime Video, subscription services, and its cloud business with Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAmazon has delivered an impressive turnaround in its business after suffering a market downturn in 2022 that led to steep profit declines. The company's free cash flow has risen 170% in the last 12 months, illustrating its ability to successfully navigate unexpected headwinds.\n\nThe e-commerce giant has used its boosted cash reserves to reinvest in its business, expanding AWS' reach by building data centers in new regions, enhancing its AI offerings, and venturing into chip development. Amazon will report its Q2 2024 earnings on Aug. 3, which will likely follow recent trends in beating estimates. MSFT PS Ratio Chart\n\nMoreover, the above chart shows Amazon is potentially the best-valued stock among its AI rivals. Not only does it have the lowest price-to-sales ratio (P/S) among these companies, but its figure for the metric is also the closest to its 10-year average. As a result, Amazon's stock is a bargain right now, compared to its potential, and could make you rich in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Apple: Carving out a lucrative role in AI\n\nApple's stock didn't rally many investors in the first half of 2024, with its share price dipping about 1% from Jan. 1 to the start of June. However, recent announcements have made Wall Street bullish again, boosting the stock by 17% since last month.\n\nApple was largely left out of the rally many tech stocks enjoyed thanks to AI last year. The iPhone maker initially struggled to find its function in the market as companies like Amazon and Microsoft found their AI niches in cloud computing. However, while many of the company's peers are focused on providing businesses with AI services, Apple is prioritizing the consumer market.\n\nThe company hosted its annual Worldwide Developer Conference in June, where it announced Apple Intelligence, with the apt tagline, \"AI for the rest of us.\" Apple Intelligence is a range of generative features coming to the company's products, including writing tools with enhanced language capabilities, image generation, access to OpenAI's ChatGPT, and a complete overhaul to Siri.\n\nApple Intelligence will launch this fall and coincide with the September release of Apple's newest iPhone, its first smartphone designed with a focus on AI. The coming iPhone is among just a few products with access to Apple Intelligence, as the generative features will be reserved for the company's newest devices. Apple's AI strategy is designed to encourage consumers to upgrade their current devices, which could lead to a significant earnings boost in its next quarter.\n\nIn addition to potential stock growth from AI, Apple will release its Q3 2024 earnings at the beginning of August. Recent reports have indicated a possible jump in iPhone and Mac sales this quarter, which could lead to a turnaround for the company's product segments after a recent slump.\n\nAs a result, it could be worth investing in Apple's stock now before earnings season and the launch of its next iPhone. The company's shares are trading at 35 times its earnings, indicating they're not exactly a bargain. However, that figure has come down over the last week. Meanwhile, Apple's long-term potential suggests its stock is worth its premium price, making it worthy of buying this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

The company is scheduled to release its earnings on August 1, 2024. On that day, Apple is projected to report earnings of $1.33 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 5.56%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $83.79 billion, up 2.44% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAAPL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $6.59 per share and revenue of $386.46 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +7.5% and +0.83%, respectively.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

The divestiture, executed over several transactions, totaled approximately $1.48 billion.\n\nOver a three-day period last week, Berkshire Hathaway offloaded 33.9 million shares of Bank of America. Although this reduced the company's holdings by about $1.5 billion, Berkshire Hathaway still holds nearly 1 billion shares of the bank in its portfolio, equating to an almost 13% stake.\n\nThe news of the sale led to a drop in Bank of America's shares during intraday trading on Monday, while Berkshire Hathaway's shares remained relatively stable. As per a regulatory filing on Friday, the company sold the shares at per-share prices ranging from $43.13 to $44.07.\n\n⚠️Track your favourite companies with InvestingPro!

        "content": "CrowdStrike Faces Downgrades Amid Concerns Over Pricing and Renewals Following Disruption\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock continued its downward price trajectory Monday as its cloud software update on Thursday triggered an outage that affected businesses worldwide.\n\nA failed update to CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform disrupted Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) systems, halting critical global services, including airports, ports, financial institutions, and hospitals.\n\nMicrosoft said the outage affected less than 1% of Windows users globally, equating to 8.5 million machines.\n\nAlso Read: Goldman Sachs Analyst Stays Course On CrowdStrike Despite Outage, Expects Strong Company Reputation To Aid Recovery\n\nWindows holds about 72% of the global operating system market share, while CrowdStrike commands nearly 24% in endpoint protection security.\n\nMicrosoft clarified that a prior agreement with the European Commission prevents it from adopting the same security measures as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as it battled criticism.\n\nSeveral analysts rerated Crowdstrike stock on Monday, voicing their mixed opinions on the prospects of the stock.\n\nGuggenheim analyst John Difucci downgraded CrowdStrike from Buy to Neutral. BTIG analyst Gray Powell downgraded from Buy to Neutral.\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Rob Owens maintained a Neutral and lowered the price target from $400 to $310.\n\nOwens notes the CrowdStrike incident as relatively unprecedented. With the incident impacting airlines, hospitals, and 911 call centers, the analyst expects that speculation around litigation will remain for some time, alongside uncertainty around pricing, renewals, and new logo additions. The analyst projects second-quarter revenue and adjusted EPS of $961.2 million and $0.99.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron reiterated an Outperform. Kidron removed CrowdStrike from his 2024 top picks. While the analyst remains positive about the long-term opportunity, he expects shares to face continued pressure near-term.\n\nCanaccord Genuity analyst Kingsley Crane reiterated a Buy and a $405 price target.\n\nRBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg maintained an Outperform rating and a price target of $420, down from $380.  Hedberg expects CrowdStrike to emerge as a stronger cyber-security vendor as this was not a breach but rather a significant breakdown in process.\n\nThe analyst considers the outage a possible near-term overhang, which illustrates the interconnected nature of the ecosystem. Hedberg projects second-quarter revenue and adjusted EPS of $959.8 million and $0.99.\n\nTruist Securities analyst Joel P. Fishbein Jr reiterated a Buy with a price target of $400. Fishbein Jr. notes that the outage and impact are a result of a faulty software update rather than a security breach.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe analyst expects the outage to be okay with the fundamental demand for the company’s security solutions. In the near term, it does dent the company’s stellar image, but Fishbein Jr. did not expect its competitors to take market share from CrowdStrike. He remains a buyer on weakness.\n\nScotia Bank analyst Patrick Colville downgraded to Sector Perform from Sector Outperform with a price target of $300, down from the prior $393.\n\nColville voiced a similar opinion as per Trusit analyst Fishbein Jr. Colville projects second-quarter revenue and adjusted EPS of $953.8 million and $0.99.\n\nThe stock plunged 30% in the last five days.\n\nPrice Action: CRWD shares traded lower by 12.8% at $265.74 at the last check on Monday.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for CRWD\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Barclays Maintains Overweight Mar 2022 Canaccord Genuity Maintains Buy Mar 2022 Deutsche Bank Maintains Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for CRWD\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article CrowdStrike Faces Downgrades Amid Concerns Over Pricing and Renewals Following Disruption originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has blamed EU rules for enabling a faulty security update to cause the world’s biggest IT outage.\n\nThe software giant said a 2009 agreement with the European Commission meant it was unable to make security changes that would have blocked the CrowdStrike update that triggered widespread travel and healthcare chaos on Friday.\n\nCrowdStrike’s Falcon system, designed to prevent cyber attacks, has privileged access to a key part of a computer known as the kernel.\n\nThis meant that a faulty update last week resulted in millions of Windows computers and servers being unable to load at all, leading to flight cancellations, contactless payments not working and GP surgeries being unable to make appointments.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMicrosoft, which offers its own alternative to CrowdStrike known as Windows Defender, agreed in 2009 to allow multiple security providers to install software at the kernel level amid a European competition investigation.\n\nIn contrast, Apple blocked access to the kernel on its Mac computers in 2020, which it said would improve security and reliability.\n\nA Microsoft spokesman told the Wall Street Journal that it was unable to make a similar change because of the EU agreement. Queues of passengers at Bangkok's Don Mueang airport in Thailand on Saturday after a global IT outage caused widespread disruption - Mailee Osten-Tan/Getty\n\nMicrosoft said on Saturday that the CrowdStrike update had affected 8.5m Windows devices. This was less than 1pc of all machines operating the software, but had major impacts because CrowdStrike is widely used in businesses.\n\nThe faulty update caused a blue error screen on many computer screens, rendering them unusable until they were fixed.\n\nCrowdStrike said on Monday that “a significant number” of the affected computers were back online and apologised for the disruption.\n\nFigures from data company OAG showed that 9,650 flights had been cancelled between Friday and Sunday. While many airlines had recovered, 2,619 flights were cancelled on Sunday, with US airline Delta accounting for most of those.\n\nThe NHS said that its systems were back online but that “there still may be some delays as services recover”.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe European Commission pursued Microsoft in the early 2000s over concerns that the company’s popular Windows software gave it an unfair advantage in other areas such as web browsers.\n\nIn 2009 the company agreed to boost choice for computer users in browsers and other software.\n\nIt comes as new European laws are forcing Apple to open up its iPhone. Under the new Digital Markets Act, the company will have to allow alternative app stores and web browser engines on the iPhone.\n\nApple has claimed the changes will make the iPhone less safe.",

        "content": "How To Earn $500 Per Month From Apple Stock\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the few companies worldwide to have gone over the $3 trillion mark. It has made fortunes for its founders and early investors, but it can also put money in your pocket. The most obvious way to earn money from investing in Apple is through capital appreciation, but it does pay a modest dividend. However, be warned: It will take a lot of Apple stock to put any dividend income in your pocket.\n\nApple Inc.’s 52-week price range was $164.08 to $237.23. Its dividend yield is 0.43%. It paid $0.96 in dividends during the past year. As of this writing, the stock has risen 20% over the past year and over the past five years by over 340%. That's not too shabby for a company of its size.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nThis property type is nearly recession-proof — see passive income real estate deals for accredited investors. The CEOs of Uber and Salesforce are so impressed with this platform they put their own money behind it. Join them, invest in private credit, and earn 7-9% APY.\n\nWill Apple Build The Next Big Thing?\n\nOne theory of investing says that when a big company starts paying dividends, its best years may be behind it. We don't subscribe to that theory, but the market is waiting for Apple to build on its reputation for innovation. The most recent iterations of the iPhone have attracted sales but not the fan frenzy that earlier launches generated. During the most recent quarter, iPhone sales dropped by 10%. The Apple Watch is popular but hasn't become a must-have device to the same level as the iPhone.\n\nSome company watchers say that Apple has too much riding on the Vision Pro, which has a steep price tag and hasn't taken off the way many betting on virtual reality would have expected. Apple recently announced a new lineup of immersive videos and movies made specifically for the Vision Pro. We can expect to hear much more about the Vision Pro from CEO Tim Cook at the next earnings call on August 1.\n\nOne area where Apple is seeing growth is in its services area. Apple is bringing more content to its entertainment offerings, including live sports. We could also see it delve more deeply into artificial intelligence. While skeptics say Apple is too late to the generative AI party, its advantage is that it owns the devices that most of us use to interact with AI. Apple has the potential to surprise the world, but missteps, like a foray into self-driving cars, are cause for concern.\n\nCheck It Out: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate.\n\nHow Can You Earn $500 Per Month As An Apple Investor?\n\nLet's get back to the money. If you want consistent $500  income from Apple, the bad news is you already need to have achieved millionaire status. To earn $500 per month — $6,000 annually — from Apple’s dividends, your investment value needs to be approximately $1,395,349, which is 6,222 shares at $224.27 each. Alternatively, to earn $100 per month, your investment value drops to $279,070 or 1,244 shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere's how to do the dividend yield calculations: When making an estimate, you need two key variables — the desired annual income ($6,000) and the dividend yield (0.43% in this case). So, $6,000 / 0.0043 = $1,395,349 to generate an income of $500 per month, and $1,200 / 0.0043 = $279,070 for $100 per month.\n\nYou can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the stock’s current price. For instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as a yearly dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2/$50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nInvesting in Apple Inc. can provide a stable monthly income, but you'd have to outlay significant cash that might be better deployed across multiple opportunities. While Apple has performed very well as a stock, past performance doesn't mean the company can deliver again. It’s important to consider market volatility and the potential for dividend changes. And we never like to have our eggs all in one basket; exploring ETFs, bonds,  mutual funds, and private investing opportunities can offer diversified income streams with potentially lower risks.\n\nCheck Out One Of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\n\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\n\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over 2 years starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

        "title": "Billionaire Warren Buffett Has Purchased $77 Billion of His Favorite Stock, Which Is More Than Double What He's Spent Buying Shares of Apple!",
        "content": "For nearly 60 years, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been running circles around Wall Street's major stock indexes. Since ascending to the CEO chair in the mid-1960s, he's overseen an aggregate return of greater than 5,350,000% for Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on July 18. This works out to an annualized return or nearly 20% over six decades.\n\nReturns of this magnitude over such a lengthy time frame are virtually unheard of, which is why the \"Oracle of Omaha\" garners so much attention on Wall Street. Some 40,000 people flock to Omaha, NE, each year for a chance to hear Buffett speak about the U.S. economy, his investment philosophy, and the stocks he favors. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nIf there's one investing trait that's been vital to Buffett's success as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, it's portfolio concentration. Billionaire Warren Buffett and the late, great Charlie Munger have long favored putting an outsized percentage of Berkshire's capital to work in their best ideas. As of last week, 75% of Berkshire's $416 billion investment portfolio was invested in just five unstoppable stocks.\n\nYet what might come as a surprise is that Buffett's biggest investment -- $77 billion in under six years -- and favorite stock to buy doesn't show up in Berkshire's investment portfolio.\n\nApple is Berkshire's top holding, but not its largest cost basis\n\nDespite Buffett and his team of advisors (Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) selling almost 126.2 million shares of tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) during the combined fourth quarter and first quarter, Berkshire's top holding still accounts for more than 43% of its invested assets.\n\nDuring Berkshire Hathaway's most recent annual meeting, Buffett attributed this selling activity as being tax-related and not representative of him or his team losing faith in Apple. In fact, Buffett has previously referred to his company's top holding as \"a better business than any we own.\" Perhaps it's not surprising that the remaining 789.4 million shares of Apple owned by Berkshire have a mammoth estimated cost basis of more than $31 billion.\n\nAlthough the Oracle of Omaha isn't the biggest fan of investing in tech stocks or buzzy innovations, he does understand consumer behavior, the power of branding, and a high-quality management team when he sees one.\n\nApple finds itself at the top of the pecking order in domestic smartphone market share. Since introducing 5G-capable iPhones in 2020, it's accounted for a 50% or greater share of the market. It's also made strides in personal computing, with Mac gaining market share in the U.S. over the last three years.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, CEO Tim Cook isn't satisfied with Apple simply being a physical product innovator. Cook is spearheading a multiyear shift that's seen Apple focus its efforts on subscription services. A services-driven operating model should improve the company's operating margin over time and help keep customers within its ecosystem of products and services.\n\nLastly, Apple's share repurchase program is unrivaled among publicly traded companies. Since kicking off its buyback program in 2013, the world's largest publicly traded company has bought back $674 billion worth of its common stock. Share repurchases are increasing Berkshire's stake in Apple without Buffett or his crew having to do a thing. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBuffett has spent a small fortune buying shares of his favorite stock\n\nThe estimated $31.3 billion that's been spent buying shares of Apple is more than the Oracle of Omaha and his team have put to work in Chevron, Occidental Petroleum, Bank of America, and any other core holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.\n\nYet this $31.3 billion investment in Apple is less than half the amount Warren Buffett has spent buying shares of his favorite stock.\n\nThe reason you don't hear about Buffett's favorite stock all that often is because you won't find it in the company's quarterly Form 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F is where investors look to see what stocks Wall Street's brightest (and richest) money managers were buying and selling the latest quarter.\n\nFor details on Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy, investors have to dig into Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results. On the final page of each report, just prior to the executive certifications, you'll find detailed trading activity on share repurchases. That's right... billionaire Warren Buffett's top stock to buy over the last six years has unquestionably been shares of his own company.\n\nSince Berkshire Hathaway doesn't pay a dividend, repurchasing stock is one of the easiest ways to reward the company's long-term investors. However, buying back stock hasn't always been easy.\n\nPrior to mid-July 2018, Buffett and Charlie Munger had their hands tied when it came to buybacks. Repurchases were only allowed if Berkshire's stock fell to or below 120% of book value, which hadn't occurred for a long, long time. This meant not a penny was put toward buybacks.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, Berkshire Hathaway's board altered the criteria governing share repurchases to make it easier for its dynamic duo of Buffett and Munger to come off the bench and work their magic. The board decreed that buybacks could continue without an end date or ceiling as long as:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet; and Warren Buffett (and Charlie Munger) believe shares are intrinsically cheap.\n\nBecause \"cheap\" is subjective, and Berkshire's cash pile has been growing with consistency for years, Buffett has overseen more than $77 billion worth of buybacks over 23 consecutive quarters. This dwarfs the amount of capital put to work in Apple.\n\nOne clear advantage of this aggressive repurchase policy is that it's incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders. The Oracle of Omaha and the late Munger have always preached a long-term ethos, and a steady stream of buybacks certainly supports this approach.\n\nA steady diet of share repurchases should also reduce Berkshire's outstanding share count. For companies with rising net income, buybacks can increase earnings per share (EPS), which can improve their attractiveness to fundamentally focused investors.\n\nWith Berkshire Hathaway potentially tipping the scales at north of $200 billion in combined cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries as of the end of June 2024, look for Buffett to continue mashing the buy button on his favorite stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape.

        "title": "Billionaire Warren Buffett Has $135 Billion Invested in Just 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock. Is It Time to Buy?",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is one of the most closely followed and studied investors in history. Since 1965, he's led investment conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway and helped generate an overall return of 4,384,748%.\n\nIt's fair to say that Buffett knows a thing or two about picking stocks. Some of the hallmarks of Buffett's portfolio include financial services, energy businesses, and consumer goods companies. By contrast, one sector that Buffett notably stayed away from for years is technology.\n\nHowever, in 2016, the Oracle of Omaha made a splash by revealing a massive position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Less than a decade later, the iPhone maker is now Buffett's largest position -- worth roughly $135 billion and accounting for nearly 41% of his total portfolio.\n\nLet's dig into why Buffett loves Apple stock so much, and assess if now is a good time for investors to scoop up some shares.\n\nBuffett's investment philosophy is surprisingly simple\n\nYou don't need to be good at picking individual stocks to mimic Buffett's success. In fact, much of Buffett's investment philosophy revolves around exercising patience and discipline as opposed to trying to identify the \"next big thing.\"\n\nBesides Apple, some of Buffett's largest positions include Coca-Cola, American Express, Occidental Petroleum, Bank of America, and Chevron. The first key item to recognize here is that Buffett is well diversified.\n\nWhat's more important, however, is taking a look at how long Buffett has owned some of these companies. For example, Buffett has owned Coca-Cola stock since 1988. Although Coca-Cola may be seen by many as a mundane business, Buffett has enjoyed generous returns over the decades thanks to Coca-Cola's reliable, steady growth and dividend program.\n\nApple is a bit of a different story, though. Buffett has owned Apple stock for less than a decade, and yet it's already ballooned into his largest position.\n\nClearly, Apple has experienced outsize price appreciation in recent years. Now, with artificial intelligence (AI) taking the spotlight in the technology sector, could investors be looking at a generational opportunity in Apple right now? Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nApple's AI strategy has been revealed\n\nOver the last couple of years, many big tech stalwarts have made splashy moves in the AI realm. Microsoft made a $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the developer behind ChatGPT. Moreover, Alphabet and Amazon each invested in a competitor to OpenAI, Anthropic.\n\nThe main thread stitching these investments together is that Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet compete fiercely with one another in the cloud computing landscape.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnlike its peers above, Apple remained suspiciously quiet as it related to its AI ambitions. Considering the company's sales have been in decline for about a year now, I found the lack of an AI roadmap to be unnerving.\n\nHowever, about a month ago during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), management finally provided investors with a preview of Apple Intelligence -- the company's long-awaited strategy around AI.\n\nApple will be partnering with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT across its suite of hardware products as it looks to bring AI-powered applications to the masses.\n\nApple's WWDC took place from June 10 to June 14. And since June 10, shares of Apple have soared by 16%.\n\nUnsurprisingly, over the last month many Wall Street analysts have revamped and upgraded their price targets for Apple stock as well.\n\nIs the premium valuation worth it?\n\nAs illustrated in the chart below, Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) multiples are significantly higher today than they were just a year ago. It's hard for me to justify these premium multiples considering Apple has shown little in the way of growth or innovation for quite some time. AAPL PE Ratio Chart\n\nOn the surface, it looks like investors are encouraged by the bullish sentiment surrounding Apple Intelligence that has led to significant buying activity in the stock. While it can be tempting to follow, buying into momentum is seldom a good strategy.\n\nOne other aspect that makes Buffett such a great investor is that he is a contrarian. Buffett does not follow the crowd or chase lofty valuations.\n\nWhile Apple Intelligence is an intriguing development, the company has yet to show any tangible results from it yet. Furthermore, the initial Apple Intelligence product suite isn't set to be released until the fall.\n\nTo me, it looks like investors are buying more into the story around Apple Intelligence, and the current outsize buying activity is rooted in emotional hype as opposed to prudent logic.\n\nWhile the rising price in Apple stock is good for Berkshire and Buffett, I don't think it's warranted at the moment. Should the company begin to show a turnaround in sales, and perhaps later this year start translating Apple Intelligence into a significant source of growth, scooping up shares could be a good idea. But for now, I would not initiate a position in Apple or add to an existing one.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "After taking a backseat in the first half, the healthcare sector is finally coming to life. The rising odds of a Trump presidency have improved prospects for the industry, validating the case for increasing positions in healthcare stocks to buy now.\n\nRegardless of who wins in November, the long-term story for healthcare stocks remains very attractive. First, healthcare spending will outpace GDP growth over the next decade due to increased social care spending and more health-conscious populations. For instance, in the U.S., the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services predicts national health expenditures to rise 5.6% annually between 2023 and 2032.\n\nConsidering the aging baby boomer population, spending trends can only rise from current levels. In particular, Medicare spending will experience a surge as more boomers enroll. Moreover, spending on physician and clinical services, pharmaceuticals and medical devices keeps rising.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe following three healthcare stocks to buy now are well-positioned to benefit from this increased spending. What’s more, they trade at reasonable valuations, presenting substantial upside.\n\niRhythm Technologies (IRTC) hands holding a red heart shape against blue background symbolizing health\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Anastasia Zagoruyko\n\nThis medical device maker has a revolutionary product for the heart health diagnostic market. iRhythm Technologies (NASDAQ:IRTC) offers a cardiac monitoring solution, Zio XT, for heart rhythm monitoring, enabling the detection of a heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation. This condition causes 450,000 hospitalizations annually in the U.S., so Zio XT is a lifesaver.\n\nThe moat around iRhythm Technologies is cemented by its AI algorithms. While the hardware patch collects patient data, its proprietary AI engine automates the analysis. iRhythm has collected over 1.8 billion hours of heart rhythm data, enabling it to generate accurate reports for clinicians.\n\nStill, there is a significant growth opportunity from now on. First, according to the American Heart Association, 12 million people in the U.S. face a risk of undiagnosed cardiac arrhythmias by 2030. Secondly, its next-generation product, Zio Monitor, is more comfortable for patients and has better economics. Thirdly, international markets represent de minimis revenues today but can grow to 25% of revenues.\n\nWith such a compelling growth story, iRhythm Technologies is among the top healthcare stocks to buy now for growth. Wolfe Research expects high teens revenue growth and argues that the stock deserves a premium multiple. In line with this view, they have an “outperform” rating and a $115 price target.\n\nStory continues\n\nGE HealthCare Technologies (GEHC) GE Healthcare (GEHC) sign. GE Healthcare is an American company founded in 2014 and spun off from GE in 2023.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nGE HealthCare Technologies (NASDAQ:GEHC) is a healthcare technology company spun off from General Electric in January 2023. It’s the world’s largest medical imaging provider and will profit from a shift to precision care. Moreover, the industry dynamics are very favorable, with only two main competitors, Siemens Healthineers (OTCMKTS:SMMNY) and Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG).\n\nThis healthcare company is a global operator with revenues spread across the U.S., Europe and China. Its ultrasound, PET and CT scans, X-ray and MRI machines are mission-critical for hospitals, guaranteeing predictable revenues. Moreover, 50% of revenues are from servicing, consumables and spare parts, hence recurring.\n\nGoing forward, GEHC is one of the healthcare stocks to buy now due to its imaging technology leadership and potential margin improvements. Under more focused management after its spinoff, it can improve its operating margins from the current mid-teens to match Siemens Healthineers levels in the mid-20s.\n\nMoreover, there is a substantial tailwind from growing digital revenues. An installed base of over 4 million machines provides data analytics needed to generate AI-enabled software revenue. Considering the significant revenue opportunities and margin improvements ahead, the stock is undervalued at 19 times forward earnings.\n\nMasimo (MASI) An image of two medical professionals performing a procedure on a patient\n\nSource: Roman Zaiets / Shutterstock.com\n\nMasimo (NASDAQ:MASI) is a sign monitoring equipment and software provider with significant upside. The company plans to spin off its consumer business after pressure from activist Politan Capital. These plans could unlock substantial value for the company.\n\nAt its core, Masimo offers sensors to monitor blood hemoglobin content, oxygen levels and pulse rates. This is a lucrative business since 85% of revenues come from selling disposable sensors that provide recurring revenues.\n\nThe big drag on MASI stock has been the acquisition of Sound United in 2022. The company hoped this acquisition would provide the distribution assets it needed to release and market its sign-monitoring smartwatch. However, investors have viewed this acquisition as a distraction that added debt.\n\nWith a spinout of its audio and consumer healthcare products on the way, Masimo is among the high-quality healthcare stocks to buy now. On July 8, Reuters reported that Masimo had received a $950 million offer for this business. Moreover, analysts expect Masimo will retain a substantial portion of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) lawsuit award.\n\nUnder this spinout plan, Well Fargo sees upside and has an “overweight” rating and a $160 price target. Investors will attach a higher multiple as Masimo returns its focus to its core healthcare and telehealth products business.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The metaverse, a virtual world where people can interact with one another using headsets and avatars, has been eclipsed by all the hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). However, the metaverse has not gone away. A number of leading metaverse stocks continue to work diligently on its development.\n\nWhile it doesn’t get as much media attention as a few years ago, the metaverse continues to be one of the fastest-growing areas of technology. The metaverse’s market size is forecast to grow from $86.31 billion in 2023 to $803.29 billion by 2031. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 40%. The technology underpinning the metaverse is only improving, as are the products related to the virtual realm.\n\nHere are three metaverse stocks that could grow your wealth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) entered the metaverse at the start of this year with the launch of its Vision Pro augmented reality headset, the company’s first new product since the introduction of the Apple Watch in 2015. At the beginning of July, Apple expanded the Vision Pros availability to Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. While the headset has won technical praise from critics, its price has been an issue.\n\nThe headset allows users to play video games, view photographs, and watch movies in a virtual setting. It is priced at $3,499 in the U.S. market. Analysts say the hefty price tag puts the Vision Pro out of reach for most consumers. Apple looks to be rectifying the situation by developing a cheaper model. Media reports say Apple is focused on entering the lower end of the augmented reality headset market in 2025.\n\nApple’s stock has increased 20% so far this year. All in all, this is one of the top metaverse stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) remains a top metaverse stock and the industry leader when it comes to virtual reality or augmented reality headsets. Meta’s Quest device has a starting price of $499.99. It has become the market leader, having won praise from critics and consumers alike. The latest Quest 3 device continues to sell extremely well and has proven to be popular with kids.\n\nBeyond its lower price, other advantages to the Quest include a longer battery life and more applications than competing devices, including Apple’s Vision Pro headset. Meta Platforms rebranded itself a few years ago to reflect its focus on the metaverse. It also continues to lead the development of the technology that underpins virtual realms and products. META stock has increased 52% in the last 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s had a rough go of it lately, but video game developer Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) is still a metaverse stock worth considering. The company runs the Roblox online video game platform. Roblox is a virtual world in which users can program and play games they create themselves or with other users. While Roblox remains extremely popular with kids and teens, the stock has struggled with mixed earnings and guidance.\n\nMost recently, Roblox posted a Q1 loss of 43 cents per share. This was much better than a loss of 53 cents expected on Wall Street. Bookings totaled $923.8 million in Q1, up 19% from a year earlier and above analyst estimates of $919 million. While the financial results were positive, the company delivered forward guidance that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. This sent the stock lower.\n\nManagement said they expect bookings (revenue) of $870 million to $900 million for the year’s second quarter, below analysts’ calls for $929 million. For all of 2024, bookings are expected to be between $4 billion and $4.1 billion, down from an earlier forecast of $4.14 billion to $4.28 billion. RBLX stock is down 7% so far in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The broader market rally has left many investors wondering if there are any growth stocks to buy before a correction. I believe that there absolutely are. Despite the run-up, a number of high-potential growth stocks remain undervalued. Their fundamentals have only gotten stronger.\n\nI believe these stocks are poised for a major bounce-back over the next 12 months. Several have already begun to recover. Now may be the time to establish a position before they really take off.\n\nInvesting just $1,000 across these picks could generate market-beating returns. A few even have the potential to become multi-baggers. That means a relatively small investment today might lead to very sizable gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are seven to look into:\n\nBombardier (BDRBF) BOMBARDIER sign is seen during the 12th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition, also known as Airshow China 2018. BDRBD stock\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nBombardier (OTCMKTS:BDRBF) designs and manufactures business jets for corporations, governments, and wealthy individuals. The Canadian aerospace company has been on a roll lately, with its stock price surging over 78% so far in 2024. I believe Bombardier is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing boom in private aviation and increased defense spending.\n\nIn the first quarter, Bombardier grew its order backlog to $14.9 billion. The company also expanded margins and is on track to deliver 150-155 aircraft this year, up from 138 in 2023. Bombardier’s high-margin aftermarket service revenues jumped 13% year-over-year in Q1.\n\nAnalysts are quite bullish on the stock, with 8 out of 11 rating it a “Buy.” I personally believe that this stock could cross $100.\n\nLast week, Bombardier reached a new 3-year labor deal with its union, ending an 18-day strike. The company is also doing its part for the environment, installing thousands of solar panels to slash emissions at its London service center. Thus, the company looks poised to hit its 2025 targets of $9 billion in revenue and $1.6 billion in EBITDA, making it among the best growth stocks to buy.\n\nPaysign (PAYS) An image of two cellphones with coins flying from one screen into the other.

The company has been making waves lately with impressive financial results and a promising growth trajectory. In the first quarter of 2024, Paysign’s revenue surged 30% year-over-year to $13.2 million, beating analyst estimates. Net income turned positive at $309,000, a significant improvement from the net loss in the same period last year.\n\nI believe Paysign is well-positioned to capitalize on the megatrend of digital payments and the tailwinds of increasing healthcare spending. The company’s focus on the healthcare industry, particularly its rapidly expanding patient affordability business, sets it apart. It has a pipeline of new programs and partnerships with major pharmaceutical companies. As such, I’m not surprised to see that Paysign’s patient affordability revenue skyrocketed by 305% in Q1 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Paysign’s prospects. The stock is rated a strong buy with a 21% upside potential. As interest rate cuts take effect and transaction volumes rise, I expect Paysign’s growth to accelerate further.\n\nIAC (IAC) The logo for IAC is seen at the top of an office building.\n\nSource: Black Pebble / Shutterstock.com\n\nIAC (NASDAQ:IAC) is a media and internet company that owns brands like Dotdash Meredith, Care.com, and Angi. It also just inked a deal with OpenAI to license Dotdash Meredith’s trusted content like People, Food & Wine, and Better Homes & Gardens. This partnership should translate into high-margin profits as OpenAI pays IAC for the rights to enhance its AI models with this premium content.\n\nIn Q1 2024, IAC beat earnings estimates with earnings per share of -34 cents vs the -76 cents expected, though revenue of $929.68 million slightly missed estimates. Analysts seem to agree that IAC is on the right track, with TD Cowen reiterating a buy rating and a $78 price target, viewing IAC as significantly undervalued. Improving EPS should send the stock higher, even if revenue stays sluggish.

Count me optimistic on IAC’s prospects to ride the AI megatrend to new heights in the category of growth stocks to buy.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) sells functional energy drinks and liquid supplements. The stock has plummeted nearly 50% from its 2024 highs amid concerns about slowing growth and high valuation.\n\nI believe this selloff is overdone and presents a compelling buying opportunity for long-term investors. Celsius is well-positioned to capitalize on the megatrends of health and wellness, functional beverages, and fitness. The company reported record Q1 revenue of $355.7 million, up 37% year-over-year, and expects to benefit from expanded distribution through its PepsiCo partnership.\n\nAnalysts forecast Celsius’ earnings per share to double over the next two years, with sales projected to increase around 30% annually through 2026. If Celsius can execute on these growth targets while riding the tailwinds of its key market trends, I see significant upside potential for the stock to bounce back strongly in the coming years. The recent dip looks like an attractive entry point for investors willing to hold through any near-term volatility. The analyst price target is also very bullish for a company of this size.

But for those who believe in Celsius’ long-term story, now may be the time to take a swig of this beaten-down beverage stock.\n\nSea Limited (SE) The logo for Sea Limited is seen on a web browser through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nSea Limited (NYSE:SE) is a tech conglomerate that operates in Southeast Asia. I’ve been bullish on this company for around a year now, and I’m pleased to see the stock making some positive moves recently. In Q1 2024, Sea posted a strong 23% year-over-year revenue growth to $3.7 billion, though it did report a net loss of $23 million. The company’s e-commerce arm, Shopee, achieved record high orders, GMV, and revenue, while its SeaMoney financial services business saw significant user growth. Sea’s gaming unit Garena also rebounded, with its Free Fire game being the most downloaded mobile game globally in Q1.\n\nI believe Sea remains well-positioned to be the “Amazon of Southeast Asia” with its strong market presence in the region’s fast-growing economies. Analysts are optimistic, projecting EPS to jump from $2 in 2024 to $5.65 in 2026, along with sustained double-digit revenue growth. While there may be short-term fluctuations, the long-term prospects for Sea look bright as it rides the tailwinds of e-commerce and gaming growth in Southeast Asia and is one of the best growth stocks to buy in the region.\n\nDirect Digital Holdings (DRCT) Close up hand holding mobile with Digital Advertising and icons, Digital Marketing concept. digital ad stocks\n\nSource: weedezign via Shutterstock\n\nDirect Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:DRCT) operates an advertising and marketing technology platform. The company’s stock has plunged nearly 87% since peaking in March, but I believe it may have bottomed out near its historical resistance level. At current prices, the potential upside outweighs the downside risk.\n\nAnalysts expect margins to expand swiftly, with EPS rising from 26 cents this year to 41 cents next year, accompanied by double-digit revenue growth. The company recently announced partnerships with Amazon Publisher Services and HPE GreenLake, which should attract more demand to its Colossus SSP platform and boost performance. Rate cuts could also boost earnings significantly due to its interest expenses being high. How Direct Digital Holdings Makes Its Money\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThese positive catalysts make me believe Direct Digital Holdings could soar once again over the next year. The digital advertising megatrend provides a strong tailwind. And with its shares trading at a fraction of their March high, now may be an opportune time for risk-tolerant investors to start a position.\n\nATRenew (RERE) A concept image of mobile payment with a smart phone for a cup of coffee.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nATRenew (NYSE:RERE) operates the largest pre-owned consumer electronics transactions and services platform in China. The company has been making strides lately, with total revenues growing 27.1% year-over-year to RMB3.65 billion in Q1 2024 and non-GAAP operating income reaching RMB80.2 million. I believe ATRenew’s stock—which has traded between $1-$3 for the past two years—is primed for a breakout in the next 12 months as fundamentals continue to improve.\n\nManagement is optimistic about future growth, citing increasing recycling opportunities driven by government action plans and rising demand for used products in China.\n\nPartnerships with major players like JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are fueling ATRenew’s product revenue growth. The company’s multi-category recycling business is also taking off, with transaction value quadrupling year-over-year in Q1. Analysts seem bullish, too – Zacks recently introduced 2024 and 2025 adjusted EPS estimates of 25 cents and 38 cents for ATRenew, implying 90% growth this year and 50%+ next year.\n\nWith RMB2.6 billion in cash, a share buyback program underway, and potential dividends on the horizon, I think ATRenew trades well-positioned among growth stocks to buy in order to ride the tailwinds of China’s push toward a circular economy in the coming years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Possible Bearish Signals With Apple Insiders Disposing Stock",
        "content": "Over the past year, many Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple\n\nApple Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Senior VP, Katherine Adams, for US$23m worth of shares, at about US$189 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$224). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 30% of Katherine Adams's stake.\n\nInsiders in Apple didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this freelist of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\n\nInsiders At Apple Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Apple. In total, insiders dumped US$15m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\n\nDoes Apple Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Apple insiders own 0.06% of the company, worth about US$2.1b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Do The Apple Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Apple makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Apple you should know about.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Apple Stock Soars to New Peak. Here's Why I'm Doubling Down.",
        "content": "Shares in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) have risen 8% over the last month, hitting an all-time high of $237 per share in mid-July. The company's stock has outperformed many of the most prominent names in artificial intelligence (AI), including Microsoft, Alphabet, and even Nvidia. Apple's growth is a welcome turnaround after facing a slump in the first half of the year. NVDA Chart\n\nThis chart illustrates how, up until June, Apple's share price had fallen while many of its rivals enjoyed solid gains. The disparity was largely because Apple had yet to display any encouraging growth in AI. However, that changed on June 10 when the company announced Apple Intelligence, a software overhaul that will bring AI features across its product lineup.\n\nAs a result, recent stock growth shows Apple playing catch-up after a delayed start in the industry. Wall Street is growing increasingly bullish in the lead-up to September when the tech giant will unveil its first iPhone designed with AI in mind.\n\nHere's why I'm doubling down on Apple despite its share price hitting a new peak this month.\n\nApple only just joined the AI rally, suggesting it could have more room to run\n\nThe launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT toward the end of 2022 triggered an AI rally that has yet to loosen its grip on Wall Street. The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has climbed 31% in the last 12 months, driven mainly by excitement over AI. For reference, the S&P 500 rose by 24% during that period.\n\nTech giants like Nvidia and Alphabet delivered stock growth of 159% and 44%, respectively, since last July as they've rallied investors with new AI products. Comparatively, Apple's share price has risen 20%. The iPhone maker has taken a more gradual approach to AI, which has led to slower stock gains. However, the company appears to be ramping up its expansion into the arena, suggesting now could be an excellent time to invest before it's too late.\n\nSeptember is shaping up to be a critical month for Apple, with the release of Apple Intelligence and the company's latest iPhone. Apple Intelligence will bring new features like image and language-generation tools, photo updates, and a complete overhaul of its smart assistant, Siri. However, Apple has strategically made its AI upgrades only available on its newest products.\n\nAs a result, consumers will need an iPhone 15 Pro or higher to access Apple Intelligence through a smartphone. Meanwhile, iPads and Macs must be running the company's M1 through M4 chips. Apple's iPhone 16 launch in September is coming at the perfect time and could lead to a rush of smartphone updates by consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's product line has slumped over the last year, facing repeated sales declines. However, the company is now utilizing AI to encourage shoppers to upgrade their devices. Apple's stock has already begun trickling up since June, but it is still a long way from seeing the growth its peers have enjoyed from AI. Consequently, Apple's shares are a compelling buy right now, with plenty of room to run.\n\nApple's stock is potentially trading at one of its best-valued positions in months AAPL PEG Ratio Chart\n\nAccording to the chart above, Apple's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio has decreased 98% over the last year to about 4.\n\nPEG is a helpful valuation metric as it uniquely accounts for a company's growth prospects. It is calculated by dividing its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) by its earnings-per-share growth rate over time. Generally, the lower the PEG, the better the value.\n\nSo, despite rises in its share price, Apple's stock has actually increased in value over the last year. Its lower PEG suggests its stock is trading at a bargain and at one of its best-valued positions in months.\n\nThe decline in PEG aligns with Apple's significant potential for the rest of 2024. In addition to AI, Apple has a booming services business. Its digital-services segment includes income from the App Store and subscription-based services like Apple TV+ and Music. In the second quarter of 2024, the services segment posted revenue gains of 14% year over year, beating all of Apple's other divisions in growth. Meanwhile, it hit a profit margin of 75%. For reference, Apple's products achieved a profit margin of 37%.\n\nApple had a challenging start to the year but appears to be back on a promising growth trajectory, which is why I'm doubling down on its stock this month.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Street calls of the week: Upgrades for Apple and Shopify; downgrade for Doximity",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nApple\n\nWhat happened? On Monday, Loop Capital upgraded Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Buy with a $300 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Loop Capital has upgraded Apple based on insights from their Supply Chain Analyst John Donovan. Donovan highlights Apple’s potential to become the leading platform for Generative AI in the consumer market over the next few years. This potential is compared to Apple’s past transformative impacts with the iPhone in social media and the iPod in digital content consumption, both of which significantly boosted the company’s stock performance.\n\nThe brokerage’s analysis underscores Gen AI as a potential major growth driver for Apple. They have a price target of $300, which is 33x their projected $9.00 EPS for CY2026. This valuation is positioned at the higher end of Apple’s post-Covid P/E range of 20x to 35x. While there has been speculation about Apple’s potential benefits from Gen AI, Loop’s upgrade is specifically based on Donovan’s detailed assessment.\n\nDespite their optimistic outlook, Loop maintains a cautious approach, noting that the full impact of Gen AI on Apple’s financial metrics will unfold gradually. They emphasize that the upgrade reflects confidence in Apple’s ability to leverage Gen AI to drive future growth, similar to the strategic advancements made with the iPhone and iPod in their respective technological eras.\n\nBuy at Loop means “The stock is expected to trade higher on an absolute basis or outperform relative to the market or its peer stocks over the next 12 months.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Apple opened the regular session at $236.20 and closed at $234.40, a gain of 1.67% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nShopify\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, BofA Securities upgraded Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) to Buy with a $82 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? BofA believes that the company, under the new CFO Jeff Hoffmeister, has turned a corner on balanced growth and margin following years of declining margin. The research team forecasts solid revenue growth and Free Cash Flow conversion from here, driven by solid high single-digit baseline eCommerce growth, steady share gains and disciplined expense spending.\n\nBofA points out that revenue growth and disciplined spending are leading to healthy margin expansion going forward. They forecast a 17.4% operating margin for FY 2026, up from 14.3% in FY 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe research team also notes that normalizing product mix-shift from lower-margin payments should result in a stable gross margin after years of decline (-650 basis points since FY 2017). Shopify is maintaining a ‘disciplined, limited headcount growth’ trajectory as a core tenet for operating leverage.\n\nIn an upside scenario, BofA projects FY 2030 revenue and FCF of $29.4 billion (+22% CAGR) and $8 billion (+33% CAGR), respectively.\n\nBuy at BofA means “Buy stocks are expected to have a total return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Shopify opened the regular session at $67.28 and closed at $69.75, a gain of 8.63% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\n1-800-Flowers.com\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, DA Davidson downgraded 1-800 FLOWERS.COM Inc (NASDAQ:FLWS) to Underperform with a $8 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? DA Davidson has analyzed FLWS’ performance, noting that the company, which operates in the late-cycle discretionary consumer sector, has experienced year-over-year sales declines since the pandemic ended. Sales have decreased in every quarter since F3Q22, with the declines worsening from low- to mid-single digits to -8% to -18% Y/Y over the past five quarters. Before the pandemic, when the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index was in the 90s and above 100, FLWS reported several quarters of organic sales growth between +8% and +10% Y/Y. Currently, the Michigan index is in the 60s-70s, having recovered from a low of 50 in June 2022.\n\nThe brokerage believes that consumer sentiment needs to consistently exceed 80 for FLWS to return to low-single-digit sales growth. Bloomberg debit card data, which is 94% correlated to sales, indicates a worsening trend, with a -15% Y/Y decline in F4Q24 compared to -13% in F3Q24. DA Davidson suggests that the consensus estimate of -6% Y/Y sales for F4Q24 might be too optimistic, potentially leading to a miss. They also anticipate that FLWS could issue FY25 guidance below market expectations due to ongoing recession-level consumer sentiment, weak everyday gifting, and potential cost inflation.\n\nAs a result, DA Davidson has lowered its sales and EBITDA estimates for FLWS to below consensus levels. The brokerage has also reduced its target multiple from 5.5x to 5.0x and its price target from $9 to $8, based on a 5.0x CY25E EBITDA of $106M (down from $109M).\n\nUnderperform at DA Davidson means “Expected to produce a total return of -15% to +15% on a risk adjusted basis over the next 12-18 months.”\n\nHow did the stock react? 1-800-Flowers.com opened the regular session at $10.40 and closed at $10.01, a decline of 9% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nDoximity Inc.\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Wells Fargo downgraded Doximity Inc (NYSE:DOCS) to Underweight with a $19 price target\n\nWhat’s the full story? Wells Fargo acknowledges that while Doximity has an appealing financial profile with consistent Free Cash Flow margins of over 35%, their biopharma survey indicates a slowdown in growth. This is expected to continue driving a downward rerating in the stock. The research team’s survey suggests that market share gains may be plateauing due to several factors. These include a shrinking percentage of clients reporting digital ad budget growth, a client wallet mix towards Doximity that is approaching a plateau, and the fact that bundling products doesn’t always translate into more same-store sales.\n\nAdditionally, a large new account/brand in FY25 is positively skewing growth dynamics, likely creating tough comparisons for FY26. Some clients have also pulled back spend, and some competitors are capturing market share.\n\nFurthermore, Wells Fargo points out that brand lifecycles could increasingly become a hurdle to Doximity’s growth prospects. Surveyed clients reported less desire to rely on Doximity to advertise more mature brands, reflecting the research team’s channel checks. This suggests that the net revenue retention rate could encounter more pressure over time as brands mature, which in turn may lead to declining ad spend with Doximity.\n\nUnderweight at Wells Fargo means “Total return on stock expected to lag the Overweight- and Equal Weight-rated stocks within the analyst's coverage universe over the next 12 months.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Doximity opened the regular session at $27.03 and closed at $27.59 , a decline of 4.83% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nOwens & Minor\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Citi upgraded Owens & Minor Inc (NYSE:OMI) to Buy with a $19 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? The bank believes the 40% sell-off since the first-quarter earnings report has been excessively harsh. OMI has demonstrated strong momentum in its core P&HS business, with the de-stocking of PPE seemingly concluded. In the long term, Citi views Chinese tariffs as a potential advantage for OMI’s products manufactured in the Americas. Despite recent headlines concerning GLP-1, the bank notes that PD (pharmacy distribution) continues to grow above market expectations, a trend they anticipate will persist. Citi sees minimal risk to the FY24 numbers, reinforcing their positive outlook.\n\nThe new price target of $19 reflects a 9.3x FY25 P/E multiple and a 6.0x FY25 adjusted EBITDA, which is significantly lower than OMI’s peers and its historical valuation. This adjustment underscores Citi’s belief that OMI is undervalued and presents a compelling opportunity for investors with a higher risk appetite. The bank’s analysis suggests that the recent market reaction has been overly punitive, and they expect OMI to benefit from both its current business momentum and favorable long-term factors.\n\nBuy at Citi means “Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Owens & Minor opened the regular session at $14.75 and closed at $14.82, a gain of 1.44% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet calls of the week: Upgrades for Apple and Shopify; downgrade for Doximity\n\nIs the bull market broadening or rotating?

        "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Apple upgraded, QCOM cut to Hold amid lack of catalysts",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nLoop Capital upgrades Apple, issues Street high price target\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares climbed higher on Monday after analysts at Loop Capital upgraded the stock to Buy and set a new price target of $300, the highest on Wall Street.\n\nAnalysts expressed confidence in Apple’s potential to become the leading platform for next-generation AI, akin to its historical success with the iPhone and iPod.\n\n\"Our $300 PT is 33x our $9.00 CY2026 EPS (what the stock will be valuing in 12 months). 33x P/E is the higher-end of AAPL’s 20x – 35x post-Covid P/E range,\" Loop Capital explained in their note to clients.\n\nThe latest upgrade is based on the latest findings that suggest a significant increase in iPhone 16 production driven by the excitement surrounding AI.\n\n\"AAPL has an opportunity the next few years to solidify itself as consumer’s Gen AI 'base camp' of choice, just as it did for social media 15 years ago (with iPhone) and digital content consumption 20 years ago (with iPod),” analysts wrote.\n\nWolfe Research starts Google stock coverage\n\nSell-side research firm Wolfe Research on Monday initiated coverage on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock, assigning it an Outperform rating and a price target of $240.00.\n\nThe analysts said the bullish rating is based on a long-term perspective that Alphabet's scale, investments in AI, leadership position in the market, and product innovations will enable the company to outpace the digital advertising market, gain share in Cloud computing, develop new revenue streams, and maintain a strong position in the Gen AI race.\n\nMoreover, the current valuation is seen as “reasonable on a growth-adjusted basis.” Wolfe said its $240 price target is derived from a 25x FY25E price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\n\n\"This multiple is above similar digital ads comp group median multiples but below Mega cap comp group median multiples and reasonable in our view, given GOOGL’s ability to outgrow the digital advertising market and expand margins in the process,\" analysts noted.\n\nHSBC cuts Qualcomm to Hold on ‘less bullish AI PC narrative’\n\nLater in the week, HSBC downgraded Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock to Hold on Wednesday, citing a lack of catalysts and \"a less bullish AI PC narrative.\" Despite raising the target price slightly to $200 from $190, analysts remain cautious about Qualcomm's near-term performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn their note, HSBC forecasts Qualcomm's Q3 FY24 results to align with consensus, projecting revenue of $9.3 billion, close to the consensus estimate of $9.2 billion. The gross margin (GM) for Q3 FY24 is expected to be 55.9%, slightly below the consensus of 56.1%.\n\nHowever, concerns arise for Q4 FY24, as HSBC predicts flat quarter-over-quarter revenue at $9.3 billion, missing the consensus estimate of $9.8 billion due to lower handset revenue projections. The gross margin for Q4 is also expected to decline to 55.6% from the consensus of 55.9%.\n\nHSBC pointed out the ongoing uncertainties in the smartphone market, particularly with China’s Android handset market anticipated to decline by 15% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nAs for the AI PC narrative, HSBC has adjusted its expectations downward following mixed reviews post-Computex. Initially optimistic about QCOM’s early mover advantage with its Snapdragon X Elite/X Plus processors, HSBC now expects Qualcomm to ship only 600,000 AI CPUs in FY24, significantly lower than earlier market expectations of 1-1.5 million. This revision resulted in a substantial reduction in projected AI CPU revenue.\n\nAccenture upgraded to Buy at UBS on GenAI-driven growth expectations\n\nMeanwhile, UBS has raised its rating on Accenture (NYSE:ACN) stock to Buy from Neutral, citing the potential for a multiple expansion as the market anticipates accelerated revenue growth amid AI optionality.\n\n\"While we appreciate concerns about the pace of IT spending, we believe the change in business mix [towards cloud, digital transformation, cybersecurity, and now Gen AI should drive higher and more durable growth,\" UBS analysts stated.\n\nFurther, UBS's analysis of the revenue from Accenture's top 10 alliance partners relative to Accenture's own revenue suggests a top-line acceleration over the next 12 months. As such, UBS believes the stock is not currently pricing in the full extent of GenAI potential.\n\nThe bank’s analysts also expect Gen AI adoption to accelerate as clients begin to realize value at scale from their experiments, potentially scaling even faster than Accenture's cloud business, which grew from $1 billion in FY12 to $32 billion in FY23, representing approximately 50% of total revenue.\n\nTD Cowen ups Fortinet to Buy\n\nDuring the week, cybersecurity firm Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) received an upgrade from TD Cowen analysts, who now hold a Buy rating on the stock.\n\nThe investment bank cited several factors behind the move, including solid channel checks indicating a bottoming cycle for security appliances, expectations of an improved outlook for the second half of 2024 due to easier year-over-year comparisons, an operational technology (OT) upgrade cycle, and increased SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) adoption.\n\nIn addition, analysts view Fortinet “as a beneficiary of on-premise Gen-AI ramp-up.”\n\nTD Cowen also said the valuation of Fortinet at 27x its projected fiscal year 2025 free cash flow (FY25E FCF) is viewed as offering potential upside to the newly established $75 price target.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Apple upgraded, QCOM cut to Hold amid lack of catalysts\n\nIs the bull market broadening or rotating?

        "title": "7 Long-Term Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next Decade: July Edition",
        "content": "The tech industry has taken the market by storm. The biggest mover and a hot property today, tech stocks have helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit new highs, making several investors rich. Looking at the recent rally, investors are flocking to long-term tech stocks and I believe they will not disappoint you for another decade. The future is about artificial intelligence (AI), innovation and machine learning and now is the time to pounce on promising long-term tech stocks.\n\nWhether you have just started your investment journey or have already built a portfolio, it is time to take a look at some of the best tech stocks in the industry today and hold them for another decade. These seven stocks look highly promising, have the potential to generate solid returns, and some also pay dividends! With that in mind, let’s dig into the seven long-term tech stocks.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo The logo of Nvidia AI displayed on smartphone screen. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Muhammad Alimaki / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a super stock to own. Driven by AI, the company has achieved tremendous highs and reported solid revenue numbers each quarter. After the stock split, NVDA exchanged hands for $121, up 151% YTD.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe rally isn’t going to stop anytime soon. Nvidia expects to report record revenue after the launch of the Blackwell platform. The first-quarter revenue came in at $26 billion, and the management is aiming for a revenue of $28 billion in the second quarter.\n\nThe imbalance between the demand and supply of AI chips will keep the momentum going, and Nvidia will hold the largest market share right now. No company has been able to come closer to the tech giant’s domination.\n\nIn a recent note, Goldman Sachs mentioned that Nvidia will silence AI critics when it announces results next month. The management could show how its end users make money using AI chips. The company will take the market higher with its quarterly results.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech dinosaur Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the most valuable company in the world in terms of market cap. The company has a diverse range of products and services that have become integral to our lives.\n\nMicrosoft’s timely investment in OpenAI has helped it remain ahead of the AI race, and it is also enjoying returns on this investment. Microsoft is known for reporting impressive quarterly numbers and generates the maximum revenue from Azure.\n\nWith a global presence and aggressive expansion plans, Microsoft is set to remain at the top for many years to come. The company will report results on July 30. Its third-quarter revenue stood at $62 billion, up 17% year over year and the cloud segment saw 21% growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrading at $440, MSFT stock is a buy-and-hold forever. Its dividend yield is 0.68%. It is one of the best Magnificent Seven stocks and will never disappoint.\n\nApple (APPL) An image of grey card with the Apple logo and the name \"Marisa Robertson\" in black and an Apple smartphone with the Apple logo and text \"Card\" in white over a black background.\n\nSource: Primakov / Shutterstock.com\n\niPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has had a tough year due to the dip in iPhone sales. Known for offering the best products worldwide, Apple has carved a niche in the industry. The company enjoys high customer loyalty and has shown tremendous growth.\n\nTrading at $224, APPL stock is up 20% YTD and has generated over 300% returns in the past five years. The company is set to report results on August 1, and I believe it will beat market expectations.\n\nApple is so much more than the iPhone, and its service segment revenue showed record growth. The total revenue was $90.8 billion, and the services segment generated $23.9 billion.\n\nThe company is set to release iPhone 16 in a few weeks, which could help boost iPhone sales globally. Apple has already seen a 33% growth in iPhone sales in India, a record shift from China, and could help balance the drop in demand in China.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nA personal favorite for multiple reasons, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is a legacy business that has come a long way. The company is making the most of AI hype and could be one of the early winners. It is already building 100 data centers and generates significant revenue from cloud infrastructure.\n\nOracle has interesting partnerships with Nvidia, Microsoft and Palantir, which will continue to drive user growth. In the recent quarterly results, the company saw a revenue of $14.3 billion, and the cloud revenue came in at $5.3 billion, up 20% YOY. Its outstanding performance obligations stood at $98 billion, up 44% YOY.\n\nThis shows that the company will have another stellar quarter, converting the performance obligations to revenue. ORCL stock is already up 32% YTD and is trading for $138.\n\nThe stock has massive upside potential and is worth holding on to for the long term. It also enjoys a dividend yield of 1.16%.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nSet to report quarterly results next week, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) will shine this quarter, driven by AI investments, Google Cloud and YouTube. Trading at $172, GOOG stock is up 28% YTD and 45% in the past 12 months. As one of the best tech stocks, Alphabet looks undervalued and is one of the cheapest Magnificent Seven.\n\nIts solid first-quarter results have helped push the stock higher. The company makes the majority of its revenue from Google Search and YouTube. It continues to hold the largest market share in search, and no other company has been able to disrupt its position.\n\nThe revenue jumped 15% to $80 billion in the quarter, and the company announced its first dividend this year. Advertising revenue stood at $61.7 billion, and as the digital ad market expands, Alphabet will continue to benefit. It will never lose its strong industry position, and GOOG is one stock that will continue to grow your wealth.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ve been pounding the table on Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) for a long time now, and I continue to do so. I love the stock because I believe in the company’s innovation and technology. Known for serving government clients for many years, Palantir has transitioned towards commercial clients and saw a 69% increase in commercial clients in the first quarter, while the remaining deal value jumped 74% YOY.\n\nThe company’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has been highly successful in the industry and has helped Palantir close several deals. Its second-quarter results will be as impressive as the first quarter, and we could see the stock hit $30.\n\nBuying Palantir at $28 is a smart move, and the stock is up 72% YTD. Wedbush Analysts think the stock could double from its current level. The stock looks undervalued to me, so it’s a buy before it skyrockets. Palantir is set to report results on August 5.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nLastly, one of the top long-term tech stocks, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), is another company that should be on your radar. Up 7% YTD, the stock is exchanging hands for $738 today, attracting high investor interest.\n\nThe company announced new AI-powered capabilities to help improve employee experiences and has partnered with Microsoft to grow its strategic alliance with AI assistants.\n\nIt also has a partnership with Nvidia to develop AI solutions, and this move could benefit both companies. One thing that stands out about this company is its healthy renewal rate. ServiceNow offers a subscription model and enjoys a 98% renewal rate.\n\nIn the first quarter, the company saw a 24% YOY revenue jump, most of it from subscriptions. The net income doubled, and the remaining performance obligations saw a 21% YOY jump. The company will beat expectations in the second quarter results and boost the stock. ServiceNow is set to report results on July 24.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "TikTok fails to reverse EU decision that triggers annual compliance cost of US$1.5 million",
        "content": "ByteDance, the owner of global hit short video platform TikTok, has lost a legal challenge that sought to reverse a European Union decision stating that the firm should not favour its own service over rivals.\n\nIn a ruling on Wednesday, the EU General Court said it \"dismissed ByteDance's action\" seeking to avoid it being designated as a \"gatekeeper\" under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which took effect in March.\n\nThe gatekeeper label, which applies to six other tech giants - Google owner Alphabet, Facebook operator Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon.com, Microsoft and Booking, which runs online travel agency Booking.com - prohibits a company from self-preferencing, combining personal data across services without consent, or preventing users from uninstalling pre-installed applications. ‍\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe European Commission estimated that the annual cost for such compliance will be 1.41 million euros (US$1.5 million) per platform. Breaches would lead to fines of up to 10 per cent of the company's total worldwide turnover, which can be increased to 20 per cent in case of repeated infringements.\n\nByteDance is the only Chinese company designated a gatekeeper by the EU. Photo: Shutterstock Images alt=ByteDance is the only Chinese company designated a gatekeeper by the EU. Photo: Shutterstock Images>\n\nByteDance, the only Chinese company designated a gatekeeper, initiated legal action in November, arguing that its valuation mainly resulted from its businesses in China, where it operates TikTok's local version Douyin and news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, and that the scale of TikTok was smaller than some other social-networking sites such as Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe court said ByteDance \"met the quantitative thresholds laid down in the DMA\", including the number of users, and that \"TikTok had succeeded in increasing its number of users very rapidly and exponentially\" with \"a particularly high engagement rate\".\n\nThe gatekeeper label applies to a platform that has had more than 45 million monthly active users in the past year, and has achieved an annual turnover of at least 7.5 billion euros in each of the past three years, according to DMA.\n\nTikTok has reported that its monthly active users in the EU rose to an average of 134 million between February 2023 and July 2023, from 125 million half a year earlier. ByteDance, still privately owned, does not regularly disclose its financials. Bloomberg News reported that the firm's pre-tax profit grew 60 per cent to US$40 billion last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nByteDance and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. The company can appeal to the European Court of Justice, the region's supreme court.\n\n\"Although the new rules apply only within the 27-member EU, other democracies could follow suit and write the next chapter of the vaunted 'Brussels effect', turning the DMA into a global standard,\" Bill Echikson, a senior fellow with the Centre for European Policy Analysis, said in a February report.\n\nThe EU has one of the world's strictest antitrust laws covering Big Tech. Last month, Apple was accused of violating the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing users to cheaper alternatives. In March, the EU slapped fines of 1.8 billion euros on Apple for impeding other music streaming services, a decision that was later challenged by the American giant.\n\nIn February, the EU announced an investigation into TikTok over child-protection measures on the platform.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "CrowdStrike Shares Trim Heavy Losses As Microsoft Announces Resolution Of Global Tech Outage: 'This Is Clearly A Major Black Eye'\n\nU.S. cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is attempting to recover sharp premarket losses felt overnight and in the early hours on Friday as an update on its cloud software triggered a global tech outage.\n\nWhat Happened: A failed update of CrowdStrike's Falcon platform on Thursday night led to widespread disruptions in Microsoft systems, pushing critical global services such as airports, ports, financial institutions and hospitals to a standstill. The issue stemmed from a technical error in the software update, ruling out initial speculation of a hacker attack.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nGeneral Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50 per share. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nGeorge Kurtz, president and CEO of CrowdStrike, stated on X the company is “actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts.”\n\nMicrosoft, which leverages CrowdStrike's services to enhance security for its Azure and Office365 softwares, said the underlying cause of the outage has been resolved.\n\nMicrosoft, which uses Crowdstrike services to enhance Azure and Office365 security, subsequently assured that the underlying cause affecting the outage has been fixed.\n\nTrending:Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield.\n\nWhat It Means For CrowdStrike: “This is clearly a major black eye for CrowdStrike,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note Friday, predicting the stock would remain under pressure.\n\nIves noted that while CrowdStrike will need to ramp up efforts to mitigate damage over time, Wedbush’s positive long-term outlook on CrowdStrike and the cybersecurity sector remains unchanged.\n\nThe situation may create opportunities for competitors as companies re-evaluate their cybersecurity strategies and potential legal actions unfold, the analyst said.\n\nMarket impact: In premarket trading, shares of CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. were down about 12.9% by 8:30 a.m. ET, after an earlier decline of about 22% around 5 a.m. ET.\n\nExchange-traded funds with the largest exposure to CrowdStrike Holdings include TrueShares Technology, AI & Deep Learning ETF (NYSE:LRNZ) with a 9% allocation, First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF (NYSE:CIBR) with an 8% weight, and REX AI Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSE:AIPI) with a 7% share.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the hedge fund sector, Strategy Capital LLC holds a substantial 16.1% weight in CrowdStrike, while Avalon Global Asset Management, managed by Nancy Kukacka, has a 7.6% stake, according to the latest 13F filings.\n\nBusiness operations in the airline and shipping industries were severely affected, with United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NYSE:UAL),Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NYSE:AAL), all temporarily grounding flights due to communication issues.\n\nTrending: Will the surge continue or decline on real estate prices? People are finding out about risk-free real estate investing that lets you cash out whenever you want.\n\nAmerican Airlines reported at 5 a.m. ET that it had safely reestablished operations.\n\nAccording to FlightAware.com, Delta, American Airlines and United Airlines canceled 331, 279 and 149 flights respectively, with delays numbering 194, 211 and 164 respectively. In total, 1,071 flights within, into, or out of the United States were canceled this morning.\n\nOther cybersecurity companies gained in premarket trading, capitalizing on CrowdStrike's disruptions.\n\nSentinelOne Inc. (NYSE:S), Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) and Okta Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) saw their shares rise by 6.3%, 2.9%, and 1% respectively.\n\nWhile Microsoft's Windows systems were impacted, Mac and Linux hosts remained unaffected, as confirmed by CrowdStrike CEO Kurtz. Shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were up 0.9% in premarket trading.\n\nRead Next:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.

Parent company Softbank Group Corp (OTC:SFTBF) (OTC:SFTBY) aims to invest significantly in data centers using its AI chips and renewable energy.\n\nAMD CFO Jean Hu recently suggested a potential entry into next-generation AI PCs.\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic about Arm Holdings, citing strong licensing interest and royalty potential as essential growth factors. They also highlight Arm’s opportunities in the AI and data center sectors.\n\nArm Holdings stock rose by 158% over the past 12 months as AI integrated into smartphones. The ARM (Acorn RISC Machine) architecture powers 99% of the world’s smartphone CPU cores. Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of Arm’s major customers.\n\nArm’s clients choose the company over Intel Corp’s (NASDAQ:INTC) x86 technology primarily for its efficiency and widespread adoption. Arm’s architecture enables chips to consume less power compared to x86, making it ideal for mobile devices and other power-sensitive applications, CNBC reported in 2023.\n\nKey clients like Apple, Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, MicrosoftCorp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NvidiaCorp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and QualcommInc (NASDAQ:QCOM) leverage Arm’s technology to build custom silicon tailored to their specific needs.\n\nARM Holdings has a consensus price target of $112.17 based on the ratings of 25 analysts.\n\nARM Price Action: Arm shares traded higher by 3.47% at $163.83 at the last check on Friday.\n\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article What's Going On With Arm Stock On Friday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- All big tech companies are trying to convince Wall Street that they’ll be a major player in artificial intelligence. Few have done as good a job as Apple Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nZuckerberg Calls Trump’s Response to Shooting ‘Badass’ From ATMs to Flights, Epic IT Crash Leaves Trail of Chaos CrowdStrike’s Global Outage Doesn’t Have to Be a Recurring Nightmare Travel Chaos Mounts as Airlines Resume Flights After Outage Biden Vows Return to Campaign Trail Despite Calls to Quit\n\nThere’s growing consensus among analysts that an iPhone with AI features, unveiled in June, will spur consumers to upgrade their phones after holding onto older models for years, giving Apple a long-awaited rebound in growth. At least five firms have raised their ratings since the event, with Loop Capital the latest to turn bullish in the face of a valuation that has risen to elevated levels.\n\nApple “is playing it brilliantly” with AI after seeming like it was behind the curve last year, said Igor Tishin, an analyst at Harding Loevner LP who rates Apple a buy. “I don’t know how much monetization there will be in the near term, but beyond the first step, I think AI can help Apple develop tremendous value in years two and three.”\n\nLoop analyst Ananda Baruah agrees, expecting AI to drive a material increase in demand for iPhones. “Apple has an opportunity the next few years to solidify itself as consumer’s Gen AI ‘base camp’ of choice, just as it did for social media 15 years ago with iPhone,” he wrote in a note. Loop’s upgrade brought Apple’s consensus recommendation — a ratio of its buy, hold, and sell ratings — to 4.2 out of five, the highest since November.\n\nA device upgrade cycle would be meaningful. The iPhone is by far Apple’s biggest business, accounting for more than half its fiscal 2023 revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. However, iPhone revenue fell 2% last year, indicating that battery and camera improvements in the iPhone 14 and 15 models weren’t enough to entice customers.\n\nAI features, including an agreement with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT, could change that. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, more than 40% of Apple’s 800 million-plus smartphone users have iPhone 12 or older devices, while another 27% are using an iPhone 13. Fewer than 10% of current users have phones that can be upgraded to the AI software.\n\nThe positive response to the AI event has contributed to a 36% surge in the shares since an April low, adding about $900 billion to Apple’s market capitalization and returning it to its position as the largest stock in the world. That’s also pushed the valuation above historical levels, indicating high hopes for AI — and high stakes for the broader market, given Apple’s massive weighting in indexes.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple shares are currently trading at more than 31 times estimated earnings, more than 50% above their 10-year average, and near the highest level since early 2021, when the firm was growing much faster and interest rates were much lower.\n\nSome see the market over-hyping the potential gains from AI, especially as it may take time for an upgrade cycle to materialize after the phones become available.\n\n“ChatGPT is exciting, Gemini is exciting, but are they really influencing consumer purchase decisions yet?” said Matt Stucky, chief equity portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. “I think it’s a little bit too early to have that kind of conviction.”\n\nAlong similar lines, UBS argued that a hoped-for “AI supercycle” was “not likely,” and that optimism for future growth was misplaced.\n\n“Our analysis of smartphone demand by region, prior cycles, income demographic data, and carrier subsidies argues for a more modest cycle next year,” wrote analysts led by David Vogt, who have a neutral rating on the stock.\n\nEven with the recent upgrades, Wall Street is somewhat more skeptical about Apple than other megacap tech stocks. Fewer than 70% of analysts recommend buying the stock, compared with ratios near or above 90% for Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., and Nvidia Corp. And shares have already gotten ahead of the average analyst price target, suggesting that AI excitement may have run its course for now.\n\nStill, the AI opportunity is likely to become clearer next year. Wall Street expects Apple revenue will grow just 1.1% in its 2024 fiscal year before accelerating to 7.7% in fiscal 2025. For earnings, Apple is expected to show growth of 7.8% this year and 10.5% next.\n\nThat’s still less that the Magnificent Seven. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, revenue for that group will rise 9.5% this year and accelerate to 12.2% in 2025, while the megacap cohort is also expected to outperform on earnings.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Zombie Mall King Doesn’t Want to Be a Bottom-Feeder Forever Five Questions With Apollo Global Co-Founder Josh Harris Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail How Trader Joe’s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit Top Takeaways From Businessweek’s Donald Trump Interview\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Netflix (NFLX) is all in on a country that's been historically difficult for its competitors: India.\n\nThe country brought in the second-highest net subscriber additions for Netflix in the second quarter and was also the third highest in terms of revenue growth, the company said on Thursday.\n\nThe streaming giant credited its localized content strategy and product mix as key drivers to attracting, retaining, and monetizing members in the area.\n\nAlthough Netflix did not disclose exact subscriber or revenue figures for the Indian market, revenue for its Asia-Pacific region jumped to $1.05 billion in the quarter from $919 million in the year-ago period.\n\n\"What's going on in the quarter has been this ongoing build,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the company's earnings call. He called out the success of shows like \"Heeramandi,\" which was created and directed by celebrated Indian filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali.\n\n\"It's our biggest drama series to date in India,\" Sarandos said, adding original films and licensed films like Kiran Rao’s \"Laapataa Ladies\" and Vikas Bahl's \"Shaitaan\" have also outperformed in the country.\n\n\"We pick [the content] well, we program well, we improve the product mix, the market fit. We improve engagement. We grow members. We grow revenue. It's the same formula everywhere else,\" he said. \"There's certainly plenty of room to grow in India, as long as we keep thrilling our audiences there.\" A woman stands next to a logo of Netflix during an event in Mumbai, India, Feb. 29, 2024. (REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nIndia, which boasts a population of more than 1.4 billion, has become a media hotspot, with projected TV and streaming-related revenue growth of 11% in 2024. That compares with much more muted growth in other developing countries, according to analytics firm Ampere Analysis.\n\nBut the market has been a hard one for US media companies to crack. First, it’s difficult for companies to create a direct relationship with Indian consumers, who largely rely on mobile operators to gain access to streaming services due to limited broadband infrastructure.\n\nIndian consumers also have a relatively low willingness to pay for streaming platforms thanks to free, ad-supported models from local content providers and rampant piracy.\n\nRecently, two of Netflix's competitors scaled back on ambitions there. Disney (DIS) said in February that it would effectively give up its ownership of the network Star India by merging it with Indian telecom giant Reliance Industries. It will hold a minority stake in the entity.\n\nTwo weeks later, Paramount Global (PARA) said it was selling its 13% stake in Indian media company Viacom18 to Reliance for about $517 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Netflix and even fellow tech giant Amazon (AMZN) — both of which boast significantly higher free cash flow levels compared to their legacy media counterparts — have been able to make inroads with higher-income Indian consumers by offering localized content.\n\n\"The real story in India has been the growth of the middle- to higher-income consumer,\" said Mihir Shah, vice president of research firm Media Partners Asia, told Yahoo Finance in March. \"That's a segment which many of the tech platforms [like] Netflix and Prime Video are really dominating.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Fintech Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "The third quarter of 2024 is set to uncover plenty of investment opportunities throughout the fintech landscape. Driven by expectations of a return to optimism throughout Wall Street, financial technology will become a key growth sector over the months ahead.\n\nWith the likelihood of Federal Reserve rate cuts occurring in the United States during Q3 2024 soaring, there may never be a better time for investors to add fintech stocks to their portfolios.\n\nCrucially, the prospect of rate cuts will encourage higher investment volumes throughout Wall Street and increase consumer spending power and confidence to the point where fintech platforms can see greater usage levels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith the quarter leading up to the holiday season, we’re likely to see more consumers embrace investment apps, leverage more payments and take a strong interest in using financial services for borrowing and various other purposes.\n\nWhile the generative AI boom has captured the imagination of retail investors in recent months, the third quarter may belong to fintech. These three stocks could offer significant growth potential for investors.\n\nGlobal Payments Inc. (GPN) An image of a laptop showing clothes on the screen with the mouse hovering over a 'buy' button; surrounded by credit card, piggy bank, shopping bag, coffee. Best E-Commerce Stocks\n\nSource: ST.art/Shutterstock\n\nBrightening consumer confidence in the wake of Fed rate cuts is likely to see a resurgence in Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) at a time when the payment technology provider’s stock has been steadily sinking.\n\nGPN closed the first half of 2024 down 23.96%, more than 55% below its all-time high market value recorded in 2021.\n\nDespite this, Global Payments Inc. remains a leading payment technology and software solution that’s primed for growth amid rising demand for point-of-sale solutions among retailers and hospitality firms.\n\nAlthough we recently saw analysts at Seaport Res Ptn lower their Q2 2024 estimates for GPN slightly to earnings per share of $2.72 for the quarter, as opposed to $2.73, it’s worth noting that Global Payments has beaten earnings estimates for the past four consecutive quarters.\n\nWith higher payment volume expected for Q3 2024 and beyond, we can expect upcoming outperformance from Global Payments. Following its recent struggles, the stock could represent a great discount for long positions.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nFollowing the appointment of CEO Alex Chriss in September 2023, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has struggled to generate any meaningful momentum to recover its stock value after ending Q2 2024 more than 80% below its all-time high market value.\n\nHowever, PayPal’s fortunes may be about to change. The recent news that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be forced to share some of its payment technology following a settlement with the European Union’s antitrust regulators prompted an uptick in PYPL on Wall Street.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s commitment to opening up its near-field communication technology presents a key opportunity for PayPal in terms of offering substantial levels of competition to Apple. As a result of the settlement, Mizuho Securities analysts placed an ‘outperform’ rating on PayPal with a lofty price target of $90.\n\nWhile Seaport Res Ptn analysts lowered their expectations for Global Payments, PayPal was handed a small boost to $0.97 per share from initial forecasts of $0.96 per share.\n\nAnother source of optimism for PayPal can be found in the performance of the fintech firm’s stablecoin, Paypal USD (PYUSD), which recently surpassed a market capitalization of $500 million, having almost doubled in value in the past month alone.\n\nThis conscious branch out into the world of decentralized finance and cryptocurrency could offer further opportunities for growth in a fintech landscape that’s ripe for further innovation.\n\nNu Holdings Ltd. (NU) An image of a cellphone with a bank on top, surrounded by people and piles of money, a credit card and calculator. fintech stocks\n\nSource: fatmawati achmad zaenuri/Shutterstock\n\nOne fintech stock that’s shown plenty of strength since its 2021 Wall Street debut is Hu Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NU). Operating a digital banking platform in Latin American nations like Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, the firm has become a leading fintech firm throughout the region.\n\nThe company provides access to credit and debit cards, mobile banking, savings accounts, cryptocurrency trading and a series of other investment products.\n\nAs a market-leading challenger bank in Latin America’s growing fintech ecosystem, investors have plenty of optimism for the long-term prospects of Nu Holdings. Third-quarter data suggests that as many as 50 hedge funds have been bullish on NU, growing from 44 expressing positive sentiment toward the stock during the prior quarter.\n\nMoreover, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) has underlined its commitment to Nu Holdings by holding more than 107 million shares worth $776.6 million.\n\nThe biggest growth factor for Nu Holdings in Q3 2024 stems from the brightening economic ecosystem in Latin America. 2023 saw the average inflation rate of the region reach 14.41%, making LatAm’s recent inflation issues far greater than the global average.\n\nWhile consumer confidence is still struggling for momentum in the region, we can expect better fiscal control in Q3 2024 to pave the way for growing consumer confidence and more frequent usage of financial services in Latin America. This could help the stock rally beyond the 58.55% growth Nu Holdings has already achieved in the first half of 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon",
        "content": "As the second-quarter earnings season approaches, key companies worldwide will provide insights into sector performance. Investors will be particularly focused on updates from some of the 'Magnificent Seven', which will reveal whether the artificial intelligence (AI) trend continues.\n\nThe Mag 7 stocks have endured a challenging period, with the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) major players—Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and AmazonAJa (AMZN)—experiencing a dramatic decline in market capitalisation. Over recent sessions, these tech giants have collectively shed $1.128tn in market value, marking the largest such loss since May 2022.\n\nWill the upcoming earnings reports show strong performance or a lack of momentum? Here’s what to watch for:\n\nTesla (TSLA) — Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nTesla shares have experienced a dramatic surge this month, with the company's stock price surging by 33%. This increase has propelled Tesla's market valuation by $209bn in the first eight trading days of the month alone, surpassing the combined market value of European automotive giants Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Stellantis, which stands at $198bn.\n\nThis surge cannot be attributed to Tesla’s first-quarter financial results, which revealed the lowest quarterly profits since Q2 2021, diminishing cash flow, and rising inventory levels. The second-quarter production and delivery figures, released earlier this month, indicated a 14% year-on-year decline in vehicle production and a 5% drop in unit sales, although this may have contributed to reducing some of the inventory backlog.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“Quite what inspired this romp is hard to divine, barring ongoing investor enthusiasm for companies that are perceived as AI (and autonomous driving) plays, Elon Musk’s courtroom victories at Tesla and X and ongoing hopes surrounding the Cybertruck, the supercharger network and the ride-hailing app,” Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: How to invest in AI as the rally continues\n\nFor the third quarter, the current consensus is sales of $25.7bn and that would signify a return to growth in the top line of some 10% year-on-year.\n\nAnalysts and investors are also paying close attention to Tesla’s revenue composition. In the first quarter of 2024, energy storage, energy generation, and other business lines contributed 19% to total revenues, up from 10% in the same period in 2022.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) fell to $0.37 in Q1, but analysts expect a rebound to $0.62 in Q2, though this still marks a one-third decrease compared to the same period last year. The consensus EPS forecast for Q3 stands at $0.63.\n\nAJ Bell also highlighted Tesla's strong financial position, with a net cash reserve of $21.5bn. Although a few quarters of weak cash flow are not overly concerning, shareholders will be looking for improvements in this area as an indicator of higher profitability and a more streamlined balance sheet through inventory reduction.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) — Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July*\n\nMicrosoft Corp is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, July 30, with analysts from Bank of America (BofA) forecasting potential revenue upside for the period.\n\nWall Street's consensus projects Microsoft to announce revenue of $64.2bn and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.90 for Q4. However, BofA analysts anticipate a 1% increase from their estimate of $64bn, indicating a 14% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by the robust performance of Azure, a premium mix in Office E3/E5, Copilot’s initial success, and a stabilising PC/Windows market.\n\nAzure’s growth is expected to remain balanced across sustained AI and core workloads, translating into a projected growth rate of 31.5%, slightly above the base expectation of 30.5%. The early traction of Copilot is also anticipated to bolster Office growth, maintaining its current valuation multiple.\n\nIn the more personal computing (MPC) segment, analysts foresee a $50m increase over the $15.5bn estimate, attributed to stronger-than-expected PC shipments.\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, BofA analysts predict continued double-digit revenue growth fuelled by ongoing strength in Azure and Office. However, they anticipate a 100 basis point decrease in margins due to increased capital expenditures driving higher cost of sales.\n\n“In an upside scenario, we believe the Office business could achieve 20% growth by Q1 fiscal 2026,” the analysts noted.\n\nBofA has reiterated its ‘buy’ rating for Microsoft and raised the price target to $510 from $480, citing the potential for higher Office growth in fiscal 2025. They acknowledge that the current share price reflects a considerable amount of near-term upside.\n\n\"Microsoft is set to deliver fourth quarter results at some point next week. Investors will be hoping to see another strong showing from the cloud business, Azure. Analysts are looking for top line growth of 19.5% from Azure, which looks very achievable. Back in April, management said cloud-AI demand was outstripping supply. Despite a mammoth effort to build out compute, that supply/demand imbalance is likely to help underpin Azure growth for some time yet,\" Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\n*Date not confirmed\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) — Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nThe parent company of Google (GOOGL), is set to announce its second-quarter earnings, with analysts predicting robust performance driven by its Android platform and continued momentum in its search and cloud businesses. The company's expanding generative AI capabilities are also anticipated to have significantly contributed to its positive results.\n\nFor Q2, the Zacks Consensus Estimate places Alphabet's revenues at $70.55bn, reflecting a 13.7% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at $1.85 per share, marking a 28.5% rise from the previous year's reported figures. This estimate has seen a slight upward revision of 0.5% over the past week.\n\nHowever, rising litigation issues and associated expenses remain areas of concern for the tech giant.\n\nOne key risk is the US Department of Justice's so-called adtech trial, in which the government charges that Google monopolises key digital advertising technologies, collectively referred to as the adtech stack. Website publishers depend on that stack to sell ads and advertisers rely on it to buy ads.\n\n\"As Alphabet’s second quarter earnings approach, the M&A rumour mill is swirling. If reports are true and Alphabet is in talks to buy cybersecurity firm Wizz for $23bn, it would mark a major move to beef up its security offering. Wizz has successfully taken on the likes of Microsoft and Palo Alto in the cyber space, taking market share over the past couple of years. Perhaps the biggest hurdle could be a regulator that’s been a blocker for many large-scale deals – though a new team in the White House later this year could help things in that regard,\" Britzman said.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\nBank of America Securities analyst Justin Post remains bullish on the integration of Google’s AI chatbot.\n\n“We remain positive on growing Gemini integration across [the] Google ecosystem and think [the] broader rollout of AI overviews will likely help drive higher usage, while AI integration can increase monetisation across Google,” Post said. “Moreover, with a focus on expense management, we think year-over-year margin growth in 2024 will be a bright spot and potential EPS upside driver.”\n\nPost affirmed a buy rating and $200 price target for Alphabet.\n\nBMO Capital Markets raised its their price target from $215 to $222, driven by potential gains in YouTube revenue.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) — Reports second-quarter results on Thursday 25 July*\n\nAmazon is in the spotlight with a \"positive\" near-term view, as Morgan Stanley anticipates the e-commerce giant to significantly outperform in its Q2 earnings and provide optimistic guidance for Q3.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts project that Amazon will exceed consensus estimates for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by 17% for Q2 and 10% for Q3. This optimistic forecast is driven by enhanced profitability in North America tetail and accelerating growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"North America retail profitability and the accelerating growth of AWS are key factors behind our projections,\" the analysts noted.\n\nAs Amazon continues to leverage its robust retail operations and expand its cloud computing dominance, investors are looking forward to a strong financial performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIt is also a top pick for JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth both in the near and long term.\n\nHe anticipates a near-term acceleration in AWS, forecasting a 20% growth in Q4 2024. This growth is expected to be driven by easing optimisations, new workload migrations, and the ramping up of GenAI monetisation.\n\nRead more: UK to lose half a million millionaires by 2028\n\nAnmuth also projects a 190 basis point expansion in Amazon's North America operating income (OI) margin in 2024, supported by enhancements in shipping and inventory placement, increased automation, and stronger advertising revenue. Amazon's free cash flow is expected to reach $66bn in 2024 and $86bn in 2025.\n\nFor Q2, investors are looking for net sales to fall between $148bn and $150bn, with operating income ranging from $14bn to $15bn or more.\n\n\"There was also a strong showing from both the e-commerce and advertising segments over the first quarter, something investors will be keen to see continue. But markets were a little unhappy with the second quarter profit guidance of $10-14bn, anything toward the top end of that range will likely be met with a positive reaction,\" Britzman said.\n\n* Date not confirmed as the company might decide to announce results on 1 August.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 22 July\n\nMONY (MONY.L)\n\nAscential (ASCL.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nNXP Semiconductor (NXPI)\n\nTuesday 23 July\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nCompass (CPG.L)\n\nMitie (MTO.L)\n\nSK Hynix (HY9H.MU)\n\nLVMH (MC.PA)\n\nASM International (ASM.AS)\n\nThales (HO.PA)\n\nLindt (LISN.SW)\n\nAlfa Laval (ALFA.L)\n\nLogitech (LOGNE.SW)\n\nNorsk Hydro (NHY.OL)\n\nAkzo Nobel (AKZOY)\n\nRandstad (RSH.DU)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nCoca-Cola (KO)\n\nSpotify (SPOT)\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\n\nGE Aerospace (GE)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nMondelez (MDLZ)\n\n3M (MMM)\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\nMattel (MAT)\n\nWednesday 24 July\n\nReckitt Benckiser (RKT.L)\n\nUNITE (UTG.L)\n\nRHI Magnesita (RHIM.L)\n\nBreedon (BREE.L)\n\nAston Martin Lagonda (AML.L)\n\nPrimary Health Properties (PHP.L)\n\nFresnillo (FRES.L)\n\nEasyJet (EZJ.L)\n\nOxford Nanopore (ONT.L)\n\nIberdrola (IBE.MC)\n\nBNP Paribas (BNP.PA)\n\nEquinor (EQNR)\n\nBanco Santander (BNC.L)\n\nUniCredit (UCG.MI)\n\nKering (KER.PA)\n\nDeutsche Boerse (DB1.DE)\n\nOrange (ORA.PA)\n\nMichelin (ML.PA)\n\nRepsol (REP.MC)\n\nMoncler (MOV.F)\n\nJerónimo Martins (JMT.LS)\n\nCarrefour (CA.PA)\n\nSSAB (SSAB-A.ST)\n\nKindred (UNBA.MU)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nFord (F)\n\nNewmont (NEM)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nInternational Paper (IP)\n\nThursday 25 July\n\nRELX (REL.L)\n\nLloyds (LLOY.L)\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nRentokil Initial (RTO.L)\n\nInforma (INF.L)\n\nCentrica (CNA.L)\n\nCentamin (CEY.L)\n\nHowden Joinery (HWDN.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nITV (ITV.L)\n\nHammerson (HMSO.L)\n\nVodafone (VOD.L)\n\nBT (BT-A.L)\n\nBritvic (BVIC.L)\n\nWorkspace (WKP.L)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nNestlé (NESNE.SW)\n\nHermès (RMS.PA)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nChristian Dior (CDI.PA)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nEssilorLuxxotica (EL.PA)\n\nStellantis (STLA)\n\nENI (ENI.F)\n\nSt. Gobain (GOB.MU)\n\nRenault (RNO.PA)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nLinde (LIN)\n\nHoneywell (HON)\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC)\n\nKeurig-Dr Pepper (KDP)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV)\n\nBaxter (BAX)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nLiberty Global (LBTYK)\n\nHarley-Davidson (HOG)\n\nFriday 26 July\n\nSEGRO (SGRO.L)\n\nIMI (IMI.L)\n\nRightmove (RMV.L)\n\nDrax (DRX.L)\n\nNEC (6701.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nAir Liquide (AI.PA)\n\nMercedes Benz (MBG.HA)\n\nHolcim (HOLN.SW)\n\nBASF (BASA.BE)\n\nCapGemini (CGM.HM)\n\nAlstom (ALO.PA)\n\nVallourec (VK.PA)\n\nKone Cranes (KNCRY)\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nBristol Meyers Squibb (BMY)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Apple (AAPL) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Apple (AAPL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.62, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 30 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.62 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 30 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 10% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AAPL Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for AAPL\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Apple here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Apple, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs AAPL Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Apple, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $6.59.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Apple. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Apple may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Trending Stock Apple Inc. (AAPL) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +6.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has gained 4.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share, indicating a change of +5.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.59 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.5%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.39 indicates a change of +12.1% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for AAPL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $83.79 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.4%. The $386.46 billion and $416.92 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.8% and +7.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $90.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.3%. EPS of $1.53 for the same period compares with $1.52 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.85%. The EPS surprise was +1.32%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Apple Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today",
        "content": "How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nAnother factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Apple (AAPL) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to AAPL for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nApple's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Apple's main business drivers.\n\nApple’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone. However, the Services portfolio that includes revenues from cloud services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services now became the cash cow.\r\n\r\nMoreover, non-iPhone devices like Apple Watch and AirPod gained significant traction. In fact, Apple dominates the Wearables and Hearables markets due to the growing adoption of Watch and AirPods. Solid uptake of Apple Watch also helped Apple strengthen its presence in the personal health monitoring space.\r\n\r\nApple is expanding non-iPhone portfolio with the launch of Apple Vision Pro a spatial computer that blends digital content with the physical world.\r\n\r\nHeadquartered in Cupertino, CA, Apple also designs, manufactures and sells iPad, MacBookand HomePod. These devices are powered by software applications including iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems.\r\n\r\nApple’s other services include subscription-based Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Arcade, new Apple TV app, Apple TV channels and Apple TV+, a new subscription service.\r\n\r\nIn fiscal 2023, Apple generated $383.29 billion in total revenues. The company’s flagship device iPhone accounted for 52.3% of total revenues. Services, Mac and iPad category contributed 22.2%, 7.7% and 7.4%, respectively. Wearables, Home and Accessories products category contributed 10.4%.\r\n\r\nApple primarily reports revenues on a geographic basis, namely the Americas (North & South America), Europe (European countries, India, Middle East and Africa), Greater China (China, Hong Kong & Taiwan), Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific (Australia & other Asian Countries).\r\n\r\nIn fiscal 2023, Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia-Pacific accounted for 42.4%, 24.6%, 18.9%, 6.3% and 7.7% of total revenues, respectively.\r\n\r\nApple faces stiff competition from the likes of Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Google, Huawei and Motorola in the smartphone market. Lenovo, HP, Dell, Acer and Asus are its primary competitors in the PC market. Other notable competitors are Google & Amazon (smart speakers) and Fitbit & Xiaomi (wearables).\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Apple ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in July 2014 would be worth $9,495.93, or an 849.59% gain, as of July 19, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 180.28% and gold's return of 79.01% over the same time frame.\n\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for AAPL.\n\nApple’s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%. Apple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve. Moreover, Apple is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. Apple’s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\n\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 6.92%, and there have been 3 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "3 Battery Stocks That Could Grow Your Wealth",
        "content": "When investors think about battery stocks as investments, their first thought is likely to be the lithium-ion batteries that are essential to electric vehicles (EVs). But if you’re looking for companies that may be worth a long-term investment, you may have to shift your focus.\n\nSince 2020, a number of startup companies are trying to capitalize on the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs). Many of these companies have been involved in the production of lithium-ion batteries, which is the current standard for EVs.\n\nThe hope was that many of these battery stocks would be solid long-term investments. The reality is most of them may have made good trades at one time or another, but they’ve been tough stocks to hold.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis is still a speculative area, but it’s one that still holds significant promise. The shift towards renewable energy will continue. However, it may be time for investors with a long-term outlook to consider these battery stocks.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst, to help frame my case for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) it’s important to look at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nThe latter company is known for its iconic iPhone and other products. But as Apple investors are aware, it generates a significant portion of its revenue from its Services business.\n\nIn a similar vein, Tesla enthusiasts have continually defended the company’s lofty valuation with the idea that Tesla is more than a car company. And a significant piece of that story is the company’s Energy Generation and Storage business. In its first quarter 2024 earnings presentation, the company noted that business was likely to generate a stronger growth rate than its Automotive business.\n\nA 36% rally in the last month has pushed TSLA stock positive for the year. Many investors continue to be fixated on its EV business and with good reason. However, if you have a contrarian state of mind, it could be a time to hope that Tesla begins to resemble the next Apple in the minds of investors.\n\nQuantumScape (QS) QuantumScape (QS) is an American company that develops solid state lithium metal batteries for electric cars.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors frequently buy the rumor and sell the news. But it was news of a new agreement with PowerCo, a wholly owned subsidiary of Volkswagen(OTCMKTS:VWAGY) that sent shares of QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) rocketing higher.\n\nThe deal will allow PowerCo to utilize QuantumScape’s QSE-5 solid-state technology to manufacture batteries. You can learn about the details of the deal in Eddie Pan’s article for InvestorPlace. But a key takeaway is that PowerCo will provide QuantumScape with an initial $130 million royalty fee.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis comes at a critical time as QuantumScape is in the final stages of pushing its solid-state battery design into commercial production. If successful, the company’s technology could become a replacement to the lithium-ion standard.\n\nNotably, the recent surge in QS stock is due in part to a short squeeze. That may not be enough to move analysts to push the stock higher. However, QuantumScape reports earnings on July 24. Investors looking to start a position should wait to gauge analyst sentiment after the earnings report.\n\nNano One Materials (NNOMF) a pile of lithium. lithium stocks\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.com\n\nIf QuantumScape isn’t speculative enough, you may want to consider Nano One Materials (OTCMKTS:NNOMF). The Canadian company’s proprietary and patented One-Pot process is working on removing sulphates from lithium-ion batteries that can lower the costs, complexity, carbon intensity and their environmental footprint.\n\nSodium sulphate is a by-product of the EV battery supply chain. The growing market for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is expanding this supply chain which is raising awareness of what to do with larger quantities of sodium sulfate.\n\nNNOMF is a penny stock today, but it’s taken investors on a wild ride in the last five years. Like may companies related to EVs, the stock got caught up in the meme stock mania in 2022. And even last year, the stock was up approximately 40% at one point. But as consumer sentiment for EVs is cooling for many reasons, the stock is down 48% this year.\n\nThat’s why you have to know what you own. This is a speculative investment. But if the company’s technology can gain a foothold with EV manufacturers, it could be a multi-bagger.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in AAPL.

        "title": "Forget The Magnificent 7! The Next Generation of Tech Titans You Need to Own.",
        "content": "The Magnificent 7 stocks have driven stock market earnings over the last three quarters. That strong performance justifies the returns investors have received from those equities. At the same time, investors wonder whether it makes sense to continue to rely on such a narrow grouping of stocks to fuel returns. There’s reason to believe that the next generation of tech titan stocks will soon emerge.\n\nEarnings growth within the Magnificent 7 is expected to slow in the second quarter. As earnings releases roll out, that is certain to cause the markets to reevaluate and likely diversify. That poses an interesting question for investors who want to capitalize on continued growth in the tech sector.\n\nIt also suggests that investors may want to forget the Magnificent 7 for the time being and consider the next generation of tech titans. Investors who agree with that theory should consider investing in the following tech stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWolfspeed (WOLF) WOLF stock: Person holding smartphone with logo of US semiconductor company Wolfspeed Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nWolfspeed (NYSE:WOLF) is a really interesting chip stock that not a lot of investors are aware of.\n\nThe chipmaker is focused on silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride technologies. That makes Wolfspeed something of a focused play within the semiconductor sector. Most investors know that semiconductors are the building blocks of modern technology. But there is much more to the technology, and it will pay for investors to dig deeper. Those who do will find that power electronics are an area of the chip opportunity that many believe will experience rapid growth.\n\nThat’s where Wolfspeed comes in with its expertise and focus on SiC technology. Silicon carbide chips combine silicon and carbon, resulting in superior performance over traditional silicon chips. It’s an emerging area of the semiconductor industry with particular applicability in the automotive sector. EVs require far more chips than traditional cars, and Wolfspeed is positioned to capitalize on that emergence. That’s evident in projections suggesting the company should improve dramatically in 2025 and beyond.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlmost every investor is aware that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has emerged as a leading AI stock. the same investors are well aware that AMD continues to play second fiddle to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). But beyond its challenger status many of those investors know little else about the company and what makes it such an interesting future tech titan.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the most important factors is that AMD is a major name in high-performance computing. What that really means is AMD provides powerful processors used in servers and data centers. It is one of few companies with the real ability to serve the demand for artificial intelligence chips.\n\nFurthermore, AMD excels in producing both central processing units (CPUs) and graphical processing units (GPUs). Modern AI chips often leverage features and technological concepts from CPU and GPU. Tensor cores are an excellent example. They are AI chips designed to perform tensor operations used extensively for the purpose of deep learning.\n\nWhether AMD can truly challenge Nvidia remains to be seen but there are strong reasons to believe it will.\n\nDayforce (DAY) A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDayforce (NYSE:DAY) is a software stock that investors should really consider. It hits on a lot of upcoming trends and benefits from the strengths unique to the software sector.\n\nOne of the most important trends is that enterprises are seeking to improve HR efficiency. Dayforce has emerged as one of the better HR software companies and its stock has the potential to continue rising as the trend grows. More generally, the software market is expected to continue growing due to the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions. Add in other broad factors like increasing digitization and AI and it’s easy to see why Dayforce will continue to have opportunities to grow.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of software stocks is recurring revenues. Generally speaking, once a piece of software is sold, recurring revenues tend to continue. The truth was on exhibit in the company’s most recent earnings report which showed recurring revenue growth outstripping overall revenue growth.\n\nThe other glaring positive for Dayforce is the fact that earnings are really expected to grow in 2024. The company reached net profitability in 2023 and is expected to see earnings more than quadruple in 2024.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has already begun to take off in 2024, appreciating by 35% thus far. The company’s opportunity will likely continue to grow, sending shares higher again.\n\nQualcomm is one of the leading phone chip manufacturers. That is a big part of the narrative behind its strong performance in 2024. It also explains why 2023 was so difficult for the firm. The smartphone market experienced a rapid decline in 2023. Qualcomm is a major supplier to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The slowdown in iPhone sales exemplifies Qualcomm’s troubles in 2023.\n\nThis year is much different. The company’s Snapdragon chips are particularly adept at running AI applications. That provides Qualcomm with a strong runway as Apple introduces its generative AI offerings to the world.\n\nQualcomm isn’t so much the next generation of stocks beyond the Magnificent 7 as it is an extension of that current opportunity. It continues to be a solid choice for tech investors seeking price appreciation and income generation through dividends.\n\nNXP Semiconductors (NXPI) A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nNXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) is really a stock to consider for forward-looking contrarians who fully expect the automotive chip market to rebound.\n\nDuring the most recent quarter, NXP Semiconductors derived nearly 58% of its revenues from the automotive sector. Top Line results were flat on a year-over-year basis and declined sequentially. However, if the depths of the EV decline have been reached, NXPI shares are certainly worth buying at the moment.\n\nInvestors should not expect the blistering pace of growth experienced in the past few years to return soon. Instead, steady linear growth over the next several years is the more likely base case.\n\nFurthermore, shareholders should continue to be rewarded in 2024 as NXP Semiconductors grows its EPS. Top line results have basically stagnated since 2022 but this year earnings are expected to increase by more than 40%. Chip sales growth should return in 2025 as a variety of factors contribute to a rebound in the EV sector. It all suggests that NXPI shares should continue to reward investors for the near and mid-term.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is particularly focused on generative AI, a powerful type of AI that can create entirely new content based on user input. The company has multiple products to help users leverage generative AI to help with tasks like marketing and content creation. Adobe’s prowess in the generative AI realm is a strong reason to believe it is a stock to own.\n\nAdobe’s primary generative AI tools are Sensei and Firefly. Firefly is a tool for generating novel creative assets whereas Sensei is more geared toward task automation, suggestions and the enhancement of existing workflows.\n\nThe reason to believe in Adobe relates to the generative AI space development. Generative AI refers to the creation of text-based assets and visual assets including photos and video. Adobe is one of the strongest visual content creation platforms available. The application of AI to Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator provides so much opportunity for the company.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

The cybersecurity market itself is expected to balloon to $299 billion by 2028, and CrowdStrike is well-positioned to capture a significant share.\n\nThe company has managed to carve out a niche as a leader in cloud-native cybersecurity. The firm offers a platform for delivering endpoint protection, threat intelligence and incident response, powered by AI.\n\nCrowdStrike boasts impressive growth and surpassed $3 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in 2024. That rapid growth of 34% in 2023 has established CrowdStrike as one of the go-to cybersecurity stocks. As AI and cloud growth continue, so will the opportunity for the company to further cement its positional leadership.\n\nAs impressive as CrowdStrike’s growth in 2023 was, 2024 and beyond are expected to be even more so. Annual growth through 2028 is expected to maintain a pace between 25% and 35%. Earnings are exploding this year. It’s a recipe for a continued surge upward into the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "A one-size-fits-all investment strategy doesn't exist, and this is wonderful because it means investing allows for plenty of flexibility. Some investors will win with an aggressive growth portfolio, while others may reach success with a focus on safe stocks that generate passive income. But there is one investment that could find its spot in any portfolio -- and during any market environment.\n\nI'm talking about stocks that bring you both dividends and growth. In a bull market, they may excel and offer your portfolio a boost, and investors appreciate their dividend payments any time. This passive income adds to gains during good times and limits losses during tough markets.\n\nWhere do you find these players? Though the technology industry generally isn't known for its dividends, you actually should look here for the valuable combination of passive income and growth. Many growth companies that have developed into market giants today have the financial strength to continue funding their growth -- and reward shareholders through dividend payments. Let's check out two of these top stocks that you won't regret buying. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) earnings have climbed over time thanks to its hardware, a selection of popular products -- from the iPhone to the Mac -- that have kept customers coming back for the latest versions year after year. This brand strength offers Apple a solid moat that's proven itself over time. Last year, Apple garnered the top-7 positions in Counterpoint Research's list of the 10 best-selling smartphones. This was a first for Apple, showing this well-established company still is generating growth.\n\nOn top of this, two other elements should add to Apple's growth in the coming months and years. The company's services businesses -- including subscriptions such as cloud storage or digital content -- have been generating record revenue levels. And, even better, services are higher margin than hardware, so they can be highly profitable for Apple. The second growth driver ahead should be Apple's new focus on artificial intelligence (AI). The company is set to release a suite of AI tools, known as Apple Intelligence, later this year throughout its devices.\n\nAll of this confirms Apple's reputation as a growth company. But what about dividends? Apple pays an annual dividend of $1 per share, which using the July 16 closing price of about $234, results in a dividend yield of 0.4%. Though this is lower than the S&P 500 dividend yield of 1.3%, that's OK. Many higher-yield stocks aren't delivering the growth you'll get with Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, you'll pay 35 times forward-earnings estimates for Apple, a reasonable price for this solid, long-term player.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is new to the world of dividends. The social media powerhouse announced its first-ever payment earlier this year, making now a great time to get in on the action.\n\nOf course, like with Apple, you won't be getting a high-yield investment with Meta. The company pays an annual dividend of $2 per share, and using the July 16 closing price of about $489, this gives a dividend yield of 0.4%. But this passive income, along with Meta's growth prospects, makes it an investment that could significantly boost your portfolio over time.\n\nSpeaking of growth, Meta is a company that's demonstrated its earnings capabilities year after year. The company generates most of its revenue through advertisers across its range of social media apps -- from Facebook and Messenger to Instagram and WhatsApp. This has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue and net income in recent years.\n\nAlso like Apple, Meta has built a solid moat. Users won't easily switch to other social media platforms because they know it will be difficult to maintain all of their contacts if they do so. After all, more than 3.2 billion people worldwide use at least one of Meta's social media apps every day.\n\nMeta isn't standing still and admiring its leadership though. Instead, this company is investing in AI to make its social media platforms even better. If Meta wins this bet, users may spend even more time on its apps -- and that could prompt advertisers to spend even more on Meta to reach their target audiences.\n\nRight now, you can pick up shares of Meta for only 24 times forward-earnings estimates -- a steal considering the company's growth prospects and the passive income you can pick up along the way.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "75% of Warren Buffett's $416 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 5 Unstoppable Stocks",
        "content": "When it comes to billionaire money managers, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett is on a pedestal of his very own.\n\nSince taking the reins at Berkshire Hathaway in the mid-1960s, the affably dubbed \"Oracle of Omaha\" has overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of a scorching-hot 5,422,618%, as of the closing bell on July 17. On an annualized total return basis covering nearly six decades, he's practically doubled up the benchmark S&P 500, including dividends paid.\n\nBuffett's secret to success is really no secret at all. He's plainly stated on multiple occasions that he seeks out time-tested businesses that have well-defined competitive advantages and strong management teams. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nHowever, nowhere near enough credit for Berkshire Hathaway's long-term success is given to Buffett's penchant for portfolio concentration. Even though he and his top investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, are currently overseeing a 44-stock, $416 billion investment portfolio at Berkshire, they all strongly believe in putting an outsized amount of capital to work in their best ideas.\n\nThe following five unstoppable stocks, which account for 75% of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets ($309.9 billion), are truly Buffett's best ideas (market values are as of the closing bell on July 17).\n\n1. Apple: $180,670,650,836 (43.4% of invested assets)\n\nAny doubts about Warren Buffett's preference to concentrate his company's invested assets into a few premier businesses are tossed aside by Berkshire's stake in tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Even following two consecutive quarters where Buffett and his crew lightened their load on Apple, this top holding still accounts for more than 43% of Berkshire's investment portfolio.\n\nThe driving force for Apple as an investment has long been its innovative capacity. For instance, Apple has accounted for 50% or more of domestic smartphone market share since introducing a 5G-capable iPhone in the latter half of 2020.\n\nBut there's more to the largest publicly traded company than just physical product innovation. CEO Tim Cook is currently overseeing the evolution of his company to a platform-focused operating model. Though Apple has no intention of phasing out the physical products (iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch) that endeared its brand to consumers, it's placing greater emphasis on higher-margin subscriptions designed to enhance customer loyalty and minimize the sales fluctuations that typically accompany iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nStory continues\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention Apple's market-leading capital-return program. The world's largest publicly traded company by market value has repurchased $674 billion of its common stock since initiating a buyback program in 2013. Buffett is a huge fan of share repurchases.\n\n2. Bank of America: $45,424,831,224 (10.9% of invested assets)\n\nThe second-largest position in the Oracle of Omaha's $416 billion investment portfolio at Berkshire is none other than money-center goliath Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), which is commonly known as \"BofA.\". Buffett and his team oversee more than 1.03 billion shares of BofA stock, equating to a 13.2% stake in the company.\n\nThere's not a sector Warren Buffett enjoys putting his company's capital to work in more than financials. But his favoritism for BofA might have everything to do with its interest rate sensitivity. The Federal Reserve's most-aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the early 1980s has added billions of dollars in net-interest income to Bank of America's bottom line.\n\nBut did you know that Bank of America has also made significant strides with its digitization efforts? Through the midpoint of 2024, 77% of consumer households were banking digitally, while 53% of all consumer loan sales were completed online or via mobile app. This is up nine percentage points from the comparable period three years ago. Digital transactions are considerably cheaper for banks than in-person interactions, which should improve BofA's operating efficiency over time.\n\nLastly, Bank of America's board approved a $0.02-per-share increase to the company's quarterly dividend following the latest round of Fed stress tests. This hike increases Berkshire's annual dividend income from its stake in BofA to more than $1 billion! Image source: American Express.\n\n3. American Express: $37,896,610,572 (9.1% of invested assets)\n\nHave I mentioned that Warren Buffett is a big fan of financial stocks? If not, credit-services provider American Express(NYSE: AXP) occupying the third spot in Berkshire's portfolio should drive this point home. AmEx, as American Express is referred to in shorthand, has been a continuous holding by Buffett's company since 1991.\n\nWhat's made AmEx such a long-term winner has been its ability to benefit from both sides of the transaction aisle. For instance, it's the No. 3 payment processor by credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. But it's also a lender, as evidenced by the American Express credit cards consumers and businesses use to facilitate transactions. AmEx is able to generate fees from merchants for processing transactions, as well as annual fees and interest income from its cardholders.\n\nAdditionally, American Express has always been particularly good at attracting high earners as cardholders. The well-to-do are less likely than the average working American to alter their buying habits or fail to pay their bills during minor economic disruptions. On paper, AmEx is in better position to navigate periods of economic turbulence than its peers.\n\nSince Berkshire's cost basis for its stake in AmEx is only $8.49 per share, Buffett is overseeing a 33% annual yield, relative to cost, on this position.\n\n4. Coca-Cola: $26,084,000,000 (6.3% of invested assets)\n\nIf you thought American Express was a longtime holding of Warren Buffett, let me introduce you to beverage behemoth Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), which has been a pillar for the Oracle of Omaha since 1988!\n\nBranding is a key reason Coca-Cola has been such a steady performer for decades. According to the annually released \"Brand Footprint\" report from Kantar, Coca-Cola has been the most-chosen brand from retail shelves by consumers for 12 consecutive years. Selling a product (beverages) that's considered a basic necessity leads to consistent and predictable operating cash flow year after year.\n\nIt also doesn't hurt that Coca-Cola offers almost unparalleled geographic diversity. With the exception of North Korea, Cuba, and Russia (the latter has to do with its invasion of Ukraine), Coke has ongoing operations in all other countries. This allows it to take advantage of organic growth opportunities in emerging markets, while generating predictable cash flow in developed countries.\n\nCoca-Cola's dividend is an undeniable lure, as well. Berkshire's cost basis for its 400,000,000-share stake in Coca-Cola is only $3.2475 per share, which means Coke's base annual payout of $1.94 translates into a 60% yield on cost for Buffett's company.\n\n5. Chevron: $19,828,098,775 (4.8% of invested assets)\n\nBuffett's fifth-largest holding, which collectively with Apple, Bank of America, American Express, and Coca-Cola accounts for 75% of Berkshire Hathaway's $416 billion of invested assets, is energy titan Chevron(NYSE: CVX).\n\nThroughout the first two decades of this century, energy stocks played a minimal role in Berkshire's portfolio. But since this decade began, Buffett has shown a clear liking to Chevron, as well as Occidental Petroleum.\n\nHaving nearly $20 billion devoted to Chevron is a crystal-clear indication that Berkshire's brightest minds expect the spot price for crude oil to remain elevated. Roughly three years of reduced capital expenditures by global energy companies (including Chevron) during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to tight worldwide supply of this key commodity. As long as crude oil supply remains constrained, there's a good chance we'll see its spot price hold above its historic average.\n\nChevron is also an integrated operator, which helps to protect its operating cash flow in pretty much any economic climate. Although it generates its beefiest margins from its upstream drilling segment, a declining spot price for crude lowers input costs for Chevron's refineries and chemical plants.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is Chevron's phenomenal capital-return program. The company's board approved a $75 billion share repurchase program in January 2023, and has green-lit 37 consecutive years of dividend increases.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Wealthiest Person in Spain",
        "content": "We recently compiled a report on the 29 Wealthiest People in Spain, and in this article, we will be looking at the richest person in Spain.\n\nSpain’s Booming Economy\n\nSpain is the 15th-largest economy in the world and the 6th-largest economy in Europe, with a population of 48.38 million. According to the IMF, the country's GDP is projected to reach $1.65 trillion as of 2024, driven by services, manufacturing, and agriculture sectors. The major driver, however, is the services sector due to Spain's large tourism and financial services industries.\n\nOn July 3, the Ministry of Industry and Tourism for Spain reported that the country received 33 million international travelers in only the first five months of 2024. This was 13.6% higher than tourists received in the same period last year. In May, it was reported that tourists were spending an average of 1,263 euros, which was 7.3% higher than what they spent in May 2023. The daily spending by tourists also averaged 204 euros, which was 8.6% higher than last May. This increased tourism spending suggests a thriving local economy which implies stable economic growth for Spain.\n\nOn June 11, Reuters reported that the strong performance of the tourism sector resulted in the bank of Spain raising its economic growth forecasts to 2.3% for 2024, up from the prior estimate of 1.9%. Simultaneously, IMF also updated its GDP growth projections for Spain to 1.9% from 1.5% for this year.\n\nThe Financial Sector\n\nSpain's financial services industry is also a top contributor to the country's GDP and growth. In 2021, the finance and insurance services industry of Spain contributed about 3.8% to the country's GDP, according to estimates by iBerotech. As of 2022, Banco Santander S.A. ADR (NYSE:SAN) is one of the largest banks in the eurozone. In Europe, it has four banks – in the UK, Portugal, Poland, and Spain, with headquarters in Spain. It also has branches in the Americas. The bank offers private banking, investment banking, and asset management, among other financial services. The annual revenue for Banco Santander S.A. ADR (NYSE:SAN) in 2023 was $49.4 billion and it had $48.39 billion in net interest income.\n\nBanco Santander S.A. ADR (NYSE:SAN) is working on strengthening its consumer finance business and offerings. On June 21, Bloomberg reported an upcoming consumer-finance partnership between Banco Santander S.A. ADR (NYSE:SAN) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) across Europe, citing unnamed sources. The partnership would entail offering easy financing options to its European customers to facilitate consumer purchases. A similar digital consumer-finance partnership was signed with Apple Inc.

ADR (NYSE:SAN) found a way to use Spain’s tourism industry to clear its debts and improve its financial health.

ADR (NYSE:SAN) already sold hotel loans valued at around $321 million to credit investor Polus Capital Management. The bank is also considering selling other commercial real estate assets, including office buildings and hotels, which is expected to be of a similar size to the hotel loan sale.

Majors such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose slightly in evening trade.\n\nA mix of profit-taking and a rotation into sectors more primed to benefit from an economic recovery had battered major technology stocks over the past two sessions.\n\nNetflix fell slightly in aftermarket trade after its second quarter earnings missed expectations.\n\nHeavyweight chipmaking stocks were also rattled by the prospect of more U.S. sanctions on China, especially on the country’s chipmaking sector.\n\nLosses in tech sparked deep losses on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 down 0.8% at 5,544.59 points on Thursday.

Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)are all set to report on Tuesday, with the two internet giants set to offer more cues on artificial intelligence after a massive valuation spike over the past year.\n\nTesla will be watched for how the electric car maker is navigating a steep decline in sales this year.\n\nPositive earnings from chipmaking bellwethers ASML (AS:ASML) Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) and TSMC (NYSE:TSM) aided chipmaking stocks on Thursday.

It last went down in August last year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSources at the Bank of England said the “global issue” with the payments was as a result of an issue with Swift technology, a global payments technology company.\n\nA source close to Swift said the payments outage was not the result of a cyber attack.\n\nAt 4:30pm, the Bank of England said: “We are pleased to confirm that the third party supplier has restored service following their earlier issues, and CHAPS payments are settling as normal.\n\n“We expect that all payments received by the Bank today will be settled by the end of the day.\n\n“If you are concerned about a CHAPS payment you plan to make or receive today, please contact your bank, or other payment service provider.”\n\nThe Bank of England had earlier this afternoon said: “A global payments issue is affecting the Bank’s CHAPS service and delaying some high value and time-sensitive payments, including some house purchases.”\n\nA spokesman said it was “working closely with a third party supplier, industry and other authorities to resolve the issue as promptly as possible”.\n\nHomebuyers were potentially left in “a nightmare scenario” with nowhere to go, brokers had warned.\n\nHannah Bashford, director of Model Financial Solutions, said earlier that anyone looking to complete on a house purchase today “may be left high and dry with nowhere to move to if funds aren’t passed through the system in time to complete”.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead the latest updates below.

And the glaring risk is that renewable energy methods are unreliable, thus profits will likely be volatile.\n\nHowever, the company believes that with the business continually expanding its high-quality asset base, shareholders stand to reap the rewards over the long term.\n\nSSE’s shares rose 1.6pc today.\n\nThanks for joining us today.

It came after a report that the United States was considering tighter curbs on exports of advanced chip technology to China - a move that could provoke a trade war.\n\nSemiconductor stocks took a dive Wednesday after Bloomberg reported that Joe Biden’s administration was weighing a measure called the foreign direct product rule that would allows the US government to stop a product from being sold if it was made using American technology.\n\nThe reported US move, if it happens, would potentially mean restrictions on companies such as Tokyo Electron and the Netherlands’ ASML.\n\nThe Global X Asia Semiconductor exchange-traded fund closed down 1.74pc earlier today, with declines in major holdings including Tokyo Electron, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung Electronics.\n\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor index of 30 top US chip companies is down 0.4pc currently, following a 6.8pc sell-off on Wednesday. This was its biggest one-day drop since March 2020.\n\nNonetheless, there are some big gainers in the US index today. Intel is up 3.9pc, GlobalFoundries is up 2.8pc and NXP Semiconductor is up 1.4pc. Artificial intelligence poster-child Nvidia is up 1.2pc.\n\n05:27 PM BST\n\nTech giant Meta mulls investment in owner of Ray-Ban\n\nThe Italian-French company that owns Ray-Ban jumped 1.5pc today after a Bloomberg report that Facebook owner Meta is considering taking a stake in the glasses giant.\n\nThe proposed investment in EssilorLuxottica - thought to involve taking a small stake - comes as Meta attempts to ramp up its plans to develop so-called smart glasses.\n\nThe two companies have already collaborated on a pair of smart glasses called the Ray-Ban Meta.\n\nMeta and EssilorLuxottica have been approached for comment.

Germany’s Dax dropped 0.4pc, but France’s blue-chip Cac 40 rose 0.2pc.\n\nYields on government bonds across the continent eased, while the euro fell 0.2pc against the dollar.\n\n05:06 PM BST\n\nAsda: No ‘quick fix’ after petrol leaks into Surrey water\n\nThe chairman of Asda has admitted to Surrey villagers there is “no quick fix” for a devastating petrol station leak, amid fears it could take as long as a year to resolve. Matt Oliver reports:\n\nLord Rose promised the supermarket chain was committed to the environmental clean-up in Bramley, near Guildford, where residents were unable to drink tap water for almost six weeks after fuel seeped into the ground from the company’s forecourt.\n\nBut the peer also warned that removing all the petrol was “not an easy job”.\n\nHe came to address villagers at a meeting on Tuesday after The Telegraph highlighted the dire situation at the end of June.\n\nFrustrated residents – some of whom had reported fumes and smells as far back as 2021 – have been calling on local authorities, utility providers and government agencies to set out a clear plan for tackling the spill, with many regarding the response so far as lacking leadership and transparency.\n\nAt the meeting in Bramley, Lord Rose told a packed village hall: “I know there’s a problem here.\n\n“But I want to just say, on behalf of Asda and certainly on behalf of the board and myself, that we are absolutely committed to getting this sorted out.”\n\nRead the full story...

The top riser was Sports Direct owner Frasers Group, which rose 9.2pc. Schroders was the second-biggest riser, up 4.9pc. At the other end of the index, mining company Antofagasta fell 4.9pc, followed by aerospace giant Melrose, down 3.8pc.\n\nMeanwhile, the mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 0.7pc.

Investment manager Ninety One fell 3.8pc, followed by Allianz Technology Trust, down 3.1pc.\n\n04:49 PM BST\n\nTechnology powering house payments ‘no longer fit for purpose’, claims tech firm\n\nA tech firm that claims to have worked with the Bank of England on a payment system for the housing market says it’s time for an alternative to CHAPS. Joe Pepper, UK chief executive of Pexa, said:\n\nHome buyers having a payment ‘glitch’ hold their transactions up is yet another proof point that the technology and infrastructure supporting the market is no longer fit for purpose. It is creaking at the seams.\n\nBuying a home is a stressful and laborious enough experience as it is for consumers without it being compounded by payments falling through or getting held up.\n\nDigitisation cannot come soon enough. With new regulation putting consumer outcomes front and centre, it is imperative that we see the adoption of new, reliable technology that improves the experience for home movers and remortgagers, speeding up transaction processes from days to minutes.\n\n04:42 PM BST\n\nGerman government bond yields drop after ECB meeting\n\nGerman government bond yields hit multi-week lows today as European Central Bank remarks backed investors’ expectations for a rate cut in September.\n\nThe ECB did not provide clear indications on future rate moves, with its president Christine Lagarde saying September’s decision was “wide open”.\n\nThe 10-year German government yield, the benchmark for the euro zone bloc, was down at 2.414pc, from 2.423pc yesterday.\n\nMoney markets were pricing in around a 75pc chance of a quarter point rate cut in September.\n\nNicolas Forest, chief investment officer at Candriam, said:\n\nThe market anticipates two additional cuts before the end of the year. This aligns with our expectations, as inflation dynamics should continue to support further easing.\n\n04:32 PM BST\n\nBank of England confirms end of outage\n\nThe CHAPS payments outage is over, the Bank of England has said. A spokesman said:\n\nWe are pleased to confirm that the third party supplier has restored service following their earlier issues, and CHAPS payments are settling as normal.\n\nWe expect that all payments received by the Bank today will be settled by the end of the day.\n\nIf you are concerned about a CHAPS payment you plan to make or receive today, please contact your bank, or other payment service provider.\n\n04:29 PM BST\n\nChinese pledge to prevent ‘ideological risks’ in new tech policy\n\nChina’s ruling Communist Party wrapped up a top-level meeting today by endorsing policies aimed at advancing the country’s technological power as part of “building a modern socialist country”.\n\n“The current and future period is a critical time for comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation using Chinese-style modernisation,” a Chinese government statement said.\n\nThe statement said it is necessary to coordinate development and security, a nod to concern that expanding national security enforcement is weighing on the economy.\n\nBut it stressed that “national security is an important foundation for the steady and long-term development of Chinese-style modernisation,” noting that the “leadership of the party is the fundamental guarantee” for achieving that goal.\n\nThe meeting also endorsed leader Xi Jinping’s repeated calls for “high-quality development,” signaling Beijing will continue to prioritise investing in technologies and encouraging companies to upgrade their equipment and knowhow at a time when China faces tightening restrictions on access to Western advanced technology, such as leading-edge computer chips and artificial intelligence.\n\nChinese leaders have repeatedly said the country will remain open to foreign investment and improve the business environment, despite ever-extending Communist Party controls over companies, social media, financial regulators and other aspects of life.\n\nThursday’s statement repeatedly reiterated the need for openness and open markets, but also said the party must prevent any “ideological risks.”\n\nThe meetings are unlikely to make a major change in policies, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary.\n\nHe said: “There still appears to be a tension between policies aimed at boosting economic security and expanding the supply-side of the economy, and those aimed at giving market forces a greater role and rebalancing growth toward consumption.”\n\n04:23 PM BST\n\nLabour’s ‘fiscal lock’ is a ‘rather theatrical way of promising’ not to copy Truss\n\nA new law designed to ensure that no future Government can sideline the Office for Budget Responsibility is a “theatrical” promise not to copy the mini-Budget from Liz Truss’s administration, a leading think tank has said.\n\nBen Zaranko, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said:\n\nThe new government’s ‘fiscal lock’ is broadly sensible but largely performative. It is, in effect, a rather theatrical way of promising not to do another Mini Budget – or at least not to do another Mini Budget without some accompanying independent analysis from the Office for Budget Responsibility\n\nThis Chancellor could make and keep to that promise without any need for primary legislation, and some future Chancellor determined to misbehave could almost certainly find a way to get around it, but it nonetheless serves as a welcome commitment to fiscal transparency.\n\nThe main impact of the bill, if there is one, will be to modestly increase the powers of the OBR vis-à-vis the Treasury. Kwasi Kwarteng unveiling a mini-Budget under the Truss administration in September 2022 - PRU/AFP via Getty Images\n\n04:15 PM BST\n\nUS stock markets fall amid worries about tech giants\n\nThe main US stock indexes are down in trading after worst day for big technology stocks since 2022.\n\nThe S&P 500 is down 0.2pc, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down very slighly at under 0.1pc. The tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite is down 0.2pc.\n\nMuch of yesterday’s pain centered on stocks of chip companies, hurt by possible trade tensions with China and other worries.\n\nBig technology stocks had been screaming higher, in large part because of a frenzy around artificial intelligence technology. That helped a handful of Big Tech stocks drive to towering heights, as well as criticism they had grown too costly.\n\nEven after Wednesday’s drops, chip companies and tech stocks broadly remain much higher for the year so far. Nvidia is still up 145pc, for example.\n\nIntel, which manufactures a lot of its chips in the US, Costa Rica, Europe and Israel, is up 4.2pc today.\n\n03:57 PM BST\n\n‘Hundreds’ of home buyers hit by payments outage\n\nHundreds of home buyers could be left unable to get the keys to their news homes as a result of the “global payments issue” reported by the Bank of England.\n\nAnthony Codling, managing director of RBC Capital Markets, said:\n\nThe Chaps collapse could leave hundreds of homebuyers out in the cold.\n\nThe breakdown of the payments system is impacting high value transactions such as house purchases, on average there are around 4,000 housing transactions a day.\n\nIf conveyancers don’t get the money, they can’t release the keys, and the completion delays don’t just impact the buyer but also all those in the chain.\n\nThose caught out in the cold will hope that the sunny warm weathers will last longer than forecast.\n\n03:47 PM BST\n\nCustomers can still use cashpoints and car payments during outage\n\nThe Bank of England’s Chaps payment system processes hundreds of billions of pounds worth of transactions a day, including banks paying one another large sums.\n\nThe Bank said:\n\nIf you are concerned about a Chaps payment you plan to make or receive today, please contact your bank, or other payment service provider.\n\nRetail payment systems are unaffected so people and businesses can continue to use cash points, card payments and bank transfers as normal.\n\n03:39 PM BST\n\nHome buyers risk being left ‘waiting outside their new property’\n\nHouse buyers could be left waiting outside a new property unable to complete their purchases as a result of the global payments outage, estate agents have warned.\n\nToby Leek, the head of the estate agent association Propertymark, said:\n\nCompleting on a property can be extremely stressful even without technical issues, however it is important to remember that should systems ever cause unexpected problems at a vital moment within the transactional process these issues do tend to be fixed quickly.\n\nThe flipside is in the short term, this can have the potential to leave people waiting outside their new property with a removal van full of their belongings in very extreme cases.\n\n03:32 PM BST\n\nHomebuyers left in ‘nightmare scenario’\n\nThe outage of the Bank of England’s high-value payment system risks leaving homebuyers in “a nightmare scenario” with nowhere to go, brokers have warned.\n\nOur senior economics reporter Eir Nolsøe has the latest:\n\nHannah Bashford, director of Model Financial Solutions, said anyone looking to complete on a house purchase today “may be left high and dry with nowhere to move to if funds aren’t passed through the system in time to complete.”\n\nAndrew Montlake, managing director at Coreco, said: “This has the potential to be a nightmare scenario for home buyers on the day of completion, potentially leaving them and their removal vans all packed up with nowhere to go.”\n\nChris Barry from Thomas Legal said while completions tend to happen in the morning, some would still occur between the issue being announced and the 4pm cut-off.\n\nMr Barry said: “Most contracts have a 12 or 1pm hard time embedded so if the payment is being made now they are technically in breach of contract.”\n\n03:25 PM BST\n\nPayments outage ‘not a cyber attack’\n\nSources at the Bank of England have said the “global issue” with the payments is as a result of an issue with Swift technology, a global payments technology company.\n\nA source close to Swift said the payments outage which is holding up house purchases across Britain is not the result of a cyber attack.\n\n03:08 PM BST\n\nHouse purchases hit by delays, Bank of England warns\n\nHouse purchases and other high-value transactions are at risk of delay, the Bank of England has warned.\n\nOur senior economics reporter Eir Nolsøe has the latest:\n\nThe system for processing large payments used for football player purchases, art deals and home completions is experiencing a ‘global payments issue’, it said.\n\nThe Bank said: “‘A global payments issue is affecting the Bank’s CHAPS service and delaying some high value and time-sensitive payments, including some house purchases.”\n\nThreadneedle Street said it was “working closely with a third party supplier, industry and other authorities to resolve the issue as promptly as possible.”\n\nThe Bank added that anyone affected should contact their lender.\n\n03:07 PM BST\n\nHouse payments delayed weeks after banking glitch\n\nThe delays affecting house purchases comes weeks after customers were left without their salaries on payday last month after a payments system outage affecting major banks.\n\nCustomers were left unable to pay bills following an issue with the faster payment system in June, which is run by Pay.uk.\n\nHSBC, Nationwide, Barclays and Virgin Money all said they were working through problems with their mobile banking apps on the final working day of the month, when typically salaries are paid.\n\nThe faster payment system was created in 2008 to support personal and business customers day and night, 365 days per year, according to Pay.uk, which runs the UK’s retail payments operations, including Bacs, the faster payment system and the image clearing system.\n\n02:55 PM BST\n\nHouse purchases delayed by ‘global payments issue’\n\nHouse buyers are having their purchases of new homes held up by a glitch with a global payment system, the Bank of England has said.\n\nOfficials said that a “global payments issue is affecting the Bank’s CHAPS service” was impacting “some high value and time-sensitive payments, including some house

put up taxes to tackle ballooning debt\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has urged Joe Biden to raise taxes to tackle the growing federal debt problem in the US as it carried out a healthcheck on the American economy.\n\nThe IMF said the government should even raise taxes on households earning less than the President’s $400,000-a-year threshold.\n\nUS debt stands at a record high of $34.9 trillion.\n\nThe fund also urged the Federal Reserve - the US equivalent of the Bank of England - to resist cutting interest rates until “late 2024” amid fears that a strong jobs market could lead to a rebound in inflation.\n\nThe prescriptions came in the detailed staff report from the IMF’s annual “Article IV” review of US economic policies.\n\nThe fund has been emphasising in recent weeks the need for more fiscal prudence as US deficits continue to grow despite robust economic growth.\n\nIt comes as Republicans and Democrats formulate tax and spending proposals ahead of November’s presidential election.\n\nIMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told Reuters that the Fed could afford to wait longer to start easing monetary policy due to a strong jobs market.\n\nHe said: “Given salient upside risks to inflation — brought into stark relief by data outturns earlier this year — it would be prudent to lower the policy rate only after there is clearer evidence in the data

that the cost of labour will remain elevated in the near term but insisted that longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable.\n\nShe said that the rate of inflation will fluctuate around current levels for the rest of this year.\n\nShe said wage growth will moderate for the rest of the year as companies gradually reduce the number of job vacancies from high levels.\n\nMs Lagarde

Domestic price pressures are described as “still high” (previously “strong”), and it says that most measures of underlying inflation were “either stable or edged down in June”.\n\nIt also notes that the effect of high wage growth is being partly offset by narrower profit margins.\n\nAt the press conference, we think President Lagarde will give little away and will certainly not pre-commit to any further rate cuts.\n\nPolicymakers will understandably be concerned at the persistent strength in indicators of domestically-generated inflation, which have stopped falling since the start of the year.\n\nThere will be two more inflation releases before the September meeting, and we suspect that they will show enough evidence of easing underlying price pressure to encourage the Bank to cut at that meeting.\n\nBut the risks are skewed towards the ECB extending its pause in September and interest rates coming down more slowly than we are forecasting.\n\n01:32 PM BST\n\nECB ‘in no rush’ to lower interest rates\n\nThe European Central Bank is “in no rush” to lower interest rates further, according to analysts, despite expectations from traders of more cuts later in the year\n\nForecasters suggested expectations for interest rate cuts have “gone too far” as policymakers held the eurozone’s deposit rate at 3.75pc.\n\nMoney markets are still pricing in at least one more cut by the ECB this year and an 83pc chance of an additional reduction by the end of the year.\n\nPolicy implication: the ECB is in no rush to ease again and wont' pre-commit to a particular rate path, but recent data points haven't materially changed the outlook.\r\nThe ECB remains on track to cut rates at a quarterly pace.\n\n— Frederik Ducrozet (@fwred) July 18, 2024\n\n\"some measures of underlying infl ticked up in May owing to one-off factors, most measures were either stable or edged down in June\"\r\n\r\n\"domestic price pressures are still high, services infl is elevated and headline infl is likely to remain above the target well into next year\"2/2\n\n— Piet Haines Christiansen (@pietphc) July 18, 2024\n\n#ECB leaves all rates unchg as expected.

He said:\n\nThe labour market is clearly cooling - with unemployment rising and vacancies falling - but pay growth still remains elevated at 5.7pc, way in excess of the circa 3pc level that is considered to be consistent with the 2pc inflation target.\n\nThis still remains one of the largest potential barriers to an August rate cut.\n\nMichael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, added: “This morning’s UK labour market data further muddies the waters ahead of the August Bank of England decision in two weeks’ time, after yesterday’s hotter-than-expected inflation figures, with the labour market continuing to show some signs of slack, as earnings pressures ease somewhat, despite remaining incompatible with a return to the 2pc inflation target.”\n\nSimon French of Panmure Gordon said:\n\nBig base effects in the latest RTI on PAYE data slowing June (median) UK pay inflation to just 3.6% YoY. Another challenge for the BoE to appraise - base effects from high summer 2023 wage settlements.

        "title": "Tim Cook gifted Donald Trump a $6,000 Mac Pro after he lowered tariffs on parts Apple needed from China",
        "content": "I get lower tariffs, you get a new Mac: the art of the deal!\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook gifted former President Donald Trump a $6,000 Mac Pro computer after the two men reached a deal for the tech giant to receive an exemption to a series of tariffs in 2019, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAt the time Apple and Cook were applying a charm offensive to persuade then-President Trump to remove tariffs on certain components that came from China. Cook asked Trump if he could meet him in person to make Apple’s case, a gesture the former president found “impressive,” he told Bloomberg. Trump was particularly pleased at the time that Cook reached out, especially considering his acrimonious relationship with other tech CEOs.\n\n“Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly,” Trump said in August 2019. “That’s why he’s a great executive, because he calls me, and others don’t.”\n\nShortly after taking office, Trump had imposed 25% tariffs on 10 parts used in building Mac Pro computers that came from China. The price increase meant potentially billions of dollars in additional costs for Apple, but when Apple first sought an exception on the trade tariffs, Trump responded with his usual obstinance.\n\n“Apple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China,” Trump posted on X (still Twitter at the time). “Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!”\n\nEventually Apple and the Trump administration reached an agreement: The White House would grant Apple an exemption to the tariffs and Apple would build the computers in the U.S. Once the production lines were up and running, Cook gifted Trump one of the first Mac Pros built at the factory, according to Bloomberg. The Mac Pro is Apple’s most powerful computer and generally targeted toward professionals who require large amounts of computing power. It is unclear what Trump did with the gift or how he reacted to receiving it.\n\nApple and the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the gift.\n\nIn Trump’s telling of the story, he induced Cook to increase Apple’s manufacturing footprint in the U.S. in exchange for lifting the tariffs. “I said, ‘I’m gonna do something for you guys,’” Trump told Bloomberg, “‘but you have to build in this country.’”\n\nIn reality, the Mac Pro was already assembled in the U.S. However, Apple still gave Trump the appearance of strong-arming a Big Tech company when it announced a $1 billion investment in an assembly plant in Austin. Apple, though, was planning the investment a year earlier, before the dispute over the Chinese tariffs, according to Bloomberg. Nonetheless, Cook and Trump appeared together in November 2019 at the Austin assembly facility. Observers at the time considered it a minor win for Trump—who got a photo op in an American factory—as well as for Cook—who skirted painful tariffs with a manufacturing investment that had already been in the works at Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple and Cook may very well have to resort to the same playbook should Trump take office again. The former president has made no secret of his wish to impose even higher tariffs, up to 60% on any imports from China and 10% on imports from anywhere else. Economists consider the policy inflationary for the entire economy, and analysts believe it would be disastrous for Apple given its heavy reliance on China to manufacture many of its most popular products, like the iPhone.\n\nAs a likely contingency plan, Apple has been diversifying its production locations away from China. In April, during a trip across South Asia, Cook announced Apple planned to spend more with suppliers in Vietnam and Indonesia, although details were scant.\n\nStill, given Trump’s desire to impose tariffs on any foreign goods, manufacturing in Vietnam or Indonesia as opposed to China would still result in a cost increase for Apple. For his part, Trump shows little intention on relenting when it comes to tariffs.\n\n“I can’t believe how many people are negative on tariffs that are actually smart,” Trump told Bloomberg. “Man, is it good for negotiation.”\n\nIf Trump were indeed to win reelection and implement his tariff policy, Cook will likely bank on his cozy relationship with the former president, which earned him an exemption five years ago. Trump does seem to have a fair amount of goodwill for Cook, the chief executive of the world’s most valuable company.\n\n“I found him to be a very good businessman,” Trump said about Cook.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "While thousands of companies will report second quarter earnings in the next few weeks, there are a handful of companies that are “must-see” earnings reports. These are some of the best known, and most popular, companies.\n\nAll eyes will be on these five for a variety of reasons. Several are part of the Magnificent 7. Many investors own those 7 large cap stocks. But several others are simply popular growth stocks that have hit new all-time highs in 2024.\n\nQ2’s Must-See Earnings Reports\n\nWhat will they say about the US, and global, economies? Is the recession here or will the Fed achieve a soft landing?\n\nSeveral companies are booming thanks to the AI revolution. Will AI still be a driver of earnings and sales in Q2?\n\nWhile there are a lot of companies that people will be tuning into during this earnings season, these 5 are the most important of all. You won’t want to miss them.\n\nThe 5 Most Important Stocks to Watch During Q2 Earnings Season\n\n1.    Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surprised on earnings 5 quarters in a row. In fact, it has a great earnings surprise track record with just 1 miss in the last 5 years and that was in early 2023.\n\nApple shares are up 19% year-to-date and are hitting all-time highs. Yet Apple trades at 35x forward earnings. Is Apple too hot to handle?\n\n2.    Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) has beat 4 quarters in a row. That is a turnaround from a string of misses in 2021 and 2022.\n\nEli Lilly has been one of the hottest stocks on the Street. It is up 55.4% year-to-date. Eli Lilly is trading with a high valuation, as it has a forward P/E of 70. Will Eli Lilly continue to execute?\n\n3.    Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) has beat 5 quarters in a row. It also has a solid 5-year earnings surprise track record, with just 3 misses during that time. That is impressive given the pandemic.\n\nShares of Chipotle are up 21% year-to-date and hit new all-time highs. However, Chipotle isn’t cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 51. Can Chipotle continue with the 20%+ earnings growth this quarter?\n\n4.    Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) has a great earnings surprise record. Microsoft has beat 7 quarters in a row. It has only missed once in the last 5 years and it was in 2022.\n\nMicrosoft shares hit new all-time highs in 2024. It is up 18% year-to-date. Microsoft isn’t cheap, however. It trades at 34x forward earnings. Will AI prove to be another catalyst for Microsoft in Q2?\n\n5.    Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) has an excellent earnings surprise track record. It’s beat 4 quarters in a row. Super Micro Computer has only missed once since 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer have been red-hot in 2024, gaining 187% year-to-date on the AI trade. It reports earnings in Aug 2024. Super Micro is trading at 26x. Is Super Micro Computer a good bellwether of what’s to come with the other AI stocks this earnings season?\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of MSFT in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Forget the Metaverse! 7 Real-World Tech Stocks Poised for Breakout.",
        "content": "The technology sector offers growth that few other sectors can match. Some of that growth is rooted in utilitarian, real-world innovation. Conversely, other niches within the tech sector grow due to the promise inherent to undeveloped, future technology. The metaverse is an excellent recent example of the latter. However, it remains very risky, and I believe that investors should focus on real-world tech stocks instead.\n\nWhen I say real world, I mean firms currently selling utilitarian technology.  That means the things we see and use regularly, not vague promises like those from the metaverse.\n\nFortunately, there are many options within the highly developed tech sector. The more real-world innovation these companies bring to market, the more valuable their stocks should become. Sure, investing in undeveloped future technology sometimes yields massive returns. That said, the utilitarian route is safer and still offers very strong returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has returned even though iPhone sales remain problematic. By now, investors know the reason: Apple is rolling out its AI, which will be heavily applied to iPhones. The application of AI there, too, has reignited interest in the stock, sending it substantially higher over the past few months.\n\nWhile Apple’s shares are currently fully priced, I think investors will continue to invest regardless. In 2024, the markets will continue to look for news to substantiate optimism, justified or not.\n\nI believe the rollout of the application of generative AI is a justifiable reason to invest in Apple even now. Apple intends to ship 10% more iPhones in the second half of 2024. The company plans to ship 90 million iPhone 16 devices during the period. The application of AI features in those phones is anticipated to drive a 10% rise in sales above iPhone 15 devices. iPhone sales are the main driver of Apple’s success. They continue to fall, so a rebound, measured by actual numbers and not just hype, should send share prices higher.\n\nGrab Holdings (GRAB) A group of Grab riders on motorbikes in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nSource: Twinsterphoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nGrab Holdings (NASDAQ:GRAB) is a real-world tech stock that continues to be poised for a breakout. Several reasons, both internal and external, lead investors to continue to hold that belief.\n\nInternally, investors must spend a few minutes reviewing the company’s financial statements. Those who do will see a company that continues growing rapidly on the top line while approaching net profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company continues rapidly improving its operating losses, leading management to adjust its guidance upward.\n\nExternally, investors should note that the rideshare super app serves a Southeast Asia region that is growing rapidly. GDP in the region is expected to increase by 4.6% in 2024. The region is characterized by favorable demographics and massive opportunities due to shifting global supply chains. Those factors supercharge the potential of companies, including Grab Holdings.\n\nGrab Holdings is an excellent example of how real-world technology can be applied to create utilitarian innovation and tangible results.\n\nSTMicroelectronics (STM) STMicroelectronics building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nDepending upon where you look, STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) is expected to break out strongly or very strongly.\n\nThe consensus is that the European chip maker is expected to increase value by roughly 20%. However, others, including Morningstar, expect that STMicroelectronics has closer to 50% upside.\n\nThe push for safer, greener, smarter vehicles leads to increased electronic content across the automotive sector. STMicroelectronics is a notable competitor in the automotive sector. The company has significant opportunities in the microcontroller and silicon carbide based power product spaces.\n\nSilicon carbide (SiC) has unique properties that are highly utilitarian in power products. SiC components can withstand voltages up to 10 times higher than traditional silicon components. They also conduct heat better than silicon components. The technical advantages go on and on, and if STMicroelectronics competes strongly in that arena, it will thrive.\n\nThe three most recent analyst actions related to STMicroelectronics include two upgrades and the reiteration of a buy rating.\n\nEHang Holdings (EH) Flying taxi or Car-drone-EHang 216 exhibited by Prestige Image Motor Cars at the 2023 Indonesia International Motor Show (IIMS) at JIExpo Kemayoran. EH stock\n\nSource: Toto Santiko Budi / Shutterstock.com\n\nEHang Holdings (NYSE:EH) is the world’s most advanced flying car company.  The Chinese company commercialized electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) technology far ahead of its U.S. competitors.\n\nEHang Holdings’ U.S. competitors continue to work through regulatory hurdles and are expected to commercialize sometime in 2025. Meanwhile, EHang Holdings has been delivering vehicles for some time. The company delivered 27 eVTOLs in late June to Wenchang County Transportation Group in Zhejiang Province. The vehicles are being used in tourism, and EHang Holdings is seeing success.\n\nThe company delivered 26 eVTOLs during the first quarter, substantially more than the 11 vehicles delivered a year prior. EHang Holdings’s more than year of vehicle delivery experience should give investors some idea of how it compares with U.S. flying car firms and stoke interest due to the real-world results the deliveries exemplify.\n\nRevenues are booming at the company, while net losses continue to narrow. I believe EHang Holdings’s early lead over its U.S. competitors, combined with improving financials, poises the stock for a breakout.\n\nLam Research (LRCX) Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX Stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nLam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a highly utilitarian tech stock that is poised for a breakout.\n\nThe company produces semiconductor fabrication equipment to produce the integrated circuits necessary for artificial intelligence. So, it’s a part of the AI opportunity. The company is also building facilities near its global customers’ research hubs.\n\nWhile the company is preparing for the continued emergence of AI, its results are also attractive. Earnings increased by 11.4% in the first quarter on better-than-anticipated revenues. Sales have grown by more than 20% over the last three years, while earnings during the same period increased by more than 30%.\n\nThe company announced a share buyback roughly two months ago, which is indicative of the company’s commitment to shareholders.\n\nMany investors looking for AI equipment producers will initially land on ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) as the best choice. Lam Research is not to be overlooked in that regard.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a major player in cybersecurity. Its core offerings focus on protecting computer systems from cyberattacks, with a particular emphasis on security solutions designed for the cloud environment, which offer scalability and flexibility. The advent of AI has upped the stakes in the cyber security world, positioning Crowdstrike stock for a breakout.\n\nTo be fair, Crowdstrike has already broken out in 2024 increasing in price by more than 47%. Even so, share prices remain slightly below consensus target prices.\n\nJudging the tech sector is particularly difficult concerning AI. Software stocks, including Crowdstrike, recently saw a spike in demand as the markets rotated out of chip stocks and into software. It currently appears that FOMO surrounding chip stocks is suddenly high again.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the two AI subsectors can rise together in the coming weeks. Regardless, Crowdstrike is undergoing substantial earnings growth in 2024. That alone is a strong reason to expect it to break out further.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) Slim Margins Are a Real and Continuing Problem for CSCO Stock\n\nSource: Anucha Cheechang / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock represents a combination of stability and broad tech exposure that is highly utilitarian. The company sells networking hardware and includes a dividend that yields 3.5%.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is shifting toward a greater percentage of software sales overall. Software sales are associated with repeat purchases, whereas hardware sales tend to be one-and-done. The result is a much more advantageous sales cycle. Beyond that, software sales are associated with greater margins than hardware sales.\n\nCisco Systems is positioned to capitalize on the LoRa and Lo RaWAN opportunities. That said, Cisco Systems stock is down by more than 7% in 2024. In my mind it’s poised for a breakout due to all of the factors I just mentioned. EPS is expected to grow by more than 23% this year at the company.\n\nHowever, Cisco Systems also anticipates that the top line will contract by a few percentage points. I look at it this way: The company will continue to have the earnings to pay a healthy dividend based on EPS projections.

        "title": "Dow Achieves New Milestone, Regains Momentum for 2H: 5 Picks",
        "content": "Wall Street has been witnessing an impressive rally for the past 18 months. However, the rally was so far primarily driven by technology stocks, buoyed by massive application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) worldwide.\n\nConsequently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the broad-market S&P 500 indexes jumped during this period. On the other hand, the performance of the Dow remained muted as it is more inclined to rate-sensitive cyclical sectors like industrials, financials, materials and energy.\n\nSituation Changes\n\nMeanwhile, the situation took a drastic turn in the last five trading sessions following the release of several soft economic data. The PCE and the core PCE price index for May and CPI for June came in weaker than expected. These readings significantly raise market participants’ expectations for a sooner-than-expected rate cut.\n\nMoreover, weak readings for several metrics of the resilient labor market, weak manufacturing and services PMIs, and soft orders for both durable and non-durable goods indicate that the U.S. economy is cooling.\n\nFinally, on Jul 15, speaking at the Economic Club of Washington D.C., Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank may not wait for the inflation rate to cool to its 2% target before implementing an interest rate cut.\n\nAccording to Powell, “The implication of that is that if you wait until inflation gets all the way down to 2%, you’ve probably waited too long, because the tightening that you’re doing, or the level of tightness that you have, is still having effects which will probably drive inflation below 2%. The Fed is looking for greater confidence and what increases that confidence in that is more good inflation data, and lately here we have been getting some of that.”\n\nRate Cut Expectations Rise\n\nThe benchmark interest rate is currently in the range of 5.25-5.5%, marking the highest level in 23 years. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note fell to 4.166% from 4.793% in mid-April.\n\nThe CME FedWatch tool currently shows a 100% probability of a Fed fund rate cut by 25 basis points in September. This probability was around 62% in late June. Moreover, the interest rate derivative tool also shows a 96% probability of two rate cuts by the end of 2024.\n\nDow Regains Momentum\n\nFollowing these developments, investors’ attention has shifted from overvalued technology stocks to rate-sensitive beaten-down cyclical stocks. On Jul 17, the blue-chip index closed above the crucial technical barrier of 41,000, for the first time. In intraday trading, the index recorded an all-time high of 41,221.98. Month to date, the Dow is up 5.3%. Year to date, the index has rallied 9.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTechnically, at its current level of 41,198.08, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 39,207.05 and 37,494.14, respectively. The 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trendsetter.\n\nHistorically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the asset (in this case the Dow Index) becomes a strong possibility.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five Dow stocks that have strong earnings growth potential for the rest of 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon.com Inc. AMZN is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. A deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive for AMZN.\n\nThe strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home offerings are tailwinds. The advertising business is also pretty robust. AMZN enjoys a strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are its other positives.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Amazon.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 57.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last 60 days.\n\nApple Inc. AAPL has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, AAPL’s competitive position is expected to improve. Moreover, AAPL is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment.\n\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. AAPL’s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and the growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Apple has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.8% and 7.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending September 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nWalmart Inc. WMT has been gaining from its highly diversified business with contributions from various segments, channels and formats. WMT has been benefiting from an increase in in-store and digital channel traffic due to its robust omnichannel initiatives. Store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped 50% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nWalmart’s strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has also been rewarding, as evidenced by the constant increase in the market share for groceries. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled WMT’s first-quarter results and led to an encouraging fiscal 2025 view.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Walmart has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3% over the last 60 days.\n\nHoneywell International Inc. HON has been benefiting from strength in the commercial aviation, building automation and UOP businesses. The aviation segment of HON is particularly strong, driven by robust demand in the aviation aftermarket. A strong commercial aftermarket and solid commercial aviation demand led by strength in the air transport aftermarket are aiding HON’s Aerospace segment. Handsome rewards to shareholders add to the stock’s appeal.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Honeywell International has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 5.5% and 10.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. ‘s JPM shares have outperformed the industry over the past three months. Higher interest rates for the longer time, strategic acquisitions and partnerships, opening new branches and solid loan and deposit balances are expected to keep aiding net interest income (NII), while higher funding costs will weigh on JPM.\n\nAlthough there has been a resurgence in global deal-making activities, a complete revival will still take some time. Thus, the performance of the investment banking business of JPM is expected to be decent in the near term. JPM’s enhanced capital distributions seem sustainable.\n\nZacks Rank #2 JPMorgan Chase has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 6.3% and 2.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.3% over the last seven days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 Long-Term Tech Stocks for Extending Investment Horizons",
        "content": "Is the tech trade really over? Much is being written about investors rotating capital out of high-flying technology names and into value and small-cap stocks. While the rotation is seen as healthy and likely to prolong the current market rally that began in late 2022, it seems doubtful that technology stocks will trail for long.\n\nFirst of all, tech firms tend to be the engines of innovation and growth in the economy. That fact has only accelerated with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Second, the quarterly financial results of technology companies justify their stock’s performance and lofty valuations. With the economy and consumer spending remaining resilient, there’s no reason to assume that there will be an earnings downturn.\n\nLastly, technology companies, particularly the mega-cap variety, have a dominant position in the markets in which they compete. Some, it can be argued, have near-monopoly positions. That also looks unlikely to change or be seriously challenged in the near future. Here are seven longevity tech stocks extending investment horizons.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe good news keeps on coming for Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). The latest tailwind for the stock is that it’s being added to the Nasdaq 100 index, replacing\r\npharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). SMCI stock will officially start trading on the Nasdaq 100 July 22. The Nasdaq 100 is comprised of the 100 largest non-financial companies in the broader Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nSuper Micro Computer’s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 should give its stock a boost as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the index will now be required to buy its shares. Super Micro Computer makes servers that run AI microchips and processors and its products are in high demand worldwide. SMCI stock has more than tripled so far in 2024. Earlier this year, the company’s stock was added to the benchmark S&P 500 index where it remains the top performing security.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) A chart of the MicroStrategy (MSTR) logo with a Bitcoin\n\nSource: JOCA_PH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of winning tech stocks, how about software firm turned Bitcoin (BTC-USD) powerhouse MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR)? The company’s stock has performed nearly as well this year as Super Micro Computer. Since January, MSTR stock has gained 141%, driving its share price up to $1,654.18 and leading the company to announce a 10-for-1 stock split that goes into effect on August 8.\n\nWhile technically a provider of enterprise software, MicroStrategy has switched its focus in recent years and adopted an aggressive Bitcoin-buying strategy. Michael Saylor, the company’s executive chairman, has said that MicroStrategy is now primarily focused on Bitcoin development and blockchain technologies. At the end of June this year, MicroStrategy owned 226,331 Bitcoin worth $14.59 billion based on the current price of the largest cryptocurrency.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at Wall Street firm Bernstein recently said that MicroStrategy is “building the world’s largest Bitcoin company” and that the stock has a further 80% upside.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nGoogle parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is well-known as a leader in AI. However, Alphabet is still a diversified technology company that has its tentacles in many other areas of technology, from smartphones to cybersecurity. The company’s role in cybersecurity looks likely to expand with the expected acquisition of Wiz, a privately held firm that specializes in cybersecurity for cloud computing.\n\nMultiple media reports say Alphabet is planning to spend $23 billion to purchase Wiz, in what would be its biggest acquisition ever. Wiz was founded in 2020 and had been planning an initial public offering (IPO) later this year. However, it now looks as though Wiz will be content to sell itself to Alphabet instead. The purchase comes as Alphabet makes growing its cybersecurity offerings a key priority.\n\nIn 2022, Alphabet acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion. Alphabet’s stock has risen 33% so far this year and the consensus rating among 38 analysts who cover the company is that the shares are a “strong buy.”\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of “strong buy” ratings, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) also holds one, along with a median price target that is 17% above where the stock currently trades. Investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently named Dell a “top pick” and said the company’s share price could rise as much as 40% over the next 12 months. At the start of July, Dell stock was added to Bank of America’s (NYSE:BAC) coveted “U.S. 1 List” of top investment ideas.\n\nThe bullish sentiment is due to the opportunity Dell has in front of it with AI, notably the servers that run AI applications and models. That business is expected to accelerate and become more profitable in coming quarters. At the same time, Dell’s core personal computer (PC) business is expected to outperform in coming quarters as a global refresh leads to accelerating PC sales this year and throughout 2025.\n\nDELL stock has increased 80% so far this year, with more gains likely, according to analysts.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo on an Apple store in Santa Monica, California.\n\nSource: View Apart / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs far as bullish sentiment goes, few stocks have experienced as big a turnaround in recent weeks as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). At the start of the year, Apple couldn’t do anything right. The media was awash with headlines about slumping iPhone sales, rising competition in China, and a new augmented reality headset that, at more than $3,000, was too expensive for most consumers. But ever since Apple unveiled its AI strategy in June, its been blue skies for the company’s stock.\n\nAAPL stock has risen 40% from a 52-week low reached in April. The shares are now up 25% on the year and trading near an all-time high on a split adjusted basis. The rebound comes after Apple announced plans to add advanced AI technology to future versions of the iPhone. Analysts say the addition of AI should spur global sales of the smartphone in coming years.\n\nAdditionally, Apple has just expanded sales of its Vision Pro augmented reality headset, rolling it out in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and U.K. Suddenly, Apple stock looks unstoppable once again.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nAs mentioned with Alphabet, cybersecurity remains a hot corner of technology right now. And among cybersecurity stocks, CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is the king. Over the past 12 months, CRWD stock has increased 143%, including a 50% gain so far this year. Analysts and investors stood up and cheered after the company’s last financial results, which beat Wall Street estimates across the board.\n\nCrowdStrike reported EPS of 93 cents, which was above the 89 cents expected among analysts. Revenue for the year’s first three months totaled $921 million, up 34% from a year earlier and ahead of estimates calling for $905 million in sales. CrowdStrike’s free cash flow stood at $322.5 million at quarter’s end, up 42% from a year ago. If there’s a knock on CRWD stock it is the valuation.\n\nShares currently trade at nearly 700x future earnings estimates. While pricey, many analysts continue to see CrowdStrike as the de facto leader among cybersecurity stocks.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nWe’ll end with a dark horse candidate: design software company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). The company behind products such as Photoshop, Illustrator and the PDF has seen its share price driven 3% lower this year over concerns that AI is going to effectively put it out of business. However, reports of Adobe’s demise appear to have been greatly exaggerated based on the company’s most recent quarterly print.\n\nADBE stock rose 17% after the company reported financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts and raised its full-year guidance. Adobe announced Q1 EPS of $4.48 compared to $4.39 that was expected among analysts. Revenue came in at $5.31 billion versus $5.29 billion that had been estimated. Sales rose 10% from a year earlier. Rather than be replaced by AI, management said on an earnings call that they are using the technology to their advantage.\n\nSpecifically, Adobe is adding AI across its suite of creative products, including Firefly and Illustrator, and charging a premium for it.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in GOOGL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years. He spent five years as a staff reporter at The Wall Street Journal, and has also written for The Washington Post and Toronto Star newspapers, as well as financial websites such as The Motley Fool and Investopedia.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "title": "Forget Apple: These Unstoppable Stocks Are Better Buys",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is once again the world's largest company (as measured by market cap) right now. It's also one of the most profitable (as measured by total profits generated).  But that wasn't always the case. It earned its way to these accolades with sustained growth largely set in motion by 2007's debut of the iPhone.\n\nHowever, investors know that past performance is no guarantee of future results. What got Apple to where it is today doesn't seem to be working quite as well lately. Sales of its top products have been stagnant for a couple of years, in fact. While the stock's been soaring since May 1 (up 38%), it's currently sitting just 6% above analysts' consensus price target. Weakness may well be on the horizon. That has some investors considering other options.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a new pick, there are three better options than Apple to consider.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nThere's no sense in not beginning with the market's most fruitful stock pick of this century so far. That's Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), of course. Shares of the e-commerce giant are up an amazing 257,000% since the company's 1997 initial public offering, soaring in step with the expansion of the then-nascent internet.\n\nThe company's fastest growth and the stock's fastest gains are likely in the past, of course, as the e-commerce market is mature even if it's not yet at its peak potential But there's still plenty of growth in store given Amazon's more nascent business lines.\n\nOne of these young ventures is cloud computing. Although Amazon Web Services only accounts for about 16% of the company's revenue, this revenue grew 13% year over year in 2023. Given that cloud computing services already drive roughly two-thirds of the company's operating income, even merely modest growth on this front could remain impactful. That's what makes Mordor Intelligence's outlook for the global cloud computing market so compelling for Amazon shareholders. The research outfit expects an annualized growth rate of 16% through 2029.\n\nThe company's e-commerce platform is also evolving. Although it still generates revenue and earnings on every item sold at Amazon.com, it's generating much more higher-margin revenue as an advertising platform. Sellers paid a total of nearly $47 billion last year to more prominently feature their products at the well-trafficked website, monetizing it in a way that wasn't even an afterthought just a few years back.\n\nAgain, neither Amazon nor Amazon stock will repeat the feat achieved during the first 30 years of the company's existence. The next 30 years, however, could still be pretty darn rewarding.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Broadcom\n\nYou've almost certainly heard of the company. You may not know, however, a single thing Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) manufactures. That's because nearly everything it makes is found on the inside of the electronics you regularly rely on. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, fiber-optic connection components, data-storage device boards, and a wide range of automation software are just a sampling of its offerings. Without Broadcom's tech, the world would look considerably different.\n\nMore important to interested investors, the need for Broadcom's technologies isn't going away anytime soon, if ever. Consumers and corporations alike are far too reliant on mobile phones, wireless networking, data centers (for artificial intelligence), and cybersecurity -- all markets that Broadcom serves -- to simply cease using them now.\n\nAlso know that Broadcom's technology remains well protected by patents. It holds more than 45,000 of them, with roughly one-third of them in active use right now, according to Insights by GreyB. Just late last year the company successfully enforced a key patent against streaming powerhouse Netflix.\n\n3. Coca-Cola\n\nFinally, add Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) to your list of unstoppable stocks to buy instead of Apple.\n\nIt's obviously a very different outfit than either Amazon or Broadcom. It operates a slow-growth, cash-driving business that generates tons of reliable cash. Indeed, the beverage behemoth hasn't just been able to pay a dividend like clockwork for decades now. It's raised its annual payment every year for the past 62 years; the most recent increase was a 5.4% improvement, extending a long streak of inflation-beating payout growth. Coke shares are also up a hefty 26,400% for that time frame, bolstering the gains stemming from its reliable dividend payments.\n\nIt's a tough act to follow to be sure. In fact, the next 62 years aren't apt to be nearly as fruitful for shareholders as the past 62 have been. There's just too much competition in the well-developed and highly competitive beverage business these days.\n\nThat doesn't mean the next six decades, however, still can't be amazingly rewarding.\n\nSee, while Coca-Cola's business isn't complicated, the company handles the most crucial aspects of it brilliantly. That's marketing, mostly. It's been able to use lifestyle-oriented advertising to create brand names and product logos that consumers readily recognize. Purchasing its products has become a habit for many of its customers.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that operating in the consumer staples space makes it easier for the company to continue selling goods to a crowd that might occasionally rethink purchases of more cyclical products and services like automobiles, vacations, or home improvements.

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – July 18, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Lowe's Companies, Inc. LOW, Shopify Inc. SHOP, MIND Technology, Inc. MIND and Moving iMage Technologies, Inc. MITQ.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Research Report for Apple, Lowe's and Shopify\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., Lowe's Companies, Inc. and Shopify Inc., as well as two micro-cap stocks MIND Technology, Inc. and Moving iMage Technologies, Inc.The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of Apple have gained +18.2% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry’s gain of +22.0%. The company’s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\r\n\r\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Apple is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. Apple’s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nLowe’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry over the year-to-date period (+8.6% vs. +6.8%). The company has implemented a comprehensive Pro-focused strategy, emphasizing improved product availability, timely delivery, and an expanded assortment, complemented by a rewards program.\r\n\r\nStrategic growth initiatives such as store expansion and enhanced customer experiences aim to position the company as a top omnichannel retailer. Investments in service offerings, operational efficiency, and long-term drivers like sustained home improvement demand support growth and profitability.\r\n\r\nHowever, market risks, intense competition, and a decline in DIY spending present challenges for the stock. Anticipated softness in comparable sales, margin pressure, and financial strain due to high debt may hinder performance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Lowe’s here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Shopify have underperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the past year (-1.7% vs. +44.2%). The company is witnessing raging inflation and cautious consumer spending are headwinds.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Shopify is benefiting from strong growth in its merchant base. New merchant-friendly tools like Bill Pay, Tax Platform, Collective and the Marketplace Connect app are helping it to win new merchants regularly. Strong adoption of these solutions holds promise for Shopify’s prospects.\r\n\r\nIntegration of Shop Pay Installments into the point-of-sale terminal and general availability of Pro makes it easier for merchants to discover and engage their customers. Expansion of back-office merchant solutions to more countries is also strengthening Shopify’s international footprint. An expanding partner base that includes TikTok, Snap, Pinterest, Criteo, IBM, Cognizant, Amazon and Adyen is expected to expand its merchant base further.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Shopify here >>>)\r\n\r\nMIND Technology’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Technology Services industry over the past year (-28.4% vs. +43.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $6.55 million faces challenges such as a 8.7% revenue decline in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, fluctuating backlog levels and increased capital requirement. Intense competition from established players poses significant risks.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, MIND Technology’s robust order pipeline and technological innovation are highlighted by a SeaLink seismic streamer system order from ATLAS ELEKTRONIK, indicating strong demand and potential long-term partnerships. The increasing focus on renewable projects, particularly offshore wind, positions MIND Technology as a critical supplier.\r\n\r\nStrong client relationships and the potential for repeat business underscore long-term growth stability. MIND is well-positioned in the marine seismic equipment market, with a global presence that mitigates regional risks and taps into international opportunities.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on MIND Technology here >>>)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "TSMC (TSM)\n\nShares in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. were higher in pre-market trading after the semiconductor company reported a 36% rise in second-quarter profit amid surging demand for advanced chips.\n\nTSMC posted a net profit of T$247.85bn (£5.84bn/$7.6bn) after the company disclosed its second-quarter sales grew at the fastest pace since 2022. Second-quarter revenue jumped 40% to T673.51bn.\n\nTSMC is the world’s largest and most advanced chipmaker. It manufactures chips for major American firms such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nRead more: Nvidia, ASML, and TSMC stocks got hammered — here's why\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThird-quarter revenue is expected to be between $22.4bn and $23.2bn, said CFO, Wendell Huang, in a post-earnings call. Huang said TSMC's annual capital expenditure is now expected to be between $30bn and $32bn, with the lower end of the range up slightly from prior estimates of $28bn.\n\nShares of the world’s largest maker of advanced chips have more than doubled since the AI boom took off in late 2022.\n\nNetflix (NFLX)\n\nShares in the streaming giant were 0.3% higher in pre-market trading as Netflix is set to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday after the US market close.\n\nAnalysts expect NFLX to deliver quarterly earnings of $4.70 per share, reflecting a 42.9% improvement on the same quarter the previous year. Revenues of $9.53bn would mark a 16.4% jump versus the year-ago period, according to Zachs Investment Research.\n\n\"For NFLX shares, much is priced in, but we remain bullish given the still large opportunity for growth ahead,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne wrote in a note ahead of the report.\n\nRead more: Stocks to watch this week: Anglo American, Burberry, TSMC and Netflix\n\nAt a recent $650, shares of the streaming company are up by a third this year.\n\n“Netflix has managed to establish a virtually insurmountable lead in the streaming wars,” wrote Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese, as she reiterated her Outperform rating last week.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the stock's recent run-up has led to some apprehension on Wall Street. \"We are cautious heading into the firm’s Q2 2024 release,\" Citi analyst, Jason Bazinet, wrote. \"We maintain our Neutral rating and $660 target price.\"\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nAnglo American was higher as it held its copper and iron ore guidance, despite a challenging market for diamonds due to subdued Chinese demand.\n\nThe diversified mining major backed its guidance for key metals copper and iron ore, but cut its coal-production target after a fire suspended output at a major mine.\n\nIt announced Thursday that it dug out 6% less copper in the second quarter, with 196,000 metric tons versus 209,000 tons in the same period a year before. This was due to an 8% decrease in Chile's production, while iron ore was flat at 15.6 million tonnes.\n\nPlatinum group metals production was down 2% to 921,000 ounces.\n\nRead more: UK wage growth slows amid interest rate cut hopes\n\nSteelmaking coal production is now expected to be in the range of 14 million - 15.5 million tonnes, down from previous guidance of 15 million - 17 million tonnes after the fire at Grosvenor sparked by coal gas saw operations suspended.\n\nIt expects headline earnings to fall between 15% and 25% in the first half, compared with the same period last year when it booked 7.86bn South African rand (£332m/$432.3m). The fall is due to lower prices for platinum metals, mainly palladium and rhodium, which fell 34% and 49%, respectively.\n\nAnglo American warned that its De Beers diamond division will cut production further as the luxury market braces itself for a protracted depression amid a downturn in high-end spending by Chinese consumers.\n\nPremier Foods (PFD.L)\n\nPremier Foods posted a jump in first-quarter sales on Thursday, boosted by strong demand overseas for Mr Kipling cakes.\n\nThe FTSE 250 food group, which makes branded and non-branded groceries, cakes and sweet treats, said sales in the 13 weeks to 29 June rose 5.3% to £239.3m, compared to the same quarter the previous year, while branded sales were up 7.3%.\n\nThe company has seen continued growth and demand for its grocery business with more shoppers buying its brands.\n\nInternational sales rose 24% as Mr Kipling was rolled out across 800 stores in Canada and The Spice Tailor meal kits launched in Germany.\n\n\"We expect to see more volume-led branded sales growth in the coming quarters,\" said CEO Alex Whitehouse.\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect trading profit for the year of £183m, according to Reuters.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Bull of the Day: Spotify Technology S.A. (SPOT)",
        "content": "Spotify Technology S.A. (SPOT) changed the music industry forever. Spotify has remained the streaming music powerhouse despite competition from Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet, closing last quarter with 615 million monthly active users, up 19% YoY.\n\nSpotify’s newfound commitment to efficiency and profits, mixed with a string of price hikes are leading to soaring earnings growth. SPOT is also set to double its revenue between 2020 and 2025.\n\nSpotify shares have soared roughly 300% off their 2022 lows. Yet, the recent big-tech pullback has Spotify trading 20% below its all-time highs, with enticing valuation levels.\n\nSpotify’s Bullish Basics\n\nSpotify kickstarted the paid streaming music industry in 2008. The firm was the vanguard of paid streaming, reshaping the music industry as much as Netflix forever altered TV and movies. Spotify is thriving despite streaming music competition from Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), as users flock to the service for music, podcasts, and more recently, audiobooks.\n\nSPOT nearly doubled its revenue between 2019 and 2023. Spotify grew its monthly active users by 19% YoY in the first quarter of 2024 to 615 million across 184 markets, expanding its paid Premium Subscribers by 14% to 239 million. Spotify grew its Premium Subscribers by 84% between Q1 FY20 and Q1 FY24, while monthly active users surged 115%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSpotify in the summer of 2023 raised its monthly prices for its ad-free Premium plans to match competitors such as Apple and Amazon. The streaming music firm announced in June 2024 another price hike to help keep up with inflation and boost profits. Spotify raised the price for its individual Premium subscriptions by a dollar to $11.99 a month, while Duo plans climbed by $2 to $16.99 a month. Meanwhile, family plans were hiked by $3 to $19.99 a month.\n\nSpotify is focused on efficiency, having trimmed its workforce among other efforts. The company boosted its ad-supported gross margin to 6% last quarter vs. -3% in the year-ago period, as revenue growth outpaced rising content costs. Premium gross margin climbed to 30% vs. 29%, primarily driven by sales growth outpacing music royalty costs.\n\nLooking ahead, some Wall Street analysts project Spotify will grow its total user base by almost 50% by 2028 to 900 million. Spotify’s user growth expansion is key to helping it continue to negotiate favorable rights deals with artists. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth Outlook\n\nSpotify grew its revenue by 21% last quarter and swung from an adjusted loss of -$1.24 a share to +$1.05, crushing our bottom line estimate. The company is now firmly committed to profits amid the new interest rate environment, alongside the likes of Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nSPOT’s adjusted earnings outlook has skyrocketed over the past 12 months, up 723% for FY24 and 215% for FY25. The streaming music firm’s upbeat EPS outlook helps it land its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Spotify’s most accurate/recent EPS estimates came in slightly below consensus, but SPOT stock's recent pullback will help account for that. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nZacks estimates call for SPOT to grow its sales by 18% in 2024 and another 15% next year to soar from around $14 billion in FY23 to nearly $20 billion next year—doubling revenue between FY20 and FY25.\n\nSpotify is projected to swing from an adjusted loss of -$2.95 a share last year to +$5.02 per share in 2024 and then surge another 44% next year. The earnings expansion is driving the stock, with Wall Street convinced that Spotify has reached an inflection point on profits.\n\nPerformance, Technical Levels, and Valuation\n\nSpotify stock has climbed around 100% since its 2018 IPO, lagging the Zacks Tech sector’s 190% run. But Spotify shares have soared roughly 300% off their 2022 lows (around the stock market’s 2022 bottom), including a 55% YTD climb, blowing away Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet during those stretches.\n\nSPOT has faced some selling pressure recently, alongside plenty of other first-half big tech winners. Spotify is down around 11% from its early June highs, putting it 20% off its 2021 peaks. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSpotify is trading below its 21-day and 50-day moving averages and at some of its most oversold RSI levels over the last five years. Any pullback to SPOT’s 200-day moving average (around $240 per share) would mark a screaming buy opportunity.\n\nSpotify is trading at 48.1X forward 12-month earnings, which is hardly cheap. But it has traded as high as 175X earnings over the last year. SPOT’s PEG ratio, which factors in its long-term EPS growth outlook, comes in at 0.6, offering a 67% discount to the Tech sector.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSpotify’s recent downturn could set up SPOT stock for a potential break out in the coming weeks, especially if it impresses Wall Street with strong guidance on Tuesday, July 23.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Morgan Stanley analysts are setting a bullish tone for the upcoming earnings season, with specific companies expected to outperform. According to the analysts, investors should watch Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) closely, as these companies are anticipated to deliver strong results.\n\nAmazon is highlighted with a \"Positive\" near-term view. Morgan Stanley expects Amazon to deliver a significant EBIT beat in Q2 and guide positively for Q3.\n\n\"We are 17% above Street EBIT\" for Q2 and 10% above for Q3, the analysts noted, driven by North America Retail profitability and accelerating growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nApple also holds a \"Positive\" near-term outlook. For the first time in over a year, Morgan Stanley sees a favorable setup, expecting Apple to post better-than-expected results.\n\n\"Street estimates are 4-5% too low for the September quarter,\" the analysts stated. They forecast Apple will achieve $96.9 billion in revenue for the September quarter, which is 4% above the consensus. Driving this optimism are strong iPhone builds, improvements in the Mac outlook, and robust growth in Services.\n\nEli Lilly is another key player with a positive outlook. Morgan Stanley anticipates that upcoming data from the Phase 3 SUMMIT trial of Tirzepatide/Zepbound in patients with obesity and heart failure will be a catalyst for the stock. The data, expected in Q3, could demonstrate significant benefits beyond weight loss, potentially broadening Medicare coverage and strengthening Tirzepatide's competitive profile.\n\nThe analysts noted, \"We would expect positive data from SUMMIT (a statistically significant benefit on CV outcomes) to move LLY shares up ~2-3%.\"\n\nOverall, Morgan Stanley's analysts are keen to see how companies manage margins in a challenging pricing environment and whether high expectations for the second half of 2024 will hold.\n\nThey also highlighted that earnings revisions for the S&P 500 have been less negative than average heading into the reporting season, suggesting cautious optimism for the broader market.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAmazon, Apple, Eli Lilly: Here's Morgan Stanley's earnings playbook\n\nAbbott posts Q2 earnings beat, lifts full-year outlook\n\nCiti sees further S&P 500 upside during 2H24\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Goldman Sachs analysts anticipate Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will surpass earnings expectations for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nThey project Apple will report revenue of $85.1 billion, a 4% year-over-year increase, and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.36, compared to the FactSet consensus of $1.33.\n\nGoldman Sachs expects iPhone revenue to decline by 5% year-over-year to $37.8 billion, driven by price discounting efforts to maintain clean channel inventories.\n\nHowever, the investment bank believes the decline in iPhone revenue will be offset by double-digit growth in other segments.\n\nThe analysts forecast iPad revenue will rise by 23% year-over-year due to new iPad models launched in May, including the iPad Air with M2 and iPad Pro with M4. Mac revenue is expected to increase by 13% year-over-year, thanks to recent launches like the MacBook Air 13” and 15” with M3.\n\nThe Services segment is predicted to grow by 15% year-over-year, driven by price increases and strong App Store spending, which is up 13% according to Sensor Tower.\n\nMeanwhile, the Wearables, Home, and Accessories category is expected to see a modest 2% year-over-year decline, although accessories tied to new iPad and MacBook launches should provide some support.\n\nLooking ahead, Goldman Sachs sees a path for Apple path to achieve $9-$10 EPS in fiscal 2026/27, driven by increased iPhone shipments, new product innovations, and a shift towards premium iPhone models.\n\nThey forecast iPhone shipments to reach 230 million in fiscal 2024, 240 million in fiscal 2025, and 256 million in fiscal 2026.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, Goldman Sachs projects EPS of $1.55 and revenue of $93.6 billion, aligning with the Visible Alpha consensus.\n\nThey expect Apple to guide for mid-single-digit year-over-year revenue growth, with declines in iPhone revenue offset by growth in iPad, Mac, and Wearables, along with continued strong growth in Services.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoldman Sachs expects Apple to post an earnings beat\n\nAvoid this group of chip stocks as the US election approaches: Citi\n\nUS mine development timeline second-longest in world, S&P Global says\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s earnings beat lofty analysts’ estimates on growing AI investments around the world.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCanada’s Immigration Minister Has a Message for Foreign Students: You Can’t All Stay US Floats Tougher Trade Rules to Rein In China Chip Industry High-Flying Chipmakers See Worst Plunge Since 2020: Markets Wrap Brookfield Lines Up a 36-Year-Old Rising Star as Next Billionaire CEO Biden Tests Positive for Covid-19, Scraps Las Vegas Event\n\nMarket expectations had risen in the weeks leading up to TSMC’s report on Thursday, with the AI frenzy and related investment showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe chipmaker for Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. said net income rose to NT$247.8 billion ($7.6 billion). The average estimate was for a 29% increase, and many expected TSMC to hike its full-year outlook after sales jumped in the June period. The company said last week that its second-quarter sales grew at the fastest pace since 2022.\n\nClick here for a live blog on the numbers.\n\nShares of the world’s largest maker of advanced chips have more than doubled since the AI boom took off in late 2022, and hit a series of all-time highs as the firm’s market capitalization briefly crossed the $1 trillion mark.\n\nInsatiable demand for Nvidia chips has propped up TSMC’s performance, while the wider smartphone market is on a path to recovery. Apple has seen handset sales stabilize, and provided an upbeat guidance to its suppliers on shipments for the upcoming iPhone 16 based on the potential strength of its new AI tools.\n\nRead: Apple Aims to Ship 10% More New iPhones Following Bumpy 2023\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nASML’s 23.7% jump in order bookings in 2Q suggests TSMC’s N2 development is proceeding healthily, potentially accelerating capacity buildup. TSMC is scheduled to start mass production in 2H25, starting with an approximate 30,000-wafer monthly capacity in Hsinchu, Taiwan. Its N2 process will be priced at least 15% higher than N3, we believe.\n\n— Charles Shum, BI analyst\n\nStill, investor euphoria over TSMC’s prospects diminished Wednesday after Bloomberg Businessweek published comments by US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who said he’s at best lukewarm about defending Taiwan in the event of Chinese aggression.\n\nOn top of that, the US is also mulling stricter chip curbs on China, Bloomberg News reported, triggering a global tech stock selloff as investors pondered the fallout for the world’s largest semiconductor arena.\n\nAnd caution about AI is now emerging in corners of the market. This month, Goldman Sachs warned that the biggest US tech firms may be spending too much on AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nSemiAnalysis’s Chaolien Tseng warned that TSMC’s stock may take a hit if expectations for the chipmaker to lift its 2024 revenue growth to at least 25% fail to materialize. In the last earnings call, TSMC Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei reiterated the company’s estimate for full-year revenue to record a growth rate of low- to mid-20% in US dollar terms.\n\nIn the immediate term, the AI infrastructure buildout that’s driving chip sales is boosting expectations for TSMC to increase its capital expenditure. Its capex guidance for this year is $28 billion to $32 billion, with analysts estimating $29.5 billion.\n\nRead: TSMC’s $420 Billion Stock Rally Rests on More Valuation Upgrades\n\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov, Cindy Wang and Mayumi Negishi.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek’s Donald Trump Interview Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail How Trader Joe’s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit Interviewing Trump on His Plans for the US Economy What Americans Invest In Now\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tech rebound, Netflix, TSMC, ECB decision - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Wall Street looks set to rebound Thursday after the tech sector's battering during the previous session. TSMC has reported strong results, while Netflix is due to release its latest numbers after the close. The European Central Bank is expected to stand pat at its latest policy-setting meeting.\n\n1. Futures rebound after tech battering\n\nU.S. stock futures traded largely higher Thursday, rebounding after the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite’s worst session since 2022 as investors grow wary of the elevated valuations of the big tech stocks.\n\nBy 04:30 ET (08:30 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 20 points, or 0.1%, lower, while S&P 500 futures climbed 12 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 90 points, or 0.5%.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite slumped 2.8% on Wednesday, its worst day since December 2022, while the S&P 500 dropped 1.4%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, gained 0.6%, closing above 41,000 for the first time ever.\n\nAll eyes will remain on the tech sector, although the strong results from TSMC [see below] could generate some confidence.\n\nThere are more earnings to digest Wednesday, including from Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) and Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) before the open, while streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is expected to post results after the close (see below).\n\nOn the economic front, jobless claims for the week ending July 13 are due later in the session, as investors look for clues about the health of the country’s labor market with the Federal Reserve seeking more guidance before cutting interest rates.\n\n2. TSMC posts strong rise in Q2 net profit\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) may face choppy waters ahead, but there’s no doubt the Taiwanese chipmaker is thriving at the moment.\n\nThe world’s largest contract chipmaker posted a hefty 36% rise in second-quarter net profit earlier Thursday, riding the surge in demand for semiconductors used in artificial intelligence applications.\n\nTSMC posted a net profit of T$247.85 billion ($7.6 billion), compared with Reuters expectations for a profit of T$236.1 billion.\n\nIt is the world’s main producer of advanced chips found in everything from smartphones to AI applications, counting companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) among its clientele.\n\nThe surge in AI demand over the past year, as a slew of tech giants raced to roll out their own offerings after the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has resulted in the firm’s American Depository Receipts reaching a total market capitalization of over $1 trillion.\n\nThe firm is considered as a bellwether for the global chipmaking industry, given that it has the highest capacity for producing advanced chips in the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, TSMC stock slumped on Wednesday on heightened geopolitical tensions, after Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump said Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense supplies, putting the spotlight on the island’s most important company.\n\nOn top of this, reports emerged that the Biden administration was considering more export curbs on China, particularly in chipmaking technology, which could herald lower sales in China, which is a major consumer of chips.\n\n3. Netflix net adds set to contract\n\nNetflix releases its latest results after the close Thursday, with the streaming giant having already guided for lower net subscriber additions in the second quarter than in the first three months of the year.\n\nLSEG forecasts that the company will have added an estimated 4.82 million subscribers in the second quarter, which would be the lowest additions since the first quarter of 2023 and about half the 9.3 million it added in the previous three months.\n\nThis dropoff follows sharp gains in the wake of a crackdown on password sharing and as viewer attention moved to summer sporting events including the European Championships soccer tournament.\n\nThe company added an estimated 4.82 million subscribers in the second quarter, according to LSEG data. That would be the lowest additions since the first quarter of 2023 and about half the 9.3 million it added in the previous three months.\n\nThat said, JPMorgan believes Netflix may spring a few upside surprises, supported by an impressive content slate, price hikes and ongoing benefits from efforts to crackdown on password sharing.\n\n\"We remain positive on Netflix shares heading into 2Q earnings, analysts at JPMorgan said, in a note published last week, “while also recognizing high expectations.\"\n\nIndustry data suggests rising demand, JPMorgan said, citing Sensor Tower’s data showing global download and daily active user trends improved in 2Q.\n\n4. ECB set to hold rates steady\n\nThe European Central Bank holds its latest policy-setting meeting later in the session, and is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged having lowered rates from record highs last month.\n\nThe focus, thus, is likely to be on ECB President Christine Lagarde’s accompanying press conference, with investors looking for clues over the future path of interest rates.\n\nLagarde will likely attempt to strike a balance, acknowledging that regional growth is weak, but domestic inflation and wage growth remains stubbornly high.\n\nMarkets are pricing in almost two rate cuts over the rest of the year, with the next move lower widely expected to be in September.\n\n“The ECB will keep rates on hold in July,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley, in a note. “From its perspective, more data is needed to confirm the assumed (and projected) timely return of inflation to target.”\n\n5. Warner Bros Discovery to split up?\n\nWarner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) has discussed a plan to split its digital streaming and studio businesses from its legacy TV networks, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, as it looks to generate greater value for its shareholders.\n\nThe report said that CEO David Zaslav is examining several strategic options for the media and entertainment conglomerate, ranging from selling assets to separating its Warner Bros movie studio and Max streaming service into a new company.\n\nWarner Bros' stock has fallen nearly 27% so far this year, and nearly 70% since the merger between Discovery and AT&T (NYSE:T) spin-off Warner Media in 2022.\n\nIn May, the company reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss due to slumping advertising sales at its cable TV unit and as the studio segment contended with the fallout of last year's Hollywood strikes.\n\n\"While several financial assumptions behind the combination of Warner Media and Discovery have not materialized, we still believe several of WBD's assets are best in class with tremendous unrecognized value,\" analysts at Bank of America said, in a note earlier this week.\n\nThe company could create more value for its shareholders if it explored strategic options, including a potential sale, the bank added.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech rebound, Netflix, TSMC, ECB decision - what's moving markets\n\nBOJ wants to maintain accommodative monetary environment, Jiji reports\n\nIndia's Modi to focus on jobs, incomes in first budget after election setback\n\nView comments",

When Elizabeth finds herself fired from her lab, she accepts a job as a host on a TV cooking show, and sets out to teach a nation of overlooked housewives — and the men who are suddenly listening — a lot more than recipes.\n\n\"Loot\"\n\n\"Loot\" season two returns a year after Molly Wells (Maya Rudolph) settles her very public divorce from tech billionaire John Novak (Adam Scott), and we find her thriving in her role as the head of her philanthropic organization, the Wells Foundation. Focused mainly on her charity work, Molly has sworn off any new relationships with men and embarks on a wellness journey. Fabulously single but not particularly independent, Molly keeps her trusty assistant Nicholas (Joel Kim Booster) by her side. He diligently caters to her every whim … and occasionally feeds her a kale smoothie spiked with gin.\n\n\"The Morning Show\"\n\n\"The Morning Show\" explores the cutthroat world of morning news and the lives of the people who help America wake up in the morning.

As Maxine attempts to cross that impermeable line between the haves and the have-nots, \"Palm Royale\" asks the same question that still baffles us today: \"How much of yourself are you willing to sacrifice to get what someone else has?\" Set during the powder keg year of 1969, \"Palm Royale\" is a testament to every outsider fighting for their chance to truly belong.\n\n\"The Reluctant Traveler With Eugene Levy\"\n\nAfter confronting some of his long-held fears in season one, Emmy Award winner Eugene Levy steps out of his comfort zone once again. This time, he's embarking on a must-do journey for any respectable globetrotter — a grand tour of Europe. The seven-part second season of the acclaimed country-hopping travel series follows Levy as he makes his way from the very north of the continent to the very south. Along the way, he unearths stunning hidden local gems, discovers his family tree and attempts to broaden his taste buds while experiencing the region’s most unique destinations along the way. Join him as he goes on the trip of a lifetime he never knew he needed.\n\n\"Slow Horses\"\n\nThis darkly funny espionage drama follows a team of British intelligence agents who serve in a dumping ground department of MI5 due to their career-ending mistakes. Led by their brilliant but irascible leader, the notorious Jackson Lamb (Academy Award winner Gary Oldman), they navigate the espionage world’s smoke and mirrors to defend England from sinister forces.\n\n\"STEVE!

        "content": "Wednesday, July 17, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) and Shopify Inc. (SHOP), as well as two micro-cap stocks MIND Technology, Inc. (MIND) and Moving iMage Technologies, Inc. (MITQ).  The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of Apple have gained +18.2% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry’s gain of +22.0%. The company’s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%. \r\n\r\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve. \r\n\r\nMoreover, Apple is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. Apple’s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nLowe’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry over the year-to-date period (+8.6% vs. +6.8%). The company has implemented a comprehensive Pro-focused strategy, emphasizing improved product availability, timely delivery, and an expanded assortment, complemented by a rewards program. \r\n\r\nStrategic growth initiatives such as store expansion and enhanced customer experiences aim to position the company as a top omnichannel retailer. Investments in service offerings, operational efficiency, and long-term drivers like sustained home improvement demand support growth and profitability. \r\n\r\nHowever, market risks, intense competition, and a decline in DIY spending present challenges for the stock. Anticipated softness in comparable sales, margin pressure, and financial strain due to high debt may hinder performance. \r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Lowe’s here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Shopify have underperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the past year (-1.7% vs. +44.2%). The company is witnessing raging inflation and cautious consumer spending are headwinds.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Shopify is benefiting from strong growth in its merchant base. New merchant-friendly tools like Bill Pay, Tax Platform, Collective and the Marketplace Connect app are helping it to win new merchants regularly. Strong adoption of these solutions holds promise for Shopify’s prospects. \r\n\r\nIntegration of Shop Pay Installments into the point-of-sale terminal and general availability of Pro makes it easier for merchants to discover and engage their customers. Expansion of back-office merchant solutions to more countries is also strengthening Shopify’s international footprint. An expanding partner base that includes TikTok, Snap, Pinterest, Criteo, IBM, Cognizant, Amazon and Adyen is expected to expand its merchant base further.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Shopify here >>>)\r\n\r\nMIND Technology’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Technology Services industry over the past year (-28.4% vs. +43.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $6.55 million faces challenges such as a 8.7% revenue decline in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, fluctuating backlog levels and increased capital requirement. Intense competition from established players poses significant risks.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, MIND Technology’s robust order pipeline and technological innovation are highlighted by a SeaLink seismic streamer system order from ATLAS ELEKTRONIK, indicating strong demand and potential long-term partnerships. The increasing focus on renewable projects, particularly offshore wind, positions MIND Technology as a critical supplier.\r\n\r\nStrong client relationships and the potential for repeat business underscore long-term growth stability. MIND is well-positioned in the marine seismic equipment market, with a global presence that mitigates regional risks and taps into international opportunities.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on MIND Technology here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Moving iMage Technologies have underperformed the Zacks Technology Services industry over the past year (-35.6% vs. +43.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $7.45 million is witnessing a supply chain disruption, competition from OTT platforms and regulatory compliance costs pose risks.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Moving Image Technologies' new share repurchase program, effective until Jun 30, 2024, signals confidence in financial stability and growth. This follows a previous program where 6.3% of shares were repurchased. MiT's significant contract win with Alamo Drafthouse Cinema and expansion into high-margin SaaS and subscription-based products like MiTranslator and CineQC promise higher margins and recurring revenues. \r\n\r\nDiversifying into live entertainment and esports markets mitigates cinema industry cyclicality. Operating in a growing market, MiT is well-positioned to capitalize on technological advancements and increased demand for high-quality cinema experiences. Financial stability, as evidenced by $5.9 million in cash, supports growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Moving iMage Technologies here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include GSK plc (GSK), L3Harris Technologies, Inc.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Wednesday, steadying after a rout in chipmaking stocks, on concerns over more trade disruptions, sparked steep losses on Wall Street.\n\nGrowing bets on early interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve also spurred a broader pivot away from technology stocks and into more growth-sensitive sectors. This saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average surge to record highs even as its Wall Street peers lagged.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.2% to 5,652.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 20,067.0 points by 20:43 ET (00:43 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 41,589.0 points.\n\nChip stocks rise after China fears, Trump comments spur steep losses\n\nHeavyweight technology and chipmaking stocks rose in aftermarket trade after clocking outsized losses during the session.\n\nHeavyweights such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) rose 1% after a 6.6% slide, while TSMC (NYSE:TSM) rose 2.4% after a nearly 8% tumble. Majors such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also steadied after falling during the session.\n\nReports that the Biden administration was considering more export curbs on China, particularly in chipmaking technology, battered the sector, given that it could herald lower sales in China, which is a major consumer of chips.\n\nConcerns over heightened geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan dented chip stocks, after Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump said Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense supplies.\n\nTech stocks were also pressured by a broader shift into more economically sensitive sectors, amid growing bets that the Fed will begin cutting rates from September.\n\nThis saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise 0.6% to a record high of 41,198.08 points. The S&P 500 fell 1.4% to 5,588.27 points, while the NASDAQ Composite finished down 2.8% at 17,997.81 points.\n\nNetflix, TSMC earnings awaited\n\nFocus remained on the second quarter earnings season, with technology majors Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and TSMC set to report earnings on Thursday.\n\nTSMC is considered a bellwether for the chipmaking industry, and is expected to log a bumper second quarter profit on increased demand from the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nLithographic equipment maker ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) ADR (NASDAQ:ASML), which is also considered a bellwether for the chip industry, clocked stronger than expected second quarter earnings, as it flagged increased demand from the AI industry.\n\nEarnings from Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX), Alaska Air Group Inc (NYSE:ALK) and Intuitive Surgical Inc (NASDAQ:ISRG) are also due on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise as chip rout eases; more earnings awaited\n\nAustralia's Domino's Pizza slumps to over 9-year low on bleak store growth view\n\nInsurance broker TWFG prices US IPO above range to raise about $187 million\n\nView comments",

        "title": "From $100K to $1 Million: 3 Tech Stocks to Buy to Grow Your Wealth",
        "content": "The technology sector continues to be one of the most desired industries for investors. Its rapid innovation has created some of the world’s most valuable companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nWith the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI), fintech and cybersecurity, finding the best tech stocks to buy is a great strategy. While these industries can help investors grow their wealth, it is important to understand the risks. There are thousands of tech companies listed on the stock market, and many of them do not pan out.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial for investors to be extremely selective and stick with the company’s with long track records of success. This can be through a combination of market share, revenue and earnings growth and consistent cash flows. While past performance is not indicative of future results, investing in the technology sector is a great way to build wealth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, here are the top three tech stocks to buy to 10X your money in the long term!\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is a leading fintech stock with enormous long term potential. The company’s investments in digital transformation, which includes digital payment solutions, position it well for long-term success.\n\nAmerican Express is undoubtedly one of the best tech stocks to buy in 2024. Over the last year, its revenue and earnings saw strong double-digit growth, boosted by strong customer engagement and demand for its premium product offerings. In 2023, new card acquisitions totaled 12.2 million, bringing its total network to over 140 million. CEO Stephen Squeri remains confident in the investments it is making in areas like digital wallets and tokenization to expand its customer base in 2024. In Q1 FY24, revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $15.8 billion. New card acquisitions hit a record 3.4 million in the quarter, with earnings per share up 39% to $3.33 per share. With a clear focus on the millennial and Gen Z segments, AXP stock is uniquely positioned to benefit from the resurgence in travel demand in 2024 and beyond.\n\nGodaddy (GDDY) GoDaddy website\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nGodaddy (NYSE:GDDY) is a leading domain registrar and web hosting company. It is also a tech company with extraordinary long-term potential. As more businesses migrate to online, Godaddy will continue to dominate and grow its revenue, earnings and market share.\n\nGodaddy is among the best tech stocks to buy and hold for the long haul. The company hit a key inflection point in 2023, instilling confidence in the business moving forward. While revenue increased a modest 4% from 2022, its strong operational execution drove its earnings and free cash flow to record heights. Moreover, net earnings swelled 295% year over year to $1.4 billion, with free cash flow up 11% to $1.1 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, momentum continued to build with earnings up 749% year-over-year to $401.5 million. Additionally, Godaddy continues to diversify its product offerings including its new Airo platform that includes a full suite of AI tools. With the company recently added to the S&P 500, the sky is truly the limit for this under-the-radar tech giant.\n\nQualys (QLYS) A Qualys sign hanging on a corporate office in Silicon Valley.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualys (NASDAQ:QLYS) is a provider of cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. It, too, is one of the top tech stocks to buy to grow your wealth. With cyber-crimes accelerating, Qualys is a compelling investment opportunity that you can’t miss.\n\nQualys provides customers with a broad range of cybersecurity solutions, including vulnerability management, threat detection and compliance. With the increased frequency and boldness of cyber attacks, businesses of all sizes will need more robust security measures. The company’s cloud-based solutions and TruRisk platform is uniquely positioned to address these challenges.\n\nFurthermore, Qualys’ growing revenue, earnings and free cash flow is a positive sign for the business. In the 2023 fiscal year, revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $554.5 million. Earnings per share rose 47% from the year prior, with free cash flow hitting a record $236 million. Additionally, revenue and earnings saw strong double-digit growth in the first quarter of 2024. With cyber-crimes remaining a pressing problem in business, Qualys will continue to benefit from the rise in cybersecurity spending.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Warner Bros. Discovery under pressure as 'vicious debate' ensues over NBA media rights",
        "content": "The NBA has reportedly agreed to terms for its next media rights deal — and it looks like Warner Bros. Discovery's (WBD) TNT Network could lose out.\n\nIf true, it will be a gut punch for the legacy media giant, which has aired NBA games through its TNT network since 1989. It reportedly shells out $1.2 billion annually for the rights, which expire at the end of next season. But Comcast's NBCUniversal is set to take over its current rights package at a much higher price.\n\n\"The big outstanding question that we hope to find some clarity on in the coming days is whether Warner Bros. Discovery will look to exercise its matching rights, which were built into its prior NBA contract, after the league formally approves and presents the offers in writing to [TNT],\" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a new note on Wednesday.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav acknowledged the matching rights to reporters last week at the annual Sun Valley conference, noting that negotiations are still in progress and \"we'll see how it plays out.\"\n\nBut some Wall Street watchers say it is unlikely WBD will match at this point.\n\n\"I don't believe Warner Bros. really wants to spend $1.8-plus billion on a rights package for a much smaller package and with less playoff games than they have now,\" LightShed media analyst Rich Greenfield told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"There is a pretty vicious debate among investors: Is losing the NBA catastrophic for WBD because they're at risk of getting dropped by distributors, whether it's a YouTube TV or a Comcast? Will this sort of be the end of carriage for this company, or at least a significant haircut to carriage? Or is saving a billion-plus dollars a year [actually] going to be a positive financial transaction?\"\n\nGreenfield said the answer largely depends on what other sports rights WBD is able to acquire.\n\n\"You've seen them do some small deals, like college football playoffs, nothing terribly meaningful so far,\" he said. \"But there are rights like UFC coming available. There are other things coming available over the next few years. It'll be interesting to see how aggressive they are if they do, in fact, as we believe, stand down from the NBA.\" Warner Bros. Discovery has aired NBA games through its TNT network since 1989. (Getty Images) (hapabapa via Getty Images)\n\nComcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA) is reportedly taking over WBD's portion of the rights after submitting a reported bid worth $2.5 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal. The network will show about 100 games per season, with half airing exclusively on its streaming service Peacock.\n\nStory continues\n\nDisney (DIS), the NBA's other major broadcast partner, is expected to retain its share of the league's media rights after reportedly agreeing to increase its payment of $1.5 billion a year to $2.6 billion, per the Journal. The company will carry fewer games than in its current package, although it will be able to stream games on its upcoming ESPN streaming platform, set to launch in fall 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) struck a deal with the NBA for a streaming rights package that will be offered through its Prime Video service for a reported $1.8 billion. The Journal said the package includes both regular season and playoff games, plus the play-in tournament and a share of conference finals, which would rotate among the media partners.\n\nIn total, the NBA has reportedly secured a media rights package worth around $76 billion over 11 years — a bullish sign when it comes to the importance of sports to both streamers and traditional broadcast and cable providers.\n\n\"Ultimately, this NBA renewal is just another example of the growing importance — and thus ever inflating costs — of sports rights,\" MoffettNathanson's Fishman said. \"Further, with the creation of a digital-only package at Amazon, more sports than ever before will be available outside of the Pay TV bundle as the distribution ecosystem continues to evolve.\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver.

        "title": "How Apple and Samsung are selling gen AI is wildly different",
        "content": "The world’s two biggest smartphone makers, Samsung and Apple (AAPL), are going all in on generative AI. Take a look at Samsung’s latest Galaxy Unpacked event in Paris, where the company debuted its latest foldable smartphones and espoused the benefits of its Galaxy AI platform.\n\nApple, meanwhile, spent the majority of its WWDC event in June focusing on how its Apple Intelligence generative AI software will power new features on its iPhones. But the companies that, according to IDC, made up a combined 36.6% of the global smartphone market as of the second quarter of 2024, are taking decidedly different approaches to bringing generative AI to their users.\n\nSamsung is angling to quickly build a large user base for its generative AI services, thus incentivizing developers to build apps for its Galaxy AI platform. And as those apps prove to be more capable and useful, Samsung will draw in more users.\n\nSamsung’s Galaxy AI features are available on this year’s Galaxy S24, last year’s S23, and 2022’s Galaxy S22, not to mention three generations of its foldable phones. Overall, Samsung says it expects to put Galaxy AI on some 200 million devices by the end of the year. Apple, however, says only people who own its most powerful iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and later iterations of the ubiquitous smartphone will get Apple Intelligence features. Samsung president Roh Tae-moon speaks during the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event. (Emmanuel Dunand/AFP via Getty Images) (EMMANUEL DUNAND via Getty Images)\n\nApple is banking on boosting iPhone sales in the near to medium term by getting users who are interested in generative AI apps to upgrade to the next generation of devices, rather than holding on to their current iPhones for years to come.\n\nDespite the difference in approaches, both companies still need to prove to consumers that generative AI apps are worth the hype. And that will take time.\n\n“Through 2025, if not a little bit longer, most of the purchasing would be purchasing that would have happened anyway as opposed to [people] running out because they need [AI] features,” explained Ryan Reith, program vice president for IDC's Mobile Device Tracker suite.\n\nSamsung vs. Apple\n\nSamsung got the jump on Apple in the AI race, debuting its Galaxy AI platform, complete with a handful of Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) AI apps, alongside its Galaxy S24 line in January. Since then, the company says 77% of S24 users have used its AI capabilities at least once per week. So far, Samsung says Google’s Circle to Search feature, which lets you snap photos of objects and text and circle them to identify or translate them, is among users’ favorite AI options. Apple CEO Tim Cook delivers remarks at the start of the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10, 2024, in Cupertino, Calif. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nIn addition to Google’s Circle to Search, Samsung offers AI-powered translation, transcription, text composition, and photo editing apps. Of those, I find transcription to be the most useful. Photo editing, which lets you manipulate photos using generative AI, feels like more of a party trick than a must-have feature that people will use on a regular basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, those options are a start. And getting them into the hands of users and developers will inevitably help Samsung create more interesting and, importantly, useful AI offerings moving forward.\n\n“I think Samsung is recognizing that they want to get [Galaxy AI] out there to as many people as they can,” explained TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell.\n\n“They want to get developers excited to create things for their platforms. And so, this is a way to do that, because all of a sudden, you've got a significantly larger install base with Samsung incorporating a few previous generations, whereas, obviously with Apple, it's going be a significantly smaller install base,” he added.\n\nSamsung’s approach should incentivize developers eager to reach a large user base to begin building apps for its platform. And if those developers build engaging apps, users will inevitably opt for Samsung’s devices to gain access to those apps. The approach isn’t going to move smartphone units in the immediate future, but if customers like using apps built for Samsung’s AI services, they’ll be far more likely to purchase the company’s devices when they’re shopping for a new phone in the future. Samsung's Annika Bizon speaks during the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked in Paris on July 10, 2024. (Emmanuel Dunand /AFP via Getty Images) (EMMANUEL DUNAND via Getty Images)\n\nApple, however, isn’t interested in waiting for phone sales to trickle in over time. The company clearly wants users to go buy its next-generation iPhone the moment it hits the market, likely this September. It makes sense for Apple. The iPhone is its most important product, and after sales declines in 2023 and a mixed start to 2024, getting new devices into consumers' hands sooner rather than later is a must.\n\nWall Street is hoping the company’s Apple Intelligence platform helps power a new sales cycle in the year ahead. Tying the software to the latest and greatest iPhones gives Apple a better chance of pulling that off.\n\nBut it also means it’ll have a smaller install base of users for its generative AI products than Samsung. And that could hurt AI developers building on Apple’s software, at least in the near term.\n\nDo consumers really want generative AI?\n\nAll of this generative AI talk, though, won’t be worth a thing if consumers don’t actually understand it. While Samsung’s early usage numbers are impressive, they only account for users who access its AI software once per week. Considering we pick up our phones dozens of times each day, that’s not exactly a ringing endorsement just yet.\n\nAnecdotally, my family and friends are still largely confused by what adding generative AI to their smartphones means for them. While Samsung and Apple have made splashy announcements, the average consumer, at least in so far as my own circle goes, doesn’t quite get the whole concept quite yet.\n\nFor now, we’ll have to see how Apple pitches its Apple Intelligence during its expected iPhone event in September and how Samsung and Google continue to evolve their own messaging and offerings in the months ahead.

        "title": "UBS casts doubt on Apple's FY25 iPhone 'super-cycle'",
        "content": "Investing.com - Analysts from UBS, a well-respected financial services company, issued an analyst note on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), predicting the tech giant will deliver in-line results for June and September, while cautioning that the market's optimism for FY25 may be misplaced.\n\nUBS forecasts June 2024 revenues of $84.6 billion, a 3.5% year-on-year increase, with iPhone unit sales expected to reach 43 million, a 2% decrease year-on-year. The firm also anticipates that Mac sales will benefit from easy comparisons, driving their forecast to $7.5 billion.\n\nAdditionally, they predict that iPad revenue will grow by 10% year-on-year for the quarter.\n\nDespite these predictions, UBS doubts the likelihood of an iPhone \"super-cycle\" in FY25, arguing that their analysis of smartphone demand by region, previous cycles, income demographic data, and carrier subsidies suggests a more modest cycle next year.\n\n⚠️Stay updated with the latest market moves using InvestingPro! Our Summer Sale is now on, use coupon code INVPRODEAL and save over 50%!⚠️\n\nIn addition, given Apple's current price-to-earnings multiple of 33 times, UBS believes that unless EPS estimates increase significantly, the risk/reward is unfavorable.\n\nDespite making minor adjustments to their estimates, UBS maintains that FY25 iPhone demand expectations are overly optimistic. They estimate that peak demand for iPhones will reach around 247 million units, significantly below the most bullish investors' forecasts. UBS also notes that the market is pricing in iPhone units 15% above their 225 million forecast for FY25.\n\nUBS's analysis further suggests that global iPhone share would need to reach a record 22% to underwrite an AI supercycle or approximately 260 million iPhones in FY25. This would be a significant increase from the current 19% share, especially given increased competition from Huawei in China.\n\nThe note also highlights concerns around privacy, cost, and lack of applications as potential impediments to the success of a GenAI replacement cycle. They point out that almost 40% of respondents in a recent UBS Evidence Lab Smartphone Survey cited privacy as a concern. Price is also a crucial factor for consumers, and any attempt to raise iPhone prices could negatively impact demand.\n\nUBS rated Apple as \"neutral\" with a price target of $190, reflecting a challenging growth backdrop, higher rates, and an undefined AI strategy.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUBS casts doubt on Apple's FY25 iPhone 'super-cycle'\n\nWintrust Financial reports earnings miss in second quarter, shares slip 5%\n\nDiscover Financial stock gains 2% as Q2 earnings soar\n\nView comments",

In my view, for most people, the best thing is to do is own the S&P 500 index fund.\"\n\nAs one of the biggest supporters of value investing, Buffett also believes in maintaining a routine while investing in index funds, especially during volatile times. Buffett stated in 2019 that he instructed his trustee to invest 90% of his wealth into a low-cost S&P 500 index after passing away.\n\n\"Keep buying it through thick and thin, and especially through thin. ...

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street is looking beyond the obvious megacap stocks to find the next leg of the artificial intelligence trade.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Floats Tougher Trade Rules to Rein In China Chip Industry Nasdaq 100 Set for Worst Day Since December 2022: Markets Wrap BlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm’s Ad Trump Security Tightened on Iran Plot Intel; No Link to Shooting Amazon Sold a Used Diaper. It Tanked a Mom-and-Pop Business\n\nBetting that the Magnificent Seven may be running out of steam after an 18-month rally, some investors are turning their attention to what Melius Research dubbed “AI laggards.” This group, which includes Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and International Business Machines Corp., have exposure to the AI theme but failed to keep up with gains for the biggest AI winners in the first half of the year.\n\nAll three have outperformed over the past month, while AI poster child Nvidia Corp. has slightly dropped in that period. Chip stocks broadly fell Wednesday after Bloomberg reported that the Biden administration is considering using the most severe trade restrictions available if companies continue giving China access to advanced chip technology, although Intel rose 6.6%.\n\nIBM shares swung between gains and losses in early trading Wednesday, after five days of gains.\n\nCrucially, the laggards also have lower valuations and bars to clear in terms of sentiment and earnings expectations, suggesting they could be well positioned for the rest of 2024.\n\n“We are believers in a ‘catch-up’ trade for some in semis, hardware and even software — those with lower expectations,” Melius analyst Ben Reitzes wrote in a note this month, adding that a similar pattern occurred in 2023, when first half “underdogs” did well in the second half.\n\nReitzes also included Apple Inc. on his list of stocks that underperformed in the first six months. Shares in the iPhone maker have been rising steadily since April, preceding the rotation into other laggards, but have been especially strong since Apple demonstrated long-awaited new AI features last month.\n\nTed Mortonson, a technology desk sector strategist at Baird, said investors are starting to rotate into stocks where fundamentals are strong but expectations are lower, leaving more room for upside.\n\n“The obvious AI stocks have doubled over the past year and are facing slower growth from here,” he said. “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to think they’re over-owned and that there might be a catch up in names that have been overlooked.”\n\nMortonson highlighted other stocks he sees as beneficiaries of the trade, including software company F5 Inc., electronic measurement instruments company Keysight Technologies Inc., and semiconductor-related firms Diodes Inc., Coherent Corp., Lumentum Holdings Inc. and Aehr Test Systems, which on Tuesday gave a positive outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe rotation is coming after a first half which saw megacaps including Nvidia, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. propel the market higher, stretching valuations for these names and leaving them with a tougher setup for the rest of 2024. Citigroup analysts recently suggested investors take profits in some high-flying AI stocks and “re-balance toward a broader array of AI stocks across the value chain.”\n\nEarnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to decelerate next year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. At the same time, AI winners like Nvidia and Microsoft are trading at substantial premiums to their long-term multiples — making laggards like IBM and Intel look like bargains in comparison.\n\nIBM’s second-quarter results next week will be an important datapoint to determine whether this trade can continue. Last quarter, weak sales from the company’s consulting unit sparked the biggest one-day drop in more than two years. While megacap stocks have been hitting record after record this year, IBM hasn’t hit one since 2013.\n\n“Everyone owns the growth tech stocks, but the value side has been neglected at a time when the macro cycle should be pretty favorable,” said Ohsung Kwon, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America.\n\n“There’s definitely a trade to be made within tech, since positioning has gotten pretty extreme.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nThe recent strength in small-cap stocks includes tech, with the category trouncing its larger equivalent of late. An index tracking small-cap tech jumped 3% on Tuesday, its biggest one-day gain since December, even as the large-cap tech index fell 0.4%. While large-cap remains the decisive outperformer this year, the past month has favored smaller names. The small-cap tech index is up more than 10%, compared with a 3.8% rise for large-caps.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nThe Biden administration, facing pushback to its chip crackdown on China, has told allies that it’s considering using the most severe trade restrictions available if companies such as Tokyo Electron Ltd. and ASML Holding NV continue giving the country access to advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nASML shares fell as the prospect of more severe US restrictions on its business in China offset growth in the Dutch firm’s order intake last quarter. Elon Musk said he will relocate the headquarters for X and SpaceX to Texas, adding more fuel to the billionaire’s efforts to align himself with the political right and distance himself from left-leaning California. Tesla Inc. forming an autonomous taxi platform will be the catalyst for a roughly 10-fold increase in its share price, Ark Investment Management LLC’s Cathie Wood said, echoing years of bullish predictions about a business the carmaker has yet to stand up. Amazon.com Inc.’s marketing portal for merchants crashed Tuesday night, according to multiple Amazon sellers and consultants, fouling up one of the online retailer’s biggest sales of the year. GitLab Inc., a US software developer backed by Google parent Alphabet Inc., is exploring a sale after attracting interest from potential bidders, Reuters reported.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek’s Donald Trump Interview Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail Interviewing Trump on His Plans for the US Economy How Trader Joe’s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit Here’s How to Create a Social Safety Net With Bipartisan Support\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Axcelis Technologies (ACLS) earns a Zacks Rank #1 14 days from its next quarterly earnings release on July 31, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.39 a share.\n\nACLS has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.97%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.39 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35.\n\nACLS is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Apple (AAPL) as well.\n\nSlated to report earnings on August 1, 2024, Apple holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.38 a share 15 days from its next quarterly update.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple is $1.33, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 3.23%.\n\nACLS and AAPL's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "content": "Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) biggest-ever acquisition could face US pushback no matter who wins the White House this November.\n\nThe reported $23 billion bid to buy fast-growing cloud cybersecurity firm Wiz is the kind that is almost sure to attract scrutiny from Washington competition watchdogs, along with inevitable delays.\n\nA US regulatory review could stall a tie-up into next year, making it possible that a new administration could be tasked with evaluating its competitive risks.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean Alphabet, which is already fighting antitrust challenges on other fronts, would be free of yet another legal fight.\n\n\"The current administration looks at vertical issues more heavily than has historically been the case,\" Colin Kass, a partner with Proskauer and co-chair of the firm’s antitrust group, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"But even the prior administration, under Trump, did look at vertical issues even more so than earlier administrations.\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe Biden administration has tried to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries, from healthcare to groceries to tech.\n\nBut a second Trump administration may not be much friendlier, especially with the giants of Silicon Valley.\n\nWhen Trump was president last decade, his administration launched antitrust investigations into Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Alphabet's Google. His administration also filed a lawsuit against Google, targeting its dominance as a search engine.\n\nThat search engine case, which the Biden administration decided to continue, wrapped up earlier this year, and a decision from a judge is expected soon.\n\nTrump suggested in an interview with Bloomberg Tuesday that major tech companies do need some reining in to limit hazards to children, though he added that he didn't want to go after them violently because the approach could destroy them.\n\nAnd Trump’s new vice-presidential candidate, Sen. J.D. Vance, has called for the breakup of Google while also expressing admiration for Lina Khan, the Federal Trade Commission boss who has led the scrutiny of a number of merger attempts in the tech world.\n\n\"I guess I look at Lina Khan as one of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is doing a pretty good job,\" Vance said in February.\n\nA former FTC official who spoke with Yahoo Finance and asked to remain anonymous agreed an Alphabet-Wiz deal would spark a review, no matter who is in the White House. Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, attends a campaign rally in Ohio. (AP Photo/Jeff Dean) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut a Trump-led DOJ or FTC, the former official said, would more likely favor concessions from Alphabet over litigation if a review raised competition concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegulators could even probe for evidence to learn if Google is already engaged in the cloud cybersecurity market in hopes of challenging the company on grounds that the deal poses a potential, rather than existing, competition threat.\n\nThe former FTC official said that evidence might not support the theory, but such an investigation could be worthwhile for regulators to explore because they are interested in further developing the law on potential threats.\n\nThat, too, could take up substantial time.\n\nIf a deal to buy Wiz does in fact move forward, either the DOJ or FTC would lead any ensuing investigation.\n\nAt preliminary stages, merger and acquisition reviews typically span 30 days, with room for extensions. If officials decide to move beyond preliminary review to what’s known as a second request, the additional investigation can take six to 18 months. Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) (Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images)\n\nOnly then, once a second request is completed, could a legal challenge to the transaction happen.\n\n\"So we're talking at a minimum of probably eight months before there's an actual challenge and, more likely, a year or more before there's an actual challenge,\" Kass said.\n\nThe antitrust experts said competition concerns could include fears that an acquisition would give Alphabet’s Google an opportunity to disadvantage rivals or diminish competition in a downstream market.\n\nNew York University professor Lawrence White said an Alphabet-Wiz deal could also receive scrutiny from regulators abroad.\n\nThat would pose additional complications for the companies since the EU keeps turning up the heat on US tech giants.\n\nJust last month European regulators hit Microsoft (MSFT) with an antitrust charge one day after the same regulatory body charged Apple with violating European Union competition law.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Stable Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Before Earnings Season",
        "content": "Today, we’ll explore three stable blue-chip stocks to buy. As the earnings season approaches, Wall Street is getting readyfor potential market volatility. With the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 already up 18% and 21% this year, respectively, it’s clear that market fortunes can shift rapidly. In uncertain times like these, blue-chip stocks provide a reliable anchor, offering stability and resilience when the market is turbulent.\n\nKnown for their consistent performance and reliable dividends, stable blue-chip stocks can be the bedrock of a solid investment plan. Seasoned investors agree that one of the key benefits of investing in blue-chip stocks is their reliable dividend payments. Academic research highlights that reliable dividends can help counteract any short-term drops in a stock’s value and contribute to the overall return on investment.\n\nLet’s now take a closer look at the three top-notch blue-chip stocks to buy before earnings season kicks off.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a perennial favorite among stable blue-chip stocks. The consumer tech’s continuous innovation is a cornerstone of its long-term investment appeal. apple has a wide economic moat, with competitive advantages that protect it from competitors and help maintain its leading market position.\n\nIn early May, Apple reported second quarter 2024 earnings. Despite a slight revenue dip of 4% year-over-year (YOY) to $90.8 billion, diluted EPS held steady at $1.53. The company reaffirmed its intention to crete shareholder value with a $110 billion share repurchase authorization and an annual dividend increase.\n\nApple’s services segment posted an impressive 14% YOY revenue growth, highlighting the importance of strategic diversification. Upcoming enhancements in Apple Music and Apple Fitness+, along with potential subscription bundles, aim to boost customer engagement and recurring revenue. Its new artificial intelligence (AI) platform, Apple Intelligence, also promises a significant future impact.\n\nYear-to-date (YTD), AAPL stock has surged over 22%, while the shares are trading at 33.9 times forward earnings and 9.4 times sales. Analysts warn of overvaluation, setting a 12-month median price target of $220.00, suggesting a 6% potential downside. However, positive market sentiment and promising growth prospects indicate that AAPL stock could still offer long-term returns, especially with upcoming developments.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s third quarter 2024 earnings release is scheduled for August 1. Unitl then, any potential decline in Apple stock price could be a good long-term opportunity to add this consumer tech giant to your portfolio.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper building\n\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext in today’s lineup of stable blue-chip stocks is the integrated energy company Chevron (NYSE:CVX). In terms ofenergy exploration, key areas of focus for Chevron include the Permian Basin in the U.S., offshore projects in the Gulf of Mexico, and international projects in countries like Kazakhstan and Angola. Chevron is also a significant player in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market, with major projects in Australia and Angola. Through its subsidiary, Chevron also manufactures petrochemicals and plastics, which are used in various industries.\n\nThe energy group reported its first quarter 2024 earnings on April 26. Global production saw an impressive 12% YOY increase. However, Chevron’s earnings declined due to lower profitability in refined product sales and natural gas prices. Adjusted earnings totaled $5.4 billion, or $2.93 per share, down from $3.55 per share a year ago. Notably, the company raised its dividend by 8% from the previous quarter and repurchased nearly $3 billion in shares.\n\nLooking ahead, Chevron is poised to benefit from rising global energy demand, with forecasts suggesting ongoing growth in oil and gas production. Additionally, Chevron’s collaboration with Bunge (NYSE:BG) on a new oilseed processingplant in Louisiana aligns with sustainable energy trends, bolstering capacity for renewable fuel feedstocks by 2026.\n\nSince January, CVX stock has gained 6% YTD, complemented by a robust 4.1% dividend yield. Shares trade at reasonable valuations of 12 times forward earnings and 1.5 times sales. Wall Street analysts have set a 12-month median price target of $180.00, suggesting a potential 14% upside. Chevron’s next earnings release is scheduled for August 2, 2024.\n\nSanofi (SNY) Sanofi (SNY) logo on the side of company branch in Germany\n\nSource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.com\n\nToday’s final name among blue-chip stocks to buy is Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), a leading French healthcare heavyweight. With a robust product lineup including vaccines and prescription drugs, Sanofi plays a pivotal role in global healthcare. It also offers a solid choice for diversified portfolios due to its stable earnings and dividend increases for almost three decades.\n\nOn April 25, Sanofi reported Q1 2024 financials. Revenues grew 2.4% YOY to 10.5 billion euros. Sales rose 7% YOY, driven by strong performances from Dupixent and new launches like Nexviazyme and Altuve. However, business EPS decreased 17.6% YOY to 1.78 euros, mainly due to higher tax rates.\n\nSanofi enhances its portfolio through strategic collaborations and acquisitions. It recently acquired Inhibrx to strengthen its rare disease segment. The acquisition is expected to contibute significantly to revenues. Sanofi is also progressing with its drug pipeline, with 12 phase three data readouts anticipated over 2024-2025.\n\nSince January, SNY stock is up around 1%, with a dividend yield exceeding 4%. The shares are trading at 15.8 times forward earnings and 2.5 times sales. Analysts’ 12-month median price forecast stands at $58.78, implying an upside potential of nearly 18% from the current levels. Sanofi is expected to release its second quarter 2024 results on July 25, 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor held a long position in AAPL.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "ASML (ASML)\n\nShares in ASML dropped over 7% in pre-market trading as the the prospect of more severe US restrictions on its business in China overshadowed better-than-expected second-quarter earnings.\n\nThe Dutch group, which supplies semiconductor-making machinery to chip makers, booked €5.57bn ($6.07bn, £4.67bn) in orders in the three months to the end of June, up from €4.50bn a year earlier. Analysts had forecast nearly €5.04bn in orders, according to consensus estimates by Visible Alpha.\n\nNet sales fell 9.5% year-on-year, while net income dropped by 18.7%.\n\n“While there are still uncertainties in the market, primarily driven by the macro environment, we expect industry recovery to continue in the second half of the year,” ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said in a statement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: Interest rate cut in doubt even as UK inflation remains at Bank of England target\n\nShares dropped after Bloomberg reported that the US is telling allies, including the Netherlands, it may take unilateral action to restrict exports of chip equipment to China if they fail to do so themselves.\n\nCharles Schwab (SCHW)\n\nCharles Schwab plunged over 10% in Tuesday's session and was in the red during pre-market trading after the investing giant warned it will have to shrink itself in order to protect profits.\n\nCharles Schwab reported slightly better than expected second-quarter earnings and revenue early Tuesday. The financial services firm ended the quarter with total client assets of $9.4tn.\n\nQ2 revenue increased by less than 1% to $4.69bn with earnings of 73 cents per share, down around 3% compared to Q2 2023.\n\nNet flows into managed investing solutions reached $25bn, up 56% over the year-to-date compared with the first six months of 2023.\n\n\"Client interest in our broad array of wealth solutions remained strong through June. Year-to-date enrolments are up [around] 30% versus the prior year period,\" said co-chairman and chief executive Walt Bettinger.\n\nSchwab management revealed in a post-earnings conference call that it is shrinking its banking business to \"protect the economics we're able to generate from owning a bank.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nShopify (SHOP)\n\nShopify was in the red ahead of the opening bell after surging over 8% in Tuesday's session following an upgrade from Bank of America (BoA).\n\nBoA raised its rating on the e-commerce platform to \"Buy\" from \"Neutral\" and increased its price target to $82 from $78. Analysts believe Shopify's revenue growth alongside its disciplined approach to spending will create improved margin growth in the coming quarters.\n\n\"Following years of declining margin, we believe that the company has turned a corner on balanced growth and margin, under new CFO Jeff Hoffmeister,\" BoA analyst Brad Sills said in a report.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Pound breaks $1.30 for first time in a year while European stocks fall on UK inflation data\n\n\"Revenue growth and disciplined spending point to healthy margin expansion going forward.

They did take about 100% of our chip business. I think, Taiwan should pay us for defence,\" Trump said in interview on 25 June that was published on Tuesday.\n\n\"You know, we're no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn't give us anything.\"\n\nTaiwan premier Cho Jung-tai, responding to Trump's comments, said Taiwan and the US have good relations despite the lack of formal ties, and is dedicated to bolstering its own defences.\n\n\"Taiwan has steadily strengthened its defence budget and demonstrated its responsibility to the international community,\" he told reporters in Taipei, according to Reuters.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nShowing up late to a party has its upsides. Just ask Apple.\n\nWhile Tim Cook's first-mover peers were stumbling through botched AI rollouts, boardroom drama, and a public backlash, he waltzed through the door carrying an Apple Intelligence casserole and Wall Street analysts were ready with a drink.\n\nOn Monday the company hit an all-time high as Morgan Stanley named Apple a top pick. It raised its price target on an expected mega upgrade cycle driven by Apple's coming AI platform.\n\n\"Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments,\" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.\n\nThat Apple's yet-to-be-released AI tools will be available to only 8% of existing iPhone and iPad users strengthens the case for an abnormally large upgrade cycle, they said. Add in an already enormous user base and a replacement cycle that has stretched to almost five years, and there's a recipe for a lot of people itching for new devices.\n\nThat's a testament to Apple's AI strategy and the clever ways it has presented what AI tools can do for you. By relentlessly highlighting everyday use cases, Apple has managed to wrangle the more hysterical promises of AI into something approachable (and monetizable) inside its ecosystem.\n\nPrior to Apple's AI run-up, Cupertino skeptics pointed to the public's upgrade fatigue, slowing iPhone growth, and the saturated smartphone market in the US. Recent hardware releases also prompted grumblings of a lack of pizzazz, feeding a narrative that Apple's glory days were behind it.\n\nWhen the company ended its electric car project in February, it seemed Apple was giving up on a daring initiative and giving in to the AI fad. But that inflection point looks different now. With more insight into Cook's AI services-oriented approach, the company's AI strategy looks less like Google and Microsoft's and more like an extension of its walled garden.\n\nLoop Capital likened Apple's AI potential to prior generational shifts in technology.\n\nTwenty years ago, the iPod was the platform through which many consumers experienced digital content. Next came the iPhone, which of course was also \"late,\" but redefined the category as the iconic device became the foundation for social media.\n\nAnd now, through generative AI, managing director Ananda Baruah wrote on Tuesday that Apple's AI platform will become the \"base camp\" of choice for consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's striking about Wall Street's outpouring of support, however, is that Apple never really transcended the hardware trap its critics claimed had ensnared it. While AI technology and its use cases may seem revolutionary, the business implications for Apple are all too conventional: People will buy more phones.\n\nThat's no world-changing paradigm shift. But it's a reliable way to make money. morning brief image\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) The Most Undervalued AI Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. Since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nKing Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management’s chief strategist, recently talked to CNBC about the latest decline in tech stocks and market rotation. Lip said that he’s still bullish on tech stocks and a single event does not show a trend. However, the cause of decline in tech stocks last week was the lower-than-expected CPI data which caused investors to do some “profit taking” and invest in names that can benefit “more” from lower interest rates, according to the analyst. Lip noted that small-cap stocks, real estate stocks, among others, gained ground on the back of this trend.\n\nHowever, Lip has high expectations from the upcoming earnings reports from tech companies. He also said that July has been one of the strongest months for tech stocks. Lip, however, said that major tech companies cannot go on to post record gains and their returns are expected to “fall in line with historical returns.”\n\nLip thinks the economy is entering a “Goldilocks scenario” where growth is steady but not “hot enough” to cause inflation. He reiterated his view that he expects strong earnings growth this year and in 2025, which could be a tailwind for stocks.\n\nAsked what would cause earnings growth of tech companies, Lip said a lot of that comes down to efficient management and strong cash piles these companies have. He also said “slightly” lower interest rates could also be a tailwind for the economy.\n\nSince Lip is bullish on tech stocks and believes major AI companies still have upside potential, we decided to take a look at the top names in his portfolio. These are the top holdings of King Lip, according to CNBC. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Analyst Says Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Has More Upside Potential?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nApple is one of the top AI names in King Lip’s portfolio.\n\nApple is also among the top picks of Wedbush’s Dan Ives for the second half of 2024.\n\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in “denial” about Apple’s AI potential.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 26X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock’s overvalued, given Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales growth of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) skeptics have long believed that the company is a laggard in the AI race, but experts say Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) almost always makes its own way and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will come roaring back in the AI competition and surpass Microsoft and Alphabet. The company recently revealed new M4-powered iPad Pro and claimed that its devices, powered by Neural Engine,  will be “more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.” Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Neural Engine is Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) neural processing unit (NPU) that accelerates AI workloads.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was pressured in the quarter as investors fretted over softening demand for smartphones, regulatory action from the US Department of Justice, and the Chinese government mandates restricting iPhone use by government officials. Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to believe the company remains competitively advantaged and benefits from the Apple ecosystem, which has an installed base of over 2 billion devices and over 1 billion paying subscribers. We believe the Apple ecosystem will support a more predictable cash flow stream, which should grow intrinsic value high-single-digits over our investment horizon.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Apple stock: Record AI smartphone upgrades are coming says Morgan Stanley",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley analysts have upgraded Apple stock to their Top Pick, reflecting their expectations of a forthcoming record upgrade cycle driven by the integration of Apple Intelligence into its devices.\n\nAs announced during the WWDC 2024 event, Apple Intelligence will include advanced voice-activated command features, an upgraded Siri, new Generative AI features, and broader foundation models through ChatGPT integration.\n\n“We see Apple Intelligence as the closest possible offering to a true smart virtual assistant in the market today,” Morgan Stanley analysts highlighted.\n\nThey project that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will ship 235 million iPhones in the fiscal year 2025 (FY25) and 262 million in FY26, which are 2-12% above consensus estimates. These forecasts are supported by the analysis of Apple’s extensive installed base and the potential for upgrades.\n\nOnly 15% of Apple’s current device base can support AI features, pointing to a significant opportunity for upgrades as users transition to devices equipped with the A17 Pro or M-series chips.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s report also emphasizes that Apple is entering FY25 with the “largest iPhone upgradeable base in history.”\n\nAnalysts estimate that 31% of the 700 million upgradeable iPhones will be replaced within the next 12 months, driving the projected shipment numbers. In the US, where access to Apple Intelligence will be immediate, upgrade rates are expected to reach a record 36% in FY25.\n\nGlobally, the iPhone replacement cycle is poised to accelerate further in FY26, driven by broader language support for Apple Intelligence, additional software innovations, and new hardware features. This cycle is projected to result in 262 million shipments, which represents an all-time high and 12% above consensus estimates.\n\nBeyond just unit growth, Morgan Stanley notes that the mix shift towards premium iPhone models is expected to drive 4-5% annual growth in average selling prices (ASPs) for FY25 and FY26.\n\n“Growth in iPhone units will account for 36% of Apple's total revenue growth through FY26, higher iPhone ASPs and iPad growth will account for another 26% of total revenue growth,” analysts said.\n\nThey also set a new price target of $273 for Apple stock, implying an upside potential of more than 18% from current levels.\n\n“We believe there is more room for the stock to run, as investors broadly remain underweight Apple shares and accelerating iPhone unit growth historically drives Apple stock outperformance,” analysts wrote.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple stock: Record AI smartphone upgrades are coming says Morgan Stanley\n\nStory continues\n\nBarclays sees risk of Tesla stock rally reversing on bad Q2 print\n\nWall St futures slump after rally as tech stocks slide\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Each year, hundreds of stocks are delisted from U.S. exchanges. The path to delisting is usually long, and the signs are many. Generally speaking, delistings do not happen overnight. That means there is an opportunity for seemingly dead stocks to reverse course and head for a comeback.\n\nEveryone loves the story of the underdog fighting against impossible odds and finding success. The stock market is not without recent precedents. Those precedents are similar to the biblical story of Lazarus, who rose from the dead after being entombed for several days.\n\nNovavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) and Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) are two great recent examples. Each has shown incredible resilience in fighting back after having been thought dead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere’s always room for more comeback stories in the stock market in the second half of 2024. Those comeback stories are likely to emerge from sectors that have recently suffered. Generally speaking, investors should look to the EV sector and growth stocks in order to find those opportunities. Comeback stories can emerge from any sector, of course. Let’s look at three stocks to buy for a comeback.\n\nNokia (NOK) a backdrop featuring the Nokia logo with a mobile phone featuring the Nokia logo on its screen in the foreground\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNokia (NYSE:NOK) used to be one of the major mobile phone manufacturers globally. The company certainly missed the smartphone opportunity. Nokia instead continued to rely on its legacy Symbian operating system, completely missing the app-driven smartphone opportunity. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) released its smartphone in 2007. The rest is history.\n\nSince then, Nokia has emerged as a 5G infrastructure threat, especially in light of global politics. The Chinese firm Huawei is one of its main rivals. Many countries are simply avoiding Huawei out of national security concerns. That is one of the reasons Nokia garnered increased attention over the past few years.\n\nNokia continues to focus on the security of its equipment and its reputation for reliable devices, including the famously indestructible 3310.\n\nAnd while the company continues to be a major 5G competitor, 5G hasn’t produced expected returns yet. Networks are still largely under development. That means even those with 5G coverage are often left to use more extensive 4G networks. Higher plan costs simply aren’t worth it yet, and until the build-out progresses, 5G stocks will continue to suffer.\n\nThat’s exactly why Nokia may rise again, positioning it for a comeback.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel Stock Bores Wall Street and Shareholders Should Be Worried\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock may already be in the early stages of a comeback. Well, maybe, maybe not.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock reeled off a string of day-to-day increases recently that were not expected. Some believe the momentum will be short-lived due to short selling activity rather than any positive fundamental improvements.\n\nIntel has floundered in 2024. Still, the company continues to enact plans to become a major chip foundry in the future. Intel is convinced its expertise in Process technology and packaging makes it uniquely suited to the AI opportunity. While that may prove true in the future, it has not panned out thus far.\n\nThat’s a good part of the reason Intel has performed so poorly in 2024. That poor performance has caused many to believe Intel is indeed dead. However, the company has too many positives to be counted out.\n\nIntel is the favorite son of Uncle Sam. The company has received billions in subsidies, and that investment could rise further. So, while Intel isn’t currently a top performer, it might just be able to brute force its way into a better future through massive subsidization.\n\nNio (NIO) Nio Chinese automobile manufacturer logo displayed on mobile phone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNio (NYSE:NIO) stock is down nearly 50% this year. Yet, it continues to have legitimate potential to rise from the ashes, so to speak.\n\nJune deliveries nearly doubled, rising 98% to 21,209 vehicles. Quarterly deliveries reached 57,373, increasing 144% and exceeding the high end of guidance. Those figures clearly indicate that Nio has all the potential to rebound.\n\nAt the same time, there is a massive price war going on in the EV sector, especially in China. There are more than 100 EV brands competing in the space in the country. That continues to put substantial downward pricing pressure on manufacturers overall. In response, Nio has launched a lower-price brand called Onvo. That vehicle will compete against Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model Y. It’s priced just above $30,000.\n\nNIO is certainly down but not out. While the Chinese EV market is clearly reaching saturation, the company still has one of the best names and most dominant positions. Any number of those firms is much more likely to fail than Nio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Social Media Stocks That Will Have Better Returns Than META",
        "content": "Less than two years ago, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) hit lows of $90 per share. Now, the company is a trillion-dollar titan at nearly $500 a share. Many of us, whether short-term or long-term investors, look forward to the day we can get lucky enough to hit a multi-bagger like META. However, there are plenty of other social media stocks worth your investment. Having said that, how do you find them?\n\nOne of the best ways to do so is through a simple investment strategy known as Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP). With GARP, investors should focus on companies with strong fundamentals, a large moat usually attached to market share, margin expansion, and high revenue growth.\n\nIn this article, I’ll cover stocks that I believe have a setup that META had in 2022. By using the GARP principles, these three stocks could be social media multi-baggers in the making!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeing an AI innovator, search engine giant, and social media superstar, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is truly one-of-a-kind. This unique moat has positioned Alphabet as the fourth-largest company in the world by market cap.\n\nThe company has an 81.95% market share in the search engine industry with its subsidiary, YouTube, holding a market share of 97.67%. Not surprisingly, Alphabet’s financials are stellar with 57.2% year-over-year net income growth and 15.4% year-over-year growth in revenue to $80.54 billion. Its balance sheet holds just $30 billion in total debt compared to $110 billion in cash & equivalents.\n\nSo how is Alphabet continuing to fuel growth as a $2.3 trillion company? First, Alphabet is cost-cutting, having laid off more than 12,000 employees in 2023 alone. This contributed to its operating margin increasing to 32% from 25%. Second, it’s heavily investing in its technical infrastructure to support AI and Cloud growth. In Q1 alone, Alphabet’s CapEx was $12 billion, driven by investments in servers and data centers to develop its Gemini models. Lastly, Google is integrating this AI infrastructure into its current product line. YouTube cycles a host of generative AI tools, which led to 50% more channels uploading YouTube Shorts. This led to a 21% year-over-year rise in ad revenues.\n\nSpotify Technology SA (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background.

It is also second in the podcast market, housing 28.2% of podcast listeners. This only adds to the company’s extensive monthly active user (MAU) count of 615 million with 44% of them using the platform daily. This reinforces Spotify’s networking effect: as more users use the platform, friends and family will join as well. Features like Spotify Wrapped add a true social dimension to the app.\n\nStory continues\n\nMonthly active users reach new all-time highs growing 19% year-over-year leading to quarterly revenues of $3.64 billion up about 20% year-over-year. Starting in July, the company announced price hikes for its individual, duo, and family plans by 9%, 13.3%, and 17.7% respectively.\n\nProvided that the company has had a historical monthly churn rate of just 2% and given that its customer conversion rate is 44%, I do not believe these price hikes will significantly impact the company’s user base. SPOT trades at 3.9x sales and has a 0.8-forward Price to earnings ratio divided by its annual EPS Growth (PEG ratio). This is low relative to other music streamers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) at 1.39 or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 2.8. This is easily one of the best social media stocks on the market.\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent (NASDAQ:TCEHY), is China’s largest company and operates in social media, gaming, and eCommerce. While the company’s revenues have grown by 26% since 2020 the stock is down 50% from its all-time high.\n\nIt has a staggering 47% market share in the global gaming industry. Tencent’s WeChat super-app hosts 1.3 billion monthly active users. This is nearly twice the users of Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) which has 676 million monthly active users. Net margins were up 50% quarter-over-quarter driven by improved digital advertising through its AI-powered ad targeting.\n\nTencent has a stellar lineup of games including Fight of Golden Spatula which broke mobile records in China. Other games under Tencent’s umbrella include Valorant, PUBG Mobile, and League of Legends. With more than 140 games and $135 million in annual gross revenue per game, any new release adds to Tencent’s high-margin top-line growth.\n\nAt first glance, TCEHY trades at more than double the EV/EBITDA of peers like Baidu and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). But stronger growth metrics justify shares trading at 14.62x and 16.4x forward earnings. Quarterly revenue growth grew six times that of Baidu’s while net profit margins are 50% higher than BABA. If you are looking for the top social media stocks, start here.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "4 Blue-Chip Stocks to Bet on as Dow Hits Fresh All-Time High",
        "content": "It has been a great 2024 for Wall Street, with all three major indexes hitting multiple record highs. Easing inflation and price pressures have raised optimism surrounding rate cuts, which have fueled the rally.\n\nDow Hits New Record High\n\nOn Jul 15, the Dow edged up 0.5% to close at a record high of 40,211.72 points, to register its 20th record close this year. This is also the blue-chip 30 stock index’s first record close since May 17.\n\nYear to date, the index has gained 6.7% and has now ended in positive territory for the fourth straight session.\n\nThis year’s rally has been primarily driven by tech and semiconductor stocks, which have been boosting the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. The value-oriented Dow has been slow in the race but has still put up an impressive show.\n\nThe Dow’s recent rally is being driven by positive economic data. The consumer price index (CPI) declined 0.1% sequentially in June after remaining unchanged in the previous month and recording its first decline since May 2020. On a year-over-year basis, CPI rose 3.3%, the smallest increase since April 2021.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, also rose 0.1% month over month in June and 3.3% from the year-ago levels. Year-over-year, core CPI was also the smallest since April 2021.\n\nRate Cut Hopes Rise\n\nInflation unexpectedly resumed its climb in the first quarter after declining sharply in 2023, thanks to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary tightening campaign that saw interest rates being hiked by 525 basis points.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is now gearing up for rate cuts, as inflation continues to decline. Last month, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, in his first post-FOMC meeting statement, said that the central bank now sees only one rate cut in 2024.\n\nHowever, even a single 25 basis point rate cut is good news, given that market participants had expected no rate cuts in 2024.\n\nMoreover, the latest FOMC \"dot plot,\" suggests a planned cumulative rate cut of 1% by 2025, which will take the Fed funds rate down to 4.1% by the end of next year. Currently, markets are pricing a rate cut in September, with the possibility of another before the year-end if inflation continues to decline sharply.\n\nOur Picks\n\nGiven the positive sentiment and bright outlook, investors should bet on these four fundamentally strong blue-chip stocks, namely JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL and Walmart, Inc. WMT. These companies are strategically positioned to take advantage of the overall upward trend in the market. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is one of the biggest global banks with assets worth $4.09 trillion and stockholders’ equity worth $336.6 billion as of Mar 31, 2024. With operations in more than 60 countries, JPM is one of the largest financial service firms in the world.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has an expected earnings growth rate of 1.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.7% over the last 60 days. JPM currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN’s online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company’s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish a footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. AMZN also enjoys a dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service space, thanks to Amazon Web Services.\n\nAmazon.com has an expected earnings growth rate of 57.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last 60 days. AMZN presently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nApple Inc.’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone. However, the Services portfolio of AAPL, which includes revenues from cloud services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services, has now become the cash cow. Moreover, non-iPhone devices like Apple Watch and AirPod have gained significant traction.\n\nApple has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.5% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 60 days. AAPL currently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nWalmart has evolved from just being a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer to an omnichannel player. WMT’s product offerings include almost everything from grocery to cosmetics, electronics to stationery, home furnishings to health and wellness products, and apparel to entertainment products, to name a few.\n\nWalmart’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 9.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3% over the past 60 days. WMT presently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Millionaire-Making AI Stocks Set to Ride The Trend for the Long Run",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to significantly impact the global economy and business in the coming years. While some debate sustainability of the current AI-driven growth, investors and traders alike consider AI stocks to buy. With AI technology undoubtedly here to stay, this disruption will reshape the way we work, conduct business and invest.\n\nMultiple stocks have seen dramatic gains in recent years due to AI adoption. However, they may be vulnerable to changes in investor sentiment now. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are getting the lion’s share of headlines and investor interest as they battle it out for the leading edge. Yet, as with the dot-com boom, millionaire-making stocks haven’t grown yet despite witnessing substantial returns.\n\nGenerative AI is expected to add $2.6-4.4 trillion globally in the coming years, allowing ample room for stock growth. As AI applications and technologies become more pervasive, the overall economic benefits are projected to be sizable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile large companies make headlines, smaller players with consistent earnings and projected continued AI-enabled expansion may be worth examining. Let’s explore three stocks to buy for long-term AI-driven returns.\n\nDoubleVerify Holdings (DV) a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer. data infrastructure stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne of the stocks to buy that has the potential to return millions is DoubleVerify Holdings (NYSE:DV). The technology firm provides data analytics and user authentication services for online companies. Its primary focus is helping advertisers reach audiences and achieve effective, quality returns on sales. The company uses AI to increase fraud detection capabilities. It also offers AI as a service to enhance the effectiveness of digital advertising and optimize strategies for individual businesses.\n\nWhat makes DoubleVerify attractive as a growth stock is that it has consistently increased EPS over the last four years. The company is projected to continue doing so this year, delivering a 17% sales growth in 2024. Expanding into new markets like Meta (NASDAQ:META), YouTube and TikTok will probably weigh on its current earnings but is expected to enhance future growth.\n\nThis may explain why analysts are so positive about DV stock. The average price target is currently at $29.12 per share. This represents a potential upside of over 45%, which typically spans for a 1-year period.\n\nZoom (ZM) A woman sitting at a desk waves at a large number of people on the videoconferencing software Zoom (ZM).\n\nSource: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nZoom (NASDAQ:ZM) is an internet communications platform company. It is most known for its shared-screen meetings, which were prevalent during the pandemic. As the end of lockdowns brought a major decline in demand, Zoom now integrates AI into its software. ZM provides a one-stop business solutions platform for arranging communications as companies navigate hybrid work environments.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is trading near pre-pandemic levels after its stock grew approximately ten-fold during the height of the pandemic. This means that ZM stock price is around 90% below its all-time record high. However, the company has since integrated AI and evolved into a tech company trading at a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.3x for a tech. This is well below the S&P 500 average of 29.3.\n\nAnalysts expect continued growth, making Zoom one of the stocks to buy with an average price target signaling over 30% upside. Notably, Zoom has beaten consensus EPS consistently over the prior several earnings reports, with surprises ranging in double-digit territory.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is known for its AutoCAD software, which serves as the backbone of engineering and architectural development.\n\nThe company is positioning itself as the leader in 3D AI evolution through the use of generative AI to produce functional 3D shapes. In addition to AutoCAD, Autodesk offers other products like Fusion 360 and Maya that serve the construction, manufacturing and media industries.\n\nWhile it applies AI to many industries, the company has not seen significant investor interest as its share price is up less than 5% for the year. However, Autodesk is particularly compelling because of its very low expenses due to a subscription-based business model. This results in a gross profit margin of 92%, with the largest cost being sales and marketing to acquire new customers.\n\nAutodesk expects 10% revenue growth in 2024 through consistent growth that is not reliant on short-term AI trends. Also, analysts are optimistic about the ADSK stock, with 19 out of 23 recommending buying Autodesk shares.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "The market is waiting for the latest Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A,NYSE:BRK-B) 13F filing to drop, but based on last quarter’s 13F filing, as well as subsequent disclosures, there’s no need to wait when it comes to finding the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy now.\n\nBesides owning scores of operating businesses large and small, Berkshire, Warren Buffett’s holding company, has an equity portfolio worth around $409 billion. Berkshire’s $181 billion stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) makes up a disproportionate amount of this portfolio.\n\nThe “Oracle of Omaha’s” investment vehicle also continues to hold large, long standing positions in blue-chip stocks like American Express (NYSE:AXP), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, alongside these steadier, are a few interesting growth and value plays that, while perhaps riskier, may offer the greatest opportunity for individual investors. Taking a look at the latest tracking of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, the following seven stand out as top Warren Buffett stocks to buy this quarter.\n\nBYD (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nChina-based BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) has the rare distinction of being an EV stock with the legendary investor’s “seal of approval.” It was in 2008 that Warren Buffett first invested in BYD. That was shortly before the company debuted its first battery electric vehicle.\n\nFlash forward to now, and BYD is not only the top EV maker in China. Its the top automaker in China as well. Moreover BYD is quickly expanding its presence in automotive markets outside China. Although Buffett has been reducing Berkshire’s BYD stake in recent quarters, its this global expansion drive that may suggest a good reason not to follow Buffett’s latest moves, and instead enter or add to a BYDDF stock position.\n\nMany investors have bought other U.S.-listed Chinese EV stocks, in order to gain exposure to the rise of electric vehicles in what has become the world’s largest EV market. However, most of these names are “also-ran” contenders compared to market leader BYD. Not only that, while BYD has home market dominance, and keeps on leveling up on this success by expanding overseas, shares sport a more-than-reasonable valuation relative to growth. At current prices, BYD trades for 22.6x forward earnings.\n\nCitigroup (C) A Citibank (C) sign hangs on a Citibank office in Hong Kong. Citigroup layoffs\n\nSource: TungCheung / Shutterstock.com\n\nCitigroup (NYSE:C) may at first may not seem like one of top Warren Buffett stocks to buy now, but a closer suggests that, among the several bank stocks within the Berkshire portfolio, it may be the strongest opportunity from a risk/reward standpoint.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt current prices, C stock trades for around 10.8x forward earnings. Shares also trade at a 35% discount to book value. This represents a valuation discount to other money center bank stocks, including BAC and JPMorganChase (NYSE:JPM). Yes, Citi has contended with a far greater amount of problems in recent years compared to BAC and JPM. Still, based on Citigroup’s latest results, an ongoing turnaround may be starting to make an impact.\n\nFor the preceding quarter, Citi reported better-than-expected earnings. Alongside this earnings topper, the bank reiterated guidance, and announced plans to purchase $1 billion worth of shares. Share repurchases could help bridge the valuation gap between C and its peers. Confidence with the turnaround may also lead to further gains, even as this factor played a big role in a 36.2% surge higher for shares over the past twelve months. As Buffett maintains his C stock position, consider entering one.\n\nChubb (CB) Illustrative Editorial of Chubb website homepage. Chubb logo visible on display screen. CB stock\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs I recently discussed, Chubb (NYSE:CB) is one of the latest names to join the legion of Warren Buffett stocks. Per Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F filing for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, Buffett’s holding company owns a 6.4% stake in this Swiss-headquartered global property and casualty insurer.\n\nAlso in my recent CB stock discussion, I talked about possible takeover potential from Berkshire. After all, Berkshire is a serial acquirer of insurance companies, many of which it accumulated and held large equity positions in before buying them outright. Still, it remains unclear whether that’s Buffett and Berkshire’s end goal. However, even if a takeover offer is not in the cards, Chubb may nonetheless prove to be a worthwhile long-term investment.\n\nThat could hold true, both for Berkshire, which began building up its positions at lower prices, and for those just entering the stock today. As an insurer, Chubb’s earnings can be volatile, but Chubb’s earnings have steadily climbed over the past few years. So too, have quarterly cash payouts from this “dividend aristocrat.” Other return-of-capital efforts, like CB’s $5 billion share repurchase program, could also provide a boost to long-term annualized returns.\n\nKroger (KR) Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nKroger (NYSE:KR) is another of the Warren Buffett stocks to buy now, due to improved chances that the grocery giant’s proposed merger with Albertson’s (NYSE:ACI) makes it through regulatory challenges. The two companies announced this merger back in 2022, but consummation of the deal has been held up by a legal challenge from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nRegulators in Colorado and Washington State have also taken legal action to prevent this transaction. However, several factors point to Kroger prevailing against the regulators. For instance, Kroger and Albertson’s have once again increased the number of stores that they plan to divest prior to the merger. As Seeking Alpha commentator Chuck Walston pointed out last month, Kroger and Albertson’s may also be able to lay out the argument that merging will help them stay competitive against discount retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT).\n\nIf the deal gets through regulatory scrutiny and is completed, this could have a material impact on KR stock in the years ahead. The resultant cost and growth synergies from the transaction may lead to materially stronger profitability. Perhaps, a higher valuation for KR, which today trades for only 11.8x forward earnings.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) Illustration of phone with dollar sign and other graphics symbolizing fintech displayed on and around it, with a blue background. Fintech Stock Bargains. fintech stocks to buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/ZinetroN\n\nJust like you may find it interesting to know that Warren Buffett invests in EV stocks, you may also find it interesting that Buffett has made some big bets on fintech as well. Nu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is one such example. The Berkshire portfolio includes a 2.9% stake, worth around $1.86 billion, in this Brazil-based digital banking institution.\n\nThanks to international expansion, first throughout Latin America and more recently throughout the world, Nu Holdings has been on a tear in terms of revenue and earnings growth since 2020. According to Seeking Alpha, revenue is up around tenfold during this time frame. Nu has also gone from reporting net losses, to reporting net earnings topping $1 billion.\n\nIt goes without saying that NU stock isn’t exactly “cheap,” at 35x forward earnings. Still, don’t assume this means shares have minimal upside from here. According to sell-side forecasts, earnings are expected to rise by another 47% in 2025. As growth trends appear likely to stay favorable, shares could maintain a rich valuation. From there, the stock could continue to appreciate in value, as the bottom line keeps expanding.\n\nSumitomo (SSUMY) An image of a stock graph with a robotic face overlaid, representing quant trading and machine learning\n\nSource: Semisatch / Shutterstock\n\nSumitomo (OTCMKTS:SSUMY) is one of several large Japanese trading companies that Berkshire Hathaway has invested in since 2023. Other such names that Buffett has added to the Berkshire portfolio include Mitsubishi (OTCMKTS:MSBHF) and Mitsui & Co.(OTCMKTS:MITSY).\n\nSo, among the Berkshire Japan stocks, what makes SSUMY stock in particular one of the Warren Buffett stocks to buy now? In my view, the emergence of another well-known investor active in the stock, emphasis on the word “active.” Back in May, I discussed how activist investor Paul Singer, through his fund Elliott Management, has also acquired a stake in Sumitomo.\n\nSinger has been successful in pushing for activist-style changes at Japanese companies, and could do the same here with SSUMY. With Sumitomo, there may be significant value to unlock. Shares trade for only 8.9x forward earnings, yet the company has been ramping up its exposure to high-growth industries such as raw materials for EV batteries, as well as other “green wave” type businesses. It may take some time to play out, but if Sumitomo continues on with this pivot, divesting non-core assets along the way, it may pave the way to a far higher valuation.\n\nT-Mobile US (TMUS) The logo for T-Mobile is displayed on a sign for an indoor retail storefront.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nT-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) is one of Warren Buffett’s smaller holdings, with Berkshire’s position in the telecom company making up just 0.2% of the overall portfolio. Even so, consider TMUS one of the other Warren Buffett stocks to consider, if only for the prospect of further consistent growth.\n\nAccording to Statista, T-Mobile’s customer base has grown from under 50 million to over 100 million over the course of a decade. Quarterly growth continues to come in at a steady mid single-digit percentage clip. A pending deal to acquire most of USCellular’s (NYSE:USM) operations will add millions more customers to T-Mobile’s network. This deal also means an opportunity to wring out significant cost synergies.\n\nTMUS stock, at nearly 20x forward earnings, trades at a significant premium to its competitors. However, assuming organic growth continues and the USCellular deal proves successful, T-Mobile shares may be poised to stay on an upward trajectory, leading to strong price appreciation in the years ahead. TMUS also began paying out a regular quarterly dividend in 2023. The stock currently sports a 1.09% forward yield, yet the next big leap in profitability could in turn lead to a wave of dividend growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 High-Flying Stocks With Room to Run",
        "content": "The bull market has driven shares of top companies to new highs, but that doesn't mean you have missed the boat. Sometimes stocks that are hitting new highs are the best bet, especially if there are catalysts that can push these stocks even higher in the near term.\n\nHere are two such stocks that are positioned for great returns in the next year and for years to come.\n\n1. Apple\n\nShares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) have climbed 22% this year, with virtually all the gain coming after the company's earnings report in April. Apple continues to show stable financial results heading into the highly anticipated launch of Apple Intelligence, which will bring a suite of new features powered by artificial intelligence (AI) later this year.\n\nIt's been a slow year for Apple's hardware. iPhone sales were slightly down through the first half of the year, with double-digit growth in services the only bright spot. However, Apple could be at the beginning of a long stretch of solid growth.\n\nApple is seeing increasing customer interest in services, which reflects its growing installed base of devices at over 2.2 billion. This large installed base of devices could tee up accelerating iPhone sales, since customers who are still using older devices will need to upgrade to use Apple Intelligence.\n\nApple has a long history of making new technology easy to use and accessible for everyone. This will work to its advantage in the era of AI, which could solidify its brand position and benefit shareholders. The company has massive cash resources to reinvest in new services, technologies, and other opportunities to drive profitable growth for many years.\n\nThe consensus analyst estimate has Apple's earnings growing at an annualized rate of 10%. But those estimates have been trending up this year and may be on the low side of Apple's actual opportunity, as indicated by the performance of Apple stock in the last few months. The stock should deliver strong returns to investors over the next several years.\n\n2. Netflix\n\nNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) stock has soared 34% so far this year, following a surge in the share price in 2023. The company's efforts to convert individuals using shared passwords to paying users has greatly benefited its revenue growth. But the streaming leader is also continuing to focus on delivering higher margins and profits, which could fuel the stock over the next several years.\n\nThe password sharing initiative is driving double-digit growth in revenue, a noticeable acceleration over the single-digit growth in the same period a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Netflix is demonstrating solid growth on the bottom line, too, which makes the stock very compelling right now. Management is committed to showing higher margins every year, while also investing in quality content and other initiatives, such as its ad-supported plan and live sports programming, to grow subscribers. Higher margins drove an 83% year-over-year increase in earnings per share in the first quarter.\n\nNetflix is slated to stream a live boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson in November, which could become a huge opportunity for the company to attract a new subscriber demographic. Live sports streaming will also be crucial in helping Netflix provide more exclusive content to maintain its lead over the competition.\n\nThe ability to deliver balanced growth on the top and bottom lines while investing in new opportunities, including localized content tailored to different regions worldwide, makes Netflix a solid investment for the long term. The consensus analyst estimate has the company's earnings growing 29% per year over the next several years, which could double the share price within the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Stay Far Away From Qualcomm Stock… Until It Hits $150",
        "content": "The expectations are sky-high for Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and other artificial intelligence hardware manufacturers in 2024. Since the prevailing sentiment surrounding Qualcomm is highly optimistic, contrarian investors shouldn’t be too eager to buy Qualcomm stock now.\n\nInvestorsPlace contributor Chris MacDonald reported on the analyst community’s highly ambitious projections for Qualcomm. At the same time, the CEO’s share sale seems to tell a different tale. In addition, a well-known tech-gadget manufacturer’s addition of AI features could put a dent in Qualcomm’s future top-line results.\n\nQualcomm’s Apple Problem\n\nAs InvestorPlace contributor Larry Ramer explained, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is preparing to roll out Apple Intelligence, which includes AI features for some of the company’s products.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOwners of the “iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, as well as iPads and Macs with M1 or newer chips” can look forward to AI-powered features as soon as this fall.\n\nApple’s loyal customers could quickly get used to these AI features. Consequently, Apple’s market share for smartphones and other tech gadgets might grow this year and next year.\n\nThat’s potentially bad news for Qualcomm, which reportedly derives “most” of its revenue from Android devices. Ramer observed that Qualcomm “benefited last quarter from strong sales of AI-capable Android devices.”\n\nSo, investors should be concerned about Apple taking market share from Android devices and thereby diverting an important revenue source from Qualcomm.\n\nChipmaker Chiefs Are Selling Their Shares\n\nA recent report from Barron’s found a pattern that should make overeager Qualcomm investors think twice. In particular, multiple chipmaker chief executives have sold large numbers of their company’s shares.\n\nThe report identified four CEOs and the quantities of their companies’ shares that they sold:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang sold 720,000 shares. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) CEO Sanjay Mehrotra sold 457,280 shares. Coherent (NYSE:COHR) CEO Vincent “Chuck” D. Mattera Jr. sold 15,000 shares and “expects to sell up to 65,000 Coherent shares, and use stock options to acquire and sell up to another 128,620 shares through the end of 2024.” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon sold 40,500 shares.\n\nDo these chief executives know something that most retail stock traders don’t? Do they expect imminent share-price drawdowns?\n\nThese are valid questions in light of the CEO’s share sales – and in light of Qualcomm’s elevated valuation. Qualcomm has a trailing 12-month price-to-sales ratio of around 6x, and that’s quite high. In fact, it’s double the sector median P/S ratio of around 3x.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm Stock: Only Buy It at This Price\n\nWith at least four chipmaker chiefs selling shares of their companies, this isn’t just a fluke. It’s a pattern that should raise eyebrows and raise concerns among Qualcomm’s loyal shareholders.\n\nPlus, the introduction of Apple Intelligence could negatively impact Qualcomm’s top-line stats in the upcoming quarters. Hence, since Qualcomm’s valuation is elevated, stock traders should wait for lower price points.\n\nPreviously, I recommended only buying Qualcomm stock at $150 or less. I won’t win any popularity contests for this, but I’m sticking to my $150 buy-price suggestion. You’ll thank me when the Qualcomm share price gets there, as the buying opportunity will be hard to resist at that point.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL)\n\nApple shares rose to a record high during Monday's trading session and were the number one trending ticker in pre-market trading after Morgan Stanley designated the stock as a \"top pick\" due to the company's artificial intelligence (AI) push to boost device sales.\n\nThe iPhone maker last month unveiled Apple Intelligence, in a bid to lure customers to upgrade their devices to be able to use the new technology. The move came as Apple was seen as lagging behind Alphabet's (GOOG) Google and Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI in the AI race.\n\n\"Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey added that Apple could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years. The investment bank previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years and raised its price target to $273 from $216 based on the new projections.\n\nRead more: LIVE: FTSE 100 and European markets fall after Powell teases 'confidence' in inflation data\n\nThe stock has an average rating of \"buy\" with a median price target of $217, and has outperformed the S&P 500 index this year, according to London Stock Exchange data.\n\nApple stock has risen more than 26% year to date and over 8% in the last month.\n\nOcado (OCDO.L)\n\nOcado said losses narrowed significantly in the latest six-month period, as it lifted its forecasts on signs that demand for online deliveries was picking up again.\n\nThe group reported a £154m ($199.7m) pre-tax loss for the six months to 2 June against losses of £290m a year ago.\n\nIt notched up revenues of £1.54bn for the first half, boosted by a 21.8% surge in its technology solutions business, which powers online grocery businesses and automated warehouses for other retailers.\n\nOcado retail — run as a joint venture with Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) — saw revenues rise 11.3%, helping the division swing to underlying earnings of £20.7m from a £2.5m loss a year earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nOcado has shifted its focus in the last few years to providing B2B robotics and automation services, with some suggesting it could spin out the retail business to focus solely on tech.\n\n“We have come through an unprecedented period for online grocery, with multiple years of high food inflation following a surge in demand during the pandemic. The global channel shift to online has now resumed and Ocado is uniquely well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunity,” Tim Steiner, chief executive of Ocado Group, said.\n\nOcado said it was raising its profit and cash flow guidance for the full year.\n\nRichemont (CFR.SW)\n\nCartier owner Richemont reported a small drop in sales for its fiscal first quarter amid slowing demand for luxury goods, with a slump in Chinese demand pushing the overall result slightly below expectations.\n\nRichemont, which also owns brands including Van Cleef & Arpel, said sales were down 27% in the Greater China region in the three months to the end of June.\n\nThe slump was partially offset by stronger jewellery sales in other countries, with overall sales up 1% at constant exchange rates.\n\nRead more: Stocks to watch this week: Anglo American, Burberry, TSMC and Netflix\n\n“The decline reflected both the low level of consumer confidence and the strong comparatives ranging from double-digit growth in the mainland to triple digits in Hong Kong and Macau over the prior-year period,” Richemont said.\n\nFor the period ending 30 June, the luxury-goods group booked sales of €5.27bn (£4.42bn, $5.74bn), compared with €5.32bn in the prior-year period. The result came broadly in line with analysts’ forecasts of €5.28bn, according to a poll of estimates compiled by Visible Alpha.\n\nRio Tinto (RIO.L)\n\nMining firm Rio Tinto’s London-listed shares fell after it reported second-quarter iron ore shipments below analyst estimates.\n\nIron ore production from the group’s Pilbara assets in Western Australia came in at 79.5 million tonnes, 2% lower than the same period.\n\nRio said productivity gains offset ore depletion but that production and shipping in the quarter were impacted by a train collision in mid-May, which resulted in around six days of lost rail capacity and full stockpiles at some mines.\n\nThe firm's report comes as hopes for more stimulus in China have helped iron ore prices rebound recently after weak demand from the country's construction sector led to a dull first half.\n\n\"The (Chinese) government has provided additional measures for the property market to destock the large inventory overhang,\" Rio said on Tuesday.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "3 Fintech Stocks Riding the AI Wave Higher",
        "content": "The fintech stocks had their heyday back in 2020-21 when it was thought they’d pose a serious threat to the market share of traditional financial institutions (think the banks). When the pandemic lockdowns happened and online shopping went into overdrive in what was a “roaring start” to the 2020s, it seemed like the market’s fintech darlings could only go higher.\n\nThe blistering momentum eventually ran out of steam, and fintech stocks were among the first of the dominoes to fall as the 2022 market sell-off unfolded. Undoubtedly, some of the tech-savviest fintech “disruptors” have still yet to recover. Not only that, but some, like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), have shown little signs of life, with the stock now trading even lower than the lows of 2022.\n\nAs the age of AI unfolds, the fintech firms may just be able to garner enough enthusiasm to get a second wind. Indeed, many financial tech companies have been investing in various AI technologies. And some may lead to returns as AI benefits more closer downstream. Let’s check in on three.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) icon displayed on smartphone with keyboard background. is an American multinational financial technology company operating an online payment\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal held a tech-filled event earlier this year, highlighting a handful of AI-driven innovations that management thought would “revolutionize commerce” and start “the next chapter.” Management and the event’s presenters were pumped. Investors weren’t, even after having more time to digest the finer details of the AI-driven event.\n\nWill new AI-powered PayPal features make things easier for customers? Definitely. But are they revolutionary? Though I wasn’t blown away, I was intrigued, especially if PayPal can add to its arsenal of AI features.\n\nLooking ahead, PayPal must continue investing heavily in AI if PYPL stock is starting to regain some ground. The good news is that management is very serious about placing big bets on AI as the machine learning and fintech worlds meld.\n\nWith Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently attracting regulatory scrutiny over its payment business, perhaps PayPal will have an easier time making a run for the fintech throne. Having a regulatory add hurdles in front of a top rival is always a good thing!\n\nAt 15.1 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), the fintech stock is a bargain in more ways than one.\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD) hood stock: An image of a wallet with a coin in it, a cellphone on top depicting Robinhood logo. Robinhood crypto\n\nSource: salarko/Shutterstock\n\nRobinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) is the platform of choice for many meme stock investors who took to Reddit (NASDAQ:RDDT) to chat about what Roaring Kitty has been up to. Undoubtedly, Robinhood may have a track record for being a speculator’s playground.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegardless, I continue to view the platform as boasting impressive tailwinds in the early innings of a bull market powered by revolutionary new technologies, most notably AI.\n\nThe brokerage firm reportedly acquired AI investment researcher Pluto. Such a deal could help Robinhood further differentiate itself from traditional brokerages. Indeed, Robinhood has always been about using tech to open investing to younger, often tech-savvy customers.\n\nAI-powered investment insights and analysis from Pluto probably won’t help its customers beat the market. However, I do view the move as a boon for trading activity. And it may just draw in users seeking a truly innovative brokerage platform.\n\nAll considered, HOOD stock is a great fintech firm that’s flashier (think those gold credit cards) than the rest.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is a credit card company that, like Robinhood, has really been catching on with young people lately. The only thing flashier than a golden creditcard from Robinhood is American Express’ unmistakable Centurion (black) card. Of course, such an invite-only card is out of reach for most such consumers.\n\nThat said, with increased interest in premium Platinum (and Gold) cards, which entail a fee, American Express has a unique opportunity to bring a wave of new tech to the next generation of paid card customers.\n\nIndeed, the closed-loop system is a unique advantage American Express has over rivals. It can allow American Express to leverage data to give customers the features they want. As the company deploys AI to unearth data from its data resources, it’s hard not to view American Express as one of the most underrated fintech stocks on the market.\n\nIn the meantime, AXP stock looks cheap (and buyable) at 19.7 times trailing P/E ahead of its Friday earnings report.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of American Express and Apple. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nJoey Frenette is a seasoned investment writer specializing in technology and consumer stocks. Contributing to the Motley Fool Canada, TipRanks, and Barchart, Joey excels in spotting mispriced stocks with long-term growth potential in a fast-paced market.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "content": "Apple shares rose to a record high during Monday's trading session after Morgan Stanley designated the stock as a \"top pick\" due to the company's artificial intelligence (AI) push to boost device sales.\n\nLast month, Apple unveiled Apple Intelligence as a way to encourage customers to upgrade their devices to the latest models that have the new built-in AI functionality. The move came as Apple was seen as lagging behind Alphabet's Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI in the AI race.\n\nApple shares reached $236.30 during Monday morning trading to give the company a market value of $3.62 trillion, the highest in the world. Although it has since pared back some of those gains, Apple's stock was up over 1.9% and trading around $235 a share as of early afternoon.\n\n\"Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments,\" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.\n\nAPPLE TOPS MICROSOFT, REGAINS TITLE OF WORLD'S MOST VALUABLE COMPANY Apple's AI push propelled the tech giant's stock to hit an all-time high during Monday's trading session.\n\nThe new Apple Intelligence technology is compatible with only 8% of iPhone and iPad devices and Apple currently has 1.3 billion units of smartphones in use by customers, the analysts noted.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nThey added that Apple could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years. The firm previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years and raised its price target to $273 from $216 based on the new projections.\n\nApple stock has risen more than 26% year to date and over 8% in the last month. It has an average rating of \"buy\" with a median price target of $217, having outperformed the S&P 500 index this year, according to LSEG data.\n\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company thinks \"Apple Intelligence is going to be indispensable to the products that are already such an integral role in our lives.\"\n\nIndustry analysts expect Samsung and Apple to lead a global smartphone market recovery this year amid the buzz around generative AI-enabled smartphones.\n\nApple sold 45.2 million smartphones globally in the three months ending in June, up from 44.5 million a year ago, although its market share fell to 15.8% from 16.6% in the same period, according to IDC data. Apple Intelligence was unveiled during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference at Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California, on June 10, 2024.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Apple hits all-time high as Morgan Stanley touts stock as 'top pick' for AI\n\nView comments",

That comes after the NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel in April approved the use of in-game video.\n\nIn a statement, ACC commissioner Jim Phillips made an “unparalleled prioritization of technology” going back to its design of a new gameday operations center.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks That Could Be Multibaggers in the Making: July Edition",
        "content": "The metaverse has already been through quite the boom-and-bust cycle. The concept burst onto the scene a few years ago, reaching its pinnacle when Mark Zuckerberg renamed his company from Facebook to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Zuckerberg felt that the metaverse would be a key growth avenue, and the company made a splashy Super Bowl ad to highlight its new direction.\n\nHowever, growth hasn’t been nearly as easy as anticipated. Meta’s Horizon Worlds has seen sparse usership thus far. And other tech innovations such as AI have sucked up the oxygen from metaverse investments.\n\nBut the concept of an online meeting space where people can work, collaborate, socialize and play games together remains compelling. And rapid technological advances will broaden the possibilities of the range of experiences in an augmented reality setting.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investing in the augmented reality (AR) space, metaverse stocks possibly could be in for another big run. These are three leading candidates that will prosper if the sector takes off.\n\nUnity (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity (NYSE:U) is one of the two primary graphics engines that video game developers use to produce their games.\n\nUnity’s biggest appeal is its interoperability. A developer can build a game in Unity and quickly release it across console, PC, smartphone, AR and virtual reality (VR). In fact, reports suggested that Mark Zuckerberg considered acquiring Unity to make it a core part of the Oculus ecosystem.\n\nHowever, Unity remained independent. And with U stock now down more than 90% from its all-time highs, shares are near their cheapest ever available price. That could make for a remarkable buying opportunity as Unity gains momentum via partnerships such as its development role for the Apple Vision Pro.\n\nUnity has struggled with monetization, and it generated developer pushback with an unpopular planned price hike last year. The company has had its issues. So, it’s understandable that shares have slipped. But the fall has been excessive, particularly as the company swings to profitability going forward. Any improvement in metaverse sentiment will further speed up the ensuing recover in Unity’s stock price.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is one of China’s leading tech companies. Run as a conglomerate, TCEHY owns and operates a broad array of businesses while maintaining ownership stakes in numerous other companies as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s no secret that China’s economy has been in a tailspin recently, and investors have shunned the country’s stocks. That includes TCEHY shares, which are down almost 50 percent from their all-time highs. At just 16 times forward earnings, Tencent Holdings is an excellent way to play the recovery in the Chinese technology space.\n\nAnd it’s a leading metaverse property as well. Tencent Holdings is a leading video game developer, and it also invests in other peers in that space. In particular, its large holding in Epic Games gives it a particular leg up in the metaverse space.\n\nThat’s because Epic runs Fortnite, which is arguably the most successful metaverse property to date. Fortnite has gained incredible mind share with younger players which has allowed it to attract large international brands who have set up digital stores in the Fortnite universe. Additionally, Fortnite hosts concerts and media events which attract players for unique experiences and allow all sorts of branding, product sales and other monetization opportunities.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) sign near Qualcomm Research Silicon Valley office of San Diego based chip and semiconductor company\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a large semiconductor company focused on the mobile communications market.\n\nHistorically, Qualcomm built its business by designing and licensing the 3G and then 4G technologies that underpin modern mobile communications technology. Qualcomm is pivotal in 5G rollouts now. Yet, it has also diversified, such as with its Snapdragon platform for smartphones and tablets.\n\nThat brings us to Qualcomm’s cutting-edge technologies. The company’s stock has soared over the past year thanks to its AI-enabled chips, which can power leading AI applications in a mobile setting.\n\nIn addition, Qualcomm is investing heavily in the metaverse. It has set aside $100 million for its Snapdragon Metaverse Fund to foster innovation in the space. And Qualcomm is positioning its combination of 5G, spatial intelligence, advanced hardware and high-sensitive cameras as key tools to power up future metaverse experiences.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in U, META, and QCOM stock.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. was named a top pick at Morgan Stanley, with the broker seeing the launch of the tech giant’s artificial intelligence platform triggering a record rush among users to upgrade their smartphones, tablets and computers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Shooting Changes Biden’s Plan to Revive 2024 Campaign BlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm’s Ad Trump Emerges Defiant From Rally Attack Set to Shake Up ’24 Race I Was at the Trump Rally Where He Was Shot. Here Is What I Saw Global Markets Ramp Up the ‘Trump Trade’ After Rally Attack\n\nAnalyst Erik Woodring boosted his price target on the tech giant’s shares to $273, the third-highest among analysts tracked by Bloomberg, saying Apple Intelligence has potential to drive a record number of device upgrades. The feature is a “clear catalyst” for a multi-year upgrade cycle, he wrote in a note Monday.\n\nThe highest price target for Apple shares comes from Loop Capital, which on Monday raised the stock to buy from hold and boosted its objective to $300 from $170.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s Woodring forecasts Apple will ship almost 500 million iPhones over the next two years — higher than the record cycle in 2021-2022.\n\nApple unveiled its suite of AI services in June at its Worldwide Developers Conference, with Senior Vice President Craig Federighi describing it as “AI for the rest of us.” Shares hit their first record high of the year following the reveal.\n\nShares in Apple rose 1.9% to $234.90 at 7 a.m. New York time in premarket trading. Through Friday’s close, the shares have risen 17% since the company unveiled Apple Intelligence, outpacing the Nasdaq 100 Index’s 7% gain over the same period.\n\n“We believe that there is record level of pent-up demand entering the iPhone 16 cycle later this year,” wrote Woodring, who has an overweight rating on the stock. “Coming out of WWDC — where Apple debuted Apple Intelligence — we have even greater conviction that FY25 could be the start of a multi-year device refresh cycle.”\n\nApple Intelligence will “deliver much improved, and unique-to-the-Apple-ecosystem utility value” for more than 1.3 billion users, Woodring said, adding that it will force device upgrades and accelerate product replacement cycles — a key catalyst that has historically driven Apple stock outperformance.\n\nOnly 15% Apple’s total installed user base will be able to support Apple Intelligence because the technology will be limited to devices using A17 Pro and M-Series chips, Woodring said. While a majority of Mac users will be able to use it, just 8% of current iPhone and iPad users will be able to power the AI platform. Under the analyst’s estimates, more than 1.2 billion iPhones, iPads and Macs will need to be upgraded.\n\nStory continues\n\nInitial adoption of Apple Intelligence will be limited to US English iPhone users when it launches this fall. Still, Woodring sees factors such as the broadening of non-English functionality adding even more value to users over the next 12 to 24 months. In Woodring’s view, it sets Apple up for a return to year-over-year unit growth in FY2025, followed by a potential for a major cycle in FY2026.\n\nApple’s annual sales in India hit a record of nearly $8 billion, Bloomberg News reported Monday, underscoring a rapidly growing market where the iPhone maker now assembles more of its devices and operates two flagship stores.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs French Elections Result Is Least Worst Outcome for Business\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The ‘Magnificent Seven’ stocks grew 46% in the last 5 years. How much longer does the term have to run?",
        "content": "Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett popularized the “Magnificent Seven” as a stock term just over a year ago. The movie-inspired moniker refers to Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, which accounted for half of the S&P 500’s total gains last year, according to a report from Morgan Stanley. Like the acronym FAANG before it, the \"Magnificent Seven\" has served as a strategy for some investors—raising the question of how much longer this particular basket of stocks will have an outsize influence.\n\nWhether the term—a reference to an acclaimed 1960 western that Hartnett used in a May 2023 note to investors—has outgrown its relevance is up for debate. What’s not is that shareholders have been rewarded with a combined annualized return of over 46% in the last five years, compared to just over 13% for the S&P.\n\nAngelo Zino of CFRA Research said he expects the earnings trajectory of these seven names to continue to outperform the market over the next decade.\n\n“They're what we view as growth at a reasonable price,” Zino said.\n\nThose high-quality earnings, Zino said, have been especially attractive in a high-interest rate environment, even before the artificial intelligence boom captivated markets.\n\nThe struggles of some members of the Magnificent Seven (particularly Tesla) early in 2024, fears of overconcentration risk, and the emergence of other players in the AI race, however, have analysts like Baird’s Ted Mortonson questioning whether the phrase should remain in fashion.\n\n“Talking about just the Magnificent Seven, you're missing a large swath of other names that could compound returns pretty aggressively in the next two to three years,” he said.\n\nMagnificent Seven present both AI opportunity and defensive play\n\nThe importance of large-cap stocks to the market is not a new phenomenon. A January report from Vanguard found that out of thousands of stocks, only 72 had accounted for half of the market’s total returns since 1926. The trend held even when excluding the explosion of mega-cap tech growth that has inspired several acronyms over the last decade.\n\nCNBC’s Jim Cramer popularized the term FANG (for Facebook parent Meta, Amazon, Netflix, and Google parent Alphabet) in 2013. Eventually, a second A was included to include Apple.\n\nThat term would eventually give way to the Magnificent Seven, a gorup of companies who boast a combined market capitalization of over $16 trillion and loom large in not just the markets but daily life. All seven companies, Zino said, have massive ecosystems that will presumably become only easier to monetize in the age of AI.\n\nStory continues\n\n“These are names that each one of us use to some capacity every single day of our lives,” he said.\n\nThis visibility helps makes these stocks a relative safety net for investors, Zino said. In a market plagued by election fears and geopolitical risks, Mortonson explained, institutional investors demand names sporting massive free cash flows.\n\n“They're almost becoming somewhat defensive plays in a down market just because they are so profitable and dominant,” Mortonson said.\n\nTech behemoths maintain long-term relevance\n\nThe struggles of Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet early in 2024 led some analysts to start dubbing the other four big tech stocks the “Fab Four,” though shares of Apple and Alphabet recovered to outpace the S&P, while a recent Tesla rally virtually erased its year-to-date losses. Bank of America analysts expect growth to broaden out as second-quarter earnings get underway.\n\nIn the near term, Zino believes the sharp outperformance of the Magnificent Seven could cool down as some fund managers reallocate their positions to more value-oriented areas that have underperformed. That doesn’t mean he thinks these companies are going anywhere, particularly in the age of AI.\n\n“We're hard pressed to think that these [Magnificent Seven] names aren't going to be among the biggest winners out there,” he said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple upgraded, Electronic Arts downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls",
        "content": "Apple upgraded, Electronic Arts downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nLoop Capital upgraded Apple (AAPL) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $300, up from $170. Loop's supply chain work suggests that Apple has an opportunity the next few years to solidify itself as consumer's generative artificial intelligence \"base camp\" of choice, just as it did for social media 15 years ago with the iPhone and digital content consumption 20 years ago with the iPod. Morgan Stanley upgraded Alcon (ALC) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $85, up from $65. The firm's prior downgrade of the stock was predicated on a sluggish U.S. premium IOL market, and while that risk remains, \"there can be no doubt\" that Alcon has found other factors that have more than offset the risk, diminishing the bear case, the firm tells investors. BMO Capital upgraded UDR (UDR) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $45, up from $39. BMO's recent discussion with private owner Carmel Partners reinforced its view that coastal fundamentals have continued to be strong, in particular Washington, D.C., UDR's largest market. RBC Capital upgraded TD Synnex(SNX) to Outperform from Sector Perform with a price target of $140, up from $135. The firm says solid growth in advanced solutions driven by data center builds and cloud deployments, Hyve customer ramp, PC refresh cycle, and demand for AI-powered PCs should improve TD Synnex's billings growth to mid-single-digits in the second half of 2024 with likely further improvement in fiscal 2025. Baird upgraded Carrier Global(CARR) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $75, up from $64. The firm sees multiple catalysts that could play out over the next 12-18 months for the company, including asset sales, buybacks and reaccelerating residential trends.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nCiti downgraded Electronic Arts(EA) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $161, up from $148. Since the fiscal Q2 results, EA's shares have risen 15% on optimism around the upcoming release of College Football, and while bullish on the release, Citi has some concerns, including potential weakness at Apex Legends, potential crowding out from GTA IV's release in Q4 of 2025, and macro risk if consumer spending moderates. TD Cowen downgraded Travelers (TRV) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $230, down from $252, citing uncertainty about whether modest adverse development for liability coverages in Q1 in recent accident years is a sign of more to come. Citi downgraded On Semiconductor(ON) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $77, down from $85. The firm believes the company's silicon carbide exposure will hurt its multiple. Wells Fargo downgraded SBA Communications(SBAC) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $220, down from $230. Despite some interest rate cute enthusiasm, the company's fundamentals will remain \"relatively weak\" near-term with no funds from operations inflection until 2027 and a lack of a discernible catalyst on the horizon, the firm tells investors in a research note. Susquehanna downgraded Caesars Entertainment (CZR) to Negative from Neutral with a price target of $33, down from $44. The firm believes the stock's underperformance versus MGM Resorts (MGM) is very likely to continue.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nEvercore ISI initiated coverage of Datadog (DDOG) with an Outperform rating and $150 price target. After \"treading water\" for two years, Datadog has matured to a point and grown into its valuation so that it can become a more consistent compounder over the next 12-24 months, the firm tells investors in a research note. Baird initiated coverage of SentinelOne (S) with an Outperform rating and $25 price target. Despite a slight fiscal 2025 guidance down-revision, SentinelOne maintains a strong growth trajectory, the firm tells investors in a research note. Baird initiated coverage of Rubrik (RBRK) with an Outperform rating and $42 price target. target. Rubrik stands out as a \"top-tier data security vendor, seamlessly integrating backup and security amid surging data and cyber threats,\" the firm argues. Baird initiated coverage of Tenable Holdings(TENB) with an Outperform rating and $55 price target. The firm sees upside potential amid \"modest\" growth expectations, favorable market dynamics, and the company's strategic expansion into federal markets, diversifying its revenue streams. Truist initiated coverage of Zeta Global(ZETA) with a Buy rating and $23 price target. Zeta is \"a potential disruptive force\" in the large and growing marketing tech space, serving enterprises with unique combination of data, AI-powered intelligence, marketing cloud and activation capabilities, the firm tells investors.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Apple's shares rose about 2% on Monday after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the iPhone maker's shares and designated the stock as a \"top pick,\" citing the company's AI efforts as a boost to device sales.\n\nIn what was seen as a move to catch up with Alphabet's Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the iPad maker last month unveiled Apple Intelligence, luring customers to upgrade their devices to be able to use the new technology.\n\nApple's shares, which have jumped nearly 20% this year, rose to $235.37 before the bell, giving the company a market value of about $3.6 trillion, the highest in the world.\n\n\"Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said.\n\nThe new technology is compatible with only 8% of iPhone and iPad devices and Apple has 1.3 billion units of smartphones currently in use by customers, the analysts said, adding that the company could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years.\n\nMorgan Stanley, which previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years, raised its price target on the company's shares to $273 from $216.\n\nThe stock has an average rating of \"buy\" with a median price target of $217, and has outperformed the S&P 500 index this year, according to LSEG data.\n\nIndustry analysts expect Samsung and Apple to lead the charge in global smartphone market recovery this year given the buzz around GenAI-enabled smartphones.\n\nApple sold 45.2 million smartphones globally in the three months ending June, up from 44.5 million a year earlier, but its market share fell to 15.8% from 16.6% in the same period, according to IDC data.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2024 Is Halfway Over. Here Are My Top 5 Stock Picks to End the Year",
        "content": "With 2024 halfway done, many investors are assessing their portfolios to see how their picks have performed. While a six-month time span isn't enough to define success or failure in investing, it is a good chance for investors to examine their holdings to see if anything needs to be added.\n\nSo, if you're looking to deploy some cash to increase your exposure in the market, starting with these five is a great idea.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has had a strong year, up 35%. This rise is thanks to its strong advertising performance and the company finally getting its artificial intelligence (AI) product launches right. Alphabet has some serious momentum heading into the second half of the year, yet it doesn't carry a premium price tag.\n\nUnlike other big tech companies that trade for more than 30 times forward earnings, Alphabet commands a 25 times forward earnings premium. While that may not be historically cheap, it is inexpensive in today's market.\n\nWith Alphabet's success and reasonable price tag, I'm confident Alphabet will continue to excel throughout the latter half of 2024.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nSimilarly to Alphabet, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has had tremendous success with its advertising business. Meta is the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, and Messenger, and thrives on advertising.\n\nWhile 2023 wasn't a great year for advertising, 2024 has been phenomenal. In the first quarter, Meta's ad revenue was $35.6 billion, up 27% year over year. That strength is expected to continue throughout this year and bodes well for a company many wrote off a few years ago for shrinking profit margins. META Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nLike Alphabet, Meta isn't historically cheap, but it is less expensive than its peers at 26 times forward earnings. Even though Meta has also had a successful 2024 so far, I think it's poised for more upside to end the year.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is a backdoor way to play AI investing. TSMC is behind many of the chips powering the AI technological wave. It's also a major supplier for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which may see a boost thanks to its new AI technology requiring new-generation phones.\n\nAdditionally, Taiwan Semi's 3 nanometer chip production is ramping up, which will drive increased revenue for the business. Next-generation 2nm chips are slated to start production sometime in 2025, and the hype leading up to the launch could drive TSMC's stock higher.\n\nAlthough the stock is a bit pricey at 29 times forward earnings, I think it could go higher as the demand for AI-related chips picks up.\n\nStory continues\n\n4. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is often called the Amazon of Latin America due to its e-commerce business and logistics network. However, it also has a thriving fintech wing. MercadoLibre's business has been on fire lately, with its Q1 results delivering 94% year-over-year revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis.\n\nMercadoLibre's profit margins have also been ticking up. In Q1 2023, it was 6.3%. In 2024, that figure rose to 7.9%. As MercadoLibre's margins continue to rise, its valuation will start to normalize, but until then, using a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is smarter. MELI PS Ratio Chart\n\nAt 5.5 times sales, MercadoLibre is still well below where it has traded for most of the past decade. If the market wakes up and realizes this, MercadoLibre stock could easily rocket higher to end the year.\n\n5. Salesforce\n\nLastly is Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). Salesforce is the leader in the customer relationship management software space but hit a bump with its earnings report for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2025 (ended April 30). Although it kept its full-year revenue guidance at the same level (8% to 9% growth), its Q2 growth is only expected to be between 7% and 8%.\n\nThat's slower than investors want to see, and the stock got shelled because of it, losing about 20% of its value the following trading day. That's a massive overreaction, considering that the full-year guidance stayed the same. While the stock has partially recovered since that tumble, Salesforce still looks attractive because its profit margins have room for expansion.\n\nThis is reflected in Salesforce's guidance for operating cash flow growth of 21% to 24% for the full year. Although it's not as cheap as it once was, Salesforce still makes for an excellent buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Billion-dollar companies are some of the most valuable companies. They lead the stock market and have become an integral part of the economy. Once, such companies were a rarity, but today there are many. These billion-dollar stocks are vying for the trillion-dollar spot and as they chart the upward journey, it is time to give them a spot in your portfolio so that you can be a part of their success.\n\nThese are, of course, highly profitable businesses with an edge in the industry. They are known to offer the best products and services to meet the demands of users and they have a growth strategy that works in their favor. Here are seven billion-dollar stocks that deserve a place in your portfolio this year. Let’s take a look at them in detail.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top pharmaceutical companies, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) has a market valuation of $893 billion, and it is one of the best stocks to own right now. The company is known for the weight loss drug Zepbound. As compared to the other drugs, Zepbound leads to a faster weight loss which has taken the company’s sales by storm. It generates the majority of revenue for Eli Lilly.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, LLY is struggling to meet the demand for its weight loss. But the pharmaceutical company is not limited to just one drug. Its Alzheimer’s drug, Donanemab was recently approved. And it is also working on other two weight loss drugs, one being an oral pill.\n\nIt is buying Morphic Holding (NASDAQ:MORF) for $3.2 billion, the company develops treatments for chronic diseases, and the deal will help Eli Lilly expand into the gastroenterology medical segment. Undoubtedly, Eli Lilly is one of the best pharma stocks to own. Currently LLY stock is up 60% year-to-date, and is an ideal stock split candidate.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) biggest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is another billion-dollar stock with a significant upside potential. While AMD stock hasn’t rallied as much as Nvidia, it is slowly but steadily making an upward stride. Trading at $181 today, the stock is up 31% YTD and looks undervalued to me. There are multiple catalysts working for the company.\n\nArtificial Intelligence will boost the company’s revenue and as the business grows, its revenue will soar. In the first quarter, it saw the data center sales grow 80% YOY and it is expecting to achieve sales of $4 billion from the MI300 this year. The company is expanding its reach by buying Silo AI, the largest private AI lab for $665 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the data center business grows, AMD will see rapid growth but investors should not compare it to Nvidia. The company is charting its own path to success and might not be number one but is a compelling investment with a market cap of $294 billion. Wells Fargo has recently increased the price target of the stock to $205, an 11% upside.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) has become a hot stock this year. Up 84% YTD, it is exchanging hands for $187 right now and there’s no stopping its upward momentum. Driven by AI frenzy, the stock has had one of its best years.\n\nThe company recently reported second-quarter revenue and easily beat market expectations. Its revenue came in at $20.67 billion, representing a 40% growth in the quarter. TSM is one of the best billion-dollar stocks to own.\n\nA supplier to industry stalwarts, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia, TSM has managed to offset the weak smartphone sales with a surge in AI chip sales. Buying the stock below $200 could be a smart move. This stock is going to hit new highs with the current AI hype.\n\nTo keep up with the rising demand, it has planned capital expenditure in the range of $28 billion to $32 billion this year and it will be focused on enhancing the technology capacities. It is also expanding in Japan and Europe to ensure effective demand responsiveness.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother tech company seeing massive highs is Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). A legacy software company, Oracle has been around for a long time now and it understands how the market works. The company has benefited from the global transition towards cloud and its cloud infrastructure revenue has seen a massive upside.\n\nExchanging hands for $142, the stock is up 39% YTD and has been on an upward rally since May. Its fundamentals are impressive and the company enjoys a dividend yield of 1.12%, rewarding investors with passive income.\n\nKnown for offering the best AI data center infrastructure globally, Oracle saw a 44% jump in outstanding performance obligations in the recent quarter, including new AI deals of $12.5 billion.\n\nThe data center revenue jumped 42% YOY and the company is already building 100 new data centers to meet the global demand. It has partnered with some of the top tech giants and the soaring AI demand could boost its valuation. The stock will hit $200 this year.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nStreaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a household name today with the company valued at $281 billion. While it is nowhere close to a trillion-dollar valuation, it is steadily moving higher and taking giant strides in the industry. Up 38% YTD, NFLX stock is exchanging hands for $647 and is a long-term buy and hold.\n\nIt is the largest player in the streaming space and has seen massive subscriber growth. It added 9.3 million subscribers in the first quarter to reach about 270 million. The company’s investment in new content has made it a top choice for viewers. No other streaming giant comes close to its market share.\n\nNetflix is looking for different ways to attract users and drive growth and video games are one of them. It is growing the game library and has about 100 game titles with 32 experiences on the platform. They are free right now but the management could consider monetizing this segment very soon. It is also expanding into sports and live entertainment.\n\nThe company is set to report results on July 18 and the stock is a buy before that.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nFintech giant Visa (NYSE:V) is one of the top billion-dollar stocks worth adding to your portfolio for the long-term. The company is valued at $525 billion and the stock has remained flat over the past six months. It is exchanging hands for $265 today and has been moving in the range of $258 to $290 since the beginning of the year. One solid reason to own the stock is its reliability and steady performance.\n\nVisa has a global presence which ensures it remains stable even in market ups and downs. The company generates a fee on every transaction processed through the Visa card and as we move towards cashless transactions, the demand for cards will grow and Visa will benefit. With more than 4 billion cards issued, the company is one of the top fintech players right now.\n\nDespite a high-interest environment and inflationary pressure, the company reported a 10% revenue jump and an 11% rise in processed transactions in the first quarter. You may not see an immediate upside in the stock, but it is a highly dependable stock to own. Visa also enjoys a dividend yield of 0.79%.\n\nChevron (CVX) CVX stock\n\nSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you are a dividend investor, you are going to love Chevron (NYSE:CVX) stock. The oil and gas giant had some of its best days in 2022 with oil prices soaring. While it is down from the highs it achieved then, CVX stock is up 4% YTD and exchanging hands for $155.\n\nThe company is valued at a market cap of $286 billion and while many believe that its best days are over due to the transition towards renewables, I tend to disagree.\n\nThe transition is going to take a few years and then too, the demand for oil will never drop to zero. Chevron has an upward and downward stream business that steadily generates cash flow. As the oil prices soar, Chevron benefits, and with oil trading close to $80 per barrel, it will continue to see revenue growth.\n\nThe company has also invested in the hydrogen sector and is trying to diversify its revenue streams. It is a cash flow machine with a dividend yield of 4.20% and a history of 37 years of hiking dividends.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Top Buffett Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Haul",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is one of the world's most closely followed billionaire investors because his investment-driven conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the past four decades. Therefore, buying some shares of Berkshire Hathaway is still a smart move for investors who want to generate stable long-term gains without doing too much homework.\n\nEven if you don't want to directly invest in Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate's investment portfolio is still a great starting point for finding some blue chip winners. I personally believe three of Berkshire Hathaway's tech holdings -- Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW) -- will head higher in the future. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple accounts for 44.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's entire portfolio. Buffett started buying Apple in the first quarter of 2016 and now owns 5.1% of the entire tech giant, which is now trading nearly 480% above his average purchase price of $39.60.\n\nFrom fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last September), Apple's revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% as its earnings per share (EPS) grew at a CAGR of 17%. The company bought back nearly 30% of its shares over the past seven years.\n\nApple achieved that stable growth even as the pandemic, tougher competition in China, and supply-chain constraints disrupted its sales of iPhones. The company still generates more than half of its revenue from the iPhone but has been diversifying its business by expanding its services ecosystem, which now serves more than 1 billion subscribers. It's launched new products like the Vision Pro, and locked in its users with new artificial intelligence (AI)-oriented services.\n\nWith $162 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of its latest quarter, Apple still has plenty of ways to expand its business with fresh investments and acquisitions. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect it to grow its revenue at a steady CAGR of 5% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 10%. The stock isn't cheap at 31 times forward earnings but could continue rising over the next decade as it diversifies its portfolio with new products and services.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's 0.1% stake in Amazon accounts for about 0.5% of its entire portfolio. Buffett started buying Amazon in the first quarter of 2019, and it's risen nearly 140% from his average purchase price of $84.20.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2023, Amazon's revenue rose at a CAGR of 20% as its EPS grew at a CAGR of 26%. Its e-commerce and cloud infrastructure businesses experienced a major growth spurt during the onset of the pandemic in 2020, but it struggled with tougher year-over-year comparisons as those tailwinds dissipated. Inflation and other macro headwinds further throttled the growth of both of those core businesses in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut in 2023, Amazon's e-commerce business stabilized as it benefited from faster delivery speeds, the growth of its integrated ads, and its expansion into more overseas markets. Its cloud growth also accelerated again as more companies upgraded their infrastructure to support bigger workloads and AI applications. With $85 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of its latest quarter, Amazon also has plenty of ways to expand its retail, cloud, and digital-media ecosystems.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect the company's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 11% and 37%, respectively. Its stock isn't cheap at 44 times forward earnings, but its dominance of the e-commerce and cloud markets justifies its higher valuation.\n\n3. Snowflake\n\nBuffett usually avoids hypergrowth tech stocks, but he invested in Snowflake during its initial public offering (IPO) in 2020. Berkshire only holds a 1.8% stake in Snowflake and it's just 0.2% of its entire portfolio, but it's still up about 14% from its IPO price of $120.\n\nSnowflake's cloud-based data warehousing services pull data from a wide range of computing platforms into a centralized location so it can be easily accessed by third-party apps. The market's booming demand for well-organized data, which can be fed to analytics and AI applications, lit a fire under Snowflake's business over the past few years.\n\nIts revenue surged at a CAGR of 80% from fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), but analysts only expect it to grow at a CAGR of 24% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027. That deceleration, which it mainly blamed on the macro headwinds, spooked the bulls. But as Snowflake's sales growth cooled off, it turned profitable on a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis in fiscal 2022 with an EPS of $0.01 -- then grew that figure to $1.08 in fiscal 2024.\n\nSnowflake's stock has declined about 66% from its all-time high of $401.89 on Nov. 16, 2021, but it admittedly doesn't look cheap at 250 times its forward adjusted earnings and 13 times this year's sales. Yet if we take the long-term view, I believe Snowflake could gradually expand and evolve into a much larger cloud software company. If that happens, investors who buy this stock at this slight premium to its IPO price could be well-rewarded over the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s iPhone shipments stabilized in the June quarter as the wider smartphone market accelerated its growth, according to independent research.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Shooting Changes Biden’s Plan to Revive 2024 Campaign Trump Emerges Defiant From Rally Attack Set to Shake Up ’24 Race I Was at the Trump Rally Where He Was Shot. Here Is What I Saw BlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm’s Ad Trump’s Bloodied, Defiant Image After Shooting Pumps Up His Base\n\nGlobal smartphone shipments rose 6.5%, according to IDC, while sales to consumers jumped 6%, per Counterpoint Research figures. Aggressive discounts around China’s 618 shopping festival helped entice consumers in the world’s biggest mobile market, where Xiaomi Corp. and a resurgent Huawei Technologies Co. have been making inroads this year. The new research adds to data from Chinese authorities showing the iPhone staging a recovery since March.\n\nIDC said Apple shipped 45.2 million handsets in the quarter, a 1.5% improvement on the same period a year earlier. Counterpoint’s figures, which address end-user sales, showed a 1% decline, and both research groups found the iPhone giving up market share. Xiaomi was the biggest riser, largely powered by entry-level handsets and emerging markets.\n\nThe iPhone has been under pressure in China from local players as well as a government ban on foreign devices at state-run workplaces. Discounts and the promise of new artificial intelligence enhancements has helped steady sales for Apple and market leader Samsung Electronics Co., which is also promoting a new generation of phones with AI additions.\n\n“Apple’s momentum in Q2 improved significantly from the negative growth they saw in first quarter,” said IDC research director Nabila Popal. “This is in part due to heavy discounts and promotions in many regions but also thanks to renewed customer confidence after WWDC when Apple finally announced its AI strategy.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs French Elections Result Is Least Worst Outcome for Business Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 3 Years From Now",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) recently became the world's most valuable company again with a market cap of $3.57 billion. Its stock rallied more than 60% over the past three years, even as iPhone sales cooled off amid tougher macro and competitive headwinds.\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 (ended last September) to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Apple's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% as its earnings per share (EPS) rises at a CAGR of 10%. That growth will likely be driven by a cyclical recovery in iPhone sales, an expansion into higher-growth markets like India, and the evolution of Apple's subscription ecosystem that hosts over a billion subscribers. Apple will also likely repurchase tens of billions of dollars in shares every year to boost its EPS. Image source: Apple.\n\nThose growth rates make Apple a stable long-term investment, but they're a bit weak for a stock that trades at 35 times forward earnings and 9 times this year's sales. Therefore, Apple's valuations might have been inflated by the recent hype regarding its generative AI plans for its first-party apps. Assuming Apple meets Wall Street's estimates and still trades at the same price-to-sales ratio by fiscal 2026, its market cap could grow about 12% to $4.01 billion by the final year.\n\nThat market cap would still make Apple one of the world's most valuable companies, but I believe three of its trillion-dollar peers -- Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) -- could eclipse its valuation over the next three years.\n\nThe key differences between these tech titans\n\nApple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet operate different business models. Apple generates more than half of its revenue from the iPhone, but it relies on its services business to drive most of its growth. Nvidia generates most of its revenue by selling high-end data centers for processing AI tasks.\n\nMicrosoft generates over half of its revenue from its cloud businesses, which include its Azure cloud infrastructure platform, Office 365 productivity services, and Dynamics customer relationship management (CRM) services. Alphabet generates most of its revenue from Google's advertising business, which includes its search and display ads, its advertising network, and YouTube. However, its smaller Google Cloud business is growing at a much faster clip than its core advertising business.\n\nAll four companies have been expanding their generative AI ecosystems. Apple recently integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT into its own apps and announced new generative AI features for creating images and writing text. Microsoft, which is OpenAI's top investor, integrates the start-up's generative AI tools into its own cloud-based services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet has been upgrading its Gemini generative AI platform to keep up with OpenAI, and it's been rolling out those tools across its entire ecosystem. Nvidia profits from that secular trend by selling the best \"picks and shovels\" for the AI gold rush.\n\nAll three tech giants are growing faster than Apple\n\nBut out of these four companies, only Apple generates most of its sales from a slower-growth and cyclical consumer electronics business. Nvidia is a high-growth chipmaker, Microsoft is a cloud and AI play, and Alphabet is a digital advertising company. That's why analysts expect all three companies to grow faster than Apple over the next three years.\n\nCompany Estimated Revenue CAGR (Next 3 Fiscal Years) Estimated EPS CAGR (Next 3 Fiscal Years) Current Market Capitalization Price-to-Sales Ratio (Forward) Apple 5% 10% $3.57 billion 9 Nvidia 46% 53% $3.26 billion 28 Microsoft 15% 17% $3.47 billion 14 Alphabet 11% 20% $2.37 billion 7\n\nData source: MarketScreener.\n\nAssuming they match those estimates and their price-to-sales ratios hold steady, Nvidia could be worth $5.3 trillion by fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027), Microsoft would be worth $4.5 trillion by fiscal 2026 (which ends in June 2026), and Alphabet's market cap could reach $3 trillion. But with the same price-to-sales ratio as Microsoft, Alphabet's market cap could nearly reach $6 trillion. Therefore, all three tech giants have a shot at eclipsing Apple's market cap over the next three years.\n\nBut look beyond the market caps\n\nIt's interesting to track the market caps of the world's largest companies, but it's a superficial approach that glosses over their core strengths and weaknesses.\n\nAll four of these \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks will likely keep growing. Apple is a rock-solid investment in the mobile computing market, Microsoft and Google are evolving into cloud and AI companies, and Nvidia is still arguably the best pure play on the AI accelerator chip market. So instead of wondering which tech giant will be the most valuable in three years, investors should simply focus on their ability to expand their ecosystems, widen their moats, and generate consistent growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Best AI Value Stocks That are ‘Money Machines’ According to NYU’s Aswath Damodaran. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nAswath Damodaran is a Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. His thoughts on economy and stock valuations are given a lot of weight by analysts. Damodaran in his recent interview with CNBC said that Magnificent Seven stocks have become the “value stocks for investors who care about earnings and cash flows.”\n\n“We look at the last year and a half, they’ve added $8.8 trillion in market cap… just these seven companies. Just to give you perspective, the second-largest market in the world, China, has a market cap of $12.1 trillion. These seven stocks alone have added more in market cap than the entire German market, the French market, the Swiss market.”\n\nDamodaran’s comments are important because he’s been repeatedly saying in the past that major technology companies are fully or overvalued. In September, he said on CNBC that if you go through the list of top tech stocks, “you are more likely to be overvalued than undervalued.”\n\nBut in his latest interview, Damodaran said that before we “dismiss” Mag. 7 stocks as “risky tech companies,” we should keep in mind that “these are the money machines in this market.”\n\nHowever, when asked whether he believes we are not in any kind of “danger zone,” the professor said we are in the danger zone not just in terms of these seven stocks, but the market overall.\n\nIn this article we take a look at the Mag 7. stocks and their AI-related growth catalysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Best AI Value Stock That is ‘Money Machine’ According to NYU’s Aswath Damodaran?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nAswath Damodaran believes Apple, which is part of the Mag. 7 group of stocks, has become a money machine. In October last year, while talking to CNBC, the professor recommended investors to hold on to Apple shares. He said at the time that the biggest risk for Apple is not being able to catch up on the next upgrade cycle of iPhone. However, he reiterated that Apple has become the company for “all seasons.”\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is among the top picks of Wedbush’s Dan Ives for the second half of 2024.\n\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\n\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in “denial” about Apple’s AI potential.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 26X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock’s overvalued, given Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales growth of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was pressured in the quarter as investors fretted over softening demand for smartphones, regulatory action from the US Department of Justice, and the Chinese government mandates restricting iPhone use by government officials. Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to believe the company remains competitively advantaged and benefits from the Apple ecosystem, which has an installed base of over 2 billion devices and over 1 billion paying subscribers. We believe the Apple ecosystem will support a more predictable cash flow stream, which should grow intrinsic value high-single-digits over our investment horizon.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer’s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "A Bull Market Is Here. 2 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Like There's No Tomorrow.",
        "content": "Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has popped 18% in the last month. Various factors have driven growth, such as a first look at its artificial intelligence (AI) platform Apple Intelligence, reports of increased product sales, and expectations that the Federal Reserve could soon lower interest rates (which would allow for lower borrowing costs). AAPL Chart\n\nThe rally is a welcome change after dismal growth for much of the first half of 2024. The chart above shows that up until June, Apple's stock had actually declined, underperforming when compared to some of its \"Big Tech\" rivals. Apple's lack of growth primarily stemmed from concerns over revenue declines in its products business and its lack of a position in AI.\n\nHowever, the iPhone company appears to be turning things around with changes in its product strategy. Meanwhile, Apple has market trends on its side, with a bull market sending the S&P 500 up 56% since October 2022.\n\nThe tech giant appears to be on a growth path. Here are two reasons to buy Apple stock like there's no tomorrow during this bull market.\n\nEarnings season is right around the corner\n\nApple's second-quarter results (posted May 2) were fairly positive, despite revenue dipping 4% year over year. Net sales of $91 billion beat Wall Street expectations by $190 million. Meanwhile, earnings per share (EPS) of $1.53 rose above forecasts by about $0.03. After significant growth in its digital-services division, the company enjoyed an overall rise in gross profit margins, hitting 47%.\n\nHowever, Apple could be in for an even better Q3 2024 (which it will report Aug. 1), with expected boosts in its Mac and iPhone segments.\n\nData from IDC shows a PC market recovery has continued into the second quarter, rising 3% year over year. Lenovo, HP, and Acer experienced increases between 2% and 14% during the period. However, Apple delivered the most growth, with sales in its Mac segment soaring 21%.\n\nMoreover, recent reports indicate a significant boost to iPhone sales in China, Apple's third largest market. According to Bloomberg, iPhone shipments in the East Asian country jumped 40% in May after rising 50% in April. Sales in China have been a sore point for Apple this year, declining 8% year over year in Q2 2024 amid rising competition from domestic brands like Huawei.\n\nApple has responded to the declines with heavy discounts on its products, which appear to be paying off. Discounts can sometimes be a short-term solution to a problem. However, consumers' tendency to rarely switch operating systems when it comes to smartphones could play in Apple's favor as the sales potentially create long-term customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe coming iPhone release will likely unveil Apple's next push into AI\n\nLike clockwork, Apple unveils its latest iPhone lineup every September, and 2024 is no different. However, this year's iPhone launch could be one of its most crucial to date, with the company expected to extend its push into AI.\n\niPhone sales decreased 10% year over year in Q2 2024, alongside declines in other product segments. As the highest-earning part of Apple's business, the smartphone division appeared to be in need of an overhaul. As a result, Apple is strategically using its AI expansion to boost iPhone and other product sales.\n\nIn June, the company announced Apple Intelligence, an AI platform created to enhance user experience across its lineup. Tools such as image and language generation, significant upgrades to Siri that will allow access to OpenAI's ChatGPT, and more are meant to simplify everyday tasks with AI.\n\nDuring the presentation, Apple revealed only iPhone 15 Pros and higher will be able to access Apple Intelligence. Meanwhile, Mac and iPad users will need devices equipped with the company's M1 through M4 chips to enjoy the features.\n\nApple Intelligence is slated for a fall release, just in time for the launch of the iPhone 16. It's unknown what other features the new smartphone will include, but it will be the first iPhone explicitly designed with AI in mind. As a result, the smartphone could boost sales in the coming months and encourage shoppers to upgrade to other products in the lineup that have access to Apple Intelligence.\n\nBloomberg reported on July 10 that Apple has told suppliers it's targeting about 10% growth in iPhone 16 shipments after iPhone 15 sales hit 81 million in the second half of 2023.\n\nPotentially worth its premium price tag\n\nApple's stock is trading at about 35 times its forward earnings, which means it doesn't offer the best value. However, its proven ability to increase profit margins and cash flow could make it worth its premium price.\n\nBoosts in product sales will likely lead to further growth in its digital-services segment as users take advantage of the new AI features. The company's AI push has opened the door to countless growth opportunities and ways to monetize its offerings in the coming years.\n\nIn addition to hitting $102 billion in free cash flow this year, Apple remains an attractive long-term buy that could be on the brink of a rally.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett is turning 94 next month. Should Berkshire investors start to worry?",
        "content": "Happy Birthday, Warren!\n\nThe legendary Warren Buffett turns 94 next month — Aug. 30 to be exact. And as is frequently the case when he turns a year older, investors wonder what a post-Buffett Berkshire Hathaway will look like. That’s especially true this year, with Buffett’s longtime partner Charlie Munger having passed away last year and CEO-designate Greg Abel waiting in the wings.\n\nI’m a Berkshire investor myself, and I don’t plan to go anywhere when Buffett is no longer part of the show. If you are a Berkshire shareholder, you might want to keep your powder dry as well.\n\nWhy? For one thing, Greg Abel seems unlikely to mess up the formula. And — ironically — because Berkshire’s days as a marvelous investment seem to be over, its astounding long-term record under Buffett notwithstanding. In many ways, Berkshire has become more like an index fund than a conventional corporation.\n\nSo it’s not as if something magical will depart when Buffett does.\n\nAccording to Berkshire’s most recent annual report, the stock returned 4,384,748% to its investors from the time Buffett took control in 1965 through the end of last year. That’s 140 times the 31,223% return for the S&P 500 (^GSPC), the standard market benchmark.\n\nBut that was then, and this is now.\n\nAs I’ll show you, recent Berkshire investors — including my wife and me — haven’t done remotely as well relative to the rest of the market as Buffett and his early followers have done.\n\nA little background is in order.\n\nFor most of my career, I didn't own Berkshire because I was an employee of publications that frequently wrote about Buffett. So I never bought any shares during Berkshire’s salad days, much as I wanted to.\n\nBut on Jan. 7, 2016, the first week that I became self-employed, my wife and I made a modest purchase of Berkshire stock in our joint brokerage account and have held it ever since.\n\nAnd guess what? The huge long-term advantage that Berkshire shows compared with the S&P 500 has totally disappeared since our purchase. In fact, we’d have been a bit better off buying an S&P 500 index fund than buying Berkshire.\n\nFrom our purchase date through last Monday, Berkshire was up a respectable 214%. That was also its total return because it didn’t pay any dividends during that period. However, during that same period, Admiral-class shares of Vanguard’s S&P 500 index fund returned 232%, including reinvested dividends, according to calculations that Jeff DeMaso, editor of the Independent Vanguard Adviser, did for me.\n\nIn other words, my wife and I got into Berkshire when its stock market glory days had passed.\n\nStory continues Is he up to the task? Greg Abel, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Andrea Abel at the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference last year. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) (Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images)\n\nAnd that — strange as it may seem — is a major reason that I’m not concerned with what Greg Abel will do at Berkshire when Buffett passes from the scene. Last December, shortly after the death of Charlie Munger, Buffett’s longtime partner in running Berkshire (and my longtime friend), I wrote that I saw no compelling reason for my wife and me to sell our Berkshire stock.\n\nI still feel that way because there’s no reason to think that Abel will change the company drastically if he ends up running it when Buffett ceases to be involved. After all, Abel, who’s 62, has spent almost 25 years working for Berkshire, and Buffett named him his heir apparent three years ago. Abel seems to be a Buffetteer through and through.\n\nIn addition, you can make the case that Berkshire, which owns lots of different, unrelated US businesses, including big chunks of stock in Apple, Coca-Cola, and American Express and numerous other US and Japanese companies and batches of other assets, is sort of an index fund itself. (What's a more vanilla investment than that?)\n\nThen there’s the tax question — which may or may not apply to you. My wife and I bought our Berkshire in a taxable account because I knew it was highly unlikely that the company would pay any dividends while Buffett was involved with it. So selling now would mean forking over more than 30% of our 200%-plus Berkshire profit to the IRS and our state government.\n\nA final reason that I feel no compulsion to sell Berkshire just because of a likely management change is that companies' founders or longtime chief executives are often succeeded by competent replacements.\n\nFor example, Tim Cook has done a fine job since taking control of Apple (AAPL) from legendary co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. And Walmart (WMT) didn’t blow up — and actually thrived over time — when the legendary Sam Walton died in 1992 and was succeeded by David Glass.\n\nSo, my inclination is to stick with Berkshire and see what happens if I outlast Buffett. And who knows? Should the stock drop sharply when Buffett passes from the scene, I may be tempted to buy some more of it.\n\nMaya Benjamin contributed research to this story.\n\nAllan Sloan, a contributor to Yahoo Finance, is a seven-time winner of the Loeb Award, business journalism’s highest honor.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 7 Most Important Stocks to Watch as Q2 Earnings Season Kicks Off",
        "content": "Earnings season is a combination report card and progress report. The headline results tell investors what already happened. There’s nothing that can be done about it. That’s the report card part of it. It’s the guidance a company gives that can tell investors what may be coming in future quarters. That’s the progress that investors want to hear when thinking about Q2 earnings season stocks to buy.\n\nThe latest read on inflation showed a slight slowdown in the rate of growth. And many investors now believe that the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates in September with increasing optimism that there may be more than one rate cut in 2024.\n\nThe market (i.e. institutional investors) is always looking months ahead. That’s one reason the market seemingly defies gravity. Those investors believe the next directional move for interest rates is lower, and they’re investing accordingly.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt’s impossible to keep up with every earnings report. But, let’s examine seven Q2 earnings season stocks that investors should watch closely.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up 150% making it one of the best-performing stocks in 2024. However, it’s listing as one the Q2 earnings season stocks to watch has less to do with the future stock price movement of NVDA stock than it does with demand for the company’s chips.\n\nAs noted in the introduction, the market is becoming increasingly optimistic about a pivot by the Fed. But will businesses share this optimism? If they do, NVIDIA will be one of the beneficiaries.\n\nCompanies in every sector are racing to create artificial intelligence (AI) applications. And NVIDIA is creating the hardware that these companies need to power those applications. For much of the last 18 months, investors have shrugged off any concerns about a lofty valuation. And for the most part, the company has delivered the revenue and earnings outlook to reassure them. Investors are expecting more of the same, and that’s why it will be a report to watch.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome investors will say this list of Q2 earnings season stocks to watch should simply include the magnificent seven stocks. But Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be the last one to include in this group. It used to be said that as Apple goes, so goes the market. That title may now go to Nvidia, but Apple still has one of the strongest moats a company can have. That shouldn’t be overlooked.\n\nAfter a rough first quarter, AAPL stock has come roaring back. The stock is up about 33% in this past quarter. The company has outlined its AI strategy. That will be showcased in its upcoming iPhone 16 launch.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, even with some analysts bidding the stock higher, Apple continues to have its share of critics. Those detractors believe this earnings report will be a prove-it moment. The iPhone 16 won’t launch until September. But investors will focus closely on what Apple has to say about their manufacturing plans.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is another obvious choice as one of the stocks to watch this earnings season. In its last earnings report, the company confirmed that many consumers are cutting back on discretionary spending. It also said that it’s seeing more affluent consumers choosing Walmart. And not so quietly, the company has become a digital force to be reckoned with. Global e-commerce sales were up 21% year-over-year (YOY) in the last quarter.\n\nBut earnings reports are about looking ahead. Walmart has recently announced it has opened five automated distribution centers across the U.S. These will help the country manage fresh food for its online grocery business.\n\nThe bigger story is that Walmart plans to expand this use of automation throughout its stores and fulfillment centers in the coming years. All of this will take robust capital expenditures. However, make no mistake. This will also help the company offset rising labor costs. That will be accretive to the company’s earnings over time.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nOutside of AI, two of the best-performing stocks are Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and NovoNordisk (NYSE:NVO). Both companies manufacture and sell GLP-1 drugs for treating diabetes and obesity.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, Ell Lilly reported $1.8 billion in revenue for its GLP-1 diabetes drug, Mounjaro. It also reported $517 million in revenue for Zepbound, the company’s GLP-1 obesity drug. LLY stock is up more than 60% for the year and 112% in the last 12 months.\n\nBut as the drugs become commonplace, it’s fair to ask which company’s drugs are better. A recent study suggests that Eli Lilly’s Zepbound are producing better results for weight loss than those of Novo Nordisk. The study was not sponsored by Lilly which creates the reason for the intrigue.\n\nLilly is conducting its own head-to-head study comparing the two drugs. That will be one key point of interest for investors to watch when the company reports earnings scheduled for August 8, 2024.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) continues to be a barometer for the economy. The company has recovered from the pandemic. But as its most recent earnings report showed, the company is having problems with difficult comparisons to last year. This reinforces investor sentiment that the consumer is tapped out.\n\nCurrently, SBUX stock is approaching its 52-week low. For all the talk that the consumer discretionary sector has hit a bottom, the stock seems to find new lows. And the earnings report from PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) won’t do much to allay those fears. However, with the stock down 23% for the year, the buying pressure seems overdone.\n\nInvestors will be looking to see if that trends reverses when Starbucks reports earnings on August 6. They’ll also be watching for progress on the company’s “Siren Craft System” which is the company’s initiative to alter its drink-making process to help make the job or its baristas easier. In the meantime, investors can benefit from an attractive dividend that has been growing for 14 consecutive years and has a 3.11% yield.\n\nD.R. Horton (DHI) In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerception frequently shapes reality. That’s why the economy won’t feel like it’s on firm footing until the housing market improves. And it’s why investors will pay close attention to the earnings report from D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) the largest home builder in the U.S. The report is scheduled to be released on July 18.\n\nIn early July, investors got the latest housing data. Building permits and housing starts were down YOY in May. That suggests that home builders like D.R. Horton may guide for lower revenue and earnings when they report.\n\nTight supply and high demand, particularly for first-time home buyers, should be bullish for home builders. And D.R. Horton has been beating analysts’ estimates for revenue and earnings with levels well above 2019 levels. But the numbers are still coming in lower YOY. That reflects the frustration of a housing market that’s navigating inflation and interest rates on both ends of the market.\n\nSLB (SLB) A zoomed in image of the logo for \"Schlumberger\" reflecting light on a smooth tan stone tiled wall.\n\nSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSLB (NYSE:SLB) is the oilfield services provider formerly known as (and still frequently referred to) as Schlumberger. Despite the fact that oil prices are higher YOY, the energy sector has been underperforming the market. SLB has been no different. It’s down 12% for the year.\n\nBut energy prices have been holding steady above $80 a barrel. And if the Fed lowers interest rates as expected, it’s likely to increase demand. And with oil production already near record highs, there will be no incentive for oil companies to decrease production.\n\nThe bullish argument for SLB comes from the company’s technology which is likely to add operational efficiencies to the drilling process. Furthermore, most of the company’s final investment decisions have a breakeven point with oil at $50 a barrel.\n\nInvestors won’t have long to wait. SLB is reporting on July 19 making it one of the first companies to report earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in AAPL.

        "title": "3 Red-Hot Growth Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "The stock market broadly has had an excellent year so far -- the S&P 500 is up 17%. Naturally, some hot stocks have outpaced that growth, and while it might seem counter-intuitive, some of the stocks with big gains already behind them could still be among the best places for investors to deploy their investing dollars now.\n\nHere are three growth stocks that have outpaced the market year to date, but that also have strong competitive positions that make them worth buying today and holding well into the future.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nSince artificial intelligence (AI) has become the hottest topic on Wall Street, much of the attention has been on high-end semiconductor companies like Nvidia, which have been putting up eye-popping results quarter after quarter. However, investors shouldn't forget that Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is at the forefront of the AI boom due in large part to its investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nMicrosoft has already added AI features to several of its products, and because of the reach of its product suite, many consumers have already started to see them in action. For example, the Copilot tool that it has added to productivity applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint can help users draft documents and analyze data more easily.\n\nAI is impacting Microsoft's business in other ways as well. In its most recently reported fiscal quarter, revenue from its Azure cloud unit increased by 31% year over year, with 7 percentage points of growth coming from AI alone. Overall revenue grew by 17% to $62 billion, while earnings per share increased by 20%.\n\nMicrosoft is a leader in the software and cloud infrastructure space, and its AI investments are likely to strengthen its position for years to come.\n\nApple\n\nAt first, it seemed like Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was behind when it came to AI. While other tech companies were garnering headlines for their AI-related activities, there wasn't much news coming from the iPhone maker. That all changed last month when it held its annual developer conference, where it unveiled Apple Intelligence, which will roll out later this year.\n\nWhat's most important about Apple's foray into AI is how it will reinforce its ecosystem. Its new AI features are only going to be available on newer devices, which should drive some degree of an upgrade cycle. Additionally, while these features will be free when they debut, one could imagine a scenario where some aspects of its AI offering become part of a subscription service. This would give a boost to Apple's fast-growing services segment, which is currently its second-largest revenue source after iPhone sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is already one of the largest companies in the world and boasts one of the most recognizable brands. If its efforts in AI can continue to drive consumers to buy more of its devices and subscribe to more of its services, the stock could continue to reward shareholders.\n\nTexas Instruments\n\nWith so much attention being focused on the few companies making the types of cutting-edge semiconductor chips that can power AI, it's easy to overlook a company like Texas Instruments(NASDAQ: TXN), which manufactures a wide range of less powerful chips that are needed for everyday uses and products. From your microwave oven to the entertainment center in your car, chips are nearly everywhere, and Texas Instruments makes a lot of them.\n\nYear to date, Texas Instruments' stock is up 18%. However, that run has only brought the stock back to its late 2021 level, reflecting the struggles the company has experienced over the past few years.\n\nIt's important to remember that the semiconductor industry is cyclical, and outside of the high-powered AI chip niche, the industry has been in a cyclical downturn for the past year or so. Texas Instruments' revenue and net income have declined, which is typical during these kinds of downturns.\n\nThe bottom line is that Texas Instrument plays a vital role in the semiconductor space, and down cycles like the current one are normal. The fact that the stock price is up year to date despite the company's declines on the top and bottom lines demonstrates Wall Street's belief that these market conditions will be a short-term challenge for it. Over the long term, Texas Instruments remains a solid business worth buying now and holding for the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Apple: Consider These 2 Millionaire-Maker Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has a long history of providing consistent stock gains. Its shares are up 346% in the last five years alone, outperforming many of its peers and the S&P 500's 86% rise. The company is the king of consumer tech, profiting from the immense brand loyalty it has built.\n\nHowever, Apple has hit many hurdles over the past year. The company got a late start in artificial intelligence (AI), which left it out of much of the rally the market has seen since the beginning of 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, repeated declines in sales have forced the company to rethink its product strategy. It has the cash and brand dominance to turn things around over the long term, but it might be worth investing in more reliable stocks for now. NVDA Chart\n\nThis table shows Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) have delivered significantly more returns than Apple since the start of 2024. They have rallied investors with dominating roles in crucial areas of AI: chip design and cloud computing. The two leaders in their respective industries are unlikely to be dethroned anytime soon.\n\nTheir more established positions in tech indicate they could offer more share increases over the next decade than the iPhone maker. So, forget Apple and consider buying these two millionaire-maker stocks instead.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nFew stocks have been watched as closely as Nvidia has over the last year. The company has achieved rock-star status in the tech industry as its chips have become the gold standard for AI developers worldwide. Nvidia is responsible for an estimated 90% of the AI chip market thanks to the success of its graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nMuch as Apple has attracted loyal users with its easy-to-use design language, Nvidia's Computer Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a leading reason for its AI dominance. CUDA is the software platform that complements the company's AI GPUs. Millions of developers have grown so accustomed to Nvidia's chip architecture that switching to similar offerings from competitors like AMD makes little sense. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAs demand for AI services has soared, so has Nvidia's sales. The chart above shows the significant difference in financial growth that Nvidia has seen over AMD since last July. As a result, Nvidia hit $39 billion in free cash flow this year, while AMD hovered around $1 billion in free cash flow.\n\nNvidia's higher figure suggests it's only widening the gap between the companies, with it potentially being better equipped to keep investing in its technology and maintain its lead.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market reached $196 billion in spending last year and is growing at a rate that would see it hit close to $2 trillion by 2030. So, despite its meteoric rise since last year, the AI market still has plenty of room to run, with Nvidia well-positioned to keep seeing major gains and creating millionaires.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon has made more than a few millionaires over the years. Since its initial public offering in 1997, the company's stock has soared over 200,000%.\n\nIt has gone from an online book retailer to the biggest name in e-commerce in multiple countries. And as its earnings have grown, Amazon has reinvested in its business, diversifying its revenue streams to include income from cloud computing, digital advertising, streaming, and more.\n\nThe company posted its first-quarter earnings on April 30, delivering revenue growth of 13% year over year and beating Wall Street estimates by $750 million. Amazon proved its e-commerce business remains lucrative, with revenue rising 10% and 12% in its two retail segments. Meanwhile, retail operating income reached a collective $6 billion after reporting losses of $349 million the year before.\n\nBut it's outside of e-commerce where the company's greatest promise can be found. Its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), dominates the market, reporting revenue growth of 17% year over year and operating income that nearly doubled. The quarter also highlighted the company's budding digital ad business, with revenue in its advertising services segment rising 24% after introducing ads on Prime Video.\n\nWhile Apple has suffered several quarters of sales declines, Amazon has seen an impressive boost to revenue in its retail segments. Meanwhile, it has become an imposing figure in AI thanks to AWS. With growth catalysts in multiple markets, its stock is too good to ignore right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "6 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Inside Warren Buffett's $410 Billion Portfolio",
        "content": "Warren Buffett has managed the Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) investment company since 1965. Over that 59-year stretch, he steered the conglomerate to average annual returns of 19.8%, which is nearly twice the average annual return delivered by the S&P 500 index over the same period.\n\nIn dollar terms, $1,000 invested in Berkshire stock in 1965 would have grown to $43 million by the end of 2023. The same investment in the S&P 500 would have been worth a mere $312,230.\n\nBuffett likes to buy stock in companies with steady growth, consistent profitability, solid management teams, and shareholder-friendly initiatives like dividend schemes and stock buyback programs. One thing Buffett doesn't do is chase the latest stock market trend, so you won't find him piling into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks just because they are generating the best returns right now.\n\nThat said, at least six of the 47 stocks already in Berkshire's $410 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities now use AI in some capacity. Here's a look at each company and what they're up to in AI. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Apple: 44.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is Berkshire's largest position. The conglomerate spent about $38 billion accumulating shares since 2016, and the position is now worth $184 billion -- even after Berkshire sold 13% of its stake for tax reasons earlier this year. Apple makes some of the world's most popular consumer devices led by the flagship iPhone, and it could soon be one of the biggest players in AI.\n\nApple just revealed its Apple Intelligence software, which it developed in partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. It's expected to go live in September alongside the new iOS 18 operating system, and it will overhaul many of the company's existing software products.\n\nThe Siri voice assistant will be powered by ChatGPT, and users will be able to read a summary of their emails in the Mail application with a single tap. Apple Intelligence can also transcribe audio recordings, which means users can spend less time typing.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, so the company could become the largest distributor of AI to consumers. Some analysts on Wall Street expect the upcoming iPhone 16 to drive a big upgrade cycle because it's rumored to come with a powerful new chip designed specifically for processing AI workloads.\n\n2. Bank of America: 10.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire first bought shares in Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) in 2007, and it's now the conglomerate's second-largest holding.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors probably don't associate banking with cutting-edge technology, given it's such a slow-moving industry. But Bank of America was an early adopter of AI, launching its AI assistant called Erica way back in 2018. Erica can remind customers about upcoming bills, locate historical transactions, and even offer ideas for saving money and reducing debt.\n\nOver the last six years, Erica has logged more than 2 billion interactions with customers, and adoption is accelerating. Bank of America recently introduced Erica to its business clients who use the CashPro platform, and the chatbot is already solving 43% of inquiries autonomously with no human intervention.\n\nAI tools like Erica are likely to shrink the human workforce for banks, especially in their customer service departments, and those cost savings can translate into much higher earnings.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: 6.1% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nLast year, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) allowed generative AI to formulate a new drink called Coca-Cola Y3000. The AI model used customer data to predict what the popular beverage might taste like in the year 3000. It was a great marketing stunt that showcased Coca-Cola's progressive approach to technology, and the company even hired a \"head of generative AI\" in 2023.\n\nThe company recently signed a five-year deal with Microsoft, committing to spend $1.1 billion on the Azure cloud platform and its generative AI services. Coca-Cola will use Azure to weave AI throughout its entire organization, enhancing everything from marketing to manufacturing to the supply chain.\n\nBerkshire spent $1.3 billion accumulating 400 million shares in Coca-Cola between 1987 and 1994. It never sold a single one, and that position is now valued at $25.1 billion. Plus, Berkshire will collect $776 million in dividend payments from Coca-Cola this year alone, which highlights the powerful effects of compounding over the long term.\n\n4. Visa: 0.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nVisa (NYSE: V) has more than 4.4 billion cards in circulation worldwide, making it the largest issuer in the industry. Visa doesn't lend any money; it simply operates a payments network, which means it earns a steady stream of fees that grows as more merchants and consumers enter its ecosystem. It's right in the wheelhouse of a patient long-term investor like Buffett, which is why Berkshire has owned the stock since 2011.\n\nVisa is constantly battling fraud, which includes highly automated enumeration attacks that use bots to exploit network vulnerabilities. The company just launched a new AI-powered tool for its Visa Account Attack Intelligence (VAAI) platform, which autonomously identifies and assigns a score to enumeration attacks so banks can make more informed decisions on when to block transactions on behalf of customers.\n\nBut that's not all. Visa's new Stand-In Processing tool steps in when banks suffer outages or network disruptions, using AI to approve and decline transactions so services can continue for customers without interruption.\n\nVisa processed over 72 billion transactions in the last quarter alone, and with that much volume and data, automation is essential. Therefore, investors should expect this company to push the boundaries of innovation when it comes to AI.\n\n5. Amazon: 0.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock in 2019, but Buffett often expresses regret for not identifying the opportunity much earlier. Amazon has expanded beyond its roots in e-commerce and now operates in video streaming, digital advertising, cloud computing, and AI.\n\nThe Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division is investing heavily in AI. It developed its own chips, its own large language models (LLMs), and even its own applications, all of which are available to businesses and developers who can use them to either create their own AI products or drive efficiency in their day-to-day operations.\n\nAmazon also uses AI to power the recommendation engine on Amazon.com. It learns what customers like so it can show them more of those products to boost sales. Plus, merchants can use Amazon's AI software to create product pages with engaging descriptions and images.\n\nAmazon just entered the exclusive $2 trillion club, and there could be plenty of long-term upside ahead thanks to AI.\n\n6. Snowflake: 0.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nSnowflake (NYSE: SNOW) doesn't fit Buffett's usual criteria. The cloud computing company is growing, but it's a long way from achieving profitability, and it doesn't return any money to shareholders. Berkshire bought Snowflake around the time of its IPO in 2020, and one of Buffett's lieutenants likely made the decision.\n\nSnowflake's data cloud helps organizations aggregate their data even if it's spread across multiple cloud platforms, eliminating silos and enabling more effective analysis. The company launched Cortex AI last year, which gives businesses the tools to develop AI models using a mixture of their own data and ready-made LLMs.\n\nCortex AI also includes several AI-powered tools. The Copilot chatbot understands natural language and can offer assistance across Snowflake's platforms, and Document AI allows developers to rapidly extract valuable data from unstructured sources like contracts and invoices.\n\nSnowflake is in a great position to thrive in the world of AI, but investors should tread cautiously because its stock is very expensive.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "SoundHound AI Stock May Be Poised for a Correction. Be Careful.",
        "content": "There’s a great deal to like about Soundhound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) stock at this point. Its exposure to the AI megatrend, alliance with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and strong, overall growth are all in its favor.\n\nHowever, given the stock’s recent, overdone rally, along with the name’s extremely high valuation and significant competition, I recommend that investors hold the shares but avoid buying them.\n\nSoundhound AI Stock’s Many Positive Attributes\n\nSoundhound, which produces an AI-powered voice assistant used by businesses, is benefiting from being part of the AI megatrend that is being embraced by investors and many companies. Partly as a result of this situation, Soundhound AI stock soared 157% between the beginning of the year and the afternoon of July 11.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe fact many companies seek to save money by implementing AI-powered tools likely helped Soundhound successfully convince many to adopt its offerings. That is a huge factor behind Soundhound’s impressive growth. Last quarter, the firm’s top line surged 73% versus the same period a year earlier to $11.6 million while its cumulative subscriptions & bookings backlog soared about 80% year-over-year to a very impressive $682 million.\n\nFinally, Soundhound’s alliance with Nvidia boosted SoundhoundAI stock while also lifting financial results. In February, the chip giant disclosed that it purchased almost $3.7 million of Soundhound AI stock. The information undoubtedly lit a fire under Soundhound’s shares, as its stock surged from $2.26 on Feb. 14, the day before the news was disclosed, to $8.24 on March 18. Although the shares subsequently sharply retreated, Nvidia’s investment in Soundhound has put the latter company on many investors’ radar and made them excited about its outlook.\n\nAlso importantly, the company’s association with Nvidia has undoubtedly helped it obtain more customers since firms are likely impressed by the investment.\n\nAfterall, Soundhound’s list of customers is impressive. Among them are Applebee’s, Church’s Chicken, Stellantis (NYSE:STLA),Honda (NYSE:HMC) and Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMLY).\n\nA Potentially Overdone Rally\n\nOn July 10, SoundHound announced Stellantis began including “its SoundHound Chat AI voice assistant with integrated ChatGPT” in its “Peugeot, Opel and Vauxhall vehicle brands across 11 European markets.” The news sparked a huge rally in SoundHound AI stock.\n\nNot surprisingly, SoundHound did not reveal the financial terms of the deal. But as a longtime investor in BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), I know the royalties software makers obtain from auto companies can be quite low. For example, BlackBerry historically only received $1.50 to $5 per vehicle for its infotainment offering. It also received as little as $5 per vehicle for its more advanced technologies.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat’s more, SoundHound began providing voice AI systems for Stellantis last year. That means this new deal may not produce large revenue increases for the tech firm.\n\nValuation and Competition\n\nBy any measure, the valuation of Soundhound AI stock is quite elevated. The shares have a forward price-to-sales ratio of over 17 times. Its enterprise value-to-revenue ratio is a gigantic 30.5 times.\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, the company reportedly has many competitors. Amomg them are Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Further, a company called Cerence (NASDAQ:CRNC) is said to have taken automotive customers away from Soundhound in the past.\n\nThe Bottom Line on SoundHound AI Stock\n\nI believe that SoundhoundAI has a bright future. However, given the company’s high valuation, its many tough competitors and the market’s exuberance about its deal with Stellantis, I expect the shares to drop significantly below their current levels in the medium term.\n\nSuch a downturn could occur because Soundhound reports weaker-than-expected quarterly results or because it loses a key customer. Alternatively, a correction by the stock market could cause the company’s share price to drop sharply.\n\nConsequently, I recommend investors wait for a meaningful pullback before pulling the trigger rather than chasing it in the wake of its recent rally. However, investors who already own the shares should hold onto them.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in BB.

        "title": "Apple stock might soar thanks to old iPhones",
        "content": "Apple customers are famously loyal—but it turns out they’re also slow to upgrade.\n\nA just-released Bank of America survey of over a million iPhone users from the U.S., the U.K., India, and China found that most of them have old phones. Some 29% of users own an iPhone from the iPhone 13 family, which came out in September 2021, while 13% own an iPhone from the iPhone 12 family, which came out in October 2020, and 31% own an iPhone that’s even older than that.\n\nPut differently, less than a quarter of iPhone users bought their devices within the past three years—bad news for the company’s flagship product.\n\nWith iPhone demand falling over 10% in the first quarter of this year to a six-year low, tech experts and Wall Street analysts have criticized Apple for not giving users a reason to upgrade their old phones, and for lagging behind peers when it comes to new hardware and software offerings.\n\niPhone sales are critical for Apple, accounting for more than 50% of the company’s revenue in the second quarter. But Bank of America analysts say that iPhone users' aging phones could signal opportunity for Apple stock.\n\n“We are raising our [price target] on Apple to $256 (from $230) on increased confidence of a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by an aging installed base and GenAI features that should provide a boost to customers' intentions to upgrade,” analysts led by Wamsi Mohan wrote in a Thursday note to clients. Apple shares currently trade around $232, implying a potential 12-month return of just over 10% for investors if BofA’s price target proves prescient.\n\nThis new bullish report from BofA comes after its analysts argued in May that Apple will slowly turn its iPhones into AI-enabled \"intelliphones\" with more processing power and new applications, forcing customers to upgrade. The following month, Apple revealed a few key features at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) that they hope will convince customers to buy new phones, including a new-and-improved version of Siri that will use AI tech called Apple Intelligence.\n\nPerhaps in response to complaints about its lagging hardware development, Apple also announced it will release a slimmed-down version of its iPhone next year in June, and reports indicate a flip phone similar to those offered by Samsung may also be coming soon.\n\nBeyond the coming rollout of new AI software features and hardware upgrades, Wamsi and his team pointed to Apple’s steady customer loyalty as key to their bullish outlook.\n\nThe analysts’ survey of Apple customers showed 58% of current iPhone users intend on buying another iPhone when they upgrade their current device, compared to just 53% for Samsung, 38% for Huawei, and 31% for Xiaomi.\n\nStory continues\n\nWamsi and his team argued that there could be strong demand for upgrades among wearable tech users as well. When smartwatch owners were asked which device they plan to buy when they upgrade, the Apple Watch was far and away the most mentioned option.\n\nSome 66% of Indian smartwatch users who plan to upgrade say they will buy an Apple Watch, compared to 59% in China, 57% in the U.S., and 41% in the U.K.\n\nSimilarly, BofA’s analysts found consumers are more willing to buy the Apple Vision Pro than previously expected, despite its hefty price tag. Some 14% of respondents in the U.S. reported that they are planning on buying the Apple Vision Pro, compared to 20% in China, 36% in India, and 8% in the U.K. BofA’s analysts said they view these as high percentages, noting they’re all well above the February survey figures.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple stock poised to rise 11% on iPhone AI updates, says BoA",
        "content": "Bank of America analysts reiterated “Buy” ratings for Apple stock in a note to investors on Thursday. The optimistic outlook stems from the bank’s latest global smartphone survey, which reveals a commitment among iPhone users to upgrade, in light of new generative AI features and high numbers of outdated models currently in circulation.\n\nCurrently trading at $231 as of Friday morning EST, BofA analysts have raised their price objective to $256. The predicted 11% price jump is due to \"increased confidence of a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by an aging installed base and GenAI features,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nPlacing second on the S&P 500 Index, Apple’s market capitalization of $3.49 trillion represents a staggering 7% of the index’s total weight. The consumer tech behemoth has enjoyed gains of 23% year-to-date, largely due to the anticipated launch of the iPhone 16 in September, that will offer on-device generative AI capabilities.\n\n\"Generative AI and AI are big opportunities for us across our products,” CEO Tim Cook said during the company’s earnings call for the second quarter of this year. The so-called “Apple Intelligence” features coming soon to iPads, iPhones and Mac, will involve generative AI features for writing, editing, image creation, and organization.\n\nThe Bank of America survey on iPhone adoption was based on a poll of over 1 million respondents across the US, China, India, and the UK.\n\nThe upgrade cycle is critical for Apple. In Q2, iPhone sales accounted for half of revenue. Last month, Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri told Barron’s that for every 1% of installed iPhones that upgrade to newer models, Apple could see a 20-cent boost to its earnings per share.\n\nThe survey found that during the Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple's annual tech conference held in June, the percentage of respondents who reported plans to upgrade their smartphone this year increased by 4%, which the analysts describe as “bullish.” Moreover, the results found that a “significant number of iPhone users are still using older models,” with 73% owning an iPhone 13 or older.\n\nAdding to the analysts’ confidence in the multi-year upgrade cycle, the survey found that customer loyalty remains strong. Of current iPhone users, 58% intend to buy another another for their next upgrade, a rate higher than its competitors Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi.\n\nMoreover, in China, the drop in interest in Apple (and a corresponding increase in preference for Huawei) throughout March and April, appears to have been transitory. In March, fewer than 40% of Chinese respondents said they would buy an iPhone for their next upgrade. This aligns with an 8% year-on-year drop in iPhone sales in China during Q2—the steepest drop since the beginning of the pandemic. But the survey shows that now, Chinese users wanting an iPhone for their next upgrade has rebounded to 60%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Apple’s new Vision Pro—a mixed-reality headset retailed at $3,500—has had a rocky start. Market tracker IDC has predicted Apple may not even make half a million sales this year. On Friday, just one person queued in the London store to be the first to access the device. However, the BofA survey found consumer sentiment towards the headset is rising. In March, less than 20% of respondents said they were interested in buying it, but by June, that number had risen to 35%.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Overvalued Tech Stock Darlings Primed for a Fall",
        "content": "It’s hard to think about selling a stock after the incredible first-half rally that’s beginning to carry into the second half. Undoubtedly, taking a bit of profit off the table while you’re up may be a wise idea, especially if you’re uneasy over slightly higher valuation multiples.\n\nThat said, with numerous firms seizing AI opportunities, profit-takers may also face considerable risk of missing out on upside. Indeed, the FOMO mentality can get many gain-seeking investors into deep trouble.\n\nHowever, as long as the fundamentals justify higher multiples, selling may not be the best course of action.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s look at three tech stocks that are not in that camp. Only time will tell how the following stocks fare, as they become markedly more expensive than that of historical averages. In any case, the following are a tad on the overvalued side, and perhaps long overdue for a serious pullback.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a wonderful semiconductor play that’s seen its stock enjoy one of the steepest melt-ups out there. Now up more than 200% from its late-2022 lows, though, AVGO stock seems to be lacking in value.\n\nBroadcom stock’s recent rally from its June correction is a testament to how resilient the semiconductor firm really is. Either way, Broadcom could find itself sinking quickly if the AI trade were to falter in the second half.\n\nNow, that’s not to say there haven’t been massively positive developments. The company recently announced it’s working with TikTok maker ByteDance to build an AI chip. It’s a big deal to team up with one of the most influential social-media powerhouses in the world.\n\nThough I’d not take the news lightly, I do view the move as mostly baked in here with AVGO stock going for 73.7 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). The 1.23% dividend yield is a nice touch, but it’s a fraction of what it used to be.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is having its moment in the sunshine following as investors let out a collective sigh of relief following the reveal of the latest deliveries. Indeed, the auto tides seem to be turning, all while Tesla continues innovating heavily on the front of AI and robotics.\n\nWhether we’re talking about the Optimus robot (new design due later this year) or the potential for Tesla to win the robotaxi race, there’s a lot of hype baked in right now.\n\nAs the EV firm looks to add to its winning streak — currently up 11 straight sessions — questions linger as to how the parabolic spike will end. Not to discount Tesla’s AI capabilities, but with a newly-raised expectations bar, the chances of a colossal disappointment are raised.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere’s still plenty of stiff EV competition out there and if a robotaxi scene suffers another big setback. Perhaps it’s best to wait for a steeper pullback before scooping up the stock.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nIs generative AI a threat or an opportunity for a company like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)? A strong case could be made for either camp. That said, all it will take is a competitor with better AI chops to cause investors to view AI as more of a threat than an opportunity.\n\nIn any case, AI represents both a risk and an opportunity for Adobe. The company has to be miles ahead of peers on generative AI if it’s to stave off competition, not just from the likes of smaller creative startups, but big tech.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the rest of the Magnificent Seven firms have used generative AI to create stickers and other images for personal use in recent quarters. Such AI features pose minimal risk to Adobe today. However, what happens if AI-created stickers represent just the tip of the iceberg?\n\nIndeed, a company like Apple could easily land a heavy blow on Adobe if it decided to double down on creative software with the power of AI. Given the higher stakes in the AI age, I’m cautious on ADBE stock after its latest melt-up.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple.

        "title": "3 Beaten-Down Stocks Ready for a Jaw-Dropping Rebound",
        "content": "Beaten-down stocks do rebound. And often, the reversal is dramatic. Just look at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). In the first half of the year, the electric vehicle maker’s stock was one of the worst performers in the benchmark S&P 500 index. But since the end of June, TSLA stock gained 44% and erased its previous loss on the year. And that big move higher occurred in just 10 trading sessions.\n\nSimilarly, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) staged a remarkable rebound in recent weeks. In the year’s first half, the company couldn’t do anything right and its stock badly trailed the overall market. Even Warren Buffett, a notorious Apple bull, reduced his stake in the company by 10%. However, AAPL stock bottomed in mid-April and has since risen 40%. It is now trading at an all-time high on a split-adjusted basis.\n\nThe point is that most stocks go through drawdowns. It is important not to panic and to hold on through the pullbacks or, better yet, see them as a buying opportunity. Here are three beaten-down stocks ready for a jaw-dropping rebound.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nAll is not lost at sneaker giant Nike (NYSE:NKE). Investors who buy the stock now when it is down 33% on the year and trading at a 52-week low will likely be glad they did. NKE stock is unlikely to fall much further and is poised for a recovery as management undertakes a turnaround strategy at the athletic apparel company. Trading at 19 times future earnings, NKE stock hasn’t been this affordable in at least a decade.\n\nThe key problems at Nike have been sluggish sales in China and a failed strategy that had seen the company try to drive sales through its website and branded stores rather than through wholesalers and third-party retailers such as Foot Locker (NYSE:FL). However, Nike is working to shift course and make progress. Revenue from its wholesale channels rose 5% in the most recent quarter.\n\nNike is also in the process of cutting costs by $2 billion over the next three years. Plus, Nike continues to have a strong brand and a commanding global market share of nearly 40%. In time, NKE stock will rebound.\n\nWalt Disney Co. (DIS) Statue of Disney's (DIS) Mickey Mouse in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nSource: spiderman777 / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt seems to be a case of one step forward, two steps back for shares of Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS). Disney’s stock began the year with a nice rally. Unfortunately, it stalled at the end of the first quarter. Since then, DIS stock declined 22%.\n\nWorse, the stock has become a long-term laggard. Over the past five years, the company’s share price declined 33%. No wonder activist investors are targeting Disney’s management team.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe good news is that Disney appears to be turning a corner, and a sustained rebound in its share price could come soon. The company reigned in spending on content for its Disney+ streaming platform, announced that it is spending $60 billion on its parks division over the next 10 years, and is partnering with other entertainment companies to bundle their streaming services and combine content.\n\nIt might take time, but when DIS stock finally rebounds, it will likely be jaw-dropping.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is another iconic brand whose stock has been beaten down to a 52-week low. Currently, SBUX stock is down 22% this year and is trading 19% lower than it was five years ago.\n\nBuying the dip while the share price is at its lowest point in a year might be wise, particularly for investors with a long time horizon.\n\nAdmittedly, Starbucks’ first-quarter financial results were a disaster. Worse, the company lowered its forward guidance, and management said that its coffee shops will likely continue underperforming for several more quarters.\n\nThat said, there is a glimmer of hope for SBUX stock. Late last year, the company unveiled details of a strategic plan that will see the retail coffee chain open 17,000 new locations by 2030 while cutting $3 billion in costs. The company has also begun labor negotiations with its unionized stores.\n\nThis all makes Starbucks a beaten-down stock to buy on the dip.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Shares of This Well-Known Stock",
        "content": "After an ugly performance in 2022, Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) stock has rebounded. It soared by 85% over the past 12 months and is now trading near the all-time high it set this month. But during that period, Meta's insiders sold more shares than they bought.\n\nA growing list of prolific billionaires -- including Steven Cohen, Andreas Halvorsen, Lee Ainslie, Ken Griffin, Jonathan Soros, David Tepper, and Meta's own co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg -- have also been cashing out of the high-flying stock.\n\nBy the end of the first quarter of 2024, when Meta was still trading at an average price of $446.07, Cohen and Soros had sold all of their shares while Halvorsen and Ainslie liquidated more than half of their shares. Does that cooling insider and institutional sentiment suggest it's time for retail investors to back away from Meta? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy did Meta's stock surge to a record high?\n\nMeta's revenue and earnings declined 1% and 38% year over year, respectively, in 2022. That deceleration was caused by three challenges: Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iOS update, which enhanced user privacy and made it harder to target ads based on third-party data; competition from ByteDance's TikTok; and macroeconomic headwinds for the digital advertising market.\n\nAs Meta's ad sales slowed, it ramped up its spending on its unprofitable Reality Labs segment, which houses its virtual reality and augmented reality devices and its metaverse initiatives.\n\nThat mix of slowing sales and rising expenses sent Meta's stock plunging to a seven-year low of $88.09 on Nov. 4, 2022. However, the stock has soared by more than 500% since that day.\n\nThe bulls rushed back as Meta's revenue growth accelerated again. In 2023, its revenue and earnings grew 16% and 73%, respectively. Its advertising business recovered as it countered Apple's changes by mining more first-party data with AI tools, it attracted more spending from Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies that wanted to reach overseas customers, and it expanded its Reels short videos to keep pace with TikTok. Meta remained committed to expanding its Reality Labs unit, but it laid off thousands of employees to expand its operating margins again.\n\nFor 2024, the consensus expectations of analysts are that Meta's revenue will grow by 18% and its earnings will increase by 36% as its core advertising business grows and gains new users. In the first quarter of 2024, 3.24 billion people used at least one of its family of apps (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp) daily -- up 7% from a year earlier. A proposed ban on TikTok in the U.S. -- which is set to take effect next January unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, sells it -- could drive even more users back to its apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy would Meta's big investors take profits?\n\nMeta launched a new $50 billion stock buyback plan and initiated its first dividend this year, and its stock still looks reasonably valued at 27 times forward earnings. Yet, three unpredictable challenges might throttle its near-term growth.\n\nFirst, Chinese advertisers accounted for 10% of its top line in 2023 and drove 5 percentage points of its total revenue growth. During Meta's first-quarter conference call, CFO Susan Li warned investors it would be \"lapping periods of increasingly strong demand\" from those advertisers in 2024.\n\nSecond, Meta stopped disclosing Facebook's total number of monthly and daily active users, as well as the monthly user count for its family of apps. Those changes suggest Facebook's growth is still cooling off as it saturates the global market. Its growth slowdown could worsen if TikTok dodges a U.S. ban.\n\nLastly, Meta slightly raised the outlook for its full-year expenses last quarter to account for \"higher infrastructure and legal costs\" related to the expansion of its AI services, investments in its Reality Labs segment, and tougher \"legal and regulatory headwinds.\"\n\nThose challenges could cause Meta to miss analysts' estimates over the next few quarters. Persistent macroeconomic headwinds could also keep interest rates elevated and compress the valuations of Meta and other tech stocks. In light of these risks, it's understandable that some big investors might think this is the right time to take some profits.\n\nBut should you follow their lead?\n\nIt isn't surprising to see some billionaire investors trim their stake in Meta after its massive gains since late 2022, but I don't think it makes sense for most long-term investors to follow their lead and dump the stock right now. Meta's stock has already rallied about 19% from its average trading price in the first quarter and risen another 9% since the end of March, and I believe its strengths still outweigh its weaknesses.\n\nMeta's apps are already used by 40% of the world's population, and it still has plenty of ways to expand its ecosystem and widen its moat against other advertising platforms. Its stock might waver over the next few quarters, but I'm confident it will head higher over the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

On the other hand, the broad-market S&P 500 Index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite have climbed 17.8% and 23.8%, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow recorded its all-time high of 40,077.40 on an intraday basis on Mar 20 and 40,003.59 on a closing basis on May 17. Technically, at its current level of 39,753.75, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 39,035.26 and 37,365.23, respectively.\n\nThe 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trendsetter. Historically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the asset (in this case the Dow Index) becomes a strong possibility.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to four Dow stocks that have strong earnings growth potential for the rest of 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart shows the price performance of our four picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon.com Inc. AMZN is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. A deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive for AMZN.\n\nThe strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home offerings are tailwinds. The advertising business is also pretty robust. AMZN enjoys a strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are its other positives.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Amazon.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 57.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last 60 days.\n\nApple Inc. AAPL has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, AAPL’s competitive position is expected to improve. Moreover, AAPL is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. AAPL’s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Apple has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.8% and 7.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending September 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nWalmart Inc. WMT has been gaining from its highly diversified business with contributions from various segments, channels and formats. WMT has been benefiting from an increase in in-store and digital channel traffic due to its robust omnichannel initiatives. Store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped 50% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nWalmart’s strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has also been rewarding, as evidenced by the constant increase in the market share for groceries. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled WMT’s first-quarter results and led to an encouraging fiscal 2025 view.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Walmart has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3% over the last 60 days.\n\nChevron Corp. CVX is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin. Further, the recent acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen CVX’s presence in oil-rich Guyana.\n\nCVX seems one of the best-placed global integrated oil companies to achieve sustainable production ramp-up. We expect the company's average output during 2024 to rise 4-7% year over year, due to the PDC Energy acquisition and robust output in the showpiece Permian Basin region.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Chevron has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 2.3% and 0.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Aditya Kalra\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - An investigation by India's antitrust body has found that Apple exploited its dominant position in the market for app stores on its iOS operating system, engaging \"in abusive conduct and practices\", a confidential report seen by Reuters showed.\n\nThe Competition Commission of India (CCI) has been investigating Apple Inc since 2021 for possibly abusing its dominant position in the apps market by forcing developers to use its proprietary in-app purchase system.\n\nApple has denied wrongdoing saying it was a small player in India where phones that use Google's Android system are dominant.\n\nThe CCI's investigations unit, in its 142-page report which is not public but was seen by Reuters, said Apple wields \"significant influence\" over how digital products and services reach consumers, especially through its iOS platform and App Store.\n\n\"Apple App Store is an unavoidable trading partner for app developers, and resultantly, app developers have no choice but to adhere to Apple's unfair terms, including the mandatory use of Apple's proprietary billing and payment system,\" the CCI unit said in the June 24 report.\n\n\"From the perspective of app developers, Apple iOS ecosystem is indispensable.\"\n\nApple and the CCI did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Indian investigation report comes as Apple faces increased antitrust scrutiny in other regions.\n\nIn June, European Union antitrust regulators said Apple breached the bloc's tech rules, which could result in a hefty fine for the iPhone maker. The company also faces an investigation into new fees imposed on app developers.\n\nIn January, in response to a new EU law called the Digital Markets Act, Apple outlined plans to allow software developers to distribute their apps to users in the European Union outside of Apple's own App Store.\n\nThe CCI report is the most critical stage of the Indian investigation and it will now be reviewed by the watchdog's senior officials.\n\nApple and other parties will be allowed to respond before a final decision is reached, which could include monetary fines as well as directives to change business practices.\n\nAPPLE VS GOOGLE IN INDIA\n\nThe Indian case was first filed by a little-known, non-profit group called \"Together We Fight Society\" which argued Apple's in-app fee of up to 30% hurts competition by raising costs for app developers and customers.\n\nLater, a group of Indian startups, Alliance of Digital India Foundation, and Tinder-owner Match filed similar cases at the CCI against Apple, which were all heard together.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe CCI investigation team said in its report that no third-party payment processor was being permitted by Apple to provide the services for in-app purchases.\n\nIt added that in most cases the apps are also not being allowed to include any external links that direct customers to other purchasing mechanisms, violating Indian competition laws.\n\nApple's iOS powered about 3.5% of 690 million smartphones in India as of mid-2024, with the rest using Android, according to Counterpoint Research, though it adds Apple's smartphone base in the country has become five times larger in the last five years.\n\nIn its submissions to the CCI, Apple argued its market share in India is an \"insignificant\" 0-5%, while Google commands 90-100%. The company also argued that the in-app payment system allowed it to maintain and develop the safety of its App Store.\n\nBut the CCI said, \"App stores are OS (operating system) specific and Apple's App store is the sole App store available for reaching iOS users.\"\n\n\"The payment policy of Apple adversely affects the app developers, users and other payment processors,\" it said.\n\nThe CCI report showed it considered comments from many companies including Microsoft, Uber and Amazon during its Apple investigation.\n\nGoogle too has faced CCI's heat for its in-app payments mechanism.\n\nIn October 2022, the CCI imposed a $113 million fine on Google and said it must allow the use of third-party billing and stop forcing developers to use its in-app payment system. Google has challenged the decision.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Hugh Lawson)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Tesla (TSLA)\n\nTesla shares were lower in pre-market trading after dropping over 8% during Thursday’s session as the company’s share of US electric vehicle sales slid below 50% for the first time.\n\nElon Musk’s group saw its share in the battery-run car market fall to 49.7% in the second quarter, down from 59% a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive, a car services and data group.\n\nInvestors were also spooked after Tesla said it was postponing its planned robotaxi unveiling to October to allow teams working on the project more time to build additional prototypes.\n\nThe delay has been communicated internally to Tesla employees but has yet to be announced publicly, Bloomberg reported.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: How my IBM boss taught me to navigate a complex organisation – and drink Scotch\n\nIn its last earnings report, Tesla said the robotaxi will be “purpose built”, which is a term used in the autonomous vehicle industry to describe vehicles built from the ground up to be self-driving and that often lack traditional controls like steering wheels and pedals.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia lost almost 6% in the last session and was 1% lower in pre-market trading after a “sell the news” reaction to the latest inflation figures appeared to drag on the chip maker.\n\nInvestors flocked to interest rate-sensitive stocks after the consumer price index report showed inflation fell last month for the first time since May 2020, raising the prospects of Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.\n\nNVDA stock closed the latest trading session at a valuation of $134.91 after adding 2.68% and 10.92% in the previous five trading days.\n\nTech heavyweights Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) all fell more than 1%.\n\nIn 2023, the AI stock had a huge 239% run and it's up around 159% so far this year, even after the recent drop.\n\nPfizer (PFE)\n\nShares in Pfizer were higher in pre-market trading as the pharma company announced it is moving forward with its once-daily weight loss pill.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe US pharmaceutical company said it was planning to start studies to test different doses of the experimental treatment later this year.\n\nThe drug is one of several being developed by Pfizer but the company said its once-daily danuglipron treatment was the most advanced and had the potential to be competitive in the market.\n\nThe announcement comes as Pfizer struggles to convince investors that it can find a path to growth after the COVID-19 pandemic, as sales of its blockbuster vaccine and other COVID products have plummeted.\n\nRead more: Is bitcoin heading for a bear market?\n\nMikael Dolsten, Pfizer’s outgoing chief scientific officer, said that danuglipron “has demonstrated good efficacy in a twice-daily formulation, and we believe a once-daily formulation has the potential to have a competitive profile in the oral GLP-1 space”.\n\nSuperdry (SDRY.L)\n\nDistressed fashion chain Superdry will have its last day of trading on the London Stock Exchange today, bringing its listing to an end after 14 years.\n\nDropping out from the London Stock Exchange will help Superdry save on cash, with the delisting will becoming effective from Monday.\n\nThe company’s ordinary shares will be admitted to trading on the JP Jenkins securities matching platform from 15 July.\n\nThe fashion business, which runs 216 shops as well as franchised stores, has been looking at various ways to save money after a year of weakening sales and deepening losses.\n\nPlans to cut costs include the firm looking at reducing rents on 39 of its UK shops, as well as raising money through a sale of new shares.\n\nAt its peak, Superdry was valued at more than half a billion pounds, but shares have since collapsed over 97% and today is worth barely £3m.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "46% of Warren Buffett's $410 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "When it comes to Wall Street investing greats, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett is on a pedestal of his own. Since taking the reins at Berkshire in 1965, he's overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 5,028,429%, as of the closing bell on July 10. On an annualized basis, the \"Oracle of Omaha\" has practically doubled up the total return, including dividends paid, of the benchmark S&P 500 since the mid-1960s.\n\nBuffett's formula for success primarily involves buying stakes in brand-name, time-tested businesses with well-defined competitive advantages. While this strategy places a lot of emphasis on value stocks, the occasional growth stock does wind up in the 44-stock, $410 billion portfolio Buffett and his team oversee at Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nWhat might be especially surprising is discovering that Warren Buffett and his cohorts have, at least inadvertently, bet big on the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nAI involves the use of software and systems for tasks that humans would typically oversee or undertake. The capacity for these systems to learn and evolve over time, becoming more proficient at their tasks or perhaps learning new skills, is what gives AI such broad-reaching utility.\n\nAs of the closing bell on July 10, a whopping 46% ($188.8 billion) of the $410 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway was invested in four top-notch AI stocks.\n\nApple: $183.9 billion (44.8% of invested assets)\n\nThe lion's share of Buffett's exposure to artificial intelligence rests on the shoulders of tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which accounts for close to 45% of Berkshire's $410 billion of invested assets.\n\nIn June, during the company's annual Worldwide Developer Conference, Apple unveiled what it dubbed \"Apple Intelligence.\" Though Apple has been leaning on various AI solutions for years, it laid out plans to bring chatbot solutions, powered by ChatGPT, to its operating systems, as well as make its voice assistant Siri a lot more intuitive.\n\nHowever, the Oracle of Omaha and his team didn't buy into Apple because of its role in the future of AI. More than likely, Buffett and his close advisors recognized its dominance in smartphones -- Apple has sustained a 50% or greater domestic share of the smartphone market since introducing 5G-capable iPhones in late 2020 -- as well as the success it's having in shifting to a services-based model that's driven by higher-margin subscriptions.\n\nWhile Apple certainly deserves a premium given its first-mover advantages and cutting-edge innovations, its growth engine has stalled out in recent years. Although it's possible AI could be the catalyst that reignites growth, Apple's $674 billion in cumulative stock buybacks since the start of 2013 have done most of the heavy lifting of late.\n\nStory continues\n\nBYD: $2 billion (0.5% of invested assets)\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock that the Oracle of Omaha and his team have bet big on is China-based electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer BYD(OTC: BYDD.F). The roughly 65.8 million shares Berkshire holds in BYD equates to a 6% stake in the company, which is worth around $2 billion.\n\nNewer vehicles are becoming increasingly more reliant on technology and AI to improve safety and comfort for drivers. For instance, in mid-January, BYD launched its Xuanji Architecture, which is designed to help drivers with automated parking and other advanced driving assistance technologies.\n\nBYD has also been working with Chinese regulators to test Level 3 autonomous driving on high-speed roads in the city of Shenzhen. U.S. rival Tesla has been stick at Level 2 autonomy for years, despite the continued promises of CEO Elon Musk that Level 5 autonomy is \"about one year away.\"\n\nWhat's been particularly exciting about BYD's production ramp is that it's now selling more battery-EVs than Tesla worldwide. While Tesla still retains its first-mover advantages in North America, BYD's rate of ascension in China has dwarfed all other competitors. Image source: Amazon.\n\nAmazon: $2 billion (0.5% of invested assets)\n\nThe third stock that accounts for another multibillion-dollar bet on AI is none other than e-commerce legend Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). The 10 million shares of Amazon stock held by Berkshire works out to a market value of roughly $2 billion.\n\nAlthough most investors are familiar with Amazon because of its dominant online marketplace, cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) is, arguably, its most important operating segment. Generative AI solutions can be leaned on by businesses in AWS to deploy virtual chatbots or assistants and build/scale large language models (LLMs).\n\nThe best thing about enterprise cloud spending is that we're still in the very early innings of its expansion. This is fantastic news considering that AWS has already surpassed $100 billion in annual run-rate sales, and is Amazon's highest-margin segment.\n\nThe company's other fast-paced ancillary segments are holding their own, too. Advertising services and subscription services offer sustained double-digit growth. Attracting 2.5 billion unique visitors to its website monthly has helped with ad sales, while a growing content library, which now includes Thursday Night Football, has almost certainly lifted the aggregate number of global Prime subscribers.\n\nSnowflake: $842 million (0.2% of invested assets)\n\nThe fourth AI stock that, along with Apple, BYD, and Amazon, collectively accounts for 46% of Berkshire Hathaway's $410 billion of invested assets is cloud data-warehousing company Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW). Similar to Amazon, Snowflake was added to Berkshire's portfolio by one of Buffett's investing \"lieutenants,\" Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.\n\nLast year, Snowflake acquired Neeva, a company that leverages generative AI solutions within the cloud to improve search. Snowflake plans to rely on various generative AI solutions within its data cloud to allow its customers to easily analyze data and build, train, and deploy LLMs.\n\nBeyond its AI ties, the lure of Snowflake as an investment has long been its ingrained competitive advantages. Snowflake built its data cloud atop the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platforms. Whereas sharing data can be challenging across competing platforms, it's a breeze with Snowflake.\n\nLikewise, Snowflake has shunned the subscription-as-a-service model in favor of a pay-as-you-go approach. The transparency of businesses only paying for the Snowflake Compute Credits and data storage space used has helped it retain clients and steadily grow its base of bigger businesses.\n\nHowever, Snowflake is a pricey stock and certainly doesn't fit the mold of a traditional Warren Buffett investment. Valued at 13 times forecast sales in the current fiscal year, and roughly 139 times earnings per share (EPS) in the following year, Snowflake has a lot to prove to Wall Street.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Over the past 3 months, FMET has added 11.25% to its value and has risen to the current level of $31.94. The inclusion of top-ranked tech stocks in the index, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), has contributed to the current growth, which may continue in the coming months. Experts predict that the stock will reach the $40 mark and have high expectations for the fund’s future.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) is a giant of the tech industry, and therefore has enough resources to reconfigure its activities to meet the trends. One of the latest such changes is the reformatting of the 2022-2024 period. The decline in the share price below $100 was the result of concerns about aggressive investment in metaverse initiatives. However, after breaking out of the low point in October 2022, the company began a steady growth that continues to this day. The implementation of AI technology and related advances have propelled Meta to unprecedented heights. With a price per share of $534.69, the company exceeds its 2022 figures by five times, but the potential is still not fully unlocked so META is still among the undervalued metaverse stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s focus on artificial intelligence is paying off in the form of more accurate targeted advertising and, consequently, higher ad prices. The latest earnings report exceeded market expectations and confirmed the correctness of the diversification approach. The bullish sentiment around META continues to grow, as does the wave of excitement over the positive impact of AI, which means we can expect new rounds of the company’s development shortly.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nArchitecture, engineering, entertainment, and construction are all areas that require a reliable software provider, and Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ: ADSK) meets this demand. The company with a market capitalization of $53.08 billion has gained a foothold in the market and become an integral part of many high-tech metaverse projects. After the downturn of April-May 2024, Autodesk began to gain momentum, as reflected in its indicators such as the 50-day moving average (+29.12) and the 200-day moving average (+42.99). The latter indicator shows an increase of 21.07%, which characterizes the bullish momentum of the stock. ADSK has not yet caught up with the 52-week high ($279.53), so it remains in the group of undervalued metaverse stocks.\n\nAutodesk prove its ability to manage resources with its latest unaudited financial results, which indicate a return on equity (ROE) of 65.46% and a net margin of 17.66%. Based, the company is a well-thought-out manager of shareholder capital and generates significant profit from its revenue streams. Even though the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the current fiscal year is 53.34, the expected value for the next fiscal year is 24.49, which demonstrates Autodesk’s earnings potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Julia Magas did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "It is becoming clear that 2024 is a very different year than the last year. Although we’re still in the middle of a bull market, it is more of a broad-based rally, higher this time than it was in 2023.\n\nBack then, the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks accounted for virtually all of the market’s gains. This year, although most of those companies are still performing well — and some like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continue to do very well — the seven tech giants are not having the same impact.\n\nWell, on the S&P 500 they are, because it is a market capitalization-weighted index. Six of the Magnificent Seven are worth $1 trillion or more (only laggard Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is not). That means their movements affect the index more than they do a price-weighted index like the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt is also why the S&P 500 is up 17% year-to-date and the Dow is up a measly 4%. Yet this offers investors an opportunity. It suggests undervalued Dow stocks may be more prevalent than those on the popular benchmark index.\n\nSo let’s dive into the three companies below that may be some of the best undervalued Dow stocks to buy today.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is an investment bank in transition. Weighed down by acquisitions in wealth management and installment lending that it thought would diversify its operations, today the financial giant is reorganizing its efforts to concentrate on investment banking, trading, and investment management. It will continue divesting consumer-facing businesses.\n\nGoldman took big writedowns on its home improvement lender GreenSky, which it sold last October. It also scrapped its co-branded credit cards with General Motors (NYSE:GM) while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) terminated its Goldman Sachs card.\n\nThe turnaround effort is working. First-quarter profit exceeded analyst expectations as the investment banking division benefited from increases in underwriting and dealmaking. Last year was a mixed one for mergers and acquisitions. While dealmaking hit a decade low, some of the biggest acquisitions ever took place, including Exxon Mobil’s (NYSE:XOM) purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources. Goldman Sachs was the lead advisor on the $60 billion transaction.\n\nThe investment banker’s stock is up 50% over the past year and Wall Street expects earnings to grow 22% annually for the next five years. Trading at just a fraction to those projected growth rates, Goldman Sachs stock is one of the leading undervalued Dow stocks to buy today.\n\nStory continues\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nIndustrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM) has destroyed value for investors for years. Over the past decade, the owner of Post-It Notes and Scotch-brand tape has a total return of just 23% compared to a 190% return by the Dow.\n\nIts malaise culminated in May of this year when this former Dividend King slashed its dividend by more than half. Facing mounting lawsuits over faulty products (made by a company it acquired) and environmental pollution allegations, 3M was forced to conserve cash. But it also spun off its consumer products business Solventum (NYSE:SOLV) to return some value to shareholders and began settling the lawsuits against it.\n\nToday, 3M is a much healthier company financially and the markets approve. Shares are up 9% in 2024 which turned the conglomerate into an undervalued Dow stock worth buying. 3M goes for 12 times earnings estimates and a deeply discounted 11x free cash flow (FCF). With a lower dividend payment, 3M can now support the payout. MMM stock deserves renewed consideration by investors.\n\nDow (DOW) DOW Chemical sign outside of a corporate building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis is fun to write: chemical stock Dow (NYSE:DOW) is an undervalued Dow stock. Shares trade at 12 times earnings estimates, a fraction of sales and 14x FCF. Dow stock, though, is down 5% this year and off 2% for the last 12 months. Shares remain 27% below the all-time high they hit in 2021.\n\nThe tide is turning for the chemicals company. Demand recovered in the first quarter even though sales were down 9% year-over-year. However, they were up 1% sequentially. Chairman and CEO Jim Fitterling told investors, “We captured improving demand, maintained pricing, and benefited from lower feedstock and energy costs.” As a result, volumes grew and margins expanded.\n\nBecause chemicals are a commodity and their price tends to move in tandem with Brent crude oil prices, Dow should benefit from Brent prices north of $84 a barrel. That is 5% above the price one year ago. The Energy Information Administration forecasts oil to trade around $89 a barrel in the back half of 2024. It does not expect that to change much next year as it forecasts Brent crude at $88 a barrel.\n\nThe higher prices should help Dow improve its capacity utilization. And with lower natural gas prices in the mix now and going forward, the chemicals stock should also benefit as it lowers its feedstock costs. That points to improving profitability and should have investors putting DOW stock on their buy list.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in MMM, SOLV and XOM stock.

People walk past the Samsung logo displayed on a glass door at the company's Seocho building in Seoul , Korea.\n\nSamsung’s upcoming Galaxy Ring, meanwhile, will be focused on \"health monitoring, tracking and personalized insights while worn comfortably on a finger, even while asleep,\" it said.\n\nThe company has set its price at $399.99 for the U.S.\n\nIt will use AI to help analyze sleep metrics and to increase the wearer’s \"awareness of the ways your health influences your daily life\" through an \"Energy Score\" with recommendations.\n\nSAMSUNG UNVEILS GALAXY S24 SMARTPHONES\n\nOther functions will provide heart rate and activity-related insights.\n\nWhen the Galaxy Ring debuts later in the month, it will join the Oura Ring and similar products already available on the market.\n\nSamsung also highlighted some of the interconnectability of its devices while unveiling the Galaxy Ring and Galaxy Watch Ultra. The ring, for example, can be used to turn off a phone alarm and can experience longer battery life when paired with the Watch, according to the company.\n\nSamsung is slated on July 31 to release its second-quarter financial results.\n\nIn the first quarter, the company generated $52.4 billion in total revenue.

        "content": "Investing.com - In interview with Bloomberg Television on Thursday, Steve Eisman, a senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman Group, expressed his belief in the continued dominance of US megacap technology shares for years to come. He predicts this trend will be driven by the increasing accessibility of artificial intelligence (AI) through consumer electronics.\n\nEisman, known for his successful \"Big Short\" bet against subprime mortgages before the global financial crisis, suggests that consumers' desire for new AI applications on smartphones and personal computers will trigger the \"biggest refresh cycle in history.\" This wave of upgraded device purchases will likely benefit tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL).\n\n⚠️ Track your favorite companies with InvestingPro! Our Summer Sale is now on, click here to save over 50%!⚠️\n\nDespite Nvidia's high valuation, Eisman is not concerned. He points out that the company's earnings have tripled, making it a sound investment. Eisman has previously disclosed that he owns a substantial amount of Nvidia shares.\n\nEisman also shared his views on the broader economy, stating that although it's slowing down, the situation is stable. He sees no fundamental reason to short stocks significantly.\n\nReflecting on his past experiences, Eisman said, \"I predicted the end of the world once — it was pretty awful for everybody. I have no interest in predicting it again and there's no data to show that it's going to happen.\"\n\nRegarding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., Eisman believes there are times to short the company when fundamentals are deteriorating. However, he concedes that this becomes challenging when investors focus on Tesla's self-driving car and AI ambitions rather than its fundamentals. Eisman clarified that while he doesn't short for his clients, he occasionally does so on a personal basis.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSteve Eisman: Big tech dominance to continue, predicts Trump victory\n\nExclusive-Anson Funds pushing Five9 to explore a sale, sources say\n\nStock Market Today: Nasdaq tumbles despite soft CPI data, Nvidia falls 5.6%\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple’s Vision Pro headset, a first-of-its-kind device from the iPhone maker, arrives in the UK on Friday.\n\nIt is the US tech giant’s first move into mixed reality and will serve as a marker for future consumer appetite for such devices.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about Apple’s new gadget.\n\n– What is the Vision Pro?\n\nThe Vision Pro is a wearable computer, designed as a set of goggles with internal displays that overlay apps and content on to the real world around the wearer so they blend together. An Apple Vision Pro user showing the Mac Virtual Display (Apple/PA)\n\nIn the industry this is broadly known as mixed reality – where the real and digital combine, but Apple calls it spatial computing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVision Pro wearers navigate this world using hand gestures, eye movements and voice commands, and it is powered by a phone-sized battery pack which is wired to the headset and designed to slip into a user’s pocket.\n\n– What is it meant to be used for?\n\nApple says the device has a range of uses, including as a productivity tool to help with work – for example, the wearer can create an additional display to hover next to their computer screen to help with work.\n\nIt can also be used as a communication tool for FaceTime calls using life-size video tiles.\n\nBut it is as an entertainment device that the Vision Pro has captured most attention so far.\n\nIt enables users to have their own personal cinema-sized screen for watching films and TV, or to play video games, as well as offering large multi-screen options for watching live sport. An Apple Vision Pro movie store (Apple/PA)\n\nApple has also talked up the Vision Pro’s capacity as a new way to look back at old photos and videos in a larger, more immersive format. The company also allows its flagship iPhone models to capture what it calls spatial video, which take on a 3D effect when viewed on Vision Pro.\n\n– What about battery life?\n\nApple says the portable power pack will give users around two hours of battery life from Vision Pro, or two and a half hours of video playback.\n\nVision Pro can also be plugged into a wall socket and used all day.\n\n– How much does Vision Pro cost?\n\nAs an ultra-premium technology device, the Vision Pro does not come cheap – it starts at £3,499 for the 256GB storage capacity model.",

        "title": "Apple loosens its grip on iPhone payments to end EU antitrust case",
        "content": "Good news for iPhone users: You will no longer have to use Apple Pay for tap-to-pay payments! Apple has decided to give a boost to third-party mobile wallet developers, by finally granting them free access to the handset’s near-field communication (NFC) contactless technology.\n\nNow the bad news: The above does not apply to you if you live outside the European Economic Area, meaning the EU plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.\n\nApple is only changing its ways to end a long-running antitrust case. The European Commission began investigating Apple’s restrictions on the iPhone’s NFC chip over four years ago and issued charges in 2022. Apple proposed changes earlier this year. The Commission asked app developers and various financial services companies for their opinions, then asked Apple to make some tweaks. Apple came back with a revised set of commitments, which the Commission announced today.\n\nUnder the commitments, Apple will have to give third-party mobile wallet developers NFC access for free, using a fair and objective process to decide their eligibility. These third-party wallets will run in host card emulation (HCE) mode to ensure secure storage of payment credentials, as already happens on Android. The Commission claims this is as secure as Apple Pay’s method of relying on a hardware “secure element” to protect details, and offers the same user experience.\n\nUsers will get to choose whichever wallet they like as the default, so it automatically pops up with a double-click on the side, or when the phone is placed next to a reader. People with Apple IDs registered in the EEA will also get to tap away with third-party wallets while traveling outside the region, but only if they’re on a temporary trip. Developers will also be able to combine their newfound payments functionality with other NFC-based features like using the phone as a concert ticket or car key.\n\nThe European Central Bank has given its stamp of approval to the changes, though it also suggested Apple might find itself saddled with further obligations when the digital euro becomes a reality (it’s currently in the preparation phase).\n\n“From now on, Apple can no longer use its control over the iPhone ecosystem to keep other mobile wallets out of the market,” crowed the Commission’s antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, in a press conference today. “Competing wallet developers, as well as consumers, will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice, while keeping payments secure.”\n\nTaken alongside Apple’s grudging acceptance of third-party iOS app stores—one of its many obligations under the EU’s new Digital Markets Act—it’s clear that the company's control is eroding fast.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis may only affect Europe for now, and there may yet be teething trouble in the implementation, but Apple’s big problem is that the rest of the world is watching. If third-party app stores and wallets can work in Europe without the sky caving in, then they can work elsewhere. And when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or some other national regulator proposes a similar change, Apple won’t have much of a counterargument.\n\nIn other Apple news, Bloomberg reports that the company’s $3,499 Vision Pro virtual-reality headset still hasn’t broken the barrier of selling 100,000 units in a quarter, and U.S. sales in particular are likely to crater until a cheaper version comes along.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple’s Vision Pro headset comes to the UK on Friday",
        "content": "Apple’s Vision Pro headset, which blends the real world with digital content in front of the wearer’s eyes, goes on sale in the UK for the first time on Friday.\n\nThe “spatial computing” device starts at £3,499 and is controlled by the user’s eyes, hands and voice.\n\nIt was first released in the US early in the year before mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore at the end of June, and is a major new product line for the technology giant – its first venture into mixed reality headsets.\n\nThe Vision Pro is in essence a wearable computer that overlays apps and other content on top of the real world – with Apple highlighting the device’s potential as a personal large screen cinema or gallery for looking through photos and videos.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe headset features built-in speakers and attaches using an adjustable headband, while a wire leads from the device to a battery pack which sits in the user’s pocket, enabling users to move around while wearing it.\n\nApple says it is designed to offer more immersive experiences in entertainment and gaming, as well as a new platform from which users can work and interact with others.\n\nWhen the wider international rollout of the device was confirmed last month, Apple boss Tim Cook said: “The enthusiasm for Apple Vision Pro has been extraordinary, and we are thrilled to introduce the magic of spatial computing to more customers around the world.\n\n“We can’t wait for more people to see the impossible become possible, whether working and collaborating with an infinite canvas for apps, reliving treasured memories in three dimensions, watching TV shows and movies in a one-of-a-kind personal cinema, or enjoying brand-new spatial experiences that defy imagination.”\n\nHowever, virtual, mixed or augmented reality headsets are still to truly catch on with the general public, and industry experts have said Apple’s first move into the space is not guaranteed to change that.\n\nStory continues\n\nLeo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight, told the PA news agency: “The Apple Vision Pro is undoubtedly a headline draw in the world of virtual and augmented reality, but it’s fair to say that its expansion into other geographies comes with less fanfare than expected.\n\n“After a wave of early enthusiasm for the spatial computing device, sales for the Vision Pro appeared to dampen down, and it feels as though Apple is struggling to clearly articulate the value of the device to buyers – especially given the £3,500 price tag.\n\n“The Vision Pro remains a stunning piece of design and is easily one of the most impressive pieces of technology I’ve ever used.\n\n“There’s also no doubt that Apple’s presence provides a halo effect for the spatial computing industry, and with Samsung also committed to launching a headset there’s strong momentum in the segment.\n\n“But Apple is running into the same fundamental problem that has vexed rivals in the world of virtual reality, which is providing a strong pipeline of use cases and applications.\n\n“Until buyers on the high street are given a clear reason why they might want to put on a headset on a daily basis, it’s a tricky sell.”",

        "content": "Apple’s AAPL Mac sales are expected to have jumped 20.8% year over year in the second quarter of 2024, per latest data from market research firm IDC. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 5.7 million Macs, thereby grabbing a market share of 8.8% compared with 7.5% in the year-ago quarter. \r\n\r\nApple’s estimated shipment growth rate is the largest in IDC’s vendor list. While shipments of Acer Group, Lenovo LNVGY and HP HPQ are expected to have grown 13.7%, 3.7% and 1.8%, respectively, Dell Technologies DELL is likely to have declined 2.4%.\r\n\r\nLenovo still leads the market with a 22.7% share trailed by HPQ and DELL at 21.1% and 15.5%, respectively. However, Apple gained the most in terms of market share, followed by Acer Group and Lenovo. Dell Technologies and HP lost market share per IDC data.\r\n\r\nIDC estimates 64.9 million sold units in the second quarter of 2024, up 3% year over year. In contrast, Gartner estimates shipment of 60.6 million units, up 1.9% year over year. In Gartner’s list also Apple gains the most in terms of shipments (up 13.1%) as well as market share (9% versus 8.1% in the year-ago quarter). (Read More: What Insight Does Q2 PC Data Offer for the Market's Future Course?)\n\nIDC 2Q24 Shipment Details IDC\n\nImage Source: IDC\n\nGartner 2Q24 Shipment Details Gartner\n\nImage Source: Gartner\n\nApple Shares Ride on Strong Mac Sales, AI Focus\n\nLately, AAPL shares have been gaining attention from investors thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, its annual developers’ event, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). \r\n\r\nBoth IDC and Gartner’s strong Mac sales estimates provide a further boost to Apple’s share price movement. Apple’s AI push is expected to bring consumer-focused AI-enabled PCs into the market, thereby aiding PC shipments in the long haul.\r\n\r\nApple shares hit a 52-week high of $233.08 on Jul 10 and finally closed at $232.98, up 21% year to date. Since Jun 10, when the iPhone maker hosted WWDC, Apple shares have jumped 20.6%, outperforming the Zacks Computer-Mini industry’s gain of 18.2% and the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 8%.\n\nApple’s Performance Since WWDC Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple’s stringent privacy standards.\r\n\r\nSiri, powered by Apple Intelligence, has become more natural, contextually aware, and capable of handling complex tasks. Users can communicate with Siri using both voice and text, and the assistant can now maintain context across multiple requests. Siri’s functionality now extends to providing device support and answering detailed questions about using the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\r\n\r\nIn a significant enhancement, Apple is integrating ChatGPT into its platforms, allowing users to access its expertise directly within iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia. Siri can utilize ChatGPT’s capabilities, with user consent, to provide more detailed and accurate information. ChatGPT will also be available in the systemwide Writing Tools, enhancing content creation with advanced language models and image generation.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nApple’s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition from local competitors. It expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $83.75 billion, indicating 2.38% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings has increased by a penny to $1.33 per share over the past 30 days suggesting year-over-year growth of 5.56%.\n\nPositive Estimate Revision Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlthough Apple’s Value Style Score of D indicates a stretched valuation at this moment, the momentum in Mac sales and AI push is hard to ignore for growth-oriented investors. An expanding user base of more than 2 billion active devices makes Apple’s investment profile attractive. \r\n\r\nApple’s strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generating ability are also noteworthy. As of Mar 30, 2024, its cash & marketable securities balance was a whopping $162.34 billion, making share buyback and dividend payout sustainable. Apple’s board has authorized an additional $110 billion for share repurchases and raised dividend payout by 4% to 25 cents per share.\r\n\r\nApple currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "content": "This article looks at the most advanced country in Asia in 2024. To see the full free list, you can head over to the 15 Most Advanced Countries in Asia in 2024.\n\nA report by McKinsey in 2020 highlighted the progress made by Asia in technology and innovation over the past decade, accounting for 52% of the global growth in technology companies' revenues. The continent’s share of the new unicorns established between 2012 and 2020 stood at 36%, an improvement from the decade prior when the contribution was measured at 29%.\n\nMoreover, Asia also represented 51% of the global growth in R&D expenditure during the period, led the world when it came to growth in the number of patents, and also contributed significantly toward the increase in science and engineering research articles published. Between 2016 and 2018, three-fourths of the world’s STEM education graduates came from India, while in 2020, Asia went past Europe in combating climate change, emerging as the global leader in renewable technology with an installation capacity of 45%.\n\nThe advancements in technology and innovation have fueled economic growth in the region, where technology has widely been deployed across sectors, driving enhanced productivity in the corporate sphere, and boosting economic development and public service delivery at a macro level. Many Western observers have already dubbed the 21st century Asia’s century, and the continent now seems to be catching up to the expectations faster than anticipated.\n\nAsia, which accounted for less than one-third of the global economy in purchasing power parity terms in 2000 is now on track to represent more than half of the world’s GDP by 2040, as per a report by McKinsey. The continent is also expected to represent more than 40% of the global consumption by then. Furthermore, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, China and India are set to go past the United States as the world's first and second largest economies by 2050, with the Chinese alone forecasted to make up 20% of the global economy over the next three decades.\n\nSeveral large Western corporations including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have made inroads in the continent by outsourcing some of their key operations to Asia to tap into the lucrative opportunities offered by the huge markets, coupled with making the most of the cheap, skillful labor that is available in abundance in the region. About 95% of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks are manufactured in China, today. The country, along with Hong Kong and Taiwan, was the source of 19% of the tech giant’s revenue during the fiscal year 2023. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has recently further expanded its presence in Asia through its new stores opening in India and Malaysia.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s investments in the continent have seen an uptick in Asia, with the company, in 2021, announcing the establishment of a new data center in Indonesia. The new setup is likely to increase revenues for the tech giant by $6.3 billion. On the other hand, the International Data Corporation (IDC) expects Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to add 100,000 new jobs and $39 billion to the United Arab Emirates’ economy through its cloud-based services between 2022 and 2026.\n\nAsian corporations themselves contribute a whopping $19 trillion to the global economy every year. The continent is home to many of the largest corporations in the world, including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA).\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a dominant player in the global foundry industry, accounting for 60% of all output. It is currently the third-best hardware stock to buy now, with 135 hedge funds bullish about the company, according to Insider Monkey’s database as of the first quarter of 2024. During May, the company’s revenue grew 30% to a total of $7.1 billion, driven by ASML’s announcement to ship its advanced high NA EUV scanner to TSM. The machine is crucial to future manufacturing technologies. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) has a forward P/E ratio of 26 at par with the industry average.\n\nJapanese car manufacturer Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) has a share of 11.5% of the world’s automobile industry. The company sold a record 11.2 million cars worldwide in 2023, which helped Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) to retain its status as the world’s top car maker for a fourth successive year. On the other hand, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) continues to remain a major force in the e-commerce market, controlling more than 50% of China’s online retail industry. The Most Advanced Country in Asia in 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have ranked the most advanced countries in Asia in 2024 based on three weighted metrics: technological advancement, R&D expenditure as a share of the GDP (during the latest year for which data is available), and their level of human development. The weights, in order, were 40%, 40%, and 20%, respectively. Data was sourced from WIPO’s 2023 Global Innovation Index (GII), the World Bank, and the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nIt was observed where each country ranked on a particular metric and accordingly, it was assigned a weighted score. We then summed the weighted scores for each metric to get an overall score. The 15 Most Advanced Countries in Asia in 2024 are ranked in ascending order of their overall scores.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "title": "The PC industry is finally on the path to recovery",
        "content": "The turnaround in the global PC market continues to gain speed as hype around AI PCs grows and enterprise customers start to pick up purchases of laptops and desktops. According to early data from market research firm IDC, the PC market grew 3%, marking the second quarter of growth after a staggering seven consecutive quarters of declines.\n\nWhile that’s higher than the 1.9% growth rival firm Gartner says the market saw in the quarter, both numbers point to a recovery in a sector that was crushed after it saw sales pulled forward at the start of the pandemic, which suppressed sales in subsequent quarters.\n\n\"Make no mistake, the PC market, just like other technology markets, faces challenges in the near term due to maturity and headwinds,\" said IDC group vice president Ryan Reith.\n\n\"However, two consecutive quarters of growth, combined with plenty of market hype around AI PCs and a less sexy but arguably more important commercial refresh cycle, seems to be what the PC market needed. The buzz is clearly around AI, but a lot is happening with non-AI PC purchasing to make this mature market show signs of positivity.\"\n\nIn Q1 2023, Gartner reported that PC shipments collapsed a stunning 30% year over year, before beginning to tick back up in Q2 2023 when the firm reported PC shipments fell 16%. A closer look at the Windows Copilot key. (Image: Microsoft) (Microsoft)\n\nThe declines were a rapid turnaround from the explosive growth the PC industry saw in the early days of the pandemic. Consumers and enterprise customers stuck on their couches for months purchased new systems to work from home and for entertainment. But with so many people buying PCs at once, there were fewer customers in need of new machines in subsequent months, sending sales into a nose dive.\n\nSince then, sales have continued to improve, as consumers have begun to replace the laptops and desktops they purchased in the early months of 2020.\n\nPC market declines hit everything from software vendors like Microsoft (MSFT), which reported Windows OEM sales, or sales of its Windows operating system to laptop and desktop manufacturers, fell 39% in the company’s fiscal second quarter of 2023.\n\nIntel (INTC) and AMD (AMD) saw similar declines, with Intel reporting that its first quarter Client Computing Group revenue, the organization responsible for PC chip sales, dropped an incredible 38% compared to Q1 2022. AMD reported a 65% year-over-year drop in net revenue in its Client group in 2023 from $2.1 billion to $739 million.\n\nThe market turnaround comes as the PC industry looks to the AI PC as the next leg of growth for laptop and desktop manufacturers. AI PCs are roughly defined as PCs that come equipped with specialized neural processing units.\n\nStory continues AMD launched its first AI PC desktop chip at CES 2024. (Image: AMD) (AMD)\n\nMicrosoft is marketing AI PCs that include its Copilot technology as Copilot+PCs. It’s a bit of a mouthful, and the company’s launch hasn’t exactly gone as it hoped. Initially, Microsoft was expecting to kick off its Copilot+PC push with a software feature called Recall designed to screenshot virtually everything you do on your computer, making it easier to pick up where you left off and keep you from losing your place while searching the web. But security researchers raised concerns about the app, and Microsoft was forced to pull back on the feature to address any potential issues.\n\nIntel, AMD, and Nvidia are also getting in on the AI PC push, with Intel and AMD launching AI PC chips, and Nvidia noting that PCs running its dedicated graphics chips can easily handle AI PC apps.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) is also making a run at the AI PC market, launching its latest PC chip in Microsoft Copilot+PCs including that company’s Surface Laptop and Surface Pro. The chipmaker promises the kind of performance that Apple has managed to squeeze out of its MacBook Pro and MacBook Air laptops, including all-day battery life and exceptional processing power.\n\nThe AI PC market is still new — Microsoft only launched its Copilot+PCs in May — and there’s still no sense as to how many users will specifically opt for AI PCs for their capabilities versus how many will them because they’re simply the latest and greatest on the market. Still, the industry is clearly on an upward trajectory, and for PC makers, that’s what matters most. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says He’s Still a ‘Believer’ in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a fresh episode of “Mad Money” on CNBC said that while investing isn’t easy, it’s made even more difficult by “authentic Wall Street gibberish” and “arcane technology.” Cramer said that there’s an “entire industry” in Wall Street wanting people to think that investing is hard and “ordinary people” cannot do it on their own. Cramer said that many people in the financial industry are just “after your fees” and they aren’t interested in making money from original investing. Cramer said that hedge fund managers and mutual funds make investing look inaccessible and impenetrable.\n\nCramer said that he’s “pulling back the curtain” and emphasized that investing isn’t “rocket science” or “brain surgery” and you don’t need to go to a business school to understand it. Cramer pitched himself as a “coach” or a “translator” who can explain the meaning of complex financial terms to ordinary people.\n\n“You can comprehend all the mystical-sounding vocabulary we throw around here as long as you have a translator, a coach like me, who can explain what the darn words mean.”\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he’s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Jim Cramer’s Latest Portfolio: Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Top Stock in July?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nTalking about the top performers of the second quarter, Jim Cramer reiterated his age-old mantra of “own it don’t trade it” for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), saying he has remained “steadfast” on his Apple thesis.\n\n“We held it through this period for the trust, because we are still believers.”\n\nCramer said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) showed at its WWDC event that it can offer the “best” of AI because “everybody in the industry wants access to Apple’s massive user base.”\n\n“The stock soared when it dawned on the doubters that they can have its cake (access to the best of AI) and eat it too because they don’t have to spend tens of billions of dollars to build out their own collection of data centers.”\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is among the top picks of Wedbush’s Dan Ives for the second half of 2024.\n\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\n\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in “denial” about Apple’s AI potential.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 26X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock’s overvalued, given Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales growth of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was pressured in the quarter as investors fretted over softening demand for smartphones, regulatory action from the US Department of Justice, and the Chinese government mandates restricting iPhone use by government officials. Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to believe the company remains competitively advantaged and benefits from the Apple ecosystem, which has an installed base of over 2 billion devices and over 1 billion paying subscribers. We believe the Apple ecosystem will support a more predictable cash flow stream, which should grow intrinsic value high-single-digits over our investment horizon.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer’s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Hot Analyst Upgrades That Are Moving Stocks This Summer",
        "content": "The S&P 500 has continued to receive bullish forecasts from market analysts, including recent analyst upgrades. Some suggest the index could reach a target of 6,100 by the end of the year. The optimism is grounded in the index’s foundation of earnings growth, with additional support from favorable inflation news and expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.\n\nThis “Goldilocks” scenario has reinforced the “new normal” for three years, indicating that inflation is cooling. Analysts project that this environment will support the S&P 500’s return to earnings growth, which is anticipated to accelerate in 2024 and 2025.\n\nAnalysts are raising their earnings estimates for the S&P 500, contributing to the index’s upward trajectory. The technology sector, particularly companies classified within the “Magnificent Seven,” continues to lead the market, buoyed by their involvement in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWedbush analysts forecast a further 15% rise in the S&P 500, driven by the expanding applications of AI and a resultant broadening of the market for tech leaders. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), recognized as enterprise AI industry frontrunners, along with Apple, are expected to capitalize on AI for revenue growth and margin expansion.\n\nKey reports from Microsoft and other prominent tech companies are scheduled for mid-to-late July, while NVIDIA and semiconductor stocks will follow in August. These reports could propel the index to new highs and sustain a rally through the summer and beyond the technical target of 6,100, with Wedbush’s more optimistic target around 6,250.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) icon displayed on smartphone with keyboard background. is an American multinational financial technology company operating an online payment\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal’s (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock rating was raised from “Neutral” to “Positive” at Susquehanna following analyst upgrades. The upgrade reflects PayPal’s strategic focus on profitable growth, as outlined in its recent Annual Incentive Plan update for 2024.\n\nPayPal is focusing on growing transaction margin dollars, a central part of its strategy. Susquehanna has highlighted several key initiatives. These include adopting better pricing discipline at Braintree, a PayPal service.\n\nThe company also plans to offer improved merchant services. This provides security, foreign exchange, and advertising through “PayPal Advanced Offers.” For consumers, PayPal aims to boost brand relevance. It will introduce stacked rewards with “PayPal CashPass” and smart receipts.\n\nPayPal wants to grow its cross-border business with small and medium-sized businesses (SMB) through the PayPal Commerce Platform (PPCP). A new feature, “Fastlane,” aims to increase PayPal’s market share during the holiday season. Susquehanna’s analysis suggests that PayPal will perform better than expected. This includes TMDs and adjusted EBIT dollars in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nRosenblatt lifted its rating on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares from “Neutral” to “Buy,” accompanied by a significant increase in the price target to $260 from the previous $196, marking one of the notable analyst upgrades this period. This optimism stems from Apple’s strong long-term performance, surpassing the S&P 500 with a 60.79% increase over three years and a remarkable 340.19% gain over five years.\n\nA recent survey in the United States highlights privacy in AI as a crucial demand among consumers. Analysts point out that Apple’s AI focuses on privacy more than Android. They believe this difference could boost Apple’s market share.\n\nBrokers stand to gain from investments in larger cloud service providers. However, they face different cost pressures than these providers. Rosenblatt has increased its price target for Apple’s stock by $64, which shows that the firm expects Apple’s stock performance to improve.\n\nMoreover, analysts have noted Apple’s strategy to incorporate privacy into its AI services. This strategy gives Apple a competitive advantage. It could lead to financial benefits for the company. This upgrade comes at a time when consumers prioritize AI and privacy in their technology choices.\n\nSAP (SAP) SAP sign is seen at SAP SuccessFactors Global Headquarters in South San Francisco, California\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nBMO Capital Markets adjusted its stance on SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), elevating the stock from “Market Perform” to “Outperform” and increasing the price target to $237 from the previous $218. This change, part of recent analyst upgrades, reflects a more optimistic outlook on the software giant’s future performance.\n\nThe firm has updated its rating based on confidence in SAP’s future bookings and revenues. This confidence comes from SAP’s success in moving its large, steady customer base to the cloud.\n\nIn addition, BMO Capital’s analysts stress that SAP’s current cloud backlog and Cloud ERP growth are crucial for success. They have also raised the price target to $237. This change shows their expectation for SAP’s ongoing financial growth.\n\nThe analysts highlight that SAP is on track to hit significant financial goals. Specifically, they aim for €8 billion in free cash flow by fiscal year 2025. The positive view of SAP also connects to its strategic moves in the cloud sector. These moves should boost the stock’s performance.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Do Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Earnings Warrant Your Attention?",
        "content": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple\n\nHow Fast Is Apple Growing?\n\nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Apple grew its EPS by 13% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.\n\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It was a year of stability for Apple as both revenue and EBIT margins remained have been flat over the past year. That's not a major concern but nor does it point to the long term growth we like to see.\n\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Apple?\n\nAre Apple Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$3.5t company like Apple. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$2.2b. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.06% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Apple Worth Keeping An Eye On?\n\nOne important encouraging feature of Apple is that it is growing profits. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 2 warning signs for Apple that you should be aware of.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Wall Street has been on a rally this year, with all three major indexes hitting multiple all-time highs. The S&P 500 particularly has been the standout performer, with the index registering its 37th record close in 2024 on Jul 10.\n\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed at 5,633.91, closing above the 5,600 mark for the first time and recording its seventh straight day of gains.\n\nThe recent rally is being led by tech stocks, especially semiconductor giants, which have been at the heart of the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). The AI darling NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has been driving the overall rally. The company’s shares have gained 172.4% year to date.\n\nBesides, the optimism surrounding rate cuts is also largely responsible for the ongoing rally. Inflation has finally started showing signs of easing after climbing in the first quarter. The consumer price index (CPI) held steady month over month in May after increasing 0.3% in April. May’s reading was also 0.1% lower than analysts’ estimates and the softest since July 2022.\n\nYear over year, CPI rose 3.3%, which came in slightly below analysts’ expectations of a rise of 3.4%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has indicated one rate cut this year, which is substantially lower than the three rate cuts projected earlier this year.\n\nHowever, even a single 25 basis point rate cut has been welcomed, particularly because a large section of market participants had expected no rate cuts in 2024.\n\nThe latest FOMC \"dot plot\" indicates a projected total decrease of 1% in interest rates by 2025, potentially lowering the Fed funds rate to 4.1% by the end of that year. Markets are now pricing in a rate cut in September, with expectations of another cut by the end of the year if economic conditions look favorable.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL and Broadcom Inc. AVGO thathave strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to AI-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected earnings growth rate of 106.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 12.1% over the last 60 days. NVDA presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN’s online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company’s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish its footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. AMZN also enjoys a dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service space, thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAmazon.com has an expected earnings growth rate of 57.9% for the current year.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks Flashing Danger Signs",
        "content": "Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has been the hottest sector in the stock market. Since OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, it has been a race to develop the best and smartest generative AI platforms. Bloomberg Intelligence issued a report that potentially valued the generative AI industry at $1.3 trillion by 2032. The AI hardware sector has exploded in value with every major tech company scrambling to buy high-powered GPUs. Semiconductor stocks have led the massive Nasdaq and S&P 500 rally over the past year. Over the past twelve months, the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) has gained more than 54%. Yet there could now be newly risky AI stocks.\n\nMany of these AI stocks have become overvalued and diverge from their fundamentals. At their current values, it’s hard to justify chasing them after rallying for over a year. These three AI stocks flash danger signs and should be avoided at their current multiples.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nYears ago, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the king of the chip industry. However, a drop in PC demand and being replaced as the chip provider for Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Macbook computers sent Intel into a downward spiral. While other chip stocks have flourished, shares of INTC are down by more than 30% in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSome believed that Intel would be boosted after a deal with the US government. The agreement saw Intel receive $8.5 billion in funding to advance its AI chip technology. Despite this, Intel continues to lose ground in its core CPU business. Chip-rivals AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and ArmHoldings (NASDAQ:ARM) are eating away at Intel’s market share after creating CPUs with superior performance and speed.\n\nAs a result, Intel is showing a negative revenue growth CAGR over the past five years. They are one of the only chip companies with negative growth in recent years. Comparatively, AMD has a five-year revenue CAGR of 30%, and ARM has a three-year CAGR of 17%. Intel is still trading at nearly 30x forward earnings, even with a five-year net income CAGR of -28%. The stock is too richly valued for its declining growth as it continues falling behind its peers and into a category of risky AI stocks.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock. Nvidia stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNo stock has been as front and center for the AI revolution as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). I outlined my views on Nvidia a couple of weeks ago, and thus far, my thesis for calling Nvidia’s peak has been playing out. Shares of NVDA are up by nearly 200% over the past year of trading.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s recent 10-for-one stock split not only continued the stock’s snowball but also made shares more accessible to retail investors. Those left out of the stock’s historic one-year rally FOMO’d into the stock at the top. Nvidia also faces the threat of homegrown GPUs from companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and cheaper domestic offerings in China. Through its Made in 2025 policy, China plans to produce 70% of its chips domestically by the year 2025.\n\nThere is no denying that the company’s recent growth has been impressive. Analysts have a current average price target of $119.32 and the stock even received a downgrade from a rating of Buy to Neutral by New Street Research. Nvidia will not continue to grow its revenue at a five-year CAGR of nearly 50%. With shares trading at 40x sales, any decline in revenue growth will result in the stock becoming increasingly overvalued. Nvidia is not the only way to gain exposure to AI.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nNot many people think of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as an AI company, yet. What was once the most popular stock on the market has struggled in 2024, only recently bringing their year-to-date returns above water. After gaining nearly 30% in the first week of July, the stock has returned 1.2% in 2024 to shareholders.\n\nMuch of Tesla’s long-term potential revolves around AI-based initiatives like their Robotaxi and Optimus robots. Tesla Bulls also believes in the future of their FSD technology as well as public listings of Elon Musk’s other companies like SpaceX. But most, if not all, of these initiatives are a long way off from being a reality and some may never even come to fruition. Tesla vehicles are the best-selling EVs on the planet yet the market is pricing Tesla as more than just an automaker.\n\nEven if Tesla were a full AI company, the stock now trades at a sky-high valuation. At 101x forward earnings, Tesla trades at double Nvidia’s price-to-earnings ratio. There is a future where Tesla is a leader in AI technology and software. Until we see any of these play out and hit the market, Tesla has to be considered an automaker more than an AI leader and thus one of the risky AI stocks on the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que held a LONG position in AMZN.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be the Top Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to End 2024",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is a group of companies that led the market since 2023:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nOther than Tesla, which is basically flat year to date, this group is having a fairly strong 2024. MSFT data by YCharts.\n\nNvidia outshines them all, continuing its unbelievable run after a phenomenal 2023. But investors who didn't buy in earlier can't do anything about that now; they can only look forward. So which Magnificent Seven stock looks likeliest to be the biggest winner for the rest of the year?\n\nMany of the Magnificent Seven trade at sky-high valuations\n\nLet's start with the stocks that likely won't have the best performances in the second half. While Tesla shares underperformed for most of the year, there were good reasons for that. Demand for its electric vehicles declined and its margins have shrunk due to its price cuts. There are no signs those trends will turn around before 2024 is over.\n\nNext, let's consider valuations: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all trade at expensive levels of 34 times forward earnings or more, which is quite a premium over the benchmark S&P 500 index, which currently averages 22.7 times forward earnings. Those premiums will likely inhibit their performance from here.\n\nThat leaves just Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Of the two, I think Alphabet is primed for the best second half of 2024.\n\nAlphabet's investments are starting to pay off\n\nAlphabet has long been a force in artificial intelligence (AI). However, it appeared caught off guard when the generative AI craze took off in late 2022. As a result, it had to scramble to launch competing products that weren't great initially. However, it has largely cleaned up their problems.\n\nNow, Alphabet's generative AI model, Gemini, is recognized as one of the top options available, and has already been integrated into several of its products to perform tasks such as summarizing Google search results.\n\nFurthermore, Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum. Because most companies can't afford to spend millions of dollars to build and operate their own supercomputers to train AI models, renting that processing power from a cloud computing provider is far more economical. Each cloud infrastructure provider has its specialties, and AI appears to be one of Google Cloud's. With 60% of funded generative AI start-ups and 90% of generative AI unicorns (private companies worth at least $1 billion) using its services, it has a strong foothold in this emerging market.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Alphabet's advertising business should continue to perform well this year -- and while AI may be flashy, advertising is what keeps the company's lights on. In Q1, more than three-fourths of its revenue came from advertising-related sources, and that revenue was up 13% year over year. While that's not blazing-fast growth, it is impressive for a fairly mature business. With upcoming catalysts like election-related advertising, we can expect a strong end to 2024 for Alphabet.\n\nAs for its valuation, Alphabet is actually the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven cohort, trading at 25 times forward earnings. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile that's not cheap relative to the broader market, it is when compared to its peers.\n\nBased on the combination of its relatively cheap valuation and its strong business momentum, I have confidence that Alphabet will have a strong close to 2024. Whether it will outperform the rest of the Magnificent Seven is still up in the air -- especially with a wild card like Nvidia in the mix -- but I'm confident that Alphabet will beat the market in the second half.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Streaming Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "In today’s entertainment landscape, streaming has emerged as the main way we consume media. From binge-worthy series to interactive video games and soothing music playlists, streaming platforms have revolutionized our access to content. As this trend continues to mature across various mediums, the streaming space continues to expand rapidly, driven by rising demand and competitive pricing, forming a favorable outlook for related stocks.\n\nFor this article, I have selected three undervalued streaming stocks whose future prospects are likely not reflected in their current share prices. These companies operate in distinct niches within the streaming industry. From pioneering music streaming services to global leaders in original content production, each stock brings its own set of strengths.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) The Netflix (NFLX) logo on a tablet with earbuds and a bowl of popcorn nearby.\n\nSource: Riccosta / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe all know that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) pioneered the streaming industry. Yet what’s truly impressive is that the company continues to assert its dominance despite fronting intensified competition. Many giants like Disney’s (NYSE:DIS) Disney+ and Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video have entered the fray, yet Netflix remains a standout performer in the market. While others struggle to expand their subscriber base, Netflix consistently attracts new members. In fact, its global streaming paid memberships grew impressively by 16% to reach 269.6 million in Q1, despite its already mature status.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company’s relentless focus on original content production, ranging from blockbuster series to critically acclaimed films, has solidified its position as a must-have streaming service, resulting in highly predictable revenues and overall cash flow visibility. Moreover, Netflix has been capitalizing on the economies of scale achieved by its continuous growth to improve portability significantly. Its free cash flow surged to a record $6.93 billion last year, up massively from $1.62 billion in the year before.\n\nValuation-wise, Netflix stock has rallied by about 58% over the past year, which may imply that those who didn’t buy earlier have already missed the rally. Yet, NFLX stock could still be undervalued at its current levels. Its forward P/E of 35.9x may seem rich, but given that consensus earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates point to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.7% over the next five years, I believe this multiple is well-justified and leaves room for further upside potential.\n\nSpotify Technology (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.\n\nSource: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nSpotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) is another undervalued streaming stock to consider. The audio streaming giant continues to impress with strong user and revenue growth, underscoring its position as a leading global platform. As of Q1 2024, Spotify boasted 615 million Monthly Active Users (MAUs), up a notable 19% year-over-year increase. Premium MAUs reached 239 million, up by 14%, while ad-supported MAUs surged by 22% to 388 million.\n\nIn the meantime, Spotify showcased strong pricing and improved its advertising results, boosting premium and ad-supported revenues. In particular, premium revenue grew by 20%, fueled by the aforementioned subscriber gains and a 7% increase in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) compared to the previous year. Along with an 18% rise in ad-supported revenues, Spotify’s total revenue climbed 20% year-over-year to a record €3.64 billion.\n\nOn the surface, it seems that Spotify is trading at a rather hefty valuation. At a forward P/E of 54.9x, it’s hard to argue against this. Nonetheless, this multiple becomes rather fair when you consider Spotify’s incredible moat and the significant improvement in margins and profitability. In Q1, for instance, Spotify’s gross profit margin came in at 27.6%, marking a 243 basis point increase year-over-year, while its free cash flow landed at €207 million, up 263% year-over-year.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnlike Netflix or Spotify, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a unique vehicle for investing in the streaming space. By holding AAPL stock, you get exposure to its diverse ecosystem, which includes Apple TV+ and Apple Music, with the additional advantage of Apple controlling the hardware.\n\nApple TV+ has steadily expanded its subscriber base by producing high-quality, original content, including award-winning series and films. Given Apple’s tremendous financial resources and the ability to bundle services, Apple TV+ is likely to become a dominant streaming platform slowly yet inevitably. In the meantime, Apple Music stays a strong competitor in the music streaming space, offering an extensive library and exclusive releases, thus maintaining a loyal user base.\n\nWhile Apple’s streaming services are confined to its ecosystem, this limitation also fortifies Apple’s market position. The seamless hardware and software integration enhances user engagement and cultivates strong customer loyalty, establishing a resilient and predictable revenue stream. With expanded content offerings over time, I believe that Apple’s services are poised for significant growth.\n\nWhile APPL stock may not seem cheap at a forward P/E of 32.9x, I do believe that Wall Street underestimates its services growth potential, with streaming poised to be a major growth driver in the coming years. In that sense, I view Apple as an undervalued stock in the streaming space.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

A more affordable edition — which IDC estimates would cost roughly half as much — should rekindle interest in 2025, but sales may not rise meaningfully over the coming year, IDC said.\n\n“The Vision Pro’s success, regardless of its price, will ultimately depend on the available content,” said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president at IDC. “As Apple expands the product to international markets, it’s crucial that local content is also made available.”\n\nThe early response to Apple’s headset has been mixed. Many reviewers and early adopters have praised its advanced technology, however some of Apple’s biggest fans are now returning the device. Its weight and paucity of tailored apps and video content are among the chief reasons people are turning away from the gadget. The Vision Pro made no tangible improvement to Apple’s quarterly earnings after its debut.\n\nThe unimpressive start has spurred a rethink among Apple’s management, with the company planning a more budget-friendly version of the device. IDC’s Jeronimo anticipates that will more than double sales when it arrives in the latter half of next year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLooser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom At SpaceX, Elon Musk’s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs How Digital Money Really Works Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia—With a Catch\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Stocks to Dump Before the AI Bubble Bursts",
        "content": "The S&P 500 is up more than 50% from 2022 lows. The primary reason for the resilience of the stock market is enthusiasm around AI stocks. Excitement surrounding artificial intelligence and its potential as a revolutionary technology have sent AI shares skyward, creating what many believe is a bubble reminiscent of the dotcom bubble at the turn of the century. That has many wondering whether it’s time to sell.\n\nValuations and investor exuberance are still not as high as they were during the dotcom crash. Yet, investors continue to wonder whether the similarities are too great to ignore. The inflation of each respective bubble was prompted by the introduction of world changing technology. Investors, eager to secure early gains, have rushed to get their piece of the pie. It’s a recipe for trouble if expectations do not meet reality.\n\nThe good news is that important metrics including the 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratios are currently much lower than they were at the dotcom peak. The bad news is that all bubbles are different and unforeseen factors may be at play now that no one can predict until it’s too late.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is the most obvious choice among AI stocks to sell before any potential bubble bursts. One of the most obvious reasons to believe that is in the similarity between Nvidia and dotcom champion Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).\n\nCisco shares surged by roughly 4,500% in the 5-year period prior to its peak in 2000. Nvidia’s Shares are up roughly 4,300% over the past 5 years. Whether it’s a coincidence or not, time will tell.\n\nIt’s easy to see why investors continue to bet so bullishly on Nvidia following its most recent earnings report from late May. Revenue surged by more than 250% on a year-over-year basis. Sales reached $26 billion, $22.6 billion of which came from data center sales. It all continues to suggest that Nvidia is one of the best investments in AI which is largely seen as a commodity akin to gold for the digital age.\n\nYet, questions remain about Nvidia and how truly the company is capturing the current opportunity. The truth is that over the past five years Nvidia’s asset growth has outpaced its revenue growth substantially. That’s a real sign that Nvidia’s big bet on AI has not yet produced as substantial results as some may believe. If you need a reason to sell, take that as your signal.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nA cursory glance at the stock chart of Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) shows that there are real concerns about a current AI bubble.\n\nStory continues\n\nShare prices surged above $1,800 by mid June and promptly retreated back below $1,600 one week later. That jump and subsequent decline was seen across most of the AI sector and was a representation of broadly held questions by AI investors. Share prices have rebounded since but the volatility is a clear indication that investors recognize Broadcom may be in the midst of an AI fueled bubble.\n\nBroadcom isn’t a pure play AI stock but the company did mention ‘AI’ 51 times in its most recent earnings call. So AVGO may well be the beneficiary of a halo effect surrounding all things AI.\n\nThere are indications that Broadcom internally feels that its share price can’t grow much further. The company has chosen to implement a 10-for-one forward stock split. Such a stock split does nothing to change the fundamentals of the underlying company and primarily serves to increase prices due to psychological effects. Management’s decision to implement the forward split should serve as a clue to investors to sell.\n\nFundamentals based screening tools suggest Broadcom is significantly overvalued at present. It’s clearly benefiting from the AI halo effect and is at risk as such.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has come back to life following the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC24). AI is partially responsible for the resurgence in share prices at Apple indicating it is highly exposed to AI bubble hype.\n\nApple introduced two things at the briefly held conference on June 10. Those big upgrades include iOS 18 and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. The company’s massive user base is now poised to receive years of upgrades. That promises to send share prices higher. However, a question arises: how much of that recent surge in share prices is simply AI hype?\n\nIt is of course a question that no one can answer currently. Nevertheless, investors remain somewhat cautious. Apple’s revenues are still not as strong as they were a year ago. So, while the introduction of iOS 18 and Apple Intelligence is promising, the company is still facing an uphill battle.\n\nApple continues to produce substantial cash flows that allow it to satisfy shareholders but if its generative AI efforts prove fruitless it won’t be able to substantiate share prices at this level moving forward.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf the AI bubble bursts, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) might not look the way investors expect it to.\n\nIf AMD’s AI bubble bursts it will really be about investor perception of the company’s inability to capture a greater percentage of sales from Nvidia. The point here is that some analysts see indications of that sort of weak competitiveness indicated at price levels between $116 and $132.\n\nThose price levels may be much higher than many would expect following a bubble burst. Yet, that’s exactly where technical analysts see AMD falling to if it continues to be ineffective in clawing away market share from Nvidia.\n\nAMD Shares are up roughly 14% year-to-date. Those same shares rose from $140 at New Year’s to more than $210 by early March. They now trade for $160. AMD is expected to grow revenues by 14% in 2024. If investors are judging the stock’s performance relative to sales, there might be very little reason to invest in AMD currently.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s difficult to argue that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is ever a stock to sell. It has provided 10X returns over the past decade and Windows and Office continue to provide a fortress of strength in which the company dwells.\n\nDespite those obvious strengths there are concerns that Microsoft is overpriced at the moment primarily due to AI. Any investor has simply to look at the company’s current P/E ratio of 39x, well above its 10-year median.\n\nHow much of that increase in valuation is justified? Is the $30 CoPilot add on worth it? No one really knows because as my colleague Dana Blankenhorn pointed out, Microsoft didn’t break out its performance.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella was happy to boast about its initial uptake earlier this year but not much else has been said since. That’s a troublesome sign. Microsoft is well protected by Windows and Office so any AI bubble burst won’t crush it. However, it may not be a bad time to reap profits now as bubble questions continue to swirl.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has sunken like a stone in 2024. Therefore, it probably won’t be too difficult to persuade readers to avoid it moving forward.\n\nThere was a lot of hype around Intel due to AI earlier in the year. Intel announced the launch of a systems foundry designed for the AI era in February. That was around the tail end of the time during which Intel was seen as a legitimate competitor to Nvidia.\n\nHowever, Intel lags well behind Nvidia when it comes to AI chips. Intel’s leading chip is called Gaudi-3. Those chips are supposed to compete with Nvidia’s upcoming Blackwell chips which will be released around the same time. The problem is that Intel’s chips are not nearly as powerful.\n\nThe result is that Intel’s opportunity to benefit from the AI halo may already be over. Furthermore, Intel’s revenues peaked in 2021. They’re not expected to rebound to those levels until 2028.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) An image of a grey TSMC corporation building with the \"tsmc\" logo in red.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is a stock that is at once one of the best investments and one of those which is most exposed to the AI bubble.\n\nIt is one of the best investments at the moment because it is so exposed to the AI opportunity. Taiwan Semiconductor manufacturing serves as the world’s foundry, producing the world’s most advanced chips including those for AI applications. It is because of that excellent positioning that the stock has grown by nearly 80% in 2024.\n\nThe flip side of that tremendous growth is obvious: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is also heavily exposed to the inherent dangers of an AI bubble. Given that TSM provides the actual chips sold by Nvidia, AMD and many others, it stands to be punished heavily if and when things go wrong.\n\nTSM’s P/E ratio is currently the highest it’s ever been. It’s more than double its median over the last decade. That’s a bit worrisome given the fact that the company has been the foundry to the world during that period. The hype around AI is the clear reason it’s become so valuable in 2024. As questions continue to swirl about the true value of AI, TSM will continue to be on bubble watch.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Paramount Global's (PARA) plans to merge with production studio Skydance Media could set off a dealmaking spree in the media industry as it grapples with traditional TV's decline.\n\nOn Sunday, Paramount announced it will combine with Skydance following a years-long struggle to make streaming profitable and stop the bleeding of its linear network business.\n\nIt's the same two-pronged conundrum that all legacy media is facing: Fewer consumers are paying for the pay-TV bundle, which doesn't bode well for how much programmers can make from ad sales and affiliate fees paid by distributors for their content. Meanwhile, streaming remains unprofitable for the majority of players as costs rise and subscriber growth stalls.\n\nAll that points to a handful of giants getting even bigger. Rumors have swirled that Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA) could merge or spin off certain assets.\n\n\"I think you're going to have two or three major companies,\" David Wisnia, partner and managing director of media and entertainment at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal, told Yahoo Finance. \"Because if you're not able to bring streaming to a material level of profitability, ... you're going to be looking for a buyer. You have no other choice.\"\n\nThe Paramount deal has been one of the most talked about topics at the ongoingannual Sun Valley conference, which brings together top media moguls and CEOs. It's often a space where company deals are made (or at the very least teased.)\n\n\"Getting [Paramount] in solid hands and having them funded — it’s a great company and a great heritage, so I think that’s good for the industry,\" Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav told reporters on Tuesday, as cited by Bloomberg.\n\n“Over the next year or two you’re going to see some real consolidation, whether that happens with companies buying each other or going after streaming together,” he said.\n\nThat's a reality already taking place with bundles and partnerships becoming more common within the industry at large. Bundles are viewed as a way to create \"stickiness\" for subscribers searching for value.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Disney announced a streaming bundle that will combine Disney+, Hulu, and Max, with a launch date set for this summer in the US. In May, Comcast (CMCSA) rolled out a StreamSaver bundle, which packages Peacock's ad-supported premium tier with Netflix's basic ad tier (NFLX) and Apple TV+ (AAPL).\n\nAnd earlier this year, Warner Bros. announced a sports streaming partnership with Disney's ESPN (DIS) and Fox (FOXA), set to debut later this fall called Venu.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The message has been for the last few years is you need efficiencies, you need growth opportunities, you need ways to find margin improvement. And this is just all a reflection of that,\" Wisnia said.\n\n\"Paramount's deal definitely reinforces the fact that struggling traditional media companies need to improve their fundamentals.\"\n\n'No other choice' A view of Paramount Studios's water tank in Los Angeles, Calif., on September 26, 2023. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe buyers in these deals are more likely to be traditional media and entertainment players or private equity firms than Big Tech companies. Sony (SONY), for example, had submitted a bid with private equity firm Apollo for Paramount while WBD also expressed interest in a merger.\n\n\"Years ago the driving force was Big Tech,\" Wisnia said. However, a difficult regulatory environment has become a top headwind for those types of buyers, which already have a significant level of scale.\n\n\"You see what happened with Amazon and MGM and the struggle they had just to close that deal. And that was only an $8.5 billion deal at the time,\" he said. The merger faced nearly a year of regulatory hurdles before finally receiving approval in 2022.\n\nThe top tech giants have also moved away from sinking money into original content, focusing on sports rights and live content instead. This means less of a need for the intellectual property libraries of traditional media players.\n\nGiven that, the race to consolidate largely falls on the traditional players.\n\nDeep-pocked Comcast has been viewed as a buyer, although CEO Brian Roberts previously said \"the bar continues to be even higher\" when it comes to any potential deals. Lionsgate could also be a potential acquirer as it spins off its film and TV studio business from cable channel Starz. And, following the back-and-forth Paramount negotiations, Japanese conglomerate Sony clearly seems to be looking to scale.\n\nBut, in Wisnia's view, the industry is not as desperate as it seems. Rather, it's in a period of transition.\n\n\"It's a time of transition where new business models are being evolved,\" he said. \"A lot of people are down on the industry but the reality is that consumption of content has never been higher, production is still at historic highs. The only thing that's in question, and that's debatable, are the business models.\"\n\n\"But these transitions have happened before,\" he continued. \"We will come out of this and what's efficient will become clearer. And once that does, it'll be a more smooth environment. But we're in the middle of it right now. And until we get out of it, it's just it's a muddied environment.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Undervalued Gems Poised for 100% Gains in 18 Months",
        "content": "Finding undervalued growth stocks in the middle of a bull market is no easy task. By definition, they are investments rising in value over time. With the S&P 500 trading up about 25% so far this year, locating these discounted hidden gems remains a challenge but doable.\n\nJust because a growth stock has gained in value doesn’t mean it can’t keep rising. Letting your winners run is a valid investment strategy because, like Newton’s Law of Motion, an object in motion tends to remain in motion. Unless a calamity strikes these growth stocks, there is a good chance they will keep right on rising.\n\nTheir growth also doesn’t mean they are anywhere near full valuation. A growth stock’s expansion may be outpacing the multiple the market is assigning. That’s the type of undervalued growth stock we’re looking for: its fundamentals are in place and widening just as it is beginning to realize its full potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three undervalued growth stocks that fit the bill. Let’s dive in to see why they should be able to double in value by the end of 2025.\n\nTurkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri (TKC) Multiple hands holding up their cell phones\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe first question you might have about Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri (NYSE:TKC) is: who? The company is the leading mobile phone operator in Turkey but also provides broadband services to consumers and businesses, digital payment systems, cloud services and data center operations.\n\nTurkey is an important emerging market that saw its economy expand 4.5% in 2023 despite a major earthquake early in the year that killed over 53,000 people and injured more than 107,000 people. Between 2002 and 2022, Turkey’s GDP increased by an average of 5.4% a year. Although economic growth is expected to slow this year to 3%, the World Bank expects “robust” growth in the years ahead.\n\nTurkcell has been in business for 30 years, originally as a telecom operator but evolving into a significant technology provider. Its stock is up 71% in 2024 and has more than doubled over the last 12 months. Shares go for just eight times next year’s earnings estimates and Wall Street forecasts profits will rapidly expand at a 31% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). TKC stock trades at a tiny fraction of that growth while going for less than twice its sales and a bargain-basement 5x free cash flow (FCF).\n\nTurkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri might not be a household name but is a dramatically undervalued growth stock. It should readily double from its current $8 per share level, making it one of the best undervalued growth stocks to pick.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenesis Energy (GEL) Pipelines in the desert\n\nSource: bht2000 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough Genesis Energy’s (NYSE:GEL) name might make you think it is a utility, in reality it is a midstream operator in the oil and gas industry. Headquartered in Houston, Genesis operates primarily around the Gulf coast region. It has one of the largest offshore pipeline networks in the Deepwater area; is one of the biggest sodium and soda ash producers; and is one of the largest crude and petroleum transportation providers serving  two of the largest refinery complexes in the U.S.\n\nBecause it operates under long-term take-or-pay contracts, it means Genesis gets paid regardless of whether its customers accept delivery of its products or services or not. Those superlatives are not going without notice.\n\nThe midstream operator’s stock is up 24% in 2024 and 48% over the past year. Yet shares trade at 11 times earnings estimates and a fraction of its sales and projected earnings growth. Those profits are forecast to expand by 44% annually for the next five years.\n\nThe one complicating factor for Genesis investors is it is organized as a master limited partnership (MLP). That introduces potentially complex tax issues depending upon whether you invest through a taxable brokerage account or in an IRA. But if the stock meets your individual needs, GEL is an undervalued growth stock ready to double.\n\niShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) two businesspeople sit at a table stacking up coins in the shape of an ascending bar chart. overlooked growth stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nArguably the most surprising undervalued growth stock to buy is iShares S&P Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks large U.S. companies whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the market. Basically, it is an ETF growth stock tracking growth stocks.\n\nWhat makes IVW a stock to buy is the likelihood the broad market itself will continue to appreciate in value. Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell just said the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach regarding inflation. What it sees so far is positive. That suggests the Fed could cut interest sooner than expected, which could unleash a massive groundswell of economic expansion.\n\nBy investing in the ETF, you get broad exposure to leading growth stocks, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), its three largest holdings. With a minuscule expense ratio of 0.18%, you also get them at low cost.\n\nA single share of Microsoft stock goes for $460 per share versus IVW trading for less than $100 a pop. That means you can own a basket of the biggest growth stocks on the market at a significantly cheaper price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is planning to ship at least 90 million units of its iPhone 16 in the latter half of 2024, banking on AI services to bolster demand for its new lineup following a challenging 2023.\n\nThe tech giant has communicated to its suppliers and partners that it's aiming for an approximately 10% growth in new iPhone shipments compared to their predecessors, after dispatching about 81 million iPhone 15s in the second half of 2023, according to a source.\n\nApple is optimistic that the integration of Apple Intelligence features with the iPhone 16 will help stimulate demand when the model debuts later this year, as per insiders who asked to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the projections.\n\n⚠️Stay up to date with the latest company news using InvestingPro! Our Summer Sale is now on, click here to save over 50%!⚠️\n\nThese targets imply that Apple anticipates a stronger 2024, despite competition from other AI-enhanced smartphones from rivals like Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp (HK:1810).\n\nHowever, Apple's comparison year, 2023, was particularly challenging, especially in China where Huawei Technologies Co.’s Mate 60 Pro with its advanced, locally produced 7-nanometer processor, gained favor among consumers. Wall Street analysts have projected a dip in iPhone revenue in the latter half of 2024.\n\nApple shares saw a boost of up to 1.8% to $232.74, reaching a record high after Bloomberg reported on the iPhone projections. The stock has risen 19% this year through Tuesday’s close.\n\nIn China, Apple also needs to find a partner since OpenAI’s ChatGPT isn't available in the country. Additionally, Apple is grappling with a broader challenge in its largest market outside the US, as more Chinese agencies and government-backed firms have instructed staff to refrain from using iPhones and foreign devices at work.\n\nApple's challenges in China extend beyond tepid demand. The company recently petitioned the Supreme People’s Court to remove references to its \"dominant position\" from a lower court's decision, underscoring the company's increasingly precarious position in the country.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple targets 10% iPhone shipment growth in 2024 - Bloomberg\n\nAckman says his firm will put $500 million into Pershing Square USA\n\nWK Kellog faces soggy outlook that puts margin expansion in crosshairs: BofA\n\nView comments",

        "title": "It’s for the best that Microsoft and Apple won’t be observing OpenAI’s board meetings",
        "content": "OpenAI’s board meetings were about to get really weird, with not one but two major customers and partners sitting in as observers. But that awkward situation has suddenly been averted.\n\nMicrosoft, OpenAI’s biggest partner and investor, has been a board observer since last year’s leadership crisis, in which Microsoft and everyone else were shocked by OpenAI's board abruptly and briefly firing CEO Sam Altman. And, as I wrote last week, Apple, which plans to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, was reportedly about to get the same privilege.\n\nHowever, it emerged today that Microsoft has dropped its observer role with immediate effect, and Apple won’t take one either. Microsoft reportedly told OpenAI in a letter that its seven months observing meetings “provided insights into the board’s activities without compromising its independence,” and the role was no longer necessary because “we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company’s direction.”\n\nInstead of having board observers, OpenAI said it will now just hold regular meetings with its strategic partners and investors. This seems a far more sensible approach, for multiple reasons.\n\nFirstly, while European antitrust officials earlier this year dropped a probe into Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI—they conceded Microsoft had not taken control of its partner—there’s now a broader EU review taking place, covering strategic investments and partnerships across the entire AI industry. Regulators in the U.K. and U.S. are also paying close attention. This is not a time for Microsoft and OpenAI to appear overly cozy.\n\nSecondly…well, here I’m going to hand things over to Data Sheet reader JE, who wrote me this in response to last week’s essay about the subject:\n\n“The issue of letting major customers sit in on board meetings would seem to raise all kinds of issues. As the retired chair of the board of a publicly traded company, I would have real concerns about how we could have functioned with customers or even large shareholders sitting in on what should be candid, serious and confidential discussions…I question how this ‘observation’ can be helpful if open-ended. Having input and discussion for a defined topic and time in meetings with customers is fine; attending meetings as an observer or participant is not.”\n\nDoubly so if two competing customers like Microsoft and Apple are both in the room, I imagine.\n\nSince we’re on the subject of AI, Elon Musk’s xAI startup has decided to build its own data center systems rather than continuing its server rental agreement with Oracle. The Information had the scoop and the man himself confirmed it on X, where he said xAI’s only chance of catching up with more established rivals was to move faster than them.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Oracle is a great company…but, when our fate depends on being the fastest by far, we must have our own hands on the steering wheel, rather than be a backseat driver,” Musk tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. has for the first time accused another country of using generative AI in a foreign influence campaign, Reuters reports. You will be shocked to hear that Russia is the alleged miscreant—a Russian organization apparently designed an AI-powered bot farm to spread disinformation in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nFinally, Fortune AI maestro Jeremy Kahn has a new book out! It’s called Mastering AI: A Survival Guide to Our Superpowered Future and I for one can’t wait to read it. We published an excerpt yesterday—which appropriately focuses on AI’s potential for surreptitiously influencing people—and you can also read Jeremy’s own rundown of the book’s key themes in yesterday’s Eye On AI essay.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "5 Stocks Worth a Look From Leading Sectors This Earnings Season",
        "content": "The second-quarter 2024 earnings season will kick off this week, with banking sector players due to report numbers. The overall picture ahead of this reporting cycle is one of continued resilience, marked by a steadily improving outlook and a favorable revision trend.\r\n \r\nWhile most of the stocks are expected to outperform this earnings season, we have zeroed in on the best stocks of the sectors that have a high chance of surprising in their upcoming releases. These stocks — Apple AAPL, HCA Healthcare HCA, Expro International Group Holdings Ltd. XPRO, Churchill Downs CHDN and JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM — could make great plays as the earnings season unfolds and will likely move higher in the days to come.\n\nQ2 Earnings Trend\n\nTotal S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up 8.6% from the year-ago period on 4.7% higher revenues, per the latest Earnings Trends. This will be the highest earnings growth rate since the 9.9% growth rate in the first quarter of 2022. Though estimates have steadily come down since the start of the quarter, the magnitude of declines is far smaller relative to the comparable periods of other recent quarters.\r\n\r\nOf the 16 Zacks sectors, nine are expected to post earnings growth in the second quarter, with the strongest gains in the Technology sector (15.8%). This would be followed by Healthcare (19.0%), Energy (10.9%), Consumer Discretionary (12.5%) and Finance (9.0%). In particular, second-quarter earnings of the “Magnificent 7” companies are expected to be up 25.5% from the same period last year on 13.2% higher revenues.\r\n\r\nThe energy sector is likely to register earnings growth in the second quarter after witnessing declines in the preceding four quarters.\n\nHow to Choose Stocks?\n\nAn earnings beat will definitely inspire investors’ confidence and propel the price of stocks higher. Picking the star performers would be easy if we go by our proprietary methodology that selects stocks with a combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because if an analyst reevaluates their estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information that could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.\r\n\r\nStocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 or better produced an earnings surprise 70% of the time. Best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10-year backtest.

        "title": "Samsung is leaning on AI to power device sales",
        "content": "Samsung took the wraps off of a litany of new devices on Wednesday during its Unpacked event in Paris, France. Not only did the company show off its latest foldable smartphones, the Android-powered (GOOG, GOOGL) Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6, and its next-generation smartwatches, the Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Watch Ultra, it also launched its highly anticipated Galaxy Ring.\n\nBut the star of the show was the company’s Galaxy AI platform. A suite of software products the company initially launched with its Galaxy S24 line of smartphones earlier this year, Galaxy AI includes a number of generative AI capabilities that touch on everything from Samsung’s health and fitness apps to its photo, productivity, and web browser offerings.\n\nThe strategy is clear: Samsung is banking on its AI efforts, which include some of Google’s AI magic, to help power its device sales going forward. But the company’s longtime nemesis, Apple (AAPL), is just months away from launching its own AI software, which could sway Samsung users to the iPhone’s side.\n\nThe AI era\n\nSamsung’s latest devices are certainly impressive. I’m a fan of both of its foldable, and its smart watches are some of the most capable around. Adding in its Galaxy Ring could give Samsung a nice foothold in a still relatively small market. But the company is clearly focused on ensuring that its AI capabilities are front and center alongside each of its new products. Samsung is entering the smart ring market with its new AI-enabled Galaxy Ring. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nSamsung has demonstrated how Galaxy AI fits into the Galaxy Ring, Watch 7, and Watch Ultra thanks to the addition of the company’s new Energy Score feature. The company says the software uses Galaxy AI to help calculate how you’ve slept, how much exercise you’ve gotten recently, and more to provide you with a numerical representation of your overall fitness level that you can use to better understand why you might be more tired or energetic on certain days.\n\nIt’s also shown off its conversation mode feature, which lets you have a conversation with someone speaking a different language by turning the Fold's and Flip’s covers and main screens into digital whiteboards that display what you and the person you’re chatting with are saying in your own languages. The app also reads the translated text out loud.\n\nSamsung has similarly brought generative AI features to its photos app, allowing you to do things like draw sunglasses on a person in an image and automatically generate and place realistic-looking glasses on the subject’s face. Samsung also uses some of Google’s AI capabilities, adding the company’s Gemini software and assistant to its devices.\n\nStory continues Samsung's various Galaxy AI features. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nAn incentive to stay and upgrade\n\nLike Apple, which debuted its Apple Intelligence generative AI initiative at its WWDC event in June, Samsung is using AI as a means of differentiating its latest hardware offerings from its older devices in the hopes that Galaxy AI and its features will get customers who have been holding onto their phones for two years or longer to pony up for newer, pricier options.\n\nUnlike Apple, which is only making its AI options available on its iPhone 15 Pro and future phones, Samsung is rolling out its Galaxy AI software to a handful of prior-generation products including the S22 and Z Fold and Flip 4 series from 2022 and S23 and Z Fold and Z Flip 5 series from 2023.\n\nWith consumers holding onto their smartphones for between two and three years, that makes sense. It gives users a taste of Galaxy AI at a time when they’re just about ready to upgrade, adding an incentive to stick with Samsung and continue taking advantage of its generative AI features. Samsung's latest Galaxy Z Flip 6 gets minor physical enhancements, but brings along the company's Galaxy AI generative AI platform. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nThe Korean tech giant says customers are already using its AI software at a decent clip, with the company reporting that 77% of S24 owners access AI features every week. And with Samsung raising the prospect of charging a fee for its AI services in the future, its Galaxy AI offerings could not only get customers to stick with the company and upgrade to its latest phones but open up a new revenue stream as well.\n\nOf course, that could also depend on what Apple ultimately decides to do with its Apple Intelligence services. If Samsung charges for its AI software and Apple doesn’t, it could incentivize customers to switch to the iPhone.\n\nEither way, both companies are entering into a new race to see which can outdo the other in terms of the generative AI know-how. And while Samsung has a sizable lead in getting its software to market, Apple is just a few months away from launching its own AI platform. Time will tell if either AI service is capable enough to drive increased sales or not. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Apple’s AI Dilemma: 3 Chinese Stocks That Could Fill the Gap",
        "content": "There was a great deal of uncertainty surrounding Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and its AI strategy (or lack of one) entering this year. With the first half now over, investors now have more understanding of where Apple is headed in the AI age. Indeed, the Cupertino-based innovator is shooting for intelligence (note the lack of “artificial”) that’s not only useful and applied, but safe and private. Indeed, perhaps a slow and deliberate approach could be a strike of brilliance.\n\nFor now, Apple has chosen to partner with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence. In the future, Apple users will likely have more than one large language model (LLM) to pick from.\n\nIn China, a huge market for Apple, there won’t be a ChatGPT-powered iOS 18 coming later this year. According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple is looking to pair up with a Chinese AI firm to bring a local LLM to the Chinese iPhone-using public. These are three powerful candidates with whom Apple may wish to strike a deal.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) would be an excellent Chinese internet firm to partner to bring AI to the Chinese masses. The company’s Ernie bot is comparable to ChatGPT but has one notable difference: it’s trained to comply with the Cyberspace Administration of China. Undoubtedly, having an LLM that plays by the rules of Chinese regulators is paramount. If an AI model doesn’t play by their rules, it could easily get shut down, and the firm behind the model could receive stiff fines.\n\nUndoubtedly, the high degree of regulatory risk makes releasing an in-house LLM so risky for Apple. The good news is that teaming up with a third party like Baidu would offshore a great deal of that risk.\n\nApart from Ernie AI’s smarts, BIDU stock looks to be trading at a fat discount with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 11.8x. Even if Baidu doesn’t win a deal with Apple, its latest version of Ernie (4.0 Turbo) could have the potential to be a profound success. It already has 300 million users.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba (BABA) logo displayed on a phone screen\n\nSource: Nopparat Khokthong / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Baidu, Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) is a Chinese tech company that’s lost its way. After having shed more than 75% of its value, BABA stock looks severely undervalued deep-value for investors seeking growth from AI and e-commerce. With a P/E of 17.1, BABA is also much cheaper than comparable firms in the U.S. market.\n\nWith experience integrating AI across different products, perhaps Alibaba is a strong candidate to team up with the iPhone maker. It’s not just Alibaba’s LLM, Tongyi Qianwen, that’s impressive, but the firm’s ability to tailor AI to specific applications that may make an Alibaba-powered Apple Intelligence experience that much more delightful.\n\nStory continues\n\nUndoubtedly, a deal with Apple would mean wonders for the stock. However, Alibaba needs to prove it’s a cut above rivals. The company has shown it’s “all-in” on AI, with its own models, integrations, and investment in other AI startups, including Beijing’s Baichuan AI. And let’s not forget about Alibaba’s impressive cloud expertise, which would likely be an asset in Apple’s eyes.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is another internet juggernaut looking to place big bets on China’s AI future. Like Alibaba, Tencent also helped fund Baichuan AI, a firm that may have the Chinese AI model to beat.\n\nTencent’s intelligent network, Xingmai, may set Tencent apart from the pack when Apple finally decides. Of course, only time will tell which AI firm wins the right to be in the next generation of AI-enabled Chinese iPhones, iPads, and Vision Pros.\n\nThe main reason for owning the stock has to be the impressive video-gaming exposure. Though Tencent must play within Chinese regulators’ rules, I appreciate the company’s ability to engage and monetize with its intriguing mobile gaming titles. At 29.4x trailing P/E, perhaps TCEHY stock is the best all-around Chinese stock to hold for the long haul.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held a LONG position in AAPL.

        "title": "Samsung launches first Galaxy Ring wearable with AI-enabled health tracking",
        "content": "Samsung is jumping into the smart ring race with the debut of its Galaxy Ring at its Galaxy Unpacked event in Paris, France, on Wednesday. Smart rings are a category of connected devices designed to track your health and fitness more discreetly than a smartwatch or fitness band.\n\nOura's eponymously named Oura Ring is perhaps the most well-known smart ring, offering users insights into everything from sleep and heart rate variability to skin temperature and automatic workout detection. But the overall market is still relatively small compared to the smartphone space. Now Samsung is looking to get in on the action, making it the largest tech company to offer a smart ring. Samsung is entering the smart ring market with its new AI-enabled Galaxy Ring. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nThe Galaxy Ring, which Samsung says gets a shot of generative AI capabilities via its Galaxy AI platform, starts at $399 and will be available in nine sizes. Customers can visit their nearest Samsung retailer to try out different sizes in person or order sizing kits online.\n\nMy wedding ring is a 10.5, but I opted for a size 12 when trying on the Galaxy Ring as it was the most comfortable option. I'll blame that on swollen fingers from my flight to Paris, the summer heat, and the wine I had the night before my demo.\n\nThe ring itself is rather fashionable and unassuming. You wouldn't look at it and immediately assume it was a piece of technology. Available in three colors — black, silver, and gold — the Galaxy Ring felt comfortable during the brief time I wore it. Samsung says you should get upward of seven days of battery life depending on the size of your ring. The company says smaller sizes will get five days of battery life. The Galaxy Ring feels like any other ring, though it sports a series of sensors designed to help you track your health and fitness goals. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nThe Galaxy Rings' built-in sensors provide sleep-tracking features, including heart and respiratory rate tracking, and monitor movement and skin temperature changes throughout the night for cycle tracking. The ring also offers heart-rate alerts when your heart rate gets too high, auto walking and running workout detection, and an inactivity alert that lets you know when you've been stationary for too long.\n\nSamsung says it combines all of these metrics using its Galaxy AI platform into what it calls its Energy Score, which is essentially a numerical representation from 0 to 100 of your health and fitness. For example, if you worked out for a long time but didn't get a good night's sleep, your Energy Score will be on the lower side.\n\nSleep well and get in a shorter workout, and your score will be higher. Samsung is pairing this with AI-powered Wellness Tips that provide tailored suggestions to improve your metrics, such as getting to bed sooner.\n\nStory continues The Galaxy Ring charger features a circular LED battery indicator. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nSamsung isn't the only company with a health scoring system, Oura uses a similar feature it calls its Readiness score, while Fitbit has its Daily Readiness Score. Both Oura and Fitbit's offerings are meant to give you a sense of whether you can exercise or if you should take a break for the day.\n\nIt's still not clear if the smart ring market will become as popular as the modern smartwatch market or if Samsung will remain the largest company in the space for long. According to Bloomberg, Apple (AAPL) has mulled building its own smart ring in the past, and some within the organization are pushing for it to move forward with the concept.\n\nFor now, though, it looks like Samsung will soon be the biggest player in the up-and-coming market.

        "title": "Samsung debuts Galaxy Flip 6 and Fold 6 smartphones in generative AI push",
        "content": "Samsung on Wednesday took the wraps off of its latest foldable smartphones during its Unpacked event in Paris, France. The Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Android-powered phones, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6, are a key differentiator for Samsung in its long-running battle with Apple (AAPL) for global smartphone supremacy.\n\nSamsung, like Apple, is making its generative AI offerings a major selling point for both of the phones. Starting at $1,099 for the Z Flip 6 and $1,899 for the Z Fold 6, both phones are $100 more expensive than their predecessors, putting them squarely in the premium smartphone category. To put that into perspective, Apple’s iPhone 15 Pro starts at $999, while its larger Pro Max starts at $1,199. Samsung’s own S24 and S24+ start at $799 and $999, respectively. Its high-end S24 Ultra costs $1,299.\n\nSamsung is marketing its Flip 6 and Fold 6 as more than just foldable phones. It’s positioning them as powerful generative AI-capable devices thanks to its Galaxy AI platform. The software, which Samsung debuted alongside its S24 lineup earlier this year, provides a host of generative AI features ranging from real-time translation and conversation capabilities to photo editing tools and productivity options. Samsung's latest Galaxy Z Flip 6 gets minor physical enhancements, but brings along the company's Galaxy AI generative AI platform. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nAccording to the company, artificial intelligence is proving rather popular among Samsung customers. The tech giant says 77% of S24 users access its AI features every week, with Google’s Circle to Search and Samsung’s Edit Suggestions among the most popular. Circle to Search allows you to capture a photo of an object or text and then search for it via the web or translate it. Edit Suggestions, as the name implies, provides generative AI text suggestions while writing text messages and emails.\n\nSamsung says the Fold 6 and Flip 6’s unique designs make them especially helpful when using Galaxy AI features. A new conversation feature in the Interpreter app allows you to chat with another person in different languages by automatically listening to and displaying your words on the phones’ cover screens and main screens. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 can be folded like a mini laptop or book depending on how you position it. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nSay you’re chatting with someone who only speaks French, and you only speak English. You can fold the Fold 6 so that it’s resting on the table like a mini laptop or fold the Flip 6 as if it were a makeup compact. The conversation feature will then display what your friend says on the main screen and what you say on the outside screen. The idea is to allow you to have a seamless conversation in real time. Google has a similar feature on its Pixel Fold foldable smartphone.\n\nBoth phones also come loaded with Google’s Gemini app, which is powered by the search company’s own AI models. You can call up Gemini by swiping on the corner of the screen or saying, “Hey, Google.” Gemini provides a host of options including getting help brainstorming ideas for things like work projects, trip itineraries, finding location information in Google Maps and more.\n\nStory continues Samsung's various Galaxy AI features. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nAs for productivity, in addition to Edit Suggestions, Galaxy AI now includes a new PDF translation feature for the Samsung Notes app that will, true to its name, translate your PDFs on your phone while retaining the document’s layout. Chances are you’ve tried to access a PDF and translate it in the past only to have the formatting go out the window, making it difficult to read. PDF translations should help eliminate that.\n\nFrom a design perspective, the Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 are largely unchanged from last year’s Z Flip 5 and Z Fold 5, save for a few nips and tucks. The Z Fold 6, for instance, gets a slightly larger 6.3-inch cover screen to make it feel more like a standard rectangular smartphone when closed. Considering that was one of my gripes with the phone, the larger display real estate should prove to be a welcome change, even if it’s just a 0.1-inch increase. Both the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 include Google's popular Circle to Search feature. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nThe Z Flip gets the same main camera as the company’s flagship S24 and a new ultra-wide-angle camera. The phone’s battery is also the same size as the one found in the S24, which according to Samsung, means users will no longer have to sacrifice overall capabilities when choosing the Flip over its mainline flagship.\n\nThe Fold, meanwhile, gets a 50-megapixel main camera, a new 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera, and a 12MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom and up to 30x digitally enhanced zoom.\n\nBoth the Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6 come equipped with Qualcomm’s (QCOM) Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip and 12GB of memory. The Flip also gets 256GB and 512GB of storage, while the Fold gets 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB of storage.\n\nSamsung’s foldables aren’t the only ones on the market. Chinese smartphone makers like Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as Motorola, also offer their own foldable devices. Still, Samsung’s Galaxy AI platform could help ensure it remains top of mind among consumers looking for foldables. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy With Impressive Cash-Flow Performance",
        "content": "Businesses aim to generate profit, so high cash flow stocks are proof of a company’s success in making profits by generating and holding significant cash reserves.\n\nOrganizations use substantial free cash to reduce debt, withstand downturns, reinvest in growth and reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.\n\nRenowned investor Warren Buffett asserts that a company’s free cash flow is the most important valuation metric. It is unsurprising that Buffett invests in high-yield businesses like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\r\n\r\nWhile maintaining a strong balance sheet is prudent, cash alone does not define the best opportunity. Investors must consider what companies do with their cash.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite several firms excelling at generating cash flow, accumulating reserves amid high inflation represents an underutilization of resources. Though brief market volatility may warrant holding large reserves, shareholders expect ongoing reinvestment or remuneration over the long run to justify investing in high cash flow stocks.\r\n\r\nSo now, let’s examine three companies with impressive cash flows and market performance indicative of future growth.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, generates significant cash flow. Truly, it is worth consideration as one of the high cash flow stocks in which to invest.\n\nIn its latest earnings report, Meta Platforms posted $36.5 billion in revenue with $12.5 billion in free cash flow, yielding a healthy 34% cash flow margin. Also, the company maintains a strong balance sheet with $58.1 billion in total cash. Revenue climbed 27% year-over-year (YOY) as the company capitalized on a 7% increase in monthly active users. Over the past year, META expanded its cash and equivalents by 51% to $85 billion.\n\nIn addition to organic growth, Meta Platforms invests cash flow strategically. The company pays its first-ever dividend while allocating $50 billion to share repurchases. Both initiatives support the META stock price. Besides these moves, it reinvests heavily in artificial intelligence (AI). The company budgeted $40 billion for capital expenditures this year, up from an initial $35 billion target.\n\nVISA (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe world’s largest credit card company, Visa (NYSE:V) doesn’t need to use its own credit, as it has a free cash flow margin of almost 58%. Interestingly, Visa does not have significant exposure to credit card debt. It is typically up to the banks that partner with Visa to issue the cards.\n\nStory continues\n\nVisa’s business model of charging a commission on third-party transactions means it functions more as a data network that doesn’t need large expenditures. The company operates as a payment authorization, clearing and settlement, and doesn’t extend credit to consumers by itself. In fact, it takes in more income from data processing than services ($4.03 billion compared to $4.26 billion in the last quarter).\n\nThe company has increased its EPS by 20%, with payment volume increasing 7% and net revenue at 10%. Notably, Visa engages in stock buybacks, ranging from $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion a quarter, helping boost Visa’s share price. No wonder analysts are bullish on Visa stock, giving it an average price target of $310.11 per share, a potential 16% upside.\n\nAltria Group (MO) Altria Group, Inc. (MO) logo of US producer and marketer of tobacco and cigarettes is seen on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltria Group (NYSE:MO) is one of the largest tobacco companies in the U.S. and the owner of the iconic Marlboro brand. Cigarette popularity is declining, which may negatively impact the company’s future prospects. However, Altria Group is focusing on transforming its product line to smokeless options and enhancing returns for investors.\n\nNotably, Altria Group is one of the high cash flow stocks that generates a lot of cash. The free cash flow margin rose by 60.3% and operating cash flow grew by 12% last year. The company utilizes its significant cash flows to benefit shareholders. It added $2.4 billion to its stock buyback program last quarter.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Altria Group pays a generous dividend with a forward yield of 8.5%, well above the 1.3% average of the S&P 500 index. While MO’s stock price is not expected to increase rapidly and has remained flat for five years, its dividend provides consistent income, which is valuable for investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "When it comes to investing in top penny stocks, a word of caution.\n\nAlways do your due diligence before buying. Make sure it has volume. Know upfront that you can lose a lot of money. And don’t get caught up in the promotional promises of turning $10,000 into millions without first doing your homework. As I’ll repeat below, penny stocks are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators.\n\nSure, some penny stocks turned out to be massive success stories, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Ford (NYSE:F) and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST). But you must be willing to do the homework and dig through a lot of real garbage to find the next penny stock worth buying.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso, as the US SEC warns:\n\n“Penny stocks are low-priced shares of small companies. Penny stocks may trade infrequently – which means that it may be difficult to sell penny stock shares once you have them. Because it may also be difficult to find quotations for penny stocks, they may be impossible to accurately price. Investors in penny stock should be prepared for the possibility that they may lose their whole investment.”\n\nHere are a few top penny stocks I’ve been doing my homework with.\n\nAccuray (ARAY) Pennies in a jar on top of a background of blurred pennies. Penny stocks.\n\nSource: John Brueske / Shutterstock\n\nMedical device company Accuray (NASDAQ:ARAY) just saw its shares gap from about $2.20 to about $1.50. All after poor earnings stunk up the joint with a loss of $6.3 million, or six cents per share, from a year-ago profit of a penny. Revenue fell 14.3% year over year to $101.1 million, which missed calls for revenue of $113.65 million.\n\nHowever, gross orders did jump by 21% to $89.1 million, as its book-to-bill ratio improved to 1.8 from 1.2. Better, after the miss, Board Chair Joseph Whitters bought 100,000 shares at $1.56 each for about $156,050. Paul Tudor Jones’ Tudor Investment seems to like the stock, increasing its best by 34.6% with the addition of 48,090 shares at the end of March.\n\nIn addition, there’s a consensus strong buy rating on the stock with an average price target of $6.33. The high end of price targets is $7 a share.\n\nAurora Innovation (AUR) a phone displaying the Aurora website in front of a computer screen displaying the company logo\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nWhen I highlighted the opportunity in Aurora Innovation (AUR) on June 5, I noted, “It just saw Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) buy about $75 million worth of stock.” I also said, “While the AUR stock chart isn’t too attractive at the moment, give it time. With massive insider buying and its relationship with Volvo, it could accelerate higher in the near term.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the time, AUR traded at just $2.15. It’s up to about $3, which is still a strong buy today. Also, as Investorplace contributor Josh Enomoto noted, “For fiscal 2024, analysts on average anticipate sales of only $830,000. There is a possibility that the company could hit $3 million. However, the big day could arrive sometime in fiscal 2025. That’s when sales could skyrocket to $17.61 million. It’s a risk but if you want hidden-gem growth stocks, this could be it.”\n\nI’d like AUR to return to $4.50 from its last traded price of about $3.\n\nGlobalstar (GSAT) In this photo illustration the Globalstar (GSAT) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn July 3, I highlighted an opportunity in Globalstar (NYSE:GSAT), trading at around $1.08.\n\nI noted that director James Monroe III bought 4.51 million shares of GSAT for about $4.8 million on July 1. In addition, Apple recently said it would expand satellite messaging capabilities on the iPhone, which was also great news for GSAT. After all, GSAT partnered with Apple to develop satellite connectivity components.\n\nA few days later, GSAT is up to $1.32 a share and is still a buy.\n\nHelping, the stock has seen a few days of volume spikes. On July 5, for example, volume jumped to 8.8 million. On July 8, volume was up to nearly 10 million, compared to its daily average volume of 3.15 million.\n\nRegarding earnings, while its first quarter EPS loss of a penny was just in line with estimates, its revenue of $56.48 million beat estimates by $1.74 million.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks:  With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day. That’s because these “penny stocks” are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators. If we ever do publish commentary on a low-volume stock that may be affected by our commentary, we demand that InvestorPlace.com’s writers disclose this fact and warn readers of the risks.\n\nRead More: Penny Stocks — How to Profit Without Getting Scammed\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Nvidia Recently Completed a 10-for-1 Stock Split, and These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Members Look Ready to Follow in Its Footsteps",
        "content": "Although most investors are captivated by the long-term potential of artificial intelligence (AI), companies enacting stock splits are an equally hot trend on Wall Street.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows publicly traded companies an opportunity to cosmetically alter their share price and outstanding share count. It's superficial in the sense that stock splits don't affect a company's market valuation or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe two variations of stock splits are forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are purposely reducing their nominal share price to make it more affordable for everyday investors and/or their employees. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split is aimed at increasing a company's share price, often with the goal of meeting continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.\n\nAlthough some reverse-stock splits can be long-term winners, most investors tend to focus their attention on public companies conducting forward splits. High-flying stocks in need of a forward split are usually out-executing and out-innovating their competition.\n\nSince 2024 began, in the neighborhood of a dozen high-profile companies have announced and/or completed a stock split -- but none have garnered more attention than AI titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia was the most-anticipated stock split of 2024 on Wall Street\n\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) in January 1999, Nvidia has completed six forward splits. The latest was announced by the company's board on May 22 -- a 10-for-1 stock split -- with an effective date of June 7. At the snap of a finger, Nvidia's share price of more than $1,200 was adjusted to a little north of $120.\n\nThe reason Nvidia required its largest stock split since going public has everything to do with its AI dominance.\n\nSince the start of 2023, Nvidia's AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the undisputed standard in high-compute data centers. By some estimates, the company holds a virtual monopoly on the AI-GPUs that were shipped for use in enterprise data centers last year.\n\nOn top of being the preferred hardware provider for AI-accelerated data centers, demand for the company's H100 GPU has overwhelmed supply. Even with world-leading foundry services company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rapidly upping its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity for high-bandwidth memory packaging, Nvidia is nowhere close to meeting enterprise demand for its chips. As a result, it's been able to meaningfully increase the selling price of its GPUs, which has provided a hearty boost to its adjusted gross margin.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has plans to retain its first-mover advantages, as well. While most external competitors are playing catch-up to the H100, Nvidia is expected to release its next-generation AI-GPU architecture, known as Blackwell, later this year. Blackwell offers computational improvements in six areas, including quantum computing, generative AI solutions, and engineering simulation, to name a few. In June, CEO Jensen Huang teased the eventual rollout of its Rubin GPU architecture by 2026.\n\nNvidia's 10-for-1 stock split has laid a path for other fast-growing, market-leading businesses to follow. Interestingly enough, two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" might be next to answer the call. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTwo Magnificent Seven components appear ready to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks\n\nAs a quick refresher, the Magnificent Seven account for seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in America. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia have market valuations in excess of $3 trillion; Alphabet and Amazon are valued at north of $2 trillion; Meta is worth close to $1.4 trillion; and while Tesla is currently below $1 trillion, it's previously topped this psychological level.\n\nAmong Nvidia's six peers in the Magnificent Seven, two are primed to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven component that's long overdue for a stock split is the only member that's yet to ever complete one. I'm talking about social media colossus Meta Platforms. Shares of the company have risen by more than 1,300% since its debut in 2012, with the company's stock tipping the scales at roughly $540, as of the closing bell on July 5.\n\nThough Meta is among the basket of companies undeniably benefiting from the AI revolution, it would be well-insulated if the AI bubble were to burst at some point in the future. That's because nearly 98% of Meta's sales can be traced to advertising on its social media platforms.\n\nMeta is the parent company behind Facebook, the most-visited social platform globally, as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads. These are some of the world's most-downloaded social apps, and they collectively helped to attract 3.24 billion daily active users during the March-ended quarter. Businesses are well aware that no other social media company offers access to more eyeballs than Meta, which is what affords the company such exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nSomething else working in Meta's favor is its treasure trove of cash. As of March 31, Meta was sitting on more than $58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. To boot, it's also generated north of $76 billion in cash from its operations over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has the luxury of betting big on AI data centers, the metaverse, and augmented/virtual reality devices thanks to his company's immense cash-flow generation.\n\nWith Meta's stock well over $500 and the company's long-term growth prospects improving, its very first stock split would seem to be in the cards.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven member that looks ready to follow in Nvidia's footsteps and become Wall Street's newest stock-split stock is software and cloud juggernaut Microsoft.\n\nSince its March 1986 IPO, Microsoft has conducted nine forward splits. However, the last stock split it completed was back in February 2003! With the world's largest company by market cap closing the July 5 session at $467.56 per share, the ingredients are on the table for Microsoft to announce a stock split.\n\nThe beauty of Microsoft's operating model is that it relies on sizable margins from its legacy operations to fund its high-growth initiatives. Although iconic software segments like Windows and Office aren't growing like they once were, the exceptional moats and margins associated with these divisions provide Microsoft with plenty of cash to reinvest in the cloud and AI, or perhaps deploy when making acquisitions.\n\nThe bread-and-butter to Microsoft's future looks to be cloud infrastructure service platform Azure. While Microsoft has AI and cloud ties in other operating segments, Azure is consistently its fastest-growing segment -- 31% constant-currency sales growth in the fiscal third quarter (ended March 31). Azure ranks second to Amazon Web Services in global cloud infrastructure service market share.\n\nSimilar to Meta Platforms, Microsoft's balance sheet and cash-flow generation afford it the ability to take risks that few other companies can match. It closed out the fiscal third quarter with $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and has generated $110 billion in operating cash flow over the TTM period. This is what allowed Microsoft to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard last year for $68.7 billion in an all-cash deal.\n\nWhat better way for the world's largest public company to excite Wall Street and its shareholders than by being the next Magnificent Seven component to announce a stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "It can be tough to buy a stock when its share price is soaring. As the stock gets more expensive, you must cough up more money to own a slice of the business. But there's normally a good reason why the stock's price is rising steadily, and it's usually tied to its business fundamentals.\n\nLegendary investor Warren Buffett says that \"if a business does well, the stock eventually follows.\" This simple statement contains some subtlety in that it's really saying that you should look at the business behind the stock because it's the success of the business that will drive its share price higher.\n\nOnce you understand this subtlety, it becomes clear how you ought to invest if you want to succeed in building your wealth. You want to focus on the solid growth stocks that represent businesses possessing catalysts or riding sustainable trends over years or even decades and can grow their revenue, profits, and cash flows over time. As business profits increase, investors will bid up the price of its shares, resulting in attractive capital gains. As the gains from these stocks multiply, you will eventually end up with a comfortable pot of money that you can draw on for your retirement.\n\nHere are three stocks whose share prices have soared this year that are still worth buying now to attain long-term gains. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Dutch Bros\n\nDutch Bros(NYSE: BROS) is an operator and franchisor of drive-thru coffee stores that serve high-quality, handcrafted beverages. As of March 31, the company had 876 locations across 17 states in the U.S. Dutch Bros saw its share price surge by nearly 333% year to date, and with a market capitalization of just $6.5 billion, there's plenty of room for further growth.\n\nThe coffee chain's financials saw a sharp improvement over the past three years. Revenue soared by 92% from 2021 to 2023, going from $497.9 million to $965.8 million. The business reported an operating income of $46.2 million for 2023, a far cry from the operating loss of $111.2 million in 2021. Even after deducting finance expenses of $32.3 million in 2023, Dutch Bros still eked out a small net income of $1.7 million, a turnaround from two consecutive years of net losses in 2021 and 2022.\n\nOperating cash inflow also increased to $139.9 million for 2023, more than doubling from the prior year, but free cash flow remains elusive for now as the coffee chain spends available capital to open new stores.\n\nDutch Bros saw rapid store growth during these three years. Store count started at 441 at the beginning of 2021, but nearly doubled to 831 by the end of 2023. Systemwide same-store sales were also positive for all three years. This momentum has carried forward into the first quarter of 2024, with a total of 45 new shops opened across 14 states.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenue in Q1 rose 39% year over year to $275 million, with operating income at $25.6 million. Net income for the quarter stood at $7.1 million, already higher than the total net income for the whole of 2023. Operating cash flow catapulted from just $3 million the year before to more than $41 million for the quarter, demonstrating the business' strong cash flow generation capability.\n\nWith more people developing a taste for high-quality, artisanal coffee, Dutch Bros looks well-positioned to continue growing its presence as well as its top and bottom lines. The company plans to open between 150 to 165 new stores this year and expects positive same-store sales. With strong brand recognition from its member rewards program, along with two successful product launches during the most recent quarter, Dutch Bros looks like a stock you can keep for the long term.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that helped push the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 to new records this year. The iPhone maker's stock is up nearly 18.4% year to date and breaking new all-time highs in the process. The company's financials remain solid, with revenue dipping just slightly to $210.3 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2024.\n\nNet income for the first two quarters came in 6.3% higher year over year at $57.6 billion, and Apple also saw its Services revenue achieve a new record. Free cash flow increased slightly by 4.2% year over year to $58.2 billion, and the company also upped its quarterly dividend to $0.25, an increase of 4%.\n\nThere could be more positive news to come as Apple launches Apple Intelligence, a new personal artificial intelligence (AI) system that will be incorporated into its iPhone, iMac, and iPad. Working with generative AI models, the company will integrate Apple Intelligence into its new iOS 18 operating system to help simplify tasks and make work more productive. With only the newer iPhone models able to handle the processing capabilities required of Apple Intelligence, Apple may see a big wave of device upgrades that will boost its sales figures.\n\nThe company's new spatial computing headset, the Apple Vision Pro, is also going on sale outside the U.S. in countries such as Singapore, mainland China, Hong Kong, and Japan. This cutting-edge piece of technology allows for immersive video watching and the ability to increase productivity by working with just your eyes and hands. Apple's innovation and strong customer loyalty are reasons enough to own the stock for years and even decades as it endears more customers to its suite of products and services.\n\n3. Netflix\n\nNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) is the market leader in streaming television. The company releases a wide selection of original movies, TV series, and documentaries for its members. Netflix's stock has risen by 42% year to date, and investors could see more upside over the years if the company continues delivering the same breadth and quality of content that it has over the past several years.\n\nNetflix's financials are impressive -- revenue has increased from $29.7 billion in 2021 to $33.7 billion in 2023. Net income has grown from $5.1 billion to $5.4 billion over the same period, and the business is also churning out consistent positive free cash flow every year. The first quarter of 2024 saw revenue increasing by 14.8% year over year to $9.4 billion and net income surging by close to 79% year over year to $2.3 billion.\n\nNetflix's membership base has also grown steadily over the years. Membership stood at 221.8 million at the end of 2021 and has grown by nearly 22% by Q1 2024 to 269.6 million.\n\nNetflix's share of overall TV viewership in almost every country is less than 10%, suggesting there are still ample opportunities for Netflix to broaden its content slate to attract more members. Many of the company's titles already have millions of views, and its Academy Award nominations for its in-house films have made it the most nominated studio for three out of the past four years.\n\nNetflix has also started to phase out its cheapest ad-free $11.99 tier, even as it increases its ad-supported tiers across different countries. With slightly more than a quarter of a billion members, Netflix is betting that these customers will continue to pay higher prices to have access to its wide variety of different content. There are plans to introduce live shows for comedy, sports, and music, helping to take the entertainment level up another notch to keep its members satisfied.\n\nWith Netflix's strong market leadership and significant growth runway, along with its consistent spending on quality content, investors should continue to see healthy growth in profits and cash flows.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. have relinquished the chance to be observers on OpenAI’s board, a surprise decision that underscores growing scrutiny from antitrust regulators on Big Tech’s influence over artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat Hurricane Beryl Makes a Mockery of Texas Climate Deniers Microsoft Orders China Staff to Use iPhones for Work and Drop Android The End of the Cheap Money Era Catches Up to Chelsea FC’s Owner Asia’s Richest Banker Gets Caught in Adani-Hindenburg Crossfire\n\nThe Windows software maker, which has invested $13 billion in the creator of ChatGPT, sent a letter to the startup announcing its withdrawal from the board, according to a person familiar with the matter, asking not to be identified discussing a private move. Apple had been expected to take up a similar role, but an OpenAI spokesperson said the startup will have no board observers after Microsoft’s departure.\n\nLast month, European regulators said they were going to survey Microsoft’s rivals about OpenAI’s exclusive use of its technology. That underscores the mounting pressure on one of the world’s most valuable companies, which hopes to tap OpenAI’s services to propel its Windows and Copilot AI platforms. The US is opening a separate antitrust investigation into Microsoft’s alleged dominance of the rapidly emerging field, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\n“Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company’s direction,” Microsoft wrote in its memo to OpenAI, reviewed by Bloomberg News. “We no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.”\n\nMicrosoft, which also runs the Azure cloud computing service, faces questions about its other investments in the sphere.\n\nThe FTC also opened a probe into whether Microsoft failed to properly notify the antitrust agencies about its deal with Inflection AI, according to the people. In March, the Redmond, Washington-based software giant agreed to pay the startup $650 million to license its AI software and hired much of Inflection’s staff.\n\n“We’re grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the Board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership,” OpenAI said in a statement to Bloomberg News, without commenting directly on Apple or Microsoft’s decisions.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Fed chief Jerome Powell makes the climb up Capitol Hill again Wednesday, and trading is largely rangebound on Wall Street ahead of this. Microsoft has decided to give up its seat on the board of Open AI, while weak Chinese inflation data indicates a slowing recovery in this important economy.\n\n1. Powell returns to Capitol Hill\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell returns to Capitol Hill later Wednesday, for the second day of his semi-annual Congressional testimony, this time before the House of Representatives.\n\nPowell flagged the recent labor market cooling, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, as an increasingly important factor in deciding when the U.S. central bank will start cutting interest rates.\n\n“Elevated inflation is not the only risk we face,” Powell said Tuesday, noting that the \"labor market has cooled really significantly across so many measures.\"\n\n\"Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment,” Powell said, after noting that labor market indicators \"have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic.”\n\nMarket participants have taken these comments as the Fed chief preparing the ground for a September cut, acknowledging that inflation isn’t the only factor in deciding monetary policy, but will look for more refinement in his comments later in the session.\n\n2. Futures little changed; Powell speaks again\n\nU.S. stock futures are little changed Wednesday, as investors await the second round of testimony from Fed chief Jerome Powell on Capitol Hill.\n\nBy 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 20 points, or 0.1%, lower, while S&P 500 futures climbed 4 points, or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 35 points, or 0.2%.\n\nThe broad-based S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed at fresh record highs on Tuesday, after Fed head Jerome Powell hinted the central bank could soon start easing monetary policy, while the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average underperformed.\n\nPowell continues his testimony later Wednesday, this time before the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nThere’s little in the way of significant U.S. economic data scheduled Wednesday, and all eyes will be on Thursday’s June consumer price index reading, which many see as a key test for the market and the outlook for rate cuts.\n\n3. Microsoft ditches OpenAI board seat\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has given up its observer seat at the board of OpenAI, amid regulatory scrutiny into generative artificial intelligence in both the U.S. and Europe.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe software giant stated that such a position was no longer necessary given an improvement in AI start-up's governance in the past eight months.\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction. Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,\" it said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company will establish a new engagement approach by hosting regular stakeholder meetings with strategic partners such as Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nMicrosoft took a non-voting, observer position on OpenAI's board in November last year after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took back the reins of the company.\n\nThe observer seat and Microsoft's more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain and the U.S. over how much control it exerts over OpenAI.\n\n4. Chinese consumer deflation\n\nChinese consumer inflation shrank in June on a monthly basis, while producer inflation contracted for a 20th consecutive month, pointing to a very slow recovery for the world's second-largest economy.\n\nMonth-on-month CPI inflation shrank 0.2% in June, compared to expectations for a contraction of 0.1%, while on an annual basis inflation grew 0.2% year-on-year in June, below expectations for a print of 0.4%.\n\nThe weak CPI reading comes as consumers reined in discretionary spending, spooked by relatively high unemployment as well as concerns over a property market downturn.\n\nThe lackluster consumer spending presents more near-term headwinds for the country, and suggests the likelihood of more stimulus measures by the Chinese government.\n\nProducer price index inflation shrank 0.8% in June, an improvement from the 1.4% contraction seen in the prior month, and shrinking at its slowest pace since February 2023.\n\n5. Crude falls on weak Chinese inflation data\n\nCrude prices fell Wednesday, adding to the previous session’s losses as weak Chinese inflation data raised concerns about the health of the second largest economy in the world.\n\nBy 04:00 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) dropped 0.4% to $81.12 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $84.33 a barrel.\n\nConcerns over deflation in China, the world’s largest importer of crude, weighed on the oil market Wednesday, although a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. inventories has limited the losses.\n\nData from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, showed that U.S. oil inventories fell 1.9 million barrels last week, as the summer driving season continued.\n\nBoth benchmarks lost about 3% in the previous three sessions on signs that the Texas energy industry came off relatively unscathed from Hurricane Beryl.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPowell returns, Microsoft's board seat, Chinese inflation - what's moving markets\n\nEuropean shares rise as earnings take centre stage; Powell's comments on tap\n\nShares gain, dollar firm as September Fed rate cut chances grow\n\nView comments",

The company is scheduled to release its earnings on August 1, 2024. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.33, reflecting a 5.56% increase from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $83.75 billion, up 2.38% from the year-ago period.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $6.59 per share and a revenue of $386.4 billion, indicating changes of +7.5% and +0.81%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.24% higher. As of now, Apple holds a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Apple is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 34.57. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 11.31, so one might conclude that Apple is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.77. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Computer - Mini computers was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.25 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nThe Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 20, placing it within the top 8% of over 250 industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nTo follow AAPL in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. reported a 21% gain in personal computer shipments in the second quarter, the biggest jump among global PC makers as part of a budding industry recovery that produced a second consecutive period of growth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat Microsoft Orders China Staff to Use iPhones for Work and Drop Android Hurricane Beryl Makes a Mockery of Texas Climate Deniers S&P 500 Holds Gains as Fed Bets Steady on Powell: Markets Wrap Biden’s Biggest Donors Left Powerless to Sway Him to End Bid\n\nWorldwide shipments of desktops and laptops increased 3% from a year earlier in the period ended in June, according to a report Tuesday from IDC, an industry research firm. Apple and Acer Inc., which posted a jump of about 14%, saw the largest growth in shipments among major manufacturers.\n\n“Two consecutive quarters of growth, combined with plenty of market hype around AI PCs and a less sexy but arguably more important commercial refresh cycle, seems to be what the PC market needed,” wrote Ryan Reith, an IDC group vice president.\n\nThe PC industry experienced historic declines in recent years after consumers, businesses and schools bought new machines during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, then held off on replacements. The results show that a cycle of new purchases is underway, wrote Amit Daryanani, an analyst at Evercore ISI.\n\nComputer makers have touted AI PCs, a new type of device designed specifically to run artificial intelligence tasks, as helping fuel a new wave of upgrades. IDC has said only about 3% of PCs shipped this year will be AI-optimized.\n\nDell Technologies Inc.’s shipments decreased 2.4% in the quarter, making it the only major company to see a decline, while Lenovo Group Ltd. commanded the highest market share at almost 23%. HP Inc. saw an increase of 1.8% from a year earlier and was the second-biggest PC maker with 21% of the market.\n\nWeak demand in China held the overall results back — excluding that country, worldwide shipments grew more than 5%, IDC said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk’s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia—With a Catch How to Invest During a High Interest Rate Era The Rich Investor Club Is Getting Crowded How Stocks Became the Game That Record Numbers of Americans Are Playing\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon launches its fourth-generation Graviton4 chip as competition intensifies",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) Web Services (AWS) is launching its fourth-generation Graviton processor, the Graviton4 chip, the company shared exclusively with Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe new chip promises to deliver substantial improvements in performance and efficiency, including three times the compute power and memory of its predecessor, 75% more memory bandwidth, and 30% better performance, according to Rahul Kulkarni, Amazon’s lead product manager for artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\n“Collectively it's delivering more price performance, which means for every dollar spent, you get a lot more performance,” Kulkarni shared with Yahoo Finance at Amazon’s chips lab in Austin, Texas.\n\nDemand for chips is growing as semiconductors continue to play a vital role in the global economy, powering nearly everything we use. The industry is currently valued at $544 billion and is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2033, driven by increasing demand for AI.\n\nAs a result, hyperscalers such as Amazon, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) are creating custom chips to meet their specific needs, cut costs, and offer customers more affordable options.\n\n\"All of these companies are spending a lot of money on developing chips,\" said Patrick Moorhead, who spent over a decade as a vice president at AMD. \"They won't talk about how much they're investing, but they have these giant R&D budgets.\"\n\nNvidia (NVDA) remains the dominant player in the AI chips market, with more than 80% share of the market for graphics processing units (GPUs). But there is enough demand to support multiple competitors, according to Moorhead, who currently serves as CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.\n\nAlthough the Graviton4 chip is not an AI chip, it supports AWS's Inferentia and Trainium chips, which are focused on the technology. Trainium competes directly with Nvidia's AI chips, which are considered the fastest and most powerful in the market.\n\nHowever, AWS's goal is not to unseat Nvidia, Kulkarni emphasized. Instead, the cloud service provider hopes to offer a viable alternative for customers focused on price performance, which they hope will allow them to take a profitable slice of the rapidly expanding AI-driven chips market.\n\n\"Right now, if a customer is more focused on time to market, Nvidia-based products that we offer are a great option,\" Kulkarni said. \"There are customers for whom cost becomes a very prohibitive aspect of running their business. If they want to do more cost-optimized AI workloads like training or inference, then our Inferentia and Trainium products become a great alternative.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHow Amazon keeps development costs down\n\nIn addition to buying chips from makers like Nvidia, AMD (AMD), and Intel (INTC), Amazon also designs its own chips in-house. AWS currently offers two main types of chips: those designed for AI and those made for general purposes, like the Graviton4.\n\nIn a rare look at AWS's lab, Yahoo Finance saw AWS engineers solder and test chip designs, using software to look for performance issues and fix them on site.\n\nIt's one way the company says it drives down development costs.\n\n“We can tune the product, tune this silicon, to just focus on things that really matter for customer workloads,” said Kulkarni. Inside Amazon Web Services' chip-testing lab. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAWS has not disclosed specific pricing details for the Graviton4, but the processors are rented at $0.02845 per second of compute power. This price-performance ratio is crucial for AWS, as it uses its proprietary chips to power its cloud infrastructure and servers.\n\n\"AWS customers can use Graviton4 to cut their bill for IT in half,\" said Moorhead, who currently serves as CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.\n\nIt’s not just about providing chips to customers — AWS's chips strategy is also about using all of its chip offerings to power its own efforts, including a new large language model, a potential rival to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nMoorhead noted that while the development of chips is expensive, it can lead to substantial savings in the long run.\n\n\"Let's say you can save $200 a chip, and you're buying a million of them a year,\" Moorhead said. \"That adds up, and that's a lot of money that you can pour in to do that.\" Attendees walk through an expo hall at AWS re:Invent 2023, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, on Wednesday, Nov. 29, 2023, in Las Vegas. (Noah Berger/Amazon Web Services via AP Images) (AWS)\n\nFor investors, earnings expectations from chip development may impact company profits more than actual chip production. As AWS looks to carve out its niche by designing, testing, and validating its chips, analysts have noticed the company's growing influence in the semiconductor space.\n\nAnalyst earnings expectations are higher for Amazon than for Microsoft or Alphabet, and the profit margins for AWS alone reached 38% in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n\"AWS has a lot of credibility in the semiconductor space,\" Moorhead said. \"Ten years ago, I had questions about how a company like this could do chips when you have companies investing multiple billions of dollars to do that. But they are very good at it.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Hot Stocks: 3 Sleeping Giants About to Dominate Their Sectors",
        "content": "Some stocks fly under the radar of investors even as they quietly dominate the industry in which they operate. These stealth stocks rise to the top by developing competitive advantages. This allows them to take market share from competitors and deliver strong financial results.\n\nWall Street analysts who cover specific economic sectors and their competing stocks might notice the dominance of a particular company. However, retail investors often miss out. Lack of media coverage and attention to certain stocks allows them to slip by unnoticed. And this can happen even as their share price steadily rises.\n\nLet’s explore three such hot stocks that could surely dominate their sectors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCorning (GLW) the corning (GLW) logo and homepage displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpecialty glassmaker Corning (NYSE:GLW) doesn’t get much attention. But its shares are up 12% on the day of this writing after the company raised its forward guidance ahead of its Q2 financial results to be released on July 30. Corning said that it expects revenue of $3.6 billion compared with previous guidance that had called for $3.4 billion in Q2 sales.\n\nIn terms of profit, Corning is now forecasting EPS at the “high end” of its range of 42 cents to 46 cents. Corning added that it is seeing increased sales as demand rises for its new optical connectivity products designed for artificial intelligence (AI). While still best known for its CorningWare line of cookware, the company divested that consumer products business back in 1998.\n\nToday, Corning is a tech company that makes specialty glass that’s used for technological and scientific applications. In practical terms, Corning makes glass for big-screen TVs, mobile phones such as Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone and fiber optics. GLW stock is now up 41% on the year.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nIf Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY) doesn’t already dominate the pharmaceutical industry, it looks like it will in short order. Since July 1, the company has received regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin selling its Alzheimer medication that is expected to be a blockbuster drug. Also, LLY announced that it is buying biopharmaceutical companyMorphic Holding (NASDAQ:MORF) for $3.2 billion.\n\nMorphic Holding develops treatments for chronic diseases, specifically inflammatory bowel disease. The deal is expected to help Eli Lilly expand further into the gastroenterology medical specialty. Last fall, the FDA approved Eli Lilly’s drug “Omvoh,” which is used to treat ulcerative colitis.

UBS agreed to acquire Credit Suisse in 2023 for $3.2 billion after that bank’s failure. The takeover of Credit Suisse has left Switzerland, arguably the world’s best known banking center, with one global bank that has a balance sheet twice as large as the country’s economy.\n\nIf nothing else, the absorption of Credit Suisse gives UBS sufficient size to better compete against major international lenders such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) in the U.S. and HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) in the U.K. Also, the deal’s completion gives UBS a near monopoly position as the only full-service depository bank in its home country of Switzerland, whose population is just under nine million people. UBS stock has risen 52% in the last 12 months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in LLY.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Summer 2024",
        "content": "The metaverse is still very much alive and well, creating opportunities for some of the top metaverse stocks.\n\nAt the moment, we’re seeing metaverse growth in gaming and e-commerce. We’re also seeing it in retail with IKEA and Nike (NYSE:NKE), for example. We’re seeing it with McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) latest jump into the metaverse. Plus, we’re seeing it in advertising, health and wellness, education and live entertainment.\n\nAccording to CoinTrust.com, the global metaverse market could grow 575% to nearly $500 billion by 2030.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut wait, there’s more.\n\nAs noted by TynMagazine.com, “According to Statista’s forecast, the total number of users in the metaverse landscape is projected to hit almost 2.6 billion by the end of the decade, four times more than the earlier forecast and three times more than this year. The total addressable market or the revenue opportunity for metaverse products and services in the conservative scenario, where 15% of the digital economy shifts to the metaverse, is expected to hit $1.9 trillion in this period.”\n\nThat said, I’d use every dip in metaverse stocks as a buying opportunity.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to top metaverse stocks, Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) will always be a top pick.\n\nFor one, multiple companies are working with Roblox to jump into the metaverse. That includes Nike, Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), Gucci, McDonald’s and Forever 21 — to name a few. Two, Roblox is the closest thing to a mainstream metaverse. It builds out a human co-experience platform that enables billions of users to come together to play, learn, communicate and explore.\n\nThree, recent earnings negativity appears to have been priced into the rebounding stock. Plus, analysts are bullish. Macquarie initiated coverage of RBLX with an Outperform rating, noting it’s one of the main “building blox” of the metaverse.\n\nMoffettNathanson also upgraded the stock with a $26 target after the sell-off in the stock. Better, as RBLX continues to pivot higher with the metaverse story, it’s a strong buy.\n\nLast trading at $39.82, the company just refilled its earnings gap in early May. From this price, I’d like to see RBLX run back to $47 a share initially.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecent weakness in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also a strong buy opportunity. Currently trading at $128.20, I’d like to see NVDA trade closer to $150 in the near term.\n\nWhile it’s been driven by artificial intelligence, demand for its chips and strong earnings growth, it’s also exposed to the metaverse with its Omniverse software.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith it, companies can create and test virtual environments all in real-time. Foxconn, for example, is using the Omniverse to create a digital twin of its new factory in Guadalajara to train robots in a virtual environment.\n\nHelping, analysts at UBS (NYSE:UBS) say NVDA could earn $5 a share in 2025 as budgets for hyper-scalers begin to firm up. The firm also has a $150 price target.\n\nWolfe Research also raised its price target to $150, “noting that recent checks indicate a path to 50% or more content growth for Nvidia’s GPUs in 2025, with incremental upside coming from unit growth and better networking attach rates,” as reported by Seeking Alpha.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) Metaverse stock. gaming cryptos\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you’d rather diversify with an exchange-traded fund (ETF), there’s also the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF holds 40 metaverse-related holdings, all of which should benefit from the metaverse’s potential $5 trillion impact by 2030. Some of its top holdings include Nvidia, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Roblox, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).\n\nFueling upside, “The Metaverse’s economic reach is anticipated to hit an impressive $10.7 trillion by 2033, signaling an era of unprecedented expansion,” said RoundHill Investments.\n\nTwo, “VR/AR headset shipments are forecasted to reach 31.1 million by 2026, indicating steady industry growth and market traction.”\n\nBoth could help fuel a significant upside for METV.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Microsoft ordered employees in China to only use iPhones due to security threats",
        "content": "Microsoft will require its employees in China to only use iPhones due to their enhanced security features.\n\nThe move comes as Microsoft undertakes a major cybersecurity overhaul. The project, internally known as the Secure Future Initiative, comes after Microsoft faced scrutiny for its subpar security practices. Microsoft’s new policy, which will go into effect in September, means that employees in China will only be allowed to use iPhones for work, as first reported by Bloomberg. The new rule is meant to effectively limit the number of Android phones used by Microsoft’s Chinese employees.\n\nMicrosoft will begin requiring employees to verify their identities and use two-factor authentication when logging into their work phones.\n\nMicrosoft had to ask its employees to only use iPhones for work because certain security apps like Microsoft Authenticator and the Identity Pass app weren’t available on any other operating systems in China. In the U.S. and other countries, those two apps are also available on Google Play. But Google Play doesn’t operate in China, which means Microsoft’s employees could only get the relevant security apps on an Apple iPhone.\n\n“Due to the lack of availability of Google Mobile Services in this region, we look to offer employees a means of accessing these required apps, such as an iOS device,” a Microsoft spokesperson told Fortune in an email.\n\nEmployees in China who don’t have an iPhone will be given one by Microsoft, according to Bloomberg.\n\nChinese Android phones made by companies like Huawei and Xiaomi operate their own platforms. Microsoft’s banning of Chinese smartphones is emblematic of a diverging digital ecosystem between China and the U.S. where the two governments and major corporations that work with them have become increasingly wary of allowing the other to access sensitive materials.\n\nChina has its own search engines and social media platforms, where U.S. giants like Facebook are banned. Its internet censors are legendary for their breadth and strictness. Meanwhile, in the U.S. the White House has limited exports of the most sophisticated semiconductor technology to Chinese companies. And Congress passed a bill that would force the sale of the Chinese-owned TikTok to an American buyer over concerns the social media platform could be used to influence public opinion.\n\nCyber security became a top priority for Microsoft after it was found its cloud systems were breached by state-backed Chinese hackers last year. The cyber attack came ahead of Secretary of State Anthony Blinken’s visit to Beijing in June 2023, further exacerbating tensions between the U.S. and China. The hack raised major red flags about Microsoft’s security practices. In April a federal agency released a scathing report that found “Microsoft’s security culture was inadequate.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIn March, a U.S. federal court charged a group of Chinese hackers for a separate set of cyber attacks that took place in 2018. The Chinese embassy in Washington D.C. said the charges were baseless. “Without valid evidence, the U.S. jumped to an unwarranted conclusion and made groundless accusations against China,” Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the embassy said at the time.\n\nAs the relationship between the U.S. and China becomes more fraught, both sides have tried to firewall the others’ cyber capabilities. Since 2023, Chinese government-backed companies have ordered employees to stop using foreign smartphones from manufacturers like Apple and Samsung. Meanwhile China has attempted to surveil parts of the U.S. with its own surreptitious methods. Early last year China sent several spy balloons into the U.S. Even electric vehicles and connected cars have been caught in the crosshairs, seen as a covert way to surveil Americans. The Biden administration is weighing a ban of all Chinese smart cars after a national security investigation found they collect data on passengers and use external sensors to gather information on U.S. infrastructure. A recent Fortuneinvestigation found China’s self-driving cars have already traveled 1.8 million miles on American roads.\n\nThose tensions have only grown after a report published on Tuesday by an Australian-led consortium of intelligence agencies including those from the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Germany detailed repeated cyber attacks from China’s top spy agency.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Avoiding Nvidia Causes Fundsmith Equity To Lag Behind Benchmark In First Half\n\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the subject of significant debate among investment managers, as highlighted by Terry Smith’s recent comments on his decision to avoid the tech giant.\n\nSmith’s global fund, Fundsmith Equity, lagged behind its benchmark in the first half of the year, missing out on the semiconductor manufacturer’s stock surge, the Financial Times reports.\n\nAlso Read: Analysts Boost Nvidia and AMD as AI Market Continues to Expand\n\nThe $32 billion (25 billion Sterling Pounds) Fundsmith Equity portfolio, which prioritizes growth stocks, holds stakes in major US tech companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nHowever, Smith opted out of investing in Nvidia, citing unpredictability in its future outlook.\n\nNvidia, briefly valued at over $3 trillion last month, alongside other tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta, and Apple, made up nearly 60% of the S&P 500’s 14% rise in the first half of the year.\n\nIn the six months ending June, Fundsmith Equity returned 9.3%, trailing the MSCI World Index’s 12.7% return in sterling terms.\n\nThe S&P 500 index saw a 17% return over the same period, driven significantly by Nvidia’s performance, which accounted for a quarter of the gain.\n\nPrice Actions: NVDA shares traded higher by 1.64% at $130.29 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Avoiding Nvidia Causes Fundsmith Equity To Lag Behind Benchmark In First Half originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "7 ‘Buy and Hold Forever’ Stocks for Lasting Riches",
        "content": "Buy-and-hold stocks don’t have to be boring. Often, investors looking for buy-and-hold stocks see recommendations centered around what can be called charitably value traps. Alternately, some recommend buy-and-hold stocks based purely on recent outperformance without looking at long-term potential or whether the company is objectively overvalued.\n\nThese buy-and-hold stocks blend the best of both worlds, with recent winds, growth potential, and fundamental underpinnings creating a foundation suitable for any long-term portfolio. Don’t let short-term fluctuations scare you away from their long-term potential, either. Some of these buy-and-hold stocks dropped slightly in recent months, but in all cases, solid tailwinds offer a compelling and viable investment thesis.\n\nRemember to do your own due diligence when finding buy-and-hold stocks, but this list is a strong starting point that captures multiple sectors, company sizes, and opportunities for a well-rounded portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) A close-up of a Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) office in Terra Haute, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) is often at the front of the line for buy-and-hold stocks; this list is no exception.\n\nThe conglomerate’s diverse portfolio includes more than 50 companies across diversified and evergreen industries such as real estate, transportation, energy, and consumer goods. These expansive holdings offer an easy way to achieve a balanced investment portfolio without picking numerous individual stocks.\n\nAdditionally, investing in Berkshire Hathaway means aligning with Warren Buffett’s value-first investment strategies. Likewise, his prudent approach, such as reducing stakes in underperforming stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) to increase cash reserves, demonstrates a strategic “rebalancing” tactic that can protect your portfolio from economic downturns. In the future, you can benefit from Buffett’s tactical deployment of that cash to seize opportunities when companies face challenges.\n\nInvesting in Berkshire Hathaway provides a straightforward way to leverage the expertise of one of the world’s most successful investors. For long-term investors, few buy-and-hold stocks offer the stability and growth potential of Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) consistently ranks among the top buy-and-hold dividend stocks for a good reason. Its status as a Dividend Aristocrat, combined with monthly distributions and a solid 5.9% forward yield, makes it a perennial favorite. After a nearly 12% decline over the past year, this stock is attractively priced for long-term investors. Likewise, Realty Income’s operational and fundamental strength remains unchanged, reinforcing its appeal to buyers today.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company boasts an impressive 98% occupancy rate across its properties, with 80% of its retail tenants operating in sectors resilient to economic downturns. Most of these tenants are in the grocery sector, alongside convenience stores, dollar stores, and drugstores. This diverse mix ensures stability and minimizes risk, shielding Realty Income from all but the most severe economic downturns.\n\nRealty Income’s triple-net lease model is another key advantage. This arrangement shifts all operational risks and expenses to the tenants, including property maintenance costs. This effectively shields Realty Income from rising material and labor costs, often associated with higher interest rates. Additionally, with leases typically spanning 15 years or more and renewal options in place, Realty Income enjoys a consistent stream of rental income. The average lease term until renewal is just under 10 years, providing the real estate investment trust with significant flexibility over the next decade, regardless of economic conditions.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) stands out among buy-and-hold stocks in that it is attractive to a range of investment strategies and investor preferences, from AI enthusiasts and healthcare proponents to those seeking reliable dividend income.\n\nMedtronic is poised to lead the healthcare AI revolution. Its long-standing partnership with AI powerhouse Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is pioneering the development of AI-integrated medical hardware. Nvidia’s healthcare vice president, Kim Powell, highlighted the significance of this collaboration, stating that it will “accelerate AI innovation by enabling a software-defined business model, with the goal of improving clinical decision-making, reducing medical variability, and driving better patient outcomes.” Given Nvidia’s industry dominance and history of king-making, Medtronic stands to gain significantly from this partnership.\n\nMoreover, Medtronic is positioned to benefit from the long-term growth of the medical device industry, which is expected to reach $795 billion by 2030, growing at a steady 5.2% compound annual growth rate since 2015. Medtronic holds one of the largest market shares in this industry, second only to diversified firms like McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) that also sell pharmaceuticals.\n\nFor value investors, Medtronic is an attractive option among buy-and-hold stocks. The company boasts a sustainable price-to-book ratio of 1.9x and offers a solid total yield of 5.3%, making it a reliable choice for those looking to build a resilient portfolio.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf any growth stock in today’s crowded, overvalued landscape can be classified as a player among buy and hold stocks, it’s Crowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD). Businesses face many challenges today and grapple with geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, and supply chain disruptions.\n\nDespite these issues, cyber threats remain the top global risk for most business owners, both small and large. Concerns about cyber threats, data breaches, digital infrastructure vulnerabilities, and ransomware attempts are at the forefront of their minds.\n\nCrowdstrike, a leading cybersecurity stock, is positioned to address these growing threats as technological advancements demand more robust security solutions. The company already serves a diverse clientele, including government agencies, corporations, small businesses, and educational institutions.\n\nImpressively, Crowdstrike’s revenue has significantly increased over the past five quarters, with the last four marking its first consecutive profitable periods. These incremental and successive income boosts, particularly in today’s economic climate, suggest a promising future for Crowdstrike as it continues to lead in digital security and protection.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a stock that demands attention. Known for its cutting-edge data analytics and AI-driven solutions, Palantir carved out a niche in both the public and private sectors. Government agencies, commercial enterprises, and non-profit organizations leverage its platforms, Palantir Gotham and Palantir Foundry, to make sense of complex data and drive informed decision-making.\n\nDespite some volatility in its stock price, Palantir’s growth potential remains strong and remarkably resilient this year, consistently trading in the $25 range. The company keeps nailing high-profile contracts, such as its recent multi-million dollar deals with the U.S. Department of Defense and cutting-edge space companies. These contracts provide steady revenue streams and reinforce Palantir’s reputation as a trusted partner in the data analytics space.\n\nPalantir is an easy pick among buy-and-hold stocks for investors interested in capturing AI and the big data sector’s continued potential. Its continuous innovation, expanding client base, and strategic positioning make it a standout player poised for long-term growth.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf you had to guess the best-performing stock of the past few decades, you’d likely think of a big-name tech firm or one of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks. However, Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) takes the crown, delivering an astounding 31% annualized return since 1998. In comparison, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the second-best performer, achieved a “mere” 28% annual gain.\n\nWhile Monster still has some growth potential, the “next big thing” in beverage stocks is undoubtedly Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH). A January downgrade from Bank of America temporarily pushed share prices down, dropping 3% since then, but that temporary dip presents a prime entry point for investors. Celsius is not resting on its laurels; the company is aggressively expanding into new markets, including Canada, the UK, and Ireland.\n\nBank of America’s concerns about flatlining market share in the saturated U.S. market may have merit, but Celsius’ international growth strategy offers a renewed pathway for rapid expansion. With these new avenues, Celsius is well-positioned to continue its impressive growth trajectory.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is having a tough year amid lithium spot pricing concerns and a string of analyst downgrades. However, these short-term setbacks shouldn’t deter you from considering this stock for long-term gains. The downgrades were mainly influenced by temporary fluctuations in electric vehicle demand, which overlook Albemarle’s strong long-term potential.\n\nAlbemarle specializes in lithium production, and the future demand for lithium looks exceptionally bright. Projections show that by 2030, lithium demand will exceed supply by 500,000 tons annually. These promising growth prospects suggest that concerns about the viability of lithium producers are overblown and that Albemarle’s recent downturn doesn’t reflect its long-term potential.\n\nAlbemarle’s strategic positioning makes it stand out, especially considering the massive lithium demand sector. By 2025, experts predict China will account for nearly half of the global lithium demand. Albemarle’s refineries are geographically close to Chinese manufacturing facilities, enabling efficient supply chains. This proximity positions Albemarle as a leading lithium producer ready to meet China’s increasing demand for this essential resource, making it an excellent choice for investors looking to capitalize on sustainable and green energy transitions.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Like Dividends? 3 Tech Stocks Worth a Look: AAPL, ASML, AVGO",
        "content": "Tech stocks have been the craze for some time, with their performance recently boosted by the artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy. The sector has jumped into the favorite pick for many, with outsized gains keeping investors happy.\n\nOther than tech stocks, a fair portion of investors also love dividends, as they can provide a nice buffer against drawdowns in other positions and a passive income stream.\n\nIn addition, dividend-paying companies are typically well-established and able to share a portion of their profits with shareholders without experiencing a negative financial impact.\n\nFor those interested in exposure to each, several tech stocks, including ASML ASML, Apple AAPL, and Broadcom AVGO, reward their shareholders with quarterly payouts.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each.\n\nApple Shares Bounce Back\n\nApple shares have bounced back strongly over the last month after a slow start to the year, gaining 17% on favorable news concerning China iPhone shipments and broader AI excitement. Analysts have modestly raised their earnings expectations, helping land the stock a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStrong cash-generating abilities have allowed it to consistently boost its quarterly payout over the years, with Apple recently delivering its 12th consecutive year of higher payouts. Shares yield a modest 0.5% annually, though the company’s 4.9% five-year annualized dividend growth shows a commitment to shareholders.\n\nThe company’s growth profile remains positive, with consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggesting 7.5% EPS growth on 1% higher sales. Peeking ahead to FY25, expectations allude to an additional 12% EPS growth paired with an 8% sales climb. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nASML Keeps Raising Quarterly Payouts\n\nASML shares have been big-time performers in 2024 on the back of the broader semiconductor trade, gaining 43% and seeing performance aided by better-than-expected quarterly results. The stock sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company has long displayed a shareholder-friendly nature, sporting a sizable 30.7% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. Shares currently yield 0.6% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 27% of the company’s earnings.\n\nBelow is a graphic displaying the company’s dividend metrics. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBroadcom Upgrades Sales Outlook\n\nBroadcom shares have similarly benefitted from the semiconductor trade, gaining an impressive 60% YTD and trading near all-time highs. The company’s recent set of quarterly results brought post-earnings fireworks, with record revenue from AI products of $3.1 billion pleasing investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing its latest release, the company raised its current-year sales outlook, with analysts’ revisions also moving accordingly. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLike AAPL, strong cash-generating abilities have allowed it to consistently increase its quarterly payouts, sporting a 14% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. Free cash flow of $5.3 billion throughout its latest period climbed 18% year-over-year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company’s forecasted growth is impossible to ignore, with consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggesting 12% EPS growth on 43% higher sales.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTech stocks have been the craze for some time now, with excitement surrounding AI and a resilient economy providing tailwinds.\n\nAnd for those interested in joining the trade with an appetite for income, all three stocks above – ASML ASML, Apple AAPL, and Broadcom AVGO – fit that criteria nicely.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why stocks may be due for a correction",
        "content": "Markets might feel unstoppable, but it's important not to get complacent.\n\n\"There's definitely some level of froth [in markets],\" Fed Watch Advisors founder Ben Emons told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen here). \"There's a lot of liquidity in the market. You see speculation through these meme stocks — so that's happening.\"\n\nEmons suggests investors use this moment to reduce concentration risk in your portfolio, or take some profits in a stock that has surged this year and as a result is weighted too heavily.\n\nThe S&P 500 hit 35 record closing highs on Monday. From a trailing price-to-earnings (PE) ratio perspective, the S&P 500 is trading at 28 times compared to a historical mean of about 15 times.\n\nThe “Buffett Indicator” as it’s called in Wall Street circles — which takes the Wilshire 5000 Index (viewed as the total stock market) and divides it by the annual U.S. GDP — is now at a record high.\n\nWarren Buffett's favorite indicator stands at about 196.2% — up sharply from 137% or so from September 2022 lows.\n\nThe figure is well above the 159.2% seen just before the dot-com bubble.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of Apple (AAPL) have gained a cool 30% since April, allowing it to take back the mantle as world's most valuable company ($3.55 trillion market cap) from chip beast Nvidia (NVDA) ($3.15 trillion market cap).\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT), Apple, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are all trading at record high valuations. The top 10 companies in the S&P 500 make up 35% of the market cap but only 23% of earnings, according to data from Apollo (the parent company of Yahoo Finance) chief economist Torsten Slok.\n\nSeemingly everywhere one looks, the market is beginning to feel too hot, given the near-term risks such as a contentious presidential election cycle. The outlook for interest rate policy from the Fed also remains uncertain, and corporate earnings are only seen rising by a single-digit percentage in the second quarter.\n\nPros are beginning to line up on the other side of the trade amid those risks, and are calling for a swift and steep pullback.\n\nMorgan Stanley's top strategist Mike Wilson warned this week of a 10% pullback in stocks ahead of the election. Wilson is among the experts on the worried about current stock valuations.\n\nAnd Nvidia's stock caught a rare downgrade to neutral by New Street Research on valuation concerns.\n\nWhile there is no proverbial crystal ball on markets or individual stocks, Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods said on Opening Bid that 10% pullbacks happen once a year on average.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We had a 14% pullback last year,” reminded Woods.\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled, market-focused conversations and chats with the biggest names in business on Opening Bid. Find more episodes on our video hub. Watch on your preferred streaming service. Or listen and subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nIn the below Opening Bid episode, Warren Buffett's son Howard G. Buffett shares some investing tips passed down to him from his father.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 7 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "I just read an article that quoted billionaire hedge fund manager, David Einhorn, as saying value investing was dead. Since I’m writing about the best Warren Buffett stocks, that thought piqued my interest. After all, Buffett is a legendary value investor.\n\nIt turns out that Einhorn’s new religion keeps some principles of value investing. However, he believes that many money managers no longer care about valuation as a primary measure of whether a stock is a buying opportunity.\n\nIt’s hard to argue that point when you look at the stocks that are fogging the mirror of institutional investors. But, if the last five years have shown investors anything it’s that valuation doesn’t matter until it does. Besides, Buffett also considers companies that offer a competitive advantage, have a strong brand with a substantial customer base, and a moat (i.e. a high barrier to entry).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLooked at in that light, it’s never a bad time to look at some of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy. Here are some holdings that look particularly good as the summer heats up.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Company logo seen displayed on smart phone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are many reasons to make Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) the first stock on this list of the best Warren Buffett stocks for July. But the recent weather headlines move to the top of the list. Hurricane Beryl is bearing down on the Caribbean, and it’s not likely to be the only storm to pass that way.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is projecting between 17 and 25 named storms. Not all of them will impact oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, but a forecast like that supports oil prices remaining above $80 a barrel. And all it will take is one bad storm to send oil close to $90 or even $100.\n\nBuffett’s hedge fund Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) has been buying shares since 2019. His buy zone tends to be when the stock goes below $60. It’s not likely to hit that level anytime soon. However, OXY stock is only up about 4% in 2024 and analysts believe that double-digit gains are in its future.\n\nChevron (CVX) CVX stock\n\nSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’re going to make an argument that valuation doesn’t matter, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) would be one of the case studies. Chevron stock has a forward valuation of 11.4x, The company continually beats analysts’ expectations for revenue and earnings despite increasing oil production which is a drag on earnings. And perhaps, most importantly, the last time oil prices were this high CVX stock was trading about $10 higher than its closing price on July 3, 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are still some details to be ironed out concerning the arbitration with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) that will need to be resolved before the Hess (NYSE:HES) merger is complete. Once that’s complete, the company will have much more leverage over oil prices which will be bullish for the stock price.\n\nAnalysts see 17% upside for CVX stock and that doesn’t include the company’s rock-solid dividend. Chevron consistently uses its ample cash flow to support shareholder value, and its dividend which has been growing for 37 consecutive years can be supported with oil prices in the $50 range.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nWith the stock price up 31% in the last three months, you can make a strong case that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due for a healthy pullback. That’s the consensus opinion of analysts.\n\nBut a consensus opinion doesn’t include all analysts. Several analysts have a price target of $250 and even $260 on AAPL stock.\n\nThe primary factor in figuring out the short-term fortunes of Apple will come when the company reports earnings in early August. The company has had a pattern of coming in light on the top line. That’s why all eyes will be on iPhone sales ahead of the next refresh cycle in September.\n\nThat uncertainty makes Apple a tricky trade, but if you’re taking a long position, your decision is pretty simple. If the stock pulls back, it’s a buyable dip. And if the company posts a strong earnings report, you can feel comfortable chasing AAPL stock higher.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is down about 4% as the second half of the year kicks off. This may be a simple rebalancing, or it may be the start of a larger pullback.\n\nInvestors have been concerned about the impact on revenue now that the company’s blockbuster drug, Humira, faces biosimilar competition in the U.S. and Europe. However, with drugs such as Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Vraylar and Elahere, the company is confident that it can make up for any lost revenue from Humira.\n\nNevertheless, AbbVie may be a victim of its own success. The stock’s total return over the last five years has averaged around 35%. And even though the stock continues to outpace the S&P 500, it’s not likely to post that kind of return in 2024.\n\nBut most investors aren’t buying ABBV stock for its growth prospects. They can see a fundamentally sound company that has 52 years of uninterrupted dividend increases. That dividend also currently yields 3.78% making it one of the best dividends that value investors can own.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb (BMY) A Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) sign outside a company facility in New Brunswick, New Jersey.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nBristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) checks off many boxes that investors expect from the best Warren Buffett stocks. The company has a solid balance sheet and a high-yield dividend that has been growing for 16 consecutive years. But when you’re considering investing in biopharmaceutical stocks, it comes down to the pipeline.\n\nLike AbbVie and other companies in this sector, Bristol Myers Squibb is not immune from concerns about patent expirations. That’s one reason that BMY stock is down 21.9% in 2024. However, any concerns should be mitigated by the company’s deep pipeline which is concentrated in the field of oncology. This includes its blockbuster skin cancer drug, Opdivo.\n\nLike many large-cap biopharma stocks, Bristol Myers has been growing through acquisition. That’s the main reason why it posted a sharp earnings loss in the first quarter. That will turn around in the coming quarters. That will be bullish for BMY stock which analysts predict will increase by over 30%.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nBuffett has owned Visa (NYSE:V) stock to the Berkshire portfolio in 2011. His stake is only about 8 million shares which is about where he started. That means he’s done some buying and selling. However, since that time, he’s generated a 405% return on that investment.\n\nWith a dividend yield of just 0.77%, Visa isn’t the most impressive dividend stock you can find. But while Buffett likes the cash that dividends provide, it’s not the primary reason for his interest in Visa.\n\nThat would be the company’s moat. Visa and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) are for all intents and purposes a duopoly when it comes to payment processing. And although fintel companies have attempted to disrupt the industry, Visa has shown that it can adjust and will be a leader in an increasingly cashless world.\n\nSince hitting its all-time high in May 2024, V stock has been in pullback mode. That may be driven by concerns that the consumer is slowing down. Certainly, that could be a concern for traders, but it’s hard to dispute that Visa belongs on any list of the best Warren Buffett stocks.\n\nKroger (KR) A Kroger (KR) logo on a building.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nKroger (NYSE:KR) is a leading regional grocery chain. And if you look at the company’s earnings history, you have a snapshot of the impact of inflation on food prices in the country. However, after peaking at around $61 in early 2022, KR stock was rangebound until March 2024. That’s when $50 became the floor rather than the ceiling for the stock.\n\nIt’s likely to move higher. Analysts are suggesting the stock may move up 14%, but the consensus estimate may be too low.\n\nThe reason is that while food prices may not go much higher, it will take a long time for deflation to set in. Oil prices are likely to rise, and virtually everything you buy in the grocery store is affected by the price of oil. Also, if interest rates move lower, that will likely have an inflationary effect as consumer spending increases.\n\nAnd when you add in a dividend that has a 2.29% yield, you can see why KR stock is an intriguing choice of stocks to buy even if its proposed merger with Albertson’s (NYSE:ACI) is blocked by regulators.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had LONG positions in CVX and AAPL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nChris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWedbush Securities in a fresh note said mega-cap tech stocks have a 15% upside in the second half of 2024, driven by AI. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has been beating the AI drum and thinks the AI “party” is just getting started, wrote that the $4 trillion AI arms race is between major tech players and GPU chips have become the new oil or gold in the tech industry.\n\nIves wrote that he thinks NASDAQ will have another strong second half of the year.\n\n“Tech stocks will be up 15% the rest of 2024 in our view with tech fundamentals set to accelerate as AI use cases materially expand.”\n\nWhile Ives continues to see the major tech stocks leading the AI market, he thinks the AI-led rally can broaden out to tech companies who have strong “installed” bases which can actually use generative AI applications and models.\n\nLast month, while talking to CNBC, Ives said that the tech bull market is going to last for at least two more years. When asked what could be the threat to this bull run, Ives said that China could be a threat amid a possibility of “tech cold war” but he thinks that is a “contained threat.”\n\n“It started off with the semis, but now it’s started to happen is, the demand and the use cases” are expanding to other companies. Ives called the AI boom the “fourth industrial revolution.”\n\nWe picked top AI stocks from Wedbush’s latest note. The firm named some of these stocks as the best picks for the second half of 2024 while called others “oversold” tech stocks. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Best AI Stock for the Second Half of 2024?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nApple is among the top picks of Wedbush’s Dan Ives for the second half of 2024.\n\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\n\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in “denial” about Apple’s AI potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 26X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock’s overvalued, given Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales growth of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was pressured in the quarter as investors fretted over softening demand for smartphones, regulatory action from the US Department of Justice, and the Chinese government mandates restricting iPhone use by government officials. Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to believe the company remains competitively advantaged and benefits from the Apple ecosystem, which has an installed base of over 2 billion devices and over 1 billion paying subscribers. We believe the Apple ecosystem will support a more predictable cash flow stream, which should grow intrinsic value high-single-digits over our investment horizon.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks for the Second Half of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Cathie Wood Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "Cathie Wood was the hottest money manager in the game in 2020. Her Ark Invest family of funds offered investors blistering returns on their money. At one point, she more than doubled their money in a year. She has run hot and cold since.\n\nLast year, she was white hot, but in 2024, the investing guru has cooled off again. All of her funds are trailing both the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 by double-digit percentages.\n\nThat suggests there are many undervalued Cathie Wood stocks to choose from. While she is known for her big, bold bets on stocks that could pay off big time down the road, the three companies below offer some of the best values today. They might be worth a position in your own portfolio at these levels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPayPal Holdings (PYPL) PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayments platform PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) is the first undervalued Cathie Wood stock to consider. The stock is down almost 3% this year and 11% over the last 12 months but possesses several levers it can pull to grow once more.\n\nThe payments space is crowded. Where PayPal once held the field to itself, it now competes against Block (NYSE:SQ), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The latter wants to muscle its way in with more robust offerings. Last month, it introduced Tap to Cash, which allows iPhone users to transfer funds by tapping their devices against other iPhones. It will also let iPhone users access third-party buy now, pay later options when using Apple Pay. It shut down its own Apple Pay Later offering.\n\nYet, PayPal still dominates the market with a 45% share of global online payment processing technologies. That is more than the next 12 largest rivals combined, and its share is even bigger when you add in Venmo and Braintree. Payment volume is also accelerating, up 14% in the first quarter to $404 billion.\n\nPayPal is also launching an ad platform for marketers. While something of a “me too” product as everyone wants to be an ad platform these days, having insight into the spending habits of people using the service should provide a competitive edge.\n\nPYPL stock trades at 14 times next year’s earnings or less than Wall Street’s long-term earnings growth forecasts and 12x the free cash flow (FCF) it generates. It makes PayPal a leading undervalued Cathie Wood stock to buy today.\n\nIncyte (INCY) incy stock\n\nSource: Eyesonmilan / Shutterstock.com\n\nBiotech stock Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) has been on a roller coaster ride but recently landed 8% below where it was a year ago. That is an excellent buy-in price. Its lead hematology drug, Jakafi, continues to grow, generating $572 million in the first quarter. Although that was actually down 1% from a year ago, it was due to a $55 million inventory reduction. The therapy is still on a steady growth path of mid-single-digit gains.\n\nStory continues\n\nIncyte’s second-biggest drug, the dermatology therapy Opzelura, saw sales shoot 51% higher to almost $86 million. It should move even higher, as it launched in Europe. The biotech also completed its acquisition of Escient Pharmaceuticals. It now has a solid portfolio of existing treatments, a pipeline of promising therapies, and new additions like povorcitinib and new oral drug candidates from Escient.\n\nINCY stock trades at a significant discount to Wall Street’s $72 per share one-year price target. Going for just 12 times next year’s earnings, a fraction of its projected earnings growth rate, and 16x FCF, Incyte looks to have tremendous upside.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a stock up 54% this year and 83% of the past year, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) doesn’t present as the typical undervalued Cathie Wood stock. Shares also trade at 27 times estimates and 9 times revenue — hardly the bargain-basement stock you would expect.\n\nHowever, Wall Street expects Meta earnings to grow at double the rate they grew over the past five years as many of the initiatives it put into place gain traction. Meta Platforms’ long-term earnings are expected to expand 30% a year compared to less than 15% over the past five years.\n\nMost notable is Meta’s investments in artificial intelligence. The social media platform increased the budgets for both its operating expenses and capital spending for the rest of the year, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying it is important for Meta to “invest significantly more in the coming years.”\n\nInitially, the market recoiled at Meta’s AI ambitions, remembering the sinkhole for cash its metaverse plans created. But possessing some of the most powerful large language models around, Meta’s Llama-based AI agent is targeting the consumer side of the equation. Most AI models are for commercial purposes, and Meta Platforms’ distinction gives it a competitive leg up.\n\nWith AI proliferation, Meta’s dominant social media presence, and earnings growth potential, META stock seems poised to grow into its current valuation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "35% of the S&amp;P 500 Is Concentrated in the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Here's What That Means for Your Portfolio.",
        "content": "Mega-cap growth stocks continue to dominate the broader market and contribute the bulk of gains in the major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. But the sheer value of some of the largest companies might surprise you.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a term coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe seven industry-leading tech-focused companies: Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nThese seven companies are now so valuable that they make up a combined 35.5% of the S&P 500. Here's what these changing market dynamics mean for the stock market and how to position your portfolio in a way that matches your risk tolerance and helps you achieve your investment objectives. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA double-edged sword\n\nThe S&P 500 is up over 44% since the end of 2022. The primary reason is that the sectors containing Magnificent Seven stocks are outperforming the S&P 500 as a whole, while the other eight sectors are underperforming. ^IXT Chart\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia are in the tech sector. Alphabet and Meta Platforms lead the communications sector. And Amazon and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector.\n\nLarge stocks can move the market when they put up monster gains, especially if you factor in sizable companies that fall outside the Magnificent Seven -- such as Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), which is now valued at more than $800 billion  and is up more than threefold since the end of 2022. MSFT Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are so valuable that they can single-handedly spark a so-called correction in the S&P 500. A correction is a fall of 10% to 20% in a major market index, so an average decline of 28% in the Magnificent Seven would put the S&P 500 in correction territory. That math doesn't even factor in sizable stocks like Broadcom that would likely fall in lockstep with a major sell-off in Nvidia and other tech stocks.\n\nIn this vein, the Magnificent Seven's influence extends beyond their weight in the S&P 500. The group has been driving monster gains in the index during the past 18 months or so, but the larger it becomes, the more vulnerable the market will be to a growth-driven sell-off.\n\nExpectations are high\n\nNo matter your investment time horizon or risk tolerance, it's important to be aware of the S&P 500's composition, especially when it undergoes a significant makeover. The index changes based on the economy's evolution and investor sentiment. In other words, it's a moving target, or benchmark, driven by different themes at different times.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome investors might be nervous about the market's relatively expensive price tag, with the S&P 500's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sitting at almost 29. Even if the market rally is overextended, putting new capital to work -- even at record highs -- has historically been a winning strategy for investors.\n\nThere's also a case to be made that the market deserves to be more expensive. If the S&P 500 grows earnings faster because the weighting of growth stocks increases, then it would stand to reason the P/E ratio should be higher as well.\n\nInvesting is more about where a company is headed than where it is today. And so far, mega-cap growth stocks have mostly delivered on earnings growth. For example, Amazon is still not terribly overvalued despite seeing its stock price more than double during the past 18 months.\n\nA high P/E basically means that investors are willing to pay a higher price for a company relative to its earnings today because they expect earnings to be higher in the future. However, if growth slows and expectations come down, it can lead to a sizable sell-off.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the S&P 500's valuation has become based increasingly on future potential earnings, whereas a few decades ago, the most valuable companies -- consumer staples giants, banks, and oil and gas businesses -- were valued more on their past earnings. Outsize gains could continue if companies deliver the growth that investors expect, but there could also be higher volatility in the market.\n\nBuild a portfolio that's right for you\n\nGiven the expensive valuation of the S&P 500 and its puny 1.3% dividend yield, value- and income-focused investors could consider integrating quality dividend stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into a diversified portfolio.\n\nAs a starting point, Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) trade at discounts to the S&P 500, are both Dividend Kings (with over 50 consecutive years of dividend increases), and both have dividend yields of more than 3%.\n\nThe SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF(NYSEMKT: DIA) mirrors the performance of that index and has a 1.8% yield and a 23.3 P/E -- making it a good option for folks looking to stick with blue chip stocks but through a value lens.\n\nThere are plenty of low-cost Vanguard ETFs that can provide a lifetime of passive income, such as the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF(NYSEMKT: VYM), Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF(NYSEMKT: VDC), and the Vanguard Utilities ETF(NYSEMKT: VPU). Targeting lower-growth, higher-yield sectors can be an effective way to balance a portfolio that is heavily allocated in growth stocks.\n\nAdjusting with the times\n\nAt first glance, the market might look overvalued because the S&P 500 has an inflated P/E ratio. But that's mostly because it is now heavily weighted in surging mega-cap growth stocks.\n\nPlenty of pockets of the market are teeming with quality value and income stocks. Now is the perfect time for investors to conduct a portfolio review and update their watch lists to ensure they hit their passive-income goals while aligning their investments with their risk tolerance.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "content": "Investors looking for opportunities will always be interested in high-potential stocks capable of turning $5K into $50K. Realistically speaking, securing 10x returns is not particularly easy. The most obvious route to do so is through penny stocks. However, penny stocks often produce losses and are too unstable for the majority of investors.\n\nA smarter, safer route is to identify currently strong companies with the potential for rapid fundamental improvements over several years. Stock picks within this grouping are smart choices for investors looking to turn a relatively modest stake of $5,000 into $50,000.\n\nTime will tell whether the stocks discussed below truly yield 10x returns. Investing in these stocks will lead to returns that outperform the market. In other words, these stocks are not simply moonshot rolls of the dice for investors seeking strong returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAltimmune (ALT) Light blue pills on white background. Pharmaceutical industry, medical treatment, presciption drugs concept. Digital 3D render., biotech stocks, big pharma. EVAX stock\n\nSource: Hernan E. Schmidt / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltimmune (NASDAQ:ALT) is a stock to absolutely watch out for following the success of Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) for their weight loss drugs.\n\nThe success of those companies in commercializing weight loss drugs has increased their respective share prices by more than 90% and 70% over the past year. As a result of that success, each firm has the potential to become a $1 trillion enterprise.\n\nThat has investors wondering who the next competitor to their presumed throne is.\n\nEnter Altimmune.\n\nThe firm’s weight loss treatment, Pemviditude, is a legitimate threat for an important reason: It produces similar levels of weight loss while preserving lean muscle mass at rates better than the competition.\n\nWegovy has been associated with a 40% decline in muscle mass as a percentage of weight loss. Pemviditude, on the other hand, is associated with a 21.9% decrease in muscle mass as a percentage of weight loss. Thus, old immune has a legitimate chance to grow very quickly and for investors seeking to replicate recent growth at Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk it may be the best choice.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Electric car backlit by cyan blue neon light next to EV charger with cyan blue light and lightning bolt symbol, all against a black background. ev stocks to buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/JLStock\n\nShares of Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) have risen and fallen on the potential surrounding electric vehicles. Current forecasts suggest Albemarle stock will rise again. The question is more about how much rather than if.\n\nThe forecast suggests that today’s investment should yield 50% returns in the next 12 to 18 months. Those expectations are strongly predicated upon the return of lithium sales as electric vehicle sales surge again.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop-line revenues are expected to return to 2022 levels in 2025. Earnings are also expected to triple in 2025 relative to this year. Projected metrics such as those make it very easy to understand why Albemarle shares could even triple during that period.\n\nYes, Albemarle is hanging on while also being fundamentally stable. It’s a strong, high-potential pick for any contrarian who believes the bearish arguments surrounding electric vehicles have been overdone.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will probably raise a few eyebrows as a stock with 10x potential. After all, it’s currently valued at more than $3 trillion. Only Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are more valuable by that metric.\n\nHowever, investors must look at the company’s potential over the next few years. In doing so, they will understand just how valuable Nvidia’s opportunity is. The point is simple: Nvidia’s growth isn’t expected to slow down anytime soon. It is expected to grow its revenues by over 100% in 2024. Revenues are expected to double again from there by 2027.\n\nBy 2028, the forecasted market value of artificial intelligence is expected to rise to $460 billion.  Nvidia is expected to produce $250 billion in sales during that year. One could reasonably argue that Nvidia is more than half of the entire AI market and will be so for the foreseeable future. Some analysts forecast that Nvidia may be worth $10 trillion by 2030. Growth in share price doesn’t have to be linear, so the transition from $3 trillion to $10 trillion may produce 10X returns.\n\nCloudflare (NET) Close up of Cloudflare logo at the Company's headquarters\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most convincing arguments in favor of the notion that Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) stock can turn $5K into $50K is pure fundamentals.\n\nThe emerging cloud security giant is expected to produce net earnings in 2024 for the first time in its history. Earnings are expected to roughly double by 2026 and then double again by 2028. Earnings are among the best predictors of sustainable growth in a given stock. Cloudflare is moving into that opportunity as you read this. Sales are expected to grow by approximately 30% annually in the upcoming five years.\n\nMeanwhile, Cloudflare boasts phenomenally strong gross profits. The company’s high gross profit levels indicate strong pricing power and an overall strong position relative to its competition.\n\nCloudflare also benefits from increasing demand for cloud security, especially as artificial intelligence grows. Overall, the company and stock are well-positioned for the current era.\n\nSezzle (SEZL) An image of a cellphone surrounded by money and shopping bags, a calendar and shopping cart on the screen; schedule payment\n\nSource: ArtemisDiana/Shutterstock\n\nSezzle (NASDAQ:SEZL) is a relatively unknown fintech stock worth understanding by investors seeking 10x plays. The company specializes in buy now, pay later (BNPL) solutions, and its shares increased in value by 330% in 2024 alone.\n\nWhile sales increased by an impressive 35.5% during the first quarter, income growth prompted the strong growth in Sezzle stock. Net income grew by more than 364% in the first quarter, eclipsing $8 million.\n\nThose strong results prompted the company to be very bullish regarding guidance. The company upped its GAAP net income guidance from $20 million in 2024 to $30 million for the year. The company also updated revenue growth expectations from 20% to 25% over the same period.\n\nIt’s difficult to ignore any company that increases its earnings guidance by 50% in a year. That alone is a reason to consider investing in Sezzle at the moment.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is one of, if not the most popular, language learning apps. The company has successfully gamified language learning and is reaping the benefits. Those benefits are showing up in the company’s financial statements, which are impressive.\n\nQ1 revenues increased by 45%. That growth is impressive in itself, but it’s earnings that investors should consider. Net income reached $27 million during that period, a significant increase over the $2 company’s .6 million net loss a year earlier.\n\nOverall earnings are expected to increase by 366% in 2024. Meanwhile, Duolingo is firmly amid hypergrowth presently. While Duolingo is not cheap relative to the majority of its competitors in the software industry, it’s also nowhere near record high prices. Users continue to flock to the platform, resulting in rapidly improving and strong fundamentals overall for the firm. Investing in Duolingo has inherent volatility, but it still has the potential to be 10X your money.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Smartphone displaying orange Temu logo in a miniature shopping cart against a yellow background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/yanishevska\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) is one of the best growth stories in the Chinese economy, and it has seen its share of troubles lately. PDD stock is the parent of Temu, the fast growing e-commerce retailer Rapidly growing market share at home and abroad.\n\nRevenues grew by 131% during the first quarter for the firm. Those impressive growth rates are one of the primary reasons PDD stock boasts a market cap higher than that of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).\n\nAnalysts expect Temu to continue growing rapidly. They are particularly bullish on PDD because Temu recently introduced the consignment model. That model pushes logistics costs onto merchants, theoretically Improving profitability faster than previously expected. Net income and transactional revenues are both surging at PDD Holdings. Meanwhile, analysts believe that Much of the risk in China has dissipated. Combining all those factors suggests that PDD shares can continue to Surge and potentially turn $1 of investment into $10 over the long term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Amazon vs. Apple",
        "content": "A number of companies' stocks achieved new all-time highs on Friday, July 5, including tech behemoths Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. As a result, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose 1% and 2%, respectively, during a 24-hour period.\n\nThe rally followed news that unemployment had hit its highest level since 2021. Wall Street expects an uptick in unemployment to bring down interest rates, which often promotes growth in the stock market as companies benefit from lower borrowing costs. As a result, now could be an excellent time to expand your position in \"Big Tech\" before it's too late.\n\nAmazon and Apple are two attractive options, profiting from immense brand loyalty from their customers and the cash to expand into budding sectors like artificial intelligence (AI). Let's examine these consumer-favorite companies and determine whether Amazon or Apple is the better stock to buy this month.\n\nAmazon\n\nShares in Amazon have climbed 53% during the past 12 months, rallying due to several quarters of impressive earnings growth and expansion into some of tech's fastest-growing industries. One of the most attractive aspects of its business is its diversification.\n\nThe company has come a long way since starting as an online book retailer 30 years ago. It's vastly expanded its product range to become the biggest name in e-commerce and achieved lucrative positions in cloud computing, video streaming, digital advertising, and now, AI.\n\nAmazon has growth catalysts across tech, potentially making it one of the most reliable long-term investments. For instance, an economic downturn in 2022 hit the company hard, causing steep profit declines in its retail segments.\n\nHowever, Amazon remained profitable during the challenging year, thanks to its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Meanwhile, the company has since pulled off an impressive turnaround in its retail business, proving its ability to navigate market headwinds successfully.\n\nIn the 2024 first quarter, Amazon's revenue rose 13% year over year to $143 billion. Its North American and international divisions posted revenue gains of 12% and 10%, respectively, with AWS sales spiking 17%. Also, Amazon's operating income more than tripled, hitting over $15 billion.\n\nAmazon is on a promising growth trajectory as sales continue to rise and it keeps investing in its business. This makes its stock a compelling option right now.\n\nApple\n\nApple's stock hit a record high this week following a rally. Its share price has increased by 17% since its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) on June 10.\n\nStory continues GOOGL Chart\n\nDeclines in product sales and a delayed start in AI have concerned investors during the past year. This was reflected in a stock that has risen slower this year than many of its peers (as seen in the chart above). However, the WWDC gave a peek into Apple's plan to boost product sales and carve out a lucrative role in AI over the long term.\n\nAt the June conference, Apple unveiled a new AI platform it calls Apple Intelligence, which will bring generative features across its product lineup. However, consumers must upgrade to the company's newer devices to access Apple Intelligence.\n\niPhone users will need a 15 Pro or higher. Meanwhile, only Macs and iPads using Apple's custom-developed Apple Silicon chips can run the new AI tools. The company hopes the new features will compel shoppers to upgrade their devices to access the coming features.\n\nApple revealed in its Q1 2024 earnings report it had more than 2 billion active devices worldwide. The company's reach in the consumer market is vast, and its deep economic moat is driven by a walled garden of products and a reputation for quality. Apple generated $102 billion in free cash flow (what's left of cash flow after capital expenditures), so I wouldn't bet against the company flourishing over the long term.\n\nIs Amazon or Apple the better buy?\n\nAmazon and Apple have become worldwide household names. Both companies can seemingly do no wrong, succeeding in nearly every new market they enter. However, Amazon's quick recovery after macroeconomic headwinds in 2022 and arguably more diverse business model make its stock potentially more reliable and worth considering over Apple. AMZN Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nThis chart shows that Amazon's financial growth has dwarfed Apple's during the past year. The retail giant is enjoying gains in all parts of its business. Meanwhile, many questions remain about whether Apple's AI expansion will, in fact, boost earnings.\n\nIn addition to Amazon's price-to-sales ratio of 3.5, compared to Apple's 9.3, the e-commerce company's stock is the better no-brainer buy this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Cash-Rich Stocks to Steady Your Shaky Portfolio",
        "content": "Amid an overbought market and expectations of prolonged higher interest rates, cash-rich stocks have emerged as prudent investments. These firms generate substantial free cash flows, crucial for managing debt effectively across business cycles.\n\nHolding a substantial amount of cash on a company’s balance sheet allows for flexibility. Whether that’s investing in AI for today or simply having the ability to weather any economic storm that may come, this cash is very valuable for certain investor types.\n\nMany investors are focused on building a stable stream of returns. To do so, it’s important to focus on creating a lasting portfolio of enduring companies rather than seeking quick riches.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese three cash-rich stocks have robust liquidity metrics, including cash-to-debt and quick ratios. So, for those seeking investments with strong balance sheets and growth prospects long-term, here are the companies I think are important to focus on right now.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has remained a top choice for investors who seek innovation. In recent decades, the company has put forward a product line that remains unraveled in terms of consumer discretionary products.\n\nWithin the company’s core ecosystem, which includes the iPhone, iPad and Macs, the company’s services revenue has continued to grow. This high-margin segment of the business is what largely drives the company’s cash flow over time and is what many look to for true underlying growth, particularly when it comes to profitability.\n\nApple’s cash hoard is one of the biggest out there, and it’s why massive investors (such as Warren Buffett, more on him later) continue to hold this stock. The company has used this cash pile to reinvest into its core business and pay dividends to investors, something many investors clearly like to see.\n\nIn recent quarters, this cash has been funneled primarily toward various AI initiatives, which have been crucial for Apple’s sales growth. Recent revenue had peaked and started declining, with annual iPhone updates offering minimal changes. Users, known for delaying upgrades, awaited significant improvements. AI could catalyze revenue growth, marking the most significant iPhone innovation since 5G.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt has been six decades since Warren Buffett bought Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) when it was still a struggling textile company. Buffett closed the operations in 1985 and transformed it into a diversified holding company, now holding hundreds of billions of dollars in assets.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is among the companies Buffett has chosen as portfolio staples. Companies like Apple, a host of insurers, railroads and other industrial and large-cap cash cows litter the investor’s portfolio. These companies spit off cash faster than the company knows what to do with the funds, leading to outperformance over the long term and overall portfolio stability.\n\nSo, it’s unsurprising that Berkshire continues to outperform from an earnings standpoint. In Q1 2024, Berkshire’s revenue reached $89.9 billion and operating profit reached $11.22 billion — surging 39%. Buffett highlighted its operating earnings and strong insurance underwriting and investment income. There are so many factors that make this stock a good long-term investment to hold. Buffett’s hand-picked team stands ready to take the reins when it is time, but for now, investors can rest easy knowing the companies in this portfolio are among the best in the world.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPivoting towards AI from the metaverse, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is now more focused on driving profitability and long-term growth via avenues investors agree with. Yes, the company’s Meta Quest headset is among the company’s core focal points right now. But Meta is now aiming to cater to varied consumer budgets amid economic pressures, potentially with the Quest 3S. That strategy contrasts Apple’s focus on affordability over advanced features in their headset approach.\n\nMeta’s core social media empire continues to drive strong profitability and cash flow. This is a fact many investors clearly aren’t overlooking, with META stock seeing strong performance in recent weeks. The stock now trades near its all-time high, boosted by optimism over the company’s AI investments as well as its user engagement across all its platforms. Analysts noted that AI-driven algorithms were extending user app usage, per Bernstein.\n\nMeta has excelled in messaging but faces doubts about sustained social media earnings growth. That said, analysts remain bullish, citing AI and augmented reality as key long-term drivers for this company. For those looking a decade or two out, Meta remains a top pick I think is deserving of its Buy rating right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Dear ARM Stock Fans: Mark Your Calendar for July 31",
        "content": "Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) has more than tripled in valued since its Sept. 14 initial public offering. It started trading at a market capitalization of $54 billion and today is worth over $182 billion. Shares that originally went for $51 a stub now trade at $181 each. ARM stock is up 141% in 2024 alone.\n\nThe tremendous drive higher in ARM stock is because of the demand frenzy for artificial intelligence, even though the CPU architecture developer only indirectly benefits from the technology.\n\nWhile it is the premier provider of smartphone architecture where it owns an astounding 99% share of the market, increasingly its designs are found in data centers and PCs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn July 31, Arm Holdings will release its fiscal 2025 first quarter earnings. All eyes will be on the results to see the inroads it is making on x86, which is currently the dominant architecture in the space.\n\nLet’s dive in to see what investors might see in the report and whether that means ARM stock will continue its meteoric rise.\n\nA Rising Revenue Tide\n\nArm Holdings doesn’t make semiconductors. Rather, it develops CPU architecture and licenses the intellectual property from it to its customers. Revenue is growing strongly.\n\nPeriod Revenue % Growth Q1 2024 $675 million (2%) Q2 2024 $806 million 28% Q3 2024 $824 million 14% Q4 2024 $928 million 47% Q1 2025 est. $900 million 33%Data source: Arm Holdings SEC filings. Table by author.\n\nYet management’s guidance for the first quarter left the market underwhelmed. It was not the blowout expected and full-year revenue forecasts of $3.95 billion at the midpoint of its range just missed Wall Street’s estimates of $3.99 billion. The stock tumbled 28% afterward.\n\nAlthough the stock regained all the lost ground and then some (ARM stock doubled since then), it suggested the ride higher wouldn’t be smooth.\n\nAnalysts may be missing the bigger picture though. Licensing is the key to Arm Holdings future as it will drive royalty revenue higher in the years ahead.\n\nArm Architecture Everywhere\n\nArm’s architecture is used by chipmakers and technology companies to design their own chips and CPUs.\n\nCustomers like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung can then use the chip in their smartphones or, like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), sell the chip to others. Either way, Arm gets a cut of the sale as a royalty.\n\nAll of Arm’s customers pay both license fees and royalty fees for every chip shipped. So the more products or CPUs its customers sell, the more Arm makes.\n\nArm is seeing greater adoption of its Armv9 architecture, particularly in smartphones, the auto industry and by hyperscalers when building out data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeveloped with security and AI as the primary operating goal, it is already incorporated into every Android phone and most PCs. Currently, the market estimates the AI chips at $30 billion, but it could exceed $100 billion within five years.\n\nArm is widening its lens to take a share in other markets now too. And analysts estimate it is charging a 4% to 5% royalty on the latest Armv9 design, or double what it received for the previous iteration. Barron’s reports it receives $100 for every chip sold.\n\nFuture Revenue and ARM Stock\n\nApple, Samsung and other smartphone makers are incorporating AI into their products. PC makers like Dell (NYSE:DELL) are introducing all new lineups that are rich with AI features. Morgan Stanley analysts say Arm-based CPUs will be embedded in all future computers.\n\nAnd because the Arm architecture is a power-efficient and high-performance technology, it is seeing greater adoption of its Arm Total Access package of IP products, tools and models.\n\nData centers, in particular, are adopting the architecture. The chip’s low power needs are perfect for their high energy consumption. It is leading to more long-term ATA contracts being signed, up 15% in the fourth quarter to $1.18 billion.\n\nArm Holdings has beaten analyst expectations for each of its quarterly reports as a public company. There is every reason to expect it will do so again. Yet ARM stock is not cheap. That may not matter to investors who view the stock as worth the premium paid.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Alipay, China's leading mobile payment service provider, has launched a new tap-and-pay function that it expects will streamline the checkout process for merchants, while offering consumers a simplified experience compatible with both Android handsets and Apple's iPhones.\n\nAnt Group-operated Alipay, which helped popularise the QR code-based scan-and-pay feature in the country, on Monday introduced its Tap! function that enables users to complete payment by tapping their smartphone on a merchant's USB add-on at the cash register. Fintech giant Ant Group is an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding, which owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nThe tap-and-pay service, which is being rolled out in major cities across mainland China, was designed to \"expedite in-store mobile payments\", according to Alipay.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThis initiative by Alipay marks its latest effort to shape the evolution of contactless payments nationwide, years after Samsung Electronics, Google and Apple introduced their own tap-and-pay functions overseas.\n\nAlipay, which helped popularise the QR code-based scan-and-pay feature used by merchants across China, said its new tap-and-pay function was designed to streamline the checkout process in stores. Photo: Shutterstock alt=Alipay, which helped popularise the QR code-based scan-and-pay feature used by merchants across China, said its new tap-and-pay function was designed to streamline the checkout process in stores. Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nSamsung Pay, launched in 2015, lets users make payments via the Samsung Wallet app downloaded on Samsung-produced devices. Google Pay, formerly known as Android Pay in 2015, allows users to make contactless purchases on Android smartphones, tablets and smartwatches.\n\nApple introduced its own contactless payment feature, Tap to Pay on iPhone, in 2022. It allows merchants to securely accept Apple Pay and other contactless payments by using an iPhone and a partner-enabled iOS app.\n\nTap-and-pay functions are supported by Near-Field Communication (NFC) technology, which allows users to make secure transactions and exchange digital content with a tap of a smart device over a distance of 4 centimetres or less.\n\nAlipay, however, said its Tap! function is different from the NFC payment methods of Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay, which function via a so-called card emulation mode. Alipay's tap-and-pay service turns a smartphone into an NFC tag reader, replacing a few steps in a typical QR code-based payment scanning process with a simple tap.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn Alipay sign outside Ant Group's office building in Shanghai. Photo: Bloomberg alt=An Alipay sign outside Ant Group's office building in Shanghai. Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nAlipay's Tap! service is currently available for more than 2,300 brands and merchants in major mainland cities including Shanghai, Chengdu, Wuhan and Hangzhou. Merchants using the service include the 7-Eleven convenience store chain and stores at Jing'an Joy City, a major shopping centre in Shanghai, according to Chinese media reports on Tuesday.\n\nThe USB add-ons for Alipay's Tap! that merchants use can also support traditional scan-and-pay services - including those of WeChat Pay, Meituan Pay and QuickPass - through a built-in camera.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, Alipay recorded 118.2 trillion yuan (US$16.25 trillion) in total transactions, followed by WeChat Pay's 67.8 trillion yuan, according to online database Mpaypass. It said Alipay and WeChat Pay accounted for a combined share of more than 94 per cent in China's mobile payments market during that period.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Intel (INTC)\n\nIntel was the number one trending stock in pre-market trading on Tuesday after Melius Research listed the company as among the top contenders for the AI \"catch-up\" trade in the second half of 2024.\n\nShares climbed more than 6% to a two-month high on Monday and were up by 2.4% in pre-market trading after Melius Research noted that Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Apple (AAPL) and Intel could start catching up with AI winners such as Nvidia (NVDA) in the second half of the year.\n\n\"We are believers in a 'catch-up' trade for some in semis, hardware and even software — those with lower expectations,\" said Melius' analyst Ben Reitzes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSeparately, Mizuho Securities' analyst Jordan Klein noted that there was '\"a clear short cover trade underway” in chipmakers like Intel.\n\nHowever, the analyst noted that no long-only investors like or want to buy Intel, adding that, \"so a true rebound beyond mid $30s is unlikely in my view in coming months.\"\n\nRead more: LIVE: FTSE 100 muted and European markets lower as traders look to Powell speech\n\nThe chipmaker's share price also got a boost due to excitement surrounding upcoming processors that could strengthen the company's position in the AI space and gaming hardware market.\n\nIntel is gearing up to launch a new graphics processing unit (GPU) that is set to be fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM).\n\nChipotle (CMG)\n\nInvestor excitement over the Mexican fast-food chain’s 50-for-1 stock split appears to be fading as the company fell over 5% in Monday’s session and made only shy gains in pre-market trading.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill’s first-ever stock split is one of the largest in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. Before the split, one share of CMG stock cost more than $3,200. Now, investors can buy shares for $59 each.\n\nIn a hit to the share price, Wedbush recently downgraded the stock to \"neutral\" with a new price target of $3,200, while TD Cowen and Baird maintained their positive ratings with targets of $3,600 and $3,500, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nChipotle and other companies have lately been accused of “shrinkflation” — the idea of getting less for the same price.\n\nA study by Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem brought to light substantial inconsistencies in Chipotle’s portion sizes. Fadem’s team ordered the same burrito bowl 75 times from various locations in New York City, revealing significant variation in weights, with some bowls weighing under 15 ounces and others over 21 ounces.\n\nBP (BP.L)\n\nBP expects to book an impairment of up to $2bn (£1.6bn) for the second quarter, and warned that its oil-trading earnings will take a hit of up to $700m from lower refining margins.\n\nIn a trading statement, the oil giant said its second quarter results would show “post-tax adverse reporting items” relating to its ageing refining operations in Germany.\n\n“The second quarter results are expected to include post tax adverse adjusting items relating to asset impairments and associated onerous contract provisions in the range of $1bn to $2bn.\n\n“This includes charges relating to the ongoing review of our Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany,” BP said.\n\nRead more: Top five pensions priorities for the new Labour government\n\nThe company said it anticipates weak refining margins and oil trading performance will weigh on its second-quarter results, due out on 30 July. The hit is estimated between $500m to $700m.\n\nLast week, rival energy giant Shell (SHEL.L) similarly announced that it expects to record a post-tax impairment hit of up to $2bn, mainly linked to its Singapore and Rotterdam plants.\n\nWizz Air (WIZZ.L)\n\nWizz Air expects further delays in deliveries of Airbus (AIR.PA) planes, but the budget carrier remains confident it can increase its capacity over the next few years, its chief executive Jozsef Varadi told Reuters.\n\nJozsef Varadi said the Hungarian carrier insisted the delays will not impact capacity, even as it is already grappling with 45 of its planes being grounded for inspections amid concerns over their Pratt and Whitney engines. Another 35 planes will be grounded next summer.\n\n\"We are making assumptions that Airbus will have delivery delays, but they already have six-month delivery delays,\" he told Reuters. \"The real impact will be fairly limited,\" Varadi added.\n\nThe European plane maker cut its targets last month as it faces ongoing supply disruptions.\n\nVaradi said the airline is still expecting continuous deliveries of about three aircraft a month, with 20% growth in capacity next year and 20% to 25% the following year.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Most top CEOs aren't giving to either Trump or Biden",
        "content": "CEOs are largely keeping their money away from presidential politics in 2024.\n\nThe heads of 98 of America's 100 biggest companies have chosen not to financially support either of the major party's standard-bearers so far, according to a Yahoo Finance analysis of the latest federal campaign finance filings tracking donations through early June.\n\nThese top bosses have personally given only about $88,000 to presidential candidates, and most of that money went to Donald Trump's primary rivals who are no longer in the race.\n\nNot a single one of these executives has given a disclosed donation to Trump — confirming a similar recent analysis by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute.\n\nBut the data also shows a paltry level of support for Joe Biden as well, with just two major CEOs giving to the president, according to the latest data, which runs through the beginning of June.\n\nThose executives are Sarah London of healthcare company Centene (CNC) and Timothy Sweeney of Liberty Mutual Insurance Group. Representatives from Centene and Liberty Mutual didn't respond to requests for comment from Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut these executives aren't avoiding national politics altogether. By a whopping 19 to 1 margin, they are instead putting their dollars behind an array of candidates for Congress.\n\nThe analysis is based on campaign finance filings of the CEOs of America's 100 largest companies by revenue as measured by Fortune. These bosses collectively manage more than 16 million employees and run companies worth nearly $26 trillion.\n\nA decline in CEO engagement in presidential politics\n\nThe trend so far in this election cycle appears to be a continuation of a decline in top CEO engagement in the presidential elections, a trend that has coincided with Donald Trump's appearance on the political scene.\n\nWay back in 2012, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis, a whopping 27 Fortune 100 CEOs gave to Republican nominee Mitt Romney while five gave to then-President Barack Obama.\n\nBy 2020, that figure had dropped to just six CEOs willing to give. Four gave to Biden, with two sending checks to Trump.\n\nThis time around, both Trump and Biden do have their business world backers. Figures like Blackstone (BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman and venture capitalist David Sacks are prominently supporting Trump. Meanwhile, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman is a prominent supporter of Biden.\n\nBut those charged with overseeing the largest companies in the world appear to be staying away, at least financially.\n\nA slim majority of this group — 51 out of the 100 analyzed by Yahoo Finance — are avoiding any personal entanglement with the 2024 race.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey, so far at least, have not made a single penny in disclosed donations to any candidate for president, any congressional race, or any group promoting a specific political issue.\n\nThat group includes some of the biggest names in corporate America, from the CEOs of Apple (AAPL) and Walmart (WMT) to Citigroup (C) and Walt Disney (DIS).\n\nWell-connected Americans of course have a wide variety of ways to engage in the 2024 race that won't show up in government campaign finance data.\n\nCEOs can give to \"dark money\" groups that aren't required to disclose their donors. These CEOs also often give to their company's in-house political action committees, which can then turn around and give money to candidates (although data shows those company committees are less inclined to donate this time around as well.)\n\nCEOs also have the ability to be intricately involved in the political conversation without opening their wallets. Perhaps no top CEO has been as closely involved in the race as Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who constantly weighs in with posts critical of Biden while he reportedly speaks to Trump several times a month.\n\n\"I am not donating money to either candidate for US President,\" Musk said in a recent post. The data shows he has gone further than that. Musk, at least through this spring, appears not to have given a dime to any 2024 federal political candidate.\n\nWhere the CEO money is going\n\nThe middling support for the top of the 2024 ticket contrasts with about $1.7 million headed into the coffers of congressional candidates from these executives so far, according to the analysis.\n\nThe money that these CEOs are giving is highly focused in the race for Congress, where control of both chambers is up in the air and a wide array of industry issues can be impacted by lawmaker actions.\n\nResearch in 2022 from Harvard Business School found approximately 70% of top executives at S&P 500 companies identify as Republicans. As such, the donations so far this election season tend to skew Republican but are far from universal.\n\nModerate Democrats show up often. Sen. Jon Tester is locked in a tight reelection campaign in Montana and is a frequent recipient.\n\nLikewise for Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who left the Democratic party to become an independent and then ultimately decided not to seek reelection in 2024 after a short campaign. President Joe Biden and Former President Donald Trump during a Presidential Debate at CNN Studios in Atlanta on June 27. (Kyle Mazza/Anadolu via Getty Images) (Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nPowerful lawmakers with a direct say over industry concerns also often received donations, whether or not they face contested races.\n\nDemocratic Senator Maria Cantwell received donations from numerous executives, even as she is expected to cruise to reelection in Washington state. Cantwell is the chair of the Senate's influential Commerce Committee.\n\nLikewise for Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. She shows up on numerous executive donation lists as she runs in what is widely expected to be a safe seat for Republicans.\n\nThe CEOs also gave over $350,000 to a variety of issue-specific groups mostly related to the sector where they do business.\n\nOil executives often gave to the American Petroleum Institute, which represents their interests in Washington, as just one example.\n\nNikki Haley, Tim Scott, and Chris Christie also received support from four members of this elite group before Trump defeated them in the primary season.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

It entered the Chinese market in 1992 and also operates a large research and development center in the country.\n\nThe company will provide iPhone 15 models to employees, currently using Android handsets across China, including Hong Kong, the Bloomberg report said.\n\n(Reporting by Priyanka.G in Bengaluru; Editing by Mohammed Safi Shamsi)\n\nView comments",

And, as Yahoo Finance’s Josh Schafer observed, AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) was solely responsible for nearly one-third of the S&P 500’s gains as of late June.\n\nKantrowiz maintained the importance of having a bullish or bearish view of the market and reiterated that Piper Sandler continues to have a bullish view for this year. Previously, the firm's year-end price target for the S&P 500 stood at 5,250. On Monday, the benchmark index closed at 5,572.\n\nHowever, Kantrowiz cited how investors view large caps and smaller-cap stocks differently due to their respective performances. While the S&P 500 managed to reach all-time highs in the second quarter of this year, the average stock saw a decline in value.\n\nInstead of focusing on the S&P 500, Kantrowitz told Yahoo Finance that he recommends clients prioritize \"quality at a reasonable price\" by focusing on companies that outpace their peers in terms of earnings growth but aren’t the most expensive.\n\n\"You kind of have to sacrifice a little bit of growth, perhaps, in quality to find names that aren’t egregiously expensive,” he said. \"We’ve got — in the S&P 500 — 50 names that have beaten the index this year, and it’s not just about all AI or all tech.\"\n\nEarlier this year, multiple strategists raised their targets for the S&P 500 due to the record-breaking rally that had continued to pick up steam. Ultimately, strategists are finding it difficult to keep up, and there may be more that take a similar approach to Piper Sandler and pivot away from monitoring the index.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear to date, the S&P 500 is up nearly 17%.

        "content": "Big Tech's Next Milestone Is The $4 Trillion Market Cap\n\nBig Tech is racing towards a milestone that would have seems impossible only a few decades ago, a market capitalization of $4 trillion.\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) are members of the $3 trillion market cap club, with Google-parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) having only surpassed the $2 trillion milestone.\n\nNvidia could win the $4 trillion race.\n\nWith even more powerful chips on the way, the AI boom could be that powerful to drive Nvidia to $4 trillion valuation. For a moment, Nvidia even became the world’s most valuable company on June 18th. But, Nvidia got dethroned quickly due to concerns over the sustainability of its skyrocketing growth. On the other hand, Microsoft and Apple are ahead in terms of market size. Looking at past numbers, Apple was the first the reach the first three of the trillion valuation milestones. Both Apple and Microsoft are as strong as ever, but Nvidia has an incredible momentum on its side. But, just because it enjoys dominating the market does not mean it should not take seriously the threat of AMD or Intel catching up at some point, although Nvidia does have the resources to defend itself and continue to innovate. Perhaps Nvidia’s biggest protection lies in its expansion of revenue sources as it aims to go beyond chips and build an entire AI ecosystem, ensuring it remains in the center of things as opposed to being only one link in the chain.\n\nNvidia’s Promise Of Blackwell\n\nAt the end of June, Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang spoke at the company’s annual general meeting and pitched the upcoming Blackwell chips as not only the most successful product in Nvidia’s history but also in the entire computer history. Huan proudly spoke of reinventing Nvidia, the computer industry, and consequently, the world. The good part is that at the absolute end, Nvidia still does not have a big rival. But only time will show if the AI hype is enough to propel Nvidia to new heights, refuting doubts of concerned investors.\n\nPutting the the economic promise of AI and the fourth Industrial Revolution aside, there is a lot that is still unknown, the market dynamic is shaped with a lot of uncertainty that is out of even Big Tech’s control, all of which would undoubtedly impact their path to a $4 trillion valuation. In addition, there’s the long-term tech battle to think about in a new AI-shaped era that is in the making.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Valero and DR Horton Are on the Casualty List",
        "content": "Get em while they're cold.\n\nThat's the idea behind my Casualty List, a quarterly compendium of stocks that have recently been knocked down, and that I believe will rise again.\n\nYou'd never guess it from watching the market averages, but about half of all U.S. stocks were down in the past three months. That gives me ample fodder for the Casualty List.\n\nValero\n\nLeading off my second-quarter list is Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE:VLO), a large oil refiner whose stock fell about 8% in April through June.\n\nThe rise of electric cars is denting gasoline demand, and warm winters are reducing the need for heating oil. In addition, refineries in Asia and Latin America are providing more competition for American ones.\n\nI feel that the refiners have been punished too harshly. Valero, for example, still has a 5% after-tax profit margin, and scored a 27% return on stockholders' equity in the past four quarters. Yet the stock sells for less than eight times recent earnings. (The median ratio is about 24.)\n\nAnalysts think earnings will fall this year, and in 2025 and 2026 too. My hunch is that they are too pessimistic.\n\nD.R. Horton\n\nMortgage rates are a monkey wrench in the gears of the homebuilding industry. Lately, it costs close to 7% to finance a home. That's the most in about 20 years, though considerably less than the rates in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nNew home sales this spring were only a little above 600,000 per month. In homebuilding's heyday (October 2002 to May 2006) they were over a million a month. I believe that there is big pent-up demand for houses, and that a boom for homebuilders is likely in 2025 if mortgage rates come down a peg or two.\n\nD.R. Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is the nation's largest homebuilder, selling houses at a variety of price points in 33 states. The stock, down 14% in the second quarter, goes for nine times earnings.\n\nMetallus\n\nMetallus Inc. (NYSE:MTUS), of Canton, Ohio, makes steel and precision steel components. Its profitability is only so-so, but I like its balance sheet. Debt is a mere 3% of stockholders' equity, and the company has almost $12 of cash for every dollar of debt.\n\nThis small stock ($858 million market value) is almost totally neglected by Wall Street. Only three analysts follow it, all from small firms. The stock, down 9% in the second quarter, fetches about 12 times earnings.\n\nBall\n\nBall Corp. (NYSE:BALL), based in Westminster, Colorado, is the world's larger maker of metal cans. It has been consistently profitable and has increased its earnings by an average of about 6% a year over the past decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's not much compared to the big technology stocks that have captured investors' hearts and money in recent year. But Ball's net profit margin is 31%, in the same league as Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) at 36% and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 26%. After dropping 11% in the second quarter, Ball trades for 5 times earnings.\n\nWalgreens Boots\n\nTroubles abound at Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and its stock fell a sickening 43% in the second quarter. The company plans to close up to 25% of its 8,600 stores, and has considered separating the Walgreens chain in America from the Boots chain in Great Britain.\n\nYet for all its woes, Walgreens still earned $3.98 a share in 2023, and analysts predict that earnings will stay north of $3 a share through 2026. Given those estimates, the stock looks to me like a steal at the recent price of $11.26.\n\nThe record\n\nI've been compiling the Casualty list since 2000, and have one-year results for 81 lists. The average one-year return has been 14.69%, versus 11.00% for the Standard and Poor's 500 Total Return Index.\n\nOf the 81 lists, 51 were profitable and 39 beat the index.\n\nBear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn't be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn't predict the future.\n\nMy list from a year ago advanced 24.08%, not quite enough to beat the S&P's total return, which was 26.16%. My best pick from July 2023 was Acuity Brands Inc. (NYSE:AYI), up 49%. My worst was Columbia Sportswear Co. (NASDAQ:COLM), up less than 1%.\n\nI had a modest gain on Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY) and a 39% gain in Valero, which now finds itself on the Casualty List again.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments LLC in Boston, Massachusetts.

        "title": "Is Most-Watched Stock Apple Inc. (AAPL) Worth Betting on Now?",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +15%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 15.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.59 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.5%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.39 indicates a change of +12.1% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $83.75 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.4%. The $386.4 billion and $416.79 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.8% and +7.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $90.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.3%. EPS of $1.53 for the same period compares with $1.52 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.85%. The EPS surprise was +1.32%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Microsoft China\n\nMicrosoft has ordered staff in China to swap their Android devices for iPhones amid mounting security concerns.\n\nThe US technology giant has told thousands of employees in China that they must make the switch by September, becoming the latest company to tighten up protections in the country.\n\nThe move comes as Microsoft attempts to tighten up staff security after a string of cyber security blunders.\n\nChinese state-sponsored hackers were able to access email accounts of government employees and US companies last year after a flaw in its Microsoft Exchange software.\n\nThe company has told employees that Android phones will be blocked from accessing services used to verify their identities and log into work devices, according to Bloomberg.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nApps needed to unlock computers such as its Microsoft Authenticator tool, will only be available on Apple’s App Store in China.\n\nWhile Microsoft does offer the apps on Google’s Play Store for Android phones, the Google store is blocked in China, meaning Android devices must rely on local alternatives from companies such as Huawei and Xiaomi.\n\nMicrosoft has told staff they will be able to pick up iPhones at various offices in China and Hong Kong to replace Android devices such as those made by Huawei and Xiaomi.\n\nMultinationals have introduced increasingly strict protocols for staff when visiting or working in China.\n\nConsultancies Deloitte and KPMG told staff last year to use burner phones when visiting Hong Kong, having already encouraged the practice within China itself.\n\nMicrosoft is attempting to tighten up security worldwide as part of a “Secure Future Initiative” following a series of cyber intrusions.\n\nThe US heavily criticised the company last year for a “cascade of failures” that allowed a Chinese hacking group dubbed “Storm-0558” to access the emails of high-ranking government officials.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple has faced its own struggles in China amid renewed competition from Huawei, which has overcome US microchip sanctions, and a government ban on using foreign devices including iPhones.\n\nMicrosoft has been seeking to move staff working on high-end artificial intelligence software out of China in recent months, as the US and China seek to compete in the technology.\n\nMicrosoft did not respond to a request for comment.",

        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL recently unveiled the title and the first poster and announced the release date of its upcoming big-budget movie based on Formula One. The Brad Pitt-starrer movie has been named F1 and is scheduled to debut in the U.S. theatres on Jun 27, 2025. The global premiere of F1 has been planned for Jun 25, 2025.\n\nApple had onboarded actor Brad Pitt in 2022 and then director Joseph Kosinski for this film based on Formula One racing. The audience received their first sneak peek of the film at the British Grand Prix, leading some experts to speculate that the film's budget could be around $250 million.\n\nF1 will be streamed on Apple TV+ after its theatrical run, contributing to Apple TV+'s rich content library of award-winning movies. Per a report by Self Financial, Apple TV+ has maintained the top position on IMDb with the highest average IMDb rating of 7.01 out of 10 for its content library throughout 2021, 2022 and 2024.\n\nFor the rest of 2024, Apple has a lineup of theatrical releases — Fly Me to the Moon, The Instigators, Blitz and Wolves. Moreover, Wolves will star both George Clooney and Brad Pitt. In 2024, Apple TV+ originals like Palm Royale and Sugar also contributed to Apple TV+’s content pool. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIncreasing Content Pool\n\nA report by Statista shows that Apple TV+ had a market share of 8% in the first quarter of 2024 in the subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) market of the United States. The leaders in this space, Amazon AMZN Prime Video, Netflix NFLX, Max and Disney’s DIS Disney+, had a market share of 22%, 21%, 14% and 11%, respectively.\n\nIn the week of May 27, 2024 to Jun 2, 2024, Neilsen reported that the top streaming programs in the United States were Bridgerton streamed on Netflix and Bluey streamed on Disney+. Moreover, among the top-watched originals were Amazon Prime’s Fallout and Outer Range and Netflix’s Bridgerton, Evil, Dancing for the Devil, Eric and Jurassic World: Chaos Theory.\n\nTo counter its competition, Apple is also expanding in the streaming arena by increasing its content base and improving the quality of its offerings. Alongside TV+ shows, Apple is launching games on Arcade and increasing its footprint globally by launching TV+ in new countries and collaborating with new partners for the Apple Pay feature.\n\nApple TV+ also has the advantage of being a low-priced subscription model and financial support from Apple Inc. that can enable it to capture more audience, given that Apple keeps increasing its content pool.\n\nMoreover, Apple is getting into the sports entertainment space with the Apple Sports app, which is free for its users. With this new sports offering, 2,100 award nominations and 480 award wins for both its TV+ originals and theatrical releases, Apple is poised to be a strong contender in the entertainment space.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough Apple’s entertainment offerings face immense competition from giants, including Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu in the streaming space and Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount and Disney in the theatrical space, Apple has the advantages of a rich content base, free sports content and strong financial support.\n\nIn the previous quarter, i.e., the first quarter of 2024, Apple set an all-time revenue record in the services segment with $23.9 billion, up 14% year over year. Apple’s services segment accounts for subscription-based services like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music and Apple News+.\n\nThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has risen 17.6% in the year-to-date period, marginally surpassing the Zacks Computer Mini-computer industry’s growth of 17.5%.

        "content": "Fortnite maker Epic Games has said it will continue to “fight” Apple over changes the iPhone maker is reportedly asking it to make to its own app store.\n\nEpic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said the ongoing saga over the approval of Epic app store app was “absurd”, after Apple rejected Epic’s marketplace before reversing its decision after the Fortnite maker publicly criticised the decision.\n\nHowever, some reports said Apple’s decision was only temporary, and it would require Epic to make changes in a future update over concerns some of the in-app buttons appeared too similar to the design of Apple’s own store, something it says it does not allow and can confuse users.\n\nThe stand-off between the two companies is the latest episode in a long-running dispute between them centered around Apple’s control of the App Store on the iPhone and iPad, which Epic Games has argued is unfair and anti-competitive. Fortnite maker Epic Games is involved in a stand-off with Apple (Alamy/PA)\n\nNew laws in the EU – the Digital Markets Act (DMA) – have changed the landscape by introducing sweeping new rules designed to stop the biggest tech firms from cornering digital markets and as a result this has forced Apple to allow people in Europe to download iPhone apps from stores not operated by the US tech giant, a move it has long resisted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEpic Games said last week that the initial decision to reject their Epic Games Store app breached the DMA and disputed Apple’s suggestion that its design was too similar to Apple’s.\n\nMr Sweeney said reports of Apple’s approval being only temporary meant the “saga has taken a turn towards the absurd”.\n\nIn a post to X, formerly Twitter, late on Friday night, he said: “Apple is now telling reporters that this approval is temporary and are demanding we change the buttons in the next version – which would make our store less standard and harder to use. We’ll fight this.”\n\nThis was followed by a further statement from Epic Games, confirming they would dispute Apple’s decision.\n\n“Apple has told some press channels that, though they have approved our current EGS (Epic Games Store) iOS App for notarisation, they are still demanding Epic change the user interface in a future version. Epic is disputing this,” the company said.\n\nApple has not commented further on the issue, but last week said it was trying to help Epic Games get its marketplace approved and believed the issue was a small matter which could be easily fixed.",

        "content": "After iPhone Success, Apple Wants To Revive Its 'Make In India' Plans For iPads And AirPod Cases: Report\n\nThis story was first published on the Benzinga India portal.\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is reportedly reconsidering plans to manufacture iPads in India, driven by the government’s initiative to attract more supply chains to the country. The tech giant is also said to be eyeing Pune for producing AirPod cases.\n\nWhat Happened: Apple will likely resume its search for a manufacturing partner in India after its previous attempt to collaborate with China’s BYD for iPad production in the country was stopped short by government restrictions, Moneycontrol said citing sources.\n\nIn addition to ramping up its iPhone manufacturing capabilities, Apple is also making efforts to increase the production of components for AirPod wireless charging cases through Jabil in India. The company reportedly plans to start production of true wireless stereo (TWS) AirPods, in India from early next year.\n\nApple has initiated trial production of components for wireless charging cases in Pune with Jabil and is considering a similar arrangement with Taiwan’s Foxconn. Following quality testing and approval, Jabil plans to scale up commercial production of these parts for AirPods’ wireless charging cases.\n\nIf you’d like to stay ahead of the curve on the Indian stock market, sign up for our Ring The Bell newsletter by clicking here.\n\nThe Indian government is also said to be urging Apple to consider producing laptops and desktops in India in the future. The company has reportedly shared ambitious plans for the Indian market for the next two to three years, including establishing an alternate supply chain in the country.\n\nLast year, Apple redirected its iPad product development efforts to Vietnam in collaboration with BYD, following challenges in securing approvals for establishing iPad manufacturing operations in India.\n\nApple is ramping up local production of its flagship iPhone models in India with Foxconn and Tata Electronics. The goal is to manufacture a significant portion, targeting a quarter of all iPhones in India within the next three to four years.\n\nThis development is expected to boost the local manufacturing ecosystem, create jobs and contribute to the Indian economy. It is likely to also position India as a key player in Apple’s global supply chain strategy.\n\nRead Next: Too Bad For Elon Musk: Ola's Bhavish Aggarwal Says Dropping Investment Plans Will Be Tesla's Loss, Not India's\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nStory continues\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article After iPhone Success, Apple Wants To Revive Its 'Make In India' Plans For iPads And AirPod Cases: Report originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Meet the Stock Generating More Than $1 Billion in Annual Dividend Income for Warren Buffett (Hint: It's Not Apple or Coca-Cola!)",
        "content": "For the better part of the last six decades, Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) billionaire CEO Warren Buffett has been running circles around Wall Street's major stock indexes. Even though the affably named \"Oracle of Omaha\" is just as fallible as any other investor, he's managed to deliver an aggregate return in Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A) that exceeds 4,940,000% since taking the reins in 1965.\n\nExtensive books have been written highlighting the blueprint Buffett and his team have used to pick out top-tier investments for more than a half-century. While you can read about these \"ingredients\" in greater detail, the bare-bones approach for Buffett has always involved focusing on brand-name businesses that offers clear-cut competitive advantages. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nDividend stocks have paved the way to big gains for Berkshire Hathaway\n\nHowever, there are other subtleties that have helped Berkshire Hathaway excel in the return column. One of these attributes, which tends to fly under the radar, is Warren Buffett's love for dividend stocks.\n\nPublicly traded companies that regularly dole out dividends to their shareholders are typically profitable on a recurring basis and have proven their ability to navigate challenging economic conditions. Moreover, income stocks have a lengthy track record of crushing non-payers in the return department.\n\nIn 2023, the investment advisors at Hartford Funds released an extensive report, \"The Power of Dividends: Past, Present, and Future,\" which examined the many ways dividend-paying companies have outperformed for investors. In particular, one data set, calculated in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks averaged an annual return of 9.17% over the last 50 years (1973-2023), and did so while being 6% less volatile than the benchmark S&P 500.\n\nMeanwhile, non-payers generated a more modest 4.27% annualized average return over the same span and were 18% more volatile than the S&P 500.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha understands that mature, dividend-paying businesses are just the type of companies that should increase in value over time. Not surprisingly, Berkshire Hathaway is on track to collect in the neighborhood of $6 billion in dividend income over the next 12 months.\n\nBut not all dividend stocks are created equally. Among the 44-stock, $397 billion investment portfolio Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway, one holding is set to generate more than $1 billion in dividend income by itself over the next year.\n\nMany of Warren Buffett's core holdings are big-time dividend stocks\n\nAnother subtle but key facet of Berkshire Hathaway's ongoing success is its portfolio concentration. Despite holding stakes in 44 stocks, the lion's share of invested assets Buffett and his team oversee are put to work in just a handful of companies. Many of these core holdings are big-time dividend stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, Buffett's company has been holding shares of consumer staples titan Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) since 1988. As you can imagine, a 36-year holding period has left Berkshire with an exceptionally low (and highly favorable) cost basis in Coca-Cola of just $3.2475 per share. Given Coca-Cola's expected forward-year payout of $1.94 per share, Buffett's company is netting a roughly 60% yield on cost, relative to its initial investment of $1.3 billion. In dollars, Berkshire is collecting $776 million annually from its position in Coke.\n\nWhat's made Coca-Cola such a special investment is its geographic diversity and top-tier marketing efforts. With regard to the former, it operates in all but three countries globally (North Korea, Cuba, and Russia). This means it generates predictable operating cash flow in developed/established markets, and can move the organic growth needle by pushing into emerging market regions.\n\nAs for its marketing, Coca-Cola can rely on more than a century of history to connect with its mature consumers. Meanwhile, it leans on digital channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to engage with its younger audience.\n\nTech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is another core holding for Berkshire Hathaway that's generating a boatload of annual dividend income. Although it hasn't raised its base annual payout for 62 consecutive years like Coca-Cola, Apple did recently increase its quarterly dividend by $0.01 per share to $0.25. Apple doling out $1 per share over 12 months will net Berkshire Hathaway north of $789 million in dividend income.\n\nInnovation explains why Apple accounts for 44% ($175 billion) of Berkshire's invested assets. Apple's iPhone has pretty consistently controlled a 50% or greater share of the domestic smartphone market since 5G-capable versions initially hit retail shelves in late 2020. CEO Tim Cook is also overseeing the steady evolution of Apple to a platform's company. A focus on subscription services should provide a boost to the company's operating margin over time. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSay hello to the only stock putting over $1 billion in annual dividend income into Berkshire's coffers\n\nWhile Coca-Cola and Apple are income superstars for Warren Buffett's company, it's money-center behemoth Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) that sits atop the dividend income pecking order.\n\nFollowing the latest round of annual bank stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve, \"BofA,\" as Bank of America is commonly known, announced that it would be increasing its quarterly payout from $0.24 to $0.26 per share. Although a $0.02/share payout bump might not sound like much, it can make a sizable difference for Buffett's company, which holds more than 1 billion shares of BofA stock. A $1.04 per share dividend over the next 12 months from Bank of America will translate into roughly $1.074 billion in annual dividend income for Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nThe secret sauce that often allows bank stocks to dole out mammoth dividends is their cyclical ties.\n\nTo state the obvious, recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic boom-and-bust cycle. However, recessions are historically short-lived, with only three contractions since the end of World War II lasting longer than a year. By comparison, a majority of economic expansions endure for multiple years. These non-linear cycles allow bank stocks like BofA to meaningfully expand their loan portfolios and reap the reward of interest income.\n\nSpeaking of interest income, arguably no large bank has benefited more from the Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy than Bank of America. The steepest rate-hiking cycle in four decades is great news for the most interest-sensitive money-center bank on Wall Street. The longer the nation's central bank stands pat on interest rates, the more net-interest income Bank of America can collect.\n\nAlthough BofA probably isn't the first (or even 10th) name you'd think of when it comes to financial technology and digitization, the company's investments in technology have decisively paid off. Over time, a higher percentage of its consumer households are banking digitally and completing loan sales online or via mobile app. It's considerably cheaper for banks to interact with their customers online or via mobile app as opposed to in-person or over the phone. This digital push is making BofA a more efficient bank.\n\nLastly, Bank of America has a rock-solid leader in Brian Moynihan. In the wake of the Great Recession, BofA was one of America's most-fined financial institutions. Since becoming Bank of America CEO in 2010, Moynihan has predominantly led his company with a conservative, risk-off approach that favors a robust capital-return program.\n\nWhen it comes to dividend income, Bank of America is in a tier of its own within the $397 billion investment portfolio overseen by Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bank of America wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Apple a Buy?",
        "content": "Just when investors thought shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) might have run out of momentum, the company's developer conference, where it unveiled an avalanche of upcoming products and features using artificial intelligence (AI), supercharged the stock and sent it to new highs.\n\nApple is arguably one of the most obvious AI stocks because generative AI perfectly fits the core experience of using iOS products. The million-dollar question is just how much upside remains in the stock for prospective investors today. Is Apple a buy? Here is what you need to know.\n\nAI is a genuine game changer for Apple\n\nIt's fair to say that AI is a big deal for Apple. The company recently unveiled numerous AI features it will build into its software. Some examples include custom emojis, integrating ChatGPT into Siri, and its in-house AI tech, Apple Intelligence. The influx of new technology could dramatically improve the user experience on iOS devices, which Apple was already known for.\n\nAfter years of limited functionality, I cannot wait for a better version of Siri. It doesn't seem like a stretch that others feel the same. A better experience with iOS devices likely means an even stickier Apple ecosystem. In other words, AI seems likely to enhance Apple's core business of selling iOS devices and services rather than harm it.\n\nBut can AI solve Apple's growth woes?\n\nAI's impact on Apple will determine whether it can get sales growth moving in the right direction again. As you can see below, Apple's revenue has peaked and begun declining in recent years. New iterations of the iPhone are released annually, and the year-to-year changes aren't as pronounced as a decade ago. The product has matured. Incremental camera, screen, and processor updates only go so far.\n\nCombine that with Apple's famously good build quality, and users no longer rush to upgrade their phones. An estimated 61% of iPhone owners wait at least two years to upgrade. AAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nGetting more iPhone users to upgrade could revive revenue growth, and AI could be the catalyst. It's not a bold statement to say that AI features are the most significant iPhone breakthrough since the first 5G phone, which sparked Apple's last growth spurt. Naturally, only Apple's newest phones, the iPhone 15 generation, will be compatible with AI. Time will tell if consumers are excited enough to splurge on new devices.\n\nIs Apple a buy?\n\nIf the share price is any indication, Wall Street is confident AI will help Apple grow again. Shares have rocketed to all-time highs since Apple unveiled its AI plans. But here's the problem: The stock now trades at a forward P/E over 33, its highest valuation in recent memory.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors can equate a stock's valuation to expectations. The stock's average P/E for the past decade is just 21. Such a departure from long-term norms is Wall Street saying loud and clear, \"You better deliver the goods!\" AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAI sounds promising, but this is a lot to ask. Even analysts estimate just 10% annual earnings growth over the long term, which doesn't seem near enough to justify Apple's current price. Maybe Apple delivers and then some. It could justify the share price, but what about additional gains for investors who buy today? Or worse, what if AI doesn't impact Apple's business the way people hope and shares head to a lower valuation?\n\nThe reality is that AI hype has priced Apple stock for perfection. There is far more room for shares to go down than up, and even a best-case scenario doesn't seem to offer much to get excited about. Apple customers have a lot to look forward to with AI, but investors are best off staying away until the share price makes a lot more sense than it does now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Amazon: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) hit an all-time high this week after rising 53% over the last 12 months. The company has rallied Wall Street with multiple quarters of stellar financial growth and an expanding role in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmazon Web Services' (AWS) dominance in the cloud industry grants the company a promising position in AI, as more and more businesses turn to such platforms for their AI needs. Meanwhile, the company has announced a venture into chip design. Amazon has an exciting outlook in AI and would likely make an asset to any portfolio over the long term. However, its stock growth over the last year hasn't exactly matched its earnings growth, meaning its shares are slightly overpriced for now. AMZN PE Ratio Chart\n\nThis table shows Amazon has the highest price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow ratios out of some of the most prominent names in AI software. The figures suggest Amazon is currently one of the worst-valued stocks among its peers.\n\nHowever, two companies stand out as bargain buys in the space, indicating they could be worth considering over Amazon: Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). These tech giants are investing heavily in AI and could see significant gains as the industry develops.\n\nSo, forget Amazon and consider buying these two artificial intelligence stocks now.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is a no-brainer at its current price point. The company has delivered significant earnings and stock growth over the last year, yet is trading at a bargain price compared to its peers. Meanwhile, Alphabet has the brand power, tech, and cash reserves to go far in AI.\n\nThe company's Google Cloud platform holds an 11% market share in cloud computing, compared to AWS' 31%. It's the third-largest cloud company after Amazon and Microsoft. However, it's outpacing both in growth.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Google Cloud revenue jumped 28% year over year. Comparatively, the same period saw AWS sales rise by 17% and Microsoft Azure's revenue increase by 21%.\n\nAlphabet is investing billions in AI and is in a solid position to build a lucrative AI ecosystem around its products. As the home of potent brands like Android, YouTube, and the many services under Google, Alphabet has countless opportunities to boost its business with AI. The company has the potential to offer more efficient digital advertising, add generative features to its smartphone operating system, better track viewing trends on YouTube, and create a Google Search experience closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues GOOGL Chart\n\nMoreover, this chart shows Alphabet is a thoroughly reliable stock. Over the last five years, it has beaten Amazon in stock and free cash flow growth. Meanwhile, it has delivered a similar rise in operating income. In addition to its far better-valued share price, Alphabet is a screaming buy right now and a better AI stock than Amazon.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple's stock has risen 14% since Jan. 1. The figure is considerably lower than its peers, with Amazon's and Alphabet's stocks rising more than 30% during that time. Apple missed out on the initial boom in AI, preferring to take a more gradual approach to the market. However, recent developments suggest it could come back strong in the coming years.\n\nBloomberg reported on Jul. 2 that Apple is poised to get an observer role on ChatGPT developer OpenAI's board. The move follows an announcement at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference in June that revealed its smart assistant Siri will receive a major AI overhaul, making it more intuitive and able to answer hundreds of new questions. Siri will now pass off certain questions to ChatGPT as part of the update, making the OpenAI platform available to users through its iPhones, iPads, or Macs.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, \"The board observer role will put Apple on par with Microsoft Corp., OpenAI's biggest backer, and its main AI technology provider.\" Apple has been in steep competition with Microsoft for years, with both leaders in consumer tech and responsible for the two most used computer operating systems. As a result, Apple's seat at OpenAI's table could bring its AI technology more in line with its rival and boost its entire position in the industry. AAPL Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nThis table shows that Apple is potentially better financially equipped than Amazon or Microsoft to expand in AI. The company is a cash cow, with far more free cash flow and operating income over the last five years. So, despite its slower approach to AI, I wouldn't be against it carving out a lucrative position in the sector over the long term.\n\nAlongside its better-valued stock price, Apple is worth considering over Amazon stock this July.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "45% of Warren Buffett's $398 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett led the Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) holding company since 1965. He likes to invest in companies with steady growth, reliable profitability, strong management teams, and shareholder-friendly initiatives like dividend payments and stock buyback programs.\n\nThat strategy is working: Berkshire delivered a 4,384,748% return between 1965 and 2023. That translates to a compound annual gain of 19.8%, which is nearly double the 10.2% annual return of the benchmark S&P 500 index over the same period. In dollar terms, an investment of $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway stock in 1965 would have grown to over $43 million, whereas the same investment in the S&P 500, with dividends reinvested, would be worth just $312,333.\n\nBuffett isn't the type of investor who chases the latest stock market trends, so you won't find him piling into red-hot artificial intelligence (AI) stocks today. But three stocks Berkshire already owns are set to benefit tremendously from AI, and they account for more than 45% of the conglomerate's entire $398.7 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Snowflake: 0.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nSnowflake (NYSE: SNOW) developed its Data Cloud to help businesses aggregate their critical data onto one platform, where it can be analyzed more effectively to extract its maximum value. The service was designed for use by large, complex organizations that work with multiple cloud providers (like Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud), a situation that often leads to the creation of data silos.\n\nThen last year, Snowflake launched its Cortex AI platform, which allows businesses to combine ready-made large language models (LLMs) with their own data to create generative AI applications. Cortex also comes with a suite of AI tools such as Document AI, which allows businesses to extract valuable data from unstructured sources like invoices or contracts, and Snowflake's Copilot virtual assistant, which can be prompted using natural language to provide valuable insights across the Snowflake platform.\n\nIn the company's fiscal 2025 first quarter, which ended April 30, Snowflake's product revenue came in at $789.6 million, a 34% increase from the year-ago period. That's a robust growth rate at face value, but it continued a trend of deceleration from prior quarters. Though Snowflake continues to invest heavily in growth initiatives like marketing and research and development, it is acquiring new customers at a slowing rate, and its existing customers are expanding their spending with it more slowly.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway bought its stake in Snowflake around the time of the data cloud specialist's initial public offering in 2020, so it likely paid around $120 per share. The stock soared to as high as $392 in 2021, but it has since declined by 63% from that level and now trades at $142. Unfortunately, due to the company's slowing growth, the stock still appears to be quite expensive, so this is one Berkshire pick investors might want to avoid (for now).\n\n2. Amazon: 0.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock in 2019, and Buffett has often expressed regret that he didn't spot the opportunity sooner. Amazon was founded as an e-commerce company, but it expanded into cloud computing, streaming, digital advertising, and now, AI.\n\nIts Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division designed its own data center chips which can be up to 50% cheaper for AI developers to use compared to its other infrastructure powered by Nvidia's chips. Plus, the Amazon Bedrock platform offers developers a library of ready-made LLMs from some of the industry's leading start-ups, in addition to a family of LLMs called Titan that Amazon built in-house.\n\nIn essence, AWS wants to become the go-to destination for developers looking to create their own AI applications. Various Wall Street forecasts suggest AI will add anywhere from $7 trillion to $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade, potentially making it Amazon's largest opportunity ever.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway owns a $2 billion stake in Amazon, representing just 0.5% of the conglomerate's stock portfolio. AI could drive substantial growth for the company over the long term, so if Buffett wished that position was larger before, he might be kicking himself for not adding to it sooner after this next chapter unfolds.\n\n3. Apple: 44.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is Berkshire Hathaway's largest position by far. The conglomerate has spent around $38 billion accumulating shares starting in 2016, and its position is now worth $177.6 billion -- even after it sold 13% of its stake (for tax reasons) earlier this year. Apple makes some of the world's most popular devices including the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, and the Mac line of computers.\n\nThe company is entering the world of AI with its new Apple Intelligence software, which will be released alongside the iOS 18 operating system in September. It was developed in partnership with OpenAI, and it's set to transform the user experience for Apple's devices. Its Siri voice assistant will lean on the capabilities of ChatGPT, as will its writing tools like Notes, Mail, and iMessage, to help users rapidly craft content.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, meaning this company could soon become the largest distributor of AI to consumers. The upcoming iPhone 16 could drive a significant upgrade cycle, because it is expected to come with a powerful new chip capable of processing AI workloads on-device.\n\nApple ticks all of Buffett's boxes for a stock pick. It has grown steadily since Berkshire first invested in 2016, it's consistently profitable, it has a resolute leader in CEO Tim Cook, and it returns truckloads of money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. In fact, Apple just announced a new buyback program worth $110 billion -- the largest in the history of corporate America.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Snowflake right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Snowflake wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia will win the race to a $4 trillion market cap—but the long-term big tech battle might be different, experts say",
        "content": "A surprisingly resilient economy and profit-filled AI boom are driving the United States’ big tech giants toward a milestone that would have seemed impossible just a few decades ago. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple have all surpassed the $3 trillion market capitalization mark, and Google and Amazon are following close behind in the $2 trillion range.\n\nCombined, these five tech giants alone are now worth more than $14.5 trillion and make up roughly 32% of the S&P 500. For reference, in 2002, after the dot-com bubble burst, the total market capitalization of every U.S. stock was $11.1 trillion, according to Siblis Research data. Big tech’s performance has been particularly impressive this year, with Nvidia, for example, surging from a $2 trillion market cap to a $3 trillion market cap in under 100 days.\n\nThat begs the question: which tech giant will hit the next big milestone, $4 trillion in market cap, first? Some bears argue that big tech companies’ record run of performance can’t continue forever, given their elevated valuations and the slowing economy, while the bulls believe this is just the beginning of a streak of AI-induced wins for big tech.\n\n“I think, a year from now, we [will] have three $4 trillion market cap companies: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told Fortune.\n\nHe argued that many of his peers on Wall Street continue to underestimate the AI revolution and the health of the U.S. economy. “Unless you have a telescope, you can't find a recession. And the Fed? Their next move is a cut not a hike. So, to me, all signs are bullish,” he said. “It's 9 pm, and the party goes to 4 am…the haters will hate, continuing to say that this is a bubble.”\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\nNvidia\n\nThere are, of course, a wide range of views on where big tech companies are headed, but many experts are convinced that chip giant Nvidia will be the first to reach the $4 trillion market cap mark, driven by the seemingly unending thirst for its AI-enabling hardware.\n\n“The first one to get there is likely to be the godfather of AI Jensen [Huang] and Nvidia, because they’re the only game in town—their GPUs are the new oil or gold in the tech world with no real competition,” Ives said.\n\nNvidia stock has surged roughly 160% year to date and more than 3,000% over the past five years. That’s led some analysts to warn that the tech giant’s valuation has become stretched, and doesn’t account for rising competition in the semiconductor market.\n\nAs David Trainer, founder and CEO of research firm New Constructs, told Fortune’s Shawn Tully last month: “Nvidia’s valuation is ridiculous. It’s facing the same curse as Tesla. But when Tesla got profitable, loads of competitors entered the EV space, cutting margins and slowing sales. The same will happen with Nvidia.”\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Ives noted that even though Nvidia’s shares have surged, its revenues and earnings have followed suit. Nvidia raked in a record $26 billion in revenues and $14.8 billion in net income in the quarter that ended this April. In 2021, during the same quarter, the company had revenues of just $5.8 billion and net income of $1.9 billion.\n\nLouis Navellier, founder and chairman of family office Navellier & Associates, also brushed off the competition argument, claiming Nvidia essentially has a “monopoly” on key AI chips which will lead to consistent sales and earnings growth for years to come. “And, you know, Jensen is kind of like the new Elon, he’s got kind of a cult status,” he said, adding that will continue to drive retail investors in the stock.\n\nNvidia’s market capitalization as of July 5: $3.14 trillion\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft’s booming cloud business and big investment into ChatGPT creator OpenAI have buoyed its shares over the past few years. But it’s the company’s diverse and sustainable revenue streams that will lead it to a $4 trillion market cap, according to Tim Pagliara, founder and chief investment officer of independent wealth management firm CapWealth.\n\nHe said Nvidia may briefly touch the $4 trillion milestone first, due to what he called the current AI “mania,” but Microsoft will be the “more sustainable” $4 trillion company.\n\n“They're embracing AI, but they also have just a tremendous number of things in the pipeline. And I know as a small business owner, we just gladly keep paying them more per user per month for everything from Azure to some of the additional add ons that they have created for security and things like that,” he added, referencing Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing business.\n\nPagliara thinks Microsoft’s big tech rivals have riskier business models as well. Apple is dependent on consumers buying into its new iPhone offerings every few years, and Nvidia is benefiting from a lack of competition in the near term, he said. Meanwhile, Microsoft has multiple avenues for consistent revenue growth from the Azure cloud business and Office 365 to Windows and Linkedin.\n\nMarket cap: $3.48 trillion\n\nApple\n\nWhen it comes to a longer-term outlook, Apple is high on many analysts’ lists because of its potential to use AI to get customers to upgrade their current phones and lure in more iPhone customers. It may not be the first to reach a $4 trillion market cap, but it will get there soon, these bulls say.\n\n“I think over the next two, three years, the largest market cap that we will see is Apple, because they have 2.2 billion iOS devices,” Ives predicted. “Consumer AI is going to go through the walls for Cupertino—they are only in the beginning of an AI-driven supercycle.”\n\nLouis Navellier was also optimistic about Apple’s future, but he said it will need a few “little breakthroughs” to get more customers to buy new iPhones.\n\nHe pointed to new AI tools and the potential for folding iPhones as examples. “I don't know if they're going to announce that in September, but if they do, it will be a $2,500 phone, and it will sell like crazy and send that stock soaring.”\n\nMarket cap: $3.46 trillion\n\nWhat about Alphabet and Amazon?\n\nThe Google parent’s market cap is currently $2.36 trillion, leaving it well shy of the $4 trillion mark. Analysts said Alphabet will be able to capitalize on the AI revolution, but its missteps with hallucinations have left it behind, and its cloud business isn’t performing as well as others. However, the search giant is taking talent from its peers in an attempt to catch up, recent reports have shown.\n\nIt’s a similar story for Amazon, which just recently passed the $2 trillion milestone, and experts expect it will take time for share prices to nearly double. Wedbush’s Ives argued that Amazon’s cloud business, AWS, has also lost out to Microsoft. “​​I think there was some hubris in underestimating what Nadella and Microsoft are doing, and with the crosstown rivals and in that 2-0-6 area code, it's been a bit of a gut punch for Amazon,” he said.\n\nAnd when it comes to AI, Amazon is just “behind the eightball” too, according to the veteran tech analyst. However, Ives noted that CEO Andy Jassy has made changes to the company’s cloud business, and with a massive base of customers, Amazon should benefit more from AI moving forward.\n\nTo be sure, every tech giant on this list also faces risks. Antitrust regulations, cyber attacks, a slowing economy, and a reduction in AI spending should all be considered. But for now, the bulls remain bullish–and they think you should be too.\n\n“The tech bears with their spreadsheets and valuations will stay in hibernation mode,” Ives said. “But when everyone meets for breakfast at 6 am after this AI party. The bulls [will have] won and the bears just sound smart.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple and Tesla Are the Only \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Trailing the S&amp;P 500 So Far This Year. Are They Worth Buying Now?",
        "content": "2023 was dominated by the \"Magnificent Seven,\" which drove the bulk of the S&P 500's total return last year. This year, it's more like the Fab Five.\n\nWhile Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and MetaPlatforms have all continued to outpace the market benchmark through the first half of the year, two members of the group have failed to keep pace. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares are up about 15% this year, trailing the S&P 500's 16% year-to-date return. Shares were down more than 10% at one point this year. Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) stock is still down about 1% for the year despite a recent surge in the share price.\n\nShould investors expect these two market leaders to return to their 2023 form or continue trailing the market? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nApple's finally joining the AI trend\n\nWhile artificial intelligence drove the growth of most of the Magnificent Seven last year, Apple wasn't a big player in the space until recently. It announced its new \"Apple Intelligence\" features at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in early June. The new features include writing assistance, AI image generation and editing, and a much more advanced Siri. Apple also announced a system for integrating third-party large language models and applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT into iOS.\n\nThere are two potential catalysts from these new AI announcements. In the near term, Apple could see an increase in device upgrades. Apple Intelligence will be available only on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max as well as the forthcoming iPhone 16 lineup. The new software features could push more older iPhone users to upgrade their existing devices on a faster cadence.\n\nThe expectations for a strong upgrade cycle may be built into the stock at this point, after it rallied higher following Apple's announcements. Still, there's an opportunity for it to exceed expectations when it launches new iPhones in September.\n\nOver the long run, Apple's showed off the groundwork for running AI applications on iPhone. It could usher in a slew of AI-powered apps and demand for its Private Cloud Compute system for integrating complex queries to third-party services. That could be a boon to its services revenue, but it won't have much impact on the business this year.\n\nApple shares currently trade around 29.8 times forward earnings. While that's higher than the overall S&P 500 valuation, it's on the lower end of valuations among the Magnificent Seven. Apple arguably deserves a premium valuation as it produces tens of billions in free cash flow every quarter, sits on a significant sum of cash, and uses all of that cash to buy back a ton of its shares. That should help it produce strong EPS growth, especially if Apple Intelligence drives strong iPhone sales over the next year and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter a slow start to 2024, Apple looks like a buy now.\n\nTesla needs to prove it's more than a car company\n\nTesla investors have been dealt several blows over the first half of the year as competition and macroeconomic challenges have weighed on Tesla's results.\n\nPricing pressure has been the biggest challenge for Tesla this year. Amid high interest rates and lower-cost competitors, Tesla has pushed price cuts to sell more vehicles. That's weighed on both sales and profit. The company reported its lowest quarterly sales since 2022 in the first quarter, down 8.5% year over year. Its profit shrank 55%.\n\nTesla improved in the second quarter. Sales reached 444,000 vehicles in the quarter, which is down about 5% year over year, but better than analysts were expecting. What's more, it produced just 411,000 vehicles, which suggests lower inventory and better free cash flow. Still, the sales drop probably means the company will report another drop in profits when it releases its second-quarter earnings results.\n\nTesla is aiming to correct course by bringing new affordable vehicles to market sooner than planned next year. The move could spur sales and shore up profit margin. But it's unlikely to play a significant role on the stock this year.\n\nThe biggest event aside from its monthly delivery numbers and quarterly earnings reports is an event in August, detailing Tesla's robotaxi plans. CEO Elon Musk has long promised fully autonomous vehicles and a fleet of robotaxis using its technology. So far, progress has been slower than promised. Several other companies are years ahead in the robotaxi business.\n\nTesla shares currently trade around 93 times forward earnings. That's an earnings multiple that's not even comparable to other car companies. Even if you expect strong delivery growth over the next few years as new affordable cars roll out, that price is hard to justify. Investors are expecting big things from the robotaxi event and the potential for the business going forward. An impressive presentation could send shares higher, but a disappointing outlook could result in more investors selling. At its current valuation, Tesla is too risky to recommend.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Strong cash flows reflect financial stability, allowing companies to pay down debt, pursue growth opportunities, and shell out dividend payments.\n\nThese companies are also better equipped to weather downturns, providing another beneficial advantage for investors from a long-term standpoint.\n\nAnd for those seeking cash-generating machines, three mega-cap giants – Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, and Alphabet GOOGL – all fit the criteria nicely. Let’s take a closer look at how each currently stacks up.\n\nApple Shares Bounce Back\n\nApple shares have jumped back into favor over the last month after a notably slow start to 2024, gaining 15% and widely outperforming relative to the S&P 500. Favorable news concerning its China iPhone shipments has aided performance, with recent commentary surrounding AI also providing tailwinds. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company has long been a cash-generating machine, providing many benefits over the years, including higher dividend payouts. In fact, Apple raised its quarterly payout in its latest quarterly release, reflecting the 12th consecutive year of higher payouts.\n\nShares yield a modest 0.5% annually, though the company’s 4.9% five-year annualized dividend growth helps bridge the gap. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts have positively revised their earnings expectations for the mega-cap giant, landing it into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Though the revisions haven’t been robust, it’s undoubtedly a bullish development for the stock and provides the fuel needed to continue outperformance. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicrosoft Posts Strong Cloud Results\n\nMicrosoft shares have helped lead the market’s charge all year long, up nearly 25% and seeing regular positivity following quarterly results. Analysts have revised their earnings expectations for its current fiscal year consistently over the last year, with the $11.77 per share expected up roughly 9% over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRecent cloud strength has analysts optimistic, with the company expected to benefit nicely from AI. Cloud revenue popped 23% year-over-year throughout its latest period, reflecting a reacceleration and positively shocking investors.\n\nMany had feared a cloud slowdown, which was present for a few periods, but the recent results overall paint positivity moving forward. Like AAPL, strong cash flows have aided its shareholder-friendly nature, with Microsoft sporting a 10% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.\n\nAlphabet Stays in Growth Mode\n\nAlphabet shares have experienced positivity all throughout 2024, up nearly 40%. Like MSFT, the revisions trend for its current fiscal year has been notably positive, with the $7.60 per share expected climbing 14% over the last year.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company positively shocked investors when it announced the initiation of a quarterly dividend back in April. Alphabet’s cash-generating nature allows for future dividend growth, with the company posting $16.8 billion in free cash flow throughout its latest period.\n\nAnd to little surprise, the mega-cap giant remains firmly in growth mode, as consensus expectations suggest a 31% pop in earnings on 14% higher sales in FY24. Growth spills over to FY25, with earnings and revenue forecasted to climb 13% and 12%, respectively. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nCompanies boasting strong cash-generating abilities can be great investments, as they have plenty of cash to fuel growth, pay out dividends, and easily wipe out debt. And as mentioned above, these companies are better equipped to handle an economic downturn, undeniably a positive.\n\nFor those seeking cash-generators, all three companies above – Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, and Alphabet GOOGL – fit the criteria nicely.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Stocks are at record highs. Investors keep playing the hits.",
        "content": "Stocks are trading at record highs, and the market's main characters haven't changed.\n\nYahoo Finance's data whiz Jared Blikre flagged the stocks making new intraday record highs alongside the index on Friday. The names are a who's who of market leaders with only one exception — Nvidia stock (NVDA) was down after receiving a downgrade from New Street Research.\n\nApple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Costco (COST), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Walmart (WMT), on the other hand, all saw their stocks trade at intraday records on Friday.\n\nInvestors can maybe point to the soft jobs report and the prospect of lower interest rates as a catalyst for the move. At least for a chunk of these winners.\n\nTech was the biggest winner of low-interest-rate environments over the last decade, and the so-called hyperscalers in the AI race — Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet among them — are set to be the arms dealers should another speculative investment boom break out.\n\nBut on Wall Street, it appears that spending too much time in this market teasing out the fundamental particularities of why the same group of market leaders continues to lead the market is no longer a worthwhile exercise.\n\nTo wit: Piper Sandler's chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz on Wednesday dropped coverage of the S&P 500, writing that, \"Talking about the S&P 500 to communicate investment insights to institutional investors has become an exercise in futility.\"\n\nThe 10 biggest stocks in the index account for almost 40% of the index's market cap, Kantrowitz noted. And both the index's returns and earnings growth are being driven by this small handful of companies.\n\nRather than reflecting a broad swath of the corporate world's fortunes, then, the so-called benchmark stock index has become captive to the AI trade. For some, this is not a flaw of the index, but a feature, as argued by strategists at the BlackRock Investment Institute last week.\n\nSure, the S&P 500 may seem to tip out of balance, reflecting the fortunes of a privileged few over the more measured progress (or struggles) of the quieter majority. But the concept of an index is that investors can capture the market return in whatever form that takes.\n\nThis dynamic often benefits the DIY investor class looking for cheap exposure to \"the market,\" but it is a thorn in the side of portfolio managers who charge institutions more for their services as they seek to best the returns available to the masses.\n\nSaid another way, what institutional investors seek are returns — preferably returns that beat the market, of course — but most importantly, returns that do not come in whatever form the market takes. For big-money investors, safety is often paramount. And AI hype minting new multi-trillion dollar winners each week doesn't exactly scream safe by this measure.\n\nStory continues\n\nBack in 2020, before the pandemic turned markets upside down, we talked to Tom Lee at Fundstrat who saw the rally in Tesla (TSLA) stock that year as a sign of investors chasing their benchmark. Tesla stock, at the time, was responsible for a large chunk of the gains in the Russell 1000 Growth index (VONG), an index favored as the benchmark by many of Fundstrat's clients at the time.\n\nIn an effort to make up this gap, clients had a simple card to play: buy Tesla.\n\nFriday's market action — and much of what has been seen in stocks since May — seems reminiscent.\n\nBecause if the benchmark index is no longer a useful benchmark, a portfolio manager has a (seemingly) simple choice to make: either buy more of the stocks leading your benchmark, or find another way to explain your performance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Ask five analysts their perspective on a stock like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and you’ll likely find five different answers. Look to the massive gap between Cathie Wood’s $2,600 Tesla price target and Pr Lekander’s $14 per-share pricing prediction for evidence of the wide disparity among analysts, even among popular and well-liked stocks. Analysts aren’t always spot-on with their forecasts or predictions. However, when stocks with negative analyst sentiment overwhelmingly swings toward the bearish side of the spectrum with limited upside presented, investors should pay attention.\n\nSuppose a stock smells rotten, and analysts consistently agree that it stinks. In that case, there’s likely something wrong with it — while contrarian investing has its place, moving against the tide can be devastating.\n\nThese three stocks with negative analyst sentiment have an overwhelmingly bearish consensus and, therefore, aren’t worth buying today.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop (GME) The logo for GameStop Corp (GME) is displayed above a retail storefront entrance.\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt likely isn’t surprising that GameStop (NYSE:GME) tops the list of stocks with negative analyst sentiments. With the overwhelming majority of analysts saying that GameStop is a screaming sell, it seems the only bulls remaining in GameStop’s corner are the legions of bagholders continually drawn in by empty promises of a short squeeze long past overdue.\n\nAnalyst consensus pegs GameStop’s fair value at about $11 per share or more than half of today’s trade price. Meme stock status aside, the reasons are apparent. Quarterly sales for 2024’s first quarter failed to break the $1 billion mark, dropping nearly 30% on a year-over-year basis. GameStop improved its profitability prospects by $18.2 million to hit a net loss of $32.3 million. But, far from operational improvements, the narrower net loss is largely attributable to slashing SG&A expenses — which primarily came from sweeping layoffs.\n\nWedbush analysts are particularly bearish on GameStop, saying that the company has perhaps five years of cash available if current sales trends continue without a rapid turnaround.\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nLike GameStop, it isn’t surprising that Boeing (NYSE:BA) is one of today’s top stocks with negative analyst sentiment. By now, we’re all too familiar with the multitude of aircraft and performance problems that sent shares tumbling 25% since January and keep the stock trading well below pre-pandemic levels. Worse yet, the problems are systemic and not likely correctable within a reasonable timeframe to pull it from the depths of stocks with negative analyst sentiment.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpecifically, Boeing’s problems stem from managerial decisions emphasizing financial tricks and bean counting over mechanical engineering and safety. One reporter summed the situation up succinctly: “Boeing, like many, many publicly traded companies in the country, put a premium on satisfying its shareholders” and that “the results of that at the end of the day were inferior checks and balances inside the company, a culture that promoted short-term profitability over long-term quality.”\n\nIn other words, a lack of foresight and emphasis on long-term sustainability may be the final nail in Boeing’s coffin and a definitive contributor to its status among stocks with negative analyst sentiment.\n\nUdemy (UDMY) An image of the logo for Udemy through a lens.\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nUdemy (NASDAQ:UDMY) once appeared promising given the rise of remote learning platforms, but increased bearish sentiment situates it within the stocks with a negative analyst sentiment camp. In an era overflowing with free educational resources, getting customers to pay for courses they can easily access on platforms like YouTube or find in books is a tough challenge. Although Udemy boasts high-profile corporate clients such as AT&T (NYSE:T), larger companies are increasingly developing their own internal training programs, reducing the need for Udemy’s offerings.\n\nUdemy’s customer retention numbers highlight this misalignment. While the company reported a 12% increase in total customers and a 21% rise in recurring revenue last quarter, a deeper dive into the numbers reveals a troubling trend.\n\nUdemy experienced an 8% decline in net dollar retention, indicating a drop in how long customers stay with the service. More worrying is the 9% drop in large customer net dollar retention, which includes companies with over 1,000 employees. These figures suggest that companies aren’t sticking with Udemy for the long haul once they fulfill their immediate needs.\n\nIn the fiercely competitive EdTech market, Udemy’s difficulty in retaining customers and setting itself apart is a significant concern, making it clear why it’s situated among other stocks with negative analyst sentiment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Masimo (MASI) Fights Politan in a Bid to Retain CEO on Board",
        "content": "Masimo MASI and activist investor Politan Capital Management have been at odds since last year after the latter acquired an 8.4% stake in the former. The activist investor now wants to replace MASI’s CEO, Joe Kiani, with one of its selected persons. It has proposed two candidates for board seats, including Kiani’s, with a proxy vote to be held at MASI’s annual general meeting (AGM) on Jul 25.\n\nPolitan has accused Masimo's leadership of mismanagement and stated that its board lacks independent oversight. MASI, on the other hand, has held Politan responsible for false narratives and released a series of documents in support of the same. It did so in a bid to woo all investors to vote for Kiani.\n\nPolitan already has two members on MASI’s board. A potential removal of Kiani, who is also the founder of Masimo, from the board may have an unfavorable impact on the company’s share price. The company’s top management and employees have voiced their support for Kiani. However, the proxy vote will decide the future of Kiani at the company.\n\nThe Politan Saga\n\nPolitan bought its stake in Masimo in 2023, stating that Masimo’s shares were undervalued and represented an attractive investment opportunity. Politan has been trying to gain control of MASI’s board since then.\n\nThe activist investor has been advocating for change in Masimo’s corporate governance, emphasizing the need for independent oversight and greater accountability on the company’s board. It claims that the company has broken governance and control of the board should help it in enhancing capital allocation and refocusing MASI’s strategy to unlock its full potential. Politan won the last proxy vote held in June last year and successfully placed Michelle Brennan and Quentin Koffey on Masimo’s board.\n\nPolitan has blamed Masimo’s weak share price performance on its acquisition of Sound United, known for its high-end consumer audio brands such as Bowers & Wilkins and Denon, in 2022. Meanwhile, the recent spat between the company and the investors was led by Masimo’s decision to separate its consumer audio and consumer health products businesses. Politan has raised concerns over Kiani’s proper oversight of the deal. This can lead to a spin-off with poor corporate governance and Intellectual Property arrangements.\n\nMasimo Fights Allegations\n\nMasimo has created a webiste, protectmasimosfuture.com, to provide information to its investors about the company’s performance and post documents refuting Politan’s narratives. The company has defended its record and stated that Politan is providing inaccurate and misleading information to its stockholders in order to gain control of MASI’s board.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Masimo’s employees continue to have faith in Kiani for driving its progress over the long run. Recently, nearly 300 engineers signed a letter expressing support for the current CEO publicly in the proxy battle that threatens to oust him. The engineers warned about the prospect of losing Kiani, an engineer himself who founded the company in 1989, in the letter. This may jeopardize Masimo’s prospects. They also stated that they may decide not to continue at Masimo if Kiani is replaced.\n\nApart from the engineers, Masimo’s chief operating officer, Bilal Muhsin, has also voiced his support for Kiani, stating that he may also decide to step down from his current position upon the potential removal of Kiani. Other company executives also signed letters in June 2023 backing Kiani’s leadership.\n\nShare Price Impact\n\nMasimo’s shares have lost 2.6% year to date against the industry’s growth of 3.1%. The S&P 500 Index has increased 16.6% in the same period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, shares of the company have been on a declining trend after touching its all-time high in November 2021. Although Politan invested in Masimo in early 2022, the latter started a bigger battle in 2020 when it sued Apple AAPL, the world’s largest phone maker as well as one of the top companies in terms of market capitalization, over patent infringement related to a blood oxygen sensor. The ongoing litigation with Apple has been a major cause of concern for Masimo’s investors in the past few years.\n\nPer the latest ruling in January 2024 (regarding the ongoing patent dispute litigation), Apple has to stop selling the watches with the oxygen measurement feature while an appeal of the ban plays out. A ban on Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches from Apple in the United States may be beneficial for Masimo’s W1 watches that come with blood oxygen sensors.\n\nThe wearable healthcare devices market represents a robust opportunity. It is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 11% over the next four to five years and reach $69.2 billion by 2028. AAPL will try its best to resolve the litigation and clear its name as it may taint its image. Although a ban on two watch models is unlikely to have any significant impact on the company’s top line or growth potential, it can get murkier for Masimo with smaller product portfolio as well as lesser resources. Meanwhile, the challenges related to board member selection may affect Masimo’s focus with the litigation. The potential ouster of Kiani may also lead to a settlement with Apple rather than a resolution within the court.\n\nMasimo is currently facing challenges, inside as well as outside, from significant players. This is likely to continue to impact the company’s shares unfavorably going forward. If Kiani wins, Masimo is likely to face more pressure from Politan and its fight with Apple. However, in the case of Kiani’s ouster, the company may lose its management and engineers, which may affect its performance.\n\nZacks Rank & Other Key Picks\n\nMASI presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nA couple of other top-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are DaVita DVA and Ecolab ECL.\n\nDaVita, carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 13.6%.

        "content": "Investing.com-- The S&P 500 closed at record highs Friday on bets that Federal Reserve rate rate cuts may soon be on the horizon after the June monthly jobs report pointing to cooling in the labor market.\n\nAt 15:43 ET (19:53 GMT), the S&P 500 gained 0.5% to a record high of 5,566.75 , the NASDAQ Composite climbed 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%, or 68 points.\n\nTreasury yields nosedive after payrolls point to cooling labor market\n\nTreasury yields came under pressure after the monthly jobs report for June showed the economy added 206,000 jobs last month, down from 218,000 in May, but the solid headline payrolls number was accompanied by \"sizeable downward revisions,\" Macquarie said, as jobs gains for the May and April were revised lower. Adding to signs of cooling labor market the the unemployment rate rose to 4.1%, from 4.0% in May, average hourly wage growth slowed, strengthening the case for a September rate cut.\n\n\"While for now our base case for a first cut remains December, it has become increasingly likely that one may occur earlier than this, with a reduction at the September meeting a strong possibility,\" Macquarie added.\n\nTraders now see a 70% of a rate cut in September, down from 60% in the prior week, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Too.\n\nThis cooling in the jobs market through June also comes after a series of weaker-than-expected labor market readings this week.\n\nMeta hits all time highs as tech adds to gians; Nvidia stumbles on downgrade, Tesla in China win\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) led the rise in big tech as the social media company soared more than 4% to hit record highs earlier in the day, with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also higher.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), down 2%, failed to partake in the broader market rally after New Street Research downgraded the stock to hold from buy, citing concerns about valuations.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock added 2% on reports that several state-owned firms in China's financial hub of Shanghai have recently purchased the EV manufacturer's best-selling Model Y as service cars after Tesla cars reportedly were added to the list Chinese local government purchase list.\n\nMacy's in fresh deal fever; Chinese EV stocks hit by new EU tarrifs\n\nMacy’s (NYSE:M) stock rose over 9% after the Wall Street Journal reported that Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management have raised their bid to buy the department store chain for about $6.9 billion.\n\nChinese EV stocks including Li Auto Inc (NASDAQ:LI), Nio Inc Class A ADR (NYSE:NIO) and Xpeng Inc (NYSE:XPEV) were sharplly lower after the European Union proposed increased tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China commended on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrypto stocks recover ground as Bitcoin pares some losses amid Mt.

        "title": "Epic Games accuses Apple of impeding efforts to launch own app store in Europe",
        "content": "Fortnite maker Epic Games has accused Apple of blocking its efforts to set up its own app store for iPhone and iPad users in Europe.\n\nEpic said Apple had twice blocked its submission of plans for an Epic Games Store, which would allow users in Europe to download apps to their Apple devices outside of Apple’s own App Store for the first time.\n\nIn a statement posted to X, Epic accused Apple of twice rejecting the gaming firm’s submissions over concerns its design was “too similar” to Apple’s own App Store.\n\nEpic said Apple’s actions were a breach of the EU’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) – a sweeping set of rules designed to stop big tech companies from cornering digital markets, which have forced Apple to allow people in Europe to download iPhone apps from stores not operated by the US tech giant – a move it has long resisted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“Apple has rejected our Epic Games Store notarisation submission twice now, claiming the design and position of Epic’s ‘Install’ button is too similar to Apple’s ‘Get’ button and that our ‘In-app purchases’ label is too similar to the App Store’s ‘In-App Purchases’ label,” the company said.\n\n“We are using the same ‘Install’ and ‘In-app purchases’ naming conventions that are used across popular app stores on multiple platforms, and are following standard conventions for buttons in iOS apps.\n\n“We’re just trying to build a store that mobile users can easily understand, and the disclosure of in-app purchases is a regulatory best practice followed by all stores nowadays.”\n\nIt is a fresh escalation in a long-running, high-stakes battle between the two companies. Epic has spent years fighting Apple’s exclusive control over the distribution of iPhone apps.\n\nEpic’s most famous game, Fortnite, disappeared from the App Store in 2020 during a row over developer payments and commissions, and the hugely popular battle royale game is still to return to Apple’s platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Epic said it was ready to bring the game back to Apple’s iOS platform in Europe in the coming months.\n\n“Apple’s rejection is arbitrary, obstructive, and in violation of the DMA, and we’ve shared our concerns with the European Commission,” Epic said in its statement.\n\n“Barring further roadblocks from Apple, we remain ready to launch in the Epic Games Store and Fortnite on iOS in the EU in the next couple of months.”\n\nIn response, Apple said it was trying to help Epic Games get its app marketplace approved and live, and confirmed the Fortnite app had already been approved.\n\nThe iPhone maker said Epic had previously agreed to not make their own app store appear too similar to the Apple App Store and this has been the case, with the exception of the download button design.\n\nHowever, Apple said it believes it to be a small matter which can be easily fixed and said it was hopeful that with the issue resolved, Epic’s marketplace can go live.",

        "title": "Why the S&amp;P 500 is poised to rocket 100% in 5 years",
        "content": "The bull run in stocks may have further room for a stampede.\n\n\"We are in the early innings of a bull market where the earnings recovery story has barely begun,\" Bradesco BBI's head of equity strategy Ben Laidler told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in here).\n\nLaidler, whose resume includes stints at HSBC and JP Morgan, thinks there's a likelihood of two interest rate cuts this year from the Fed — which should fuel further investor excitement beyond expected strong earnings growth.\n\nThose factors could help lift stocks at least 100% over five years, contends Laidler.\n\n\"Earnings might easily compound at 15% a year if the economy keeps chugging along and you get a little bit of multiple expansion, which I think lower interest rates would justify,” he said.\n\nThe current bull market for stocks is seen as starting in October 2022, when the S&P 500 reached its most recent low. Since then, the index has gained a sizzling 55%.\n\nThe gains have been powered by enthusiasm around AI, powering names such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) to record highs.\n\nThis year the momentum has carried the Dow Jones Industrial average beyond 40,000, and the S&P 500 beyond 5,000.\n\nThe S&P 500 has managed to tack on a 15.3% increase in the first half of 2024. This is the 16th strongest start to a year since 1950, according to data from Truist chief markets strategist Keith Lerner. The S&P 500 has now risen in seven of the past eight months.\n\nPart of Laidler's thesis will be put to the test this coming earnings season, which begins with results out of banks such as JP Morgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).\n\nFactSet pegs second quarter earnings growth for S&P 500 companies at 8.8%. If achieved, it will mark the highest year over year growth rate since the first quarter of 2022. It will also represent the fourth consecutive quarter of year over year earnings growth for the index.\n\nDouble-digit percentage earnings growth is expected in the communications services (18.5%) and information technology (16.1%) sectors.\n\n“We are in a very fundamentally supported market. Earnings are recovering, and rate cuts are coming,” added Laidler.\n\nThe outlook for AI stocks still looks strong despite big-time gains, Goldman Sachs portfolio manager Brook Dane said on Opening Bid.

Much of the credit goes to its newly announced AI initiatives.\n\nThe iPhone maker announced its much-awaited generative AI initiative called “Apple Intelligence” at its WWDC conference in Cupertino, CA, in mid-June. Apple Intelligence is positioned as a distinctive offering that understands users and their data (read: Bet on \"Apple Intelligence\" With These ETFs).\n\nUpdates to its iPhone and Mac operating systems will now allow access to ChatGPT through a partnership with developer OpenAI. ChatGPT can also be used to boost other tools, including text and content generation.\n\nApple Intelligence will be deeply integrated across the company's hardware and software products. It will be available for the iPhone 15 Pro, iPads and Macs running Apple's M1 series chips and newer models starting this fall.\n\nPrivacy-Focused Cloud Services\n\nApple has developed a new cloud service called Private Cloud Compute to ensure user privacy. This service uses Apple Silicon with built-in privacy capabilities, determining if a request can be processed on-device or needs cloud access. Apple assures that no user information will be stored in the cloud.\n\nComparison With Competitors\n\nWall Street had long awaited Apple’s entry into generative AI, following Microsoft’s MSFT OpenAI-powered Bing chatbot (Copilot) and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Bard chatbot, now named Gemini. Meta META has also integrated AI into its platforms through recommendation software and the Meta AI chatbot. Amazon AMZN has also been very much in the AI race.\n\nBroker Rating\n\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.68 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 30 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.82 a month ago based on 30 recommendations.\n\nOf the 30 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 63.33% and 10% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 56.67%, while Buy represented 10%.\n\nHow to Play With ETFs?\n\nSince there still are uncertainties related to the success of Apple’s upcoming AI rollout, it is better to track the company with the ETF approach. The basket approach minimizes the company-specific concentration risks. Apple-heavy ETFs include the likes of Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, iShares Global Tech ETF IXN and iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Reuters) - \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games said on Friday Apple was impeding its attempts to set up a games store on iPhones and iPads in Europe, the latest escalation in a bitter feud over the technology giant's control of the iOS app ecosystem.\n\nApple has twice rejected documents it submitted to launch the Epic Games Store because the design of certain buttons and labels was similar to those used by its App Store, the video-game publisher said.\n\n\"We are using the same \"Install\" and \"In-app purchases\" naming conventions that are used across popular app stores on multiple platforms, and are following standard conventions for buttons in iOS apps,\" Epic said in a series of posts on X.\n\n\"Apple's rejection is arbitrary, obstructive, and in violation of the DMA (Digital Markets Act), and we've shared our concerns with the European Commission,\" it said.\n\nUnder pressure from European regulators, Apple had in March cleared the way for Epic to put its own game store on iOS devices in Europe.\n\nApple and the European Commission did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik and Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Arun Koyyur)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Must-Own Blue-Chip Stocks for Long-Term Wealth Building",
        "content": "Everyone’s definition of blue-chip stocks is different.\n\n“Blue-chip stocks are the shares of well-established, financially stable and profitable companies that are referred to as having ‘blue-chip’ status,” states CMC Markets’ website.\n\nWealthsimple, a Canadian online financial products provider, has a similar but more punchy definition.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n“Blue chip stocks are stocks from a company that has a long-standing reputation of quality, reliability and the ability to operate profitably over many years. These companies tend to be household names,” Wealthsimple contributor Veneta Lusk wrote.\n\nI think you get the idea. If you’re not new to investing, I apologize for covering the basics; we all learned this term early on in our investing journeys. It’s an important one.\n\nTo come up with three names, I borrowed the holdings from the Fidelity Series Blue Chip Growth Fund (NASDAQ:FSBDX) to find my candidates. It’s up 31% year-to-date.\n\nHere are the three names that come to mind when I think of blue-chip stocks.\n\nTJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.\n\nSource: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com\n\nTJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is the largest of FSBDX’s three holdings by weight at 0.468%. Although the off-price retailer isn’t 100 years old, it does date back to 1976. Ben Cammarata opened the first two of many TJ Maxx stores in Massachusetts for Zayre. Cammerata served as CEO until 2000.\n\nI was in my local Winners store this past weekend — TJX acquired the Canadian version of TJ Maxx in 1990 — it was so busy. I just had to include it on my list of blue-chip stocks. Over the past five years, TJX stock has gained 103%.\n\nIn May, it reported Q1 2025 results, including a 3% increase in same-store sales and a 22% jump in earnings per share to $0.93.\n\n“We saw comp sales growth at every division entirely driven by customer transactions, which underscores the strength of our value proposition. This also gives us confidence in our ability to gain market share across all of our geographies,” stated CEO Ernie Herrman.\n\nTJX Canada, which is Winners, Homesense and Marshalls, had a 4% increase in same-store sales during the quarter, up from 1% in Q1 2024.\n\nIf you’re a fan of share repurchases, it plans to repurchase $2.25 billion in fiscal 2025 at the midpoint of its guidance.\n\nIt’s a blue-chip winner.\n\nHershey (HSY) Hershey's milk chocolate pieces on a white plate on top of a wooden table\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/VG Foto\n\nHershey (NYSE:HSY) represents just 0.036% of FSBDX’s portfolio. However, its history of surviving and thriving over 130 years, makes it a blue chip in my mind.\n\nAlthough the company is best known for its Hershey’s and Cadbury chocolate bars, one of my favorite brands is Good and Plenty, the licorice candy with two colors — pink and white. Hershey’s acquired the brand in 1996. Its history dates back to 1893.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, even though it’s the chocolates and candy that most people recognize, through acquisitions and organic growth in recent years, its snacks business has become a bigger deal at the company. With brands like Skinny Pop Popcorn and Dot’s Homestyle Snacks, it is looking to grow this part of the business.\n\nHershey operates three segments: North America Confectionery for chocolates and candy, North America Salty Snacks for products like the two brands mentioned above and International for everything it makes outside North America.\n\nIn the first quarter, the North America Salty Snacks sector generated $275.1 million in revenue, approximately 8% of its overall sales. Five years ago, the segment didn’t exist.\n\nBy investing in HSY stock, you’re getting patient capital, and are part of a very good endeavor. The company is controlled by the Hershey Trust Company, trustee of the Milton Hershey School Trust, which funds the Milton Hershey School.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Berkshire Hathaway stock\n\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is the smallest of three holdings with a weight of 0.028% — Class B shares. The company was an early investment of Buffett Partnership, Warren Buffett’s limited partnership. He started the partnership in 1956, first buying shares in the textile manufacturer in December 1962 and taking control in May 1965. By 1985, Buffett had closed the textile business.\n\nToday, it’s one of the best investments a patient investor can own. Part mutual fund, part private equity firm and part insurance company, it charges no fees to own a slice of a holding company with $1.07 trillion in assets as of March 31. That includes nearly $400 million in equity securities in some of America’s largest and most blue-chip companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).\n\nThey often talk about banks too big to fail. Berkshire Hathaway should be in this discussion. Its holdings are beyond diversified.\n\nThere’s not much to say about Berkshire Hathaway other than it’s an excellent company built to live on beyond Buffett’s passing.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett took a cue from a classic Western film last year when he expanded on the idea of the FAANG stocks, dubbing his new set of the most important companies on Wall Street the \"Magnificent Seven.\" These commanding megacaps are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAll of them remain dominant forces in today's market -- other than Tesla, which is struggling with slowing EV sales. Two of them in particular look like top-tier buys preparing to crush the market right now: Alphabet and Meta Platforms.\n\nGenerative AI is a new tool for each company\n\nWhile both Alphabet and Meta are involved in artificial intelligence (AI), their businesses are far more diverse than that. AI may grab headlines, but the bigger business for both companies is the advertisements they serve up along with the content and search results their users are after.\n\nIn Q1, 77% of Alphabet's revenue came from advertising-related sources. For Meta, an incredible 98% came from ad revenue. This makes the advertising market a key factor in both stocks' investment cases.\n\nFurthermore, each is developing AI technologies to stay at the top of their game. In both cases, that means using generative AI models they have developed in-house to aid advertisers. For example, advertisers on Meta can use its tools to create multiple iterations of the same ad nearly instantly, which allows them to tailor their ads to their viewers. Alphabet offers tools that help advertisers quickly create campaigns that meet all of its internal guidelines. These examples show how each company is trying to stay ahead of its rivals by integrating new AI technologies as quickly as possible.\n\nThese innovations may (or may not) bring any new revenue, as the AI upgrades are essentially required for them to stay at the top of their respective industries. However, each company is doing so well right now that new revenue from new technologies isn't necessarily required for them to excel.\n\nGrowth for each business is strong\n\nIn Q1, Alphabet's ad revenue rose 13% to $61.7 billion. In particular, YouTube excelled, with revenue rising 21% to $8.1 billion. While most of Alphabet's advertising empire is fairly mature, YouTube is still growing quickly. Still, 13% growth companywide is impressive, considering the maturity of the business.\n\nMeta's growth put Alphabet's to shame. In Q1, its ad revenue grew 27% to $35.6 billion. And its revenue increased at a healthy pace in all of its regions worldwide.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese strong results aren't outliers, either. Wall Street analysts project Alphabet's revenue will rise 13% this year and 11% next year. For Meta, Wall Street expects 18% and 13% growth. Both of these are strong projections (considering the companies' size) and are great reasons to invest.\n\nHowever, the last point is just icing on the cake.\n\nYou don't have to pay a fortune to own either stock\n\nWhen you look at the rest of the Magnificent Seven  -- Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla -- every one of them is expensive from a valuation standpoint. Measured by their forward price-to-earnings ratios (which consider earnings projections over the next 12 months), none trades lower than 30.\n\nThat's a historically expensive price to pay, which should give investors pause. However, Alphabet and Meta don't command premiums quite that high. META PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt 24 and 25 times forward earnings, both still command slight premiums to the broader market's average of 22.3 (using the S&P 500 as a benchmark). However, their execution and market dominance justify those slight premiums.\n\nWith both companies excelling, projected to grow at respectable paces, and trading at reasonable valuations, they easily top my list as the best stocks to buy in the Magnificent Seven now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $786,046!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Loves Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) Because of the Apple (AAPL) Factor",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Recommendations. Since Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) ranks 7th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program talked about the concept of “suitability” of stocks in investing, which emphasizes the importance of picking individual stocks based on your personal context, circumstances and life goals instead of short-term market movements. Cramer recalled his days at the Harvard Law School and how he used to run to the library to read research reports on companies to dig out information on quality stocks on a week-to-week basis. When Cramer joined Goldman Sachs, an “executive” at the firm introduced him to the concept of suitability, advising him never to recommend stocks to people without knowing what they want out of investing. According to Cramer, that “best semiconductor stock” might not be good for all individuals and therefore it’s necessary to know the “tolerance” and risk appetite of investors.\n\nAnswering a question during the program, Cramer said technical analysis, including paying attention to RSI values, is “incredibly” important to him and he does not like to buy stocks if “their chart is bad.”\n\nFor this program we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he talked about recently. These include stocks he’s bullish on as well as the ones he recommends selling. We have analyzed each stock in detail to see its fundamentals and know what the Wall Street believes about it. We have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment with each company. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) One of the Jim Cramer’s Top 10 Recommendations?\n\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 31\n\nA caller recently asked Jim Cramer whether he should hold on to Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS). Cramer said “yes.”\n\n“Actually I’d buy them.”\n\nCramer said Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) CEO Liam Griffin is “terrific” and the stock could have a “big move” amid orders from Apple.\n\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) makes analog and mixed-signal chips for Apple’s iPhones. Apple accounts for about 65% of the company’s revenue. Wall Street is also bullish on Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) because of the Apple factor. Last month B. Riley increased its price target on Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) to $130 from $96 and said the stock has upside because Apple is a major customer of the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) shares fell after the company gave weaker guidance in April driven by soft mobile revenue. Piper Sandler analysts Harsh Kumar and Robert Aguanno said in a note that these mobile headwinds are “short term in nature.”\n\nCowen analyst Matthew Ramsey  downgraded Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) to Hold from Buy and also cut its price target to $90 from $125.\n\n“We remain encouraged at Skyworks’ efforts to strategically position the business following a difficult recent macro environment, yet see an approximately 10% socket loss that may or may not be temporary as too much to overcome.”\n\nSkyworks Solutions’s (NASDAQ:SWKS) forward P/E is 17.07, lower than the sector median of 24.\n\nOverall, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) ranks 7th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer’s Latest Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Recommendations. While we acknowledge the potential of Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Nasdaq Underdogs: 3 Beaten-Down Stocks Primed for a July Comeback",
        "content": "As hot as the S&P 500 has been, the Nasdaq 100 is performing even better. The tech-heavy index is up 19% year-to-date (YTD) and 83% higher since the beginning of 2023. It routinely hits new record highs.\n\nIn such a frothy market it is not easy to find undervalued Nasdaq stocks. But they exist. Even when things get overheated, conditions aren’t always evenly distributed opening up opportunities for investors to profit.\n\nWith analysts expecting the job market to slow, unemployment to stay steady and wage gains to ease, the chance for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts grows. That could send the stock market soaring further and help boost undervalued Nasdaq stocks that have been waiting for their moment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe three stocks below are companies investors may want to buy in anticipation of that next leg up.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) A zoomed in image of a large concrete structure with a blue sign on it that reads \"Qualcomm Stadium\" with a clear blue sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMobile handset chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) hasn’t exactly been a laggard. Shares are up 39% in 2024 and are 68% higher over the past 12 months. Despite those gains, QCOM stock is still an undervalued Nasdaq stock with potential.\n\nHaving immersed itself in artificial intelligence (AI), Qualcomm is now a significant player in the space. Its Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 chip supports on-device generative AI and can run large language models (LLM) of up to 10 billion parameters. That includes LLMs from the likes of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Llama 2 and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Gemini Nano from Google.\n\nThe chip is firmly embedded in Samsung phones and the next iteration of the chipset may be exclusive to Samsung’s Galaxy S25 smartphone. Analysts also anticipate a significant price boost, which will flow through Qualcomm’s income statement.\n\nAt 18 times next year’s earnings and the free cash flow (FCF) Qualcomm produces, it remains comparatively cheap. It might not be the bargain it was a year ago, but Qualcomm stock could be a welcome addition to your portfolio.\n\nCharter Communications (CHTR) The Charter Communications (CHTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nCable and telecom provider Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) is the second undervalued Nasdaq stock to consider. Unlike Qualcomm, its stock is down 22% YTD and 18% over the past year. It is pressured by the winding down of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) that ended on June 1.\n\nThe federal program made broadband more affordable for households by providing a $30 subsidy to lower costs. Charter Communications was the primary beneficiary of the program as some 5 million customers, or 16% of CHTR’s total, received a subsidy. As a result of the program’s end, the company is guiding towards weak customer growth numbers for the rest of the year though its EBITDA will expand this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile revenue grew incrementally in the first quarter to $13.7 billion despite a 38% increase in residential mobile service revenue, CHTR showed surprisingly robust profits of $1.1 billion, up from $1 billion last year. It indicates the cable and telecom stock has been able to meet consumer demand for faster broadband speed by upgrading its network at little additional cost.\n\nAs conditions improve and Charter Communications gets beyond the end of the ACP, it’s business will look appreciably better. The stock trades at 9 times trailing earnings and estimates and 15 times FCF. Also going for just a fraction of its sales, Charter Communications is a stock to consider.\n\nPayPal Holdings (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayments specialist PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) is arguably the most undervalued Nasdaq stock of the three.\n\nIt also holds the most potential. Shares are weighed down by robust competition, particularly Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent moves to muscle its way towards a larger share of the payments pie. But the market has thrown the baby out with the bathwater.\n\nPayPal Holdings remains a potent competitor even if there has been share losses. It commands a 45% share of online payment processing technologies worldwide, or more than the next 12 largest rivals combined. Payment volume is also accelerating, up 14% in the first quarter to $404 billion. But there is more growth to come.\n\nPayPal Holdings is launching an advertising platform that is unique to its business. Relying upon the data from the buying habits of it 400 million active accounts, PYPL can offer advertisers the ability to zero in on a targeted audience.\n\nAnd, the stock is cheap. It trades at 15 times earnings, 12 times estimates and goes for just a fraction of its estimated earnings growth rate. Wall Street sees PayPal Holdings growing profits at a 16% compounded annual rate for the next five years. Add in a price-to-FCF ratio of 12 and you have an undervalued Nasdaq stock ripe for the picking.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Epic Games has had two applications to create a European store for its titles on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s operating systems rejected by the iPhone giant, the maker of popular game \"Fortnite\" said on Friday.\n\nIn a series of posts on the social media platform X, Epic Games said Apple had rebuffed its submission for its Epic Games Store \"twice now.\"\n\nAccording to Epic, Apple said \"the design and position\" of Epic's \"Install\" button was too similar to its \"Get\" button, while Epic's \"In-app purchases\" label was too much like the \"In-App Purchases\" label in Apple's App Store.\n\nEpic said it was using the same naming conventions that are employed \"across popular app stores on multiple platforms, and are following standard conventions for buttons\" in apps on Apple's iOS operating system.\n\n\"We're just trying to build a store that mobile users can easily understand, and the disclosure of in-app purchases is a regulatory best practice followed by all stores nowadays,\" Epic added.\n\nEpic called Apple's rejections \"arbitrary,\" noting that it has shared the matter with the European Commission. Barring any further delays, Epic said it is ready to launch the Epic Games Store and Fortnite in the European Union on iOS \"in the next couple of months.\"\n\nNeither Apple nor the European Commission immediately responded to a request for comment, Reuters reported.\n\nEarlier this year, Apple allowed Epic to put a game store on its iPhone and iPad devices in Europe, responding to pressure from EU regulators.\n\nEven still, Epic and Apple have been enmeshed in an ongoing feud since 2020, when Apple kicked Fortnite off of its App Store because Epic failed to follow the tech titan's payment rules in protest.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has proposed changes to its App Store to better comply with the Digital Markets Act, an EU law designed to allow users to more easily move between rival services.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEpic Games says Apple has twice rejected applications to create EU games store\n\nTD's chief compliance officer departs amid US anti-money laundering probe\n\nWorld stocks rise, US yields dip amid jobs data, UK labor landslide\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Wedbush analysts are bullish on the tech sector, predicting a further 15% upside for the Nasdaq in 2024. They believe the current momentum is just the beginning of an AI-driven tech bull market, with the \"AI party\" just reaching 9 pm.\n\nWedbush highlights Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the early leaders of this \"AI Revolution,\" pioneering the foundation for a wave of new applications and spending. They anticipate a \"tidal wave of $1 trillion\" in tech sector spending related to AI over the next 12-18 months.\n\n\"We believe NASDAQ has another strong 2H ahead as tech stocks will be up 15% the rest of 2024 in our view with tech fundamentals set to accelerate as AI use cases materially expand,\" writes Wedbush.\n\nTheir initial forecast for a 25% growth in tech stocks for 2024 remains on track, fueled by strong performances by tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta (NASDAQ:META). They emphasize this is a new era – a \"1995 moment\" of technological revolution, not a repeat of the dot-com bubble of 1999.\n\nWedbush expects Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to join the party in the latter half of the year, unleashing the consumer side of the AI revolution. The upcoming iPhone 16 is seen as a potential catalyst for this shift, ushering in an era of AI-powered smartphones.\n\nWedbush predicts a race to a $4 trillion market cap between tech giants Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft over the next year. The firm says Nvidia's dominance in GPU chips, considered the \"new gold\" of the tech sector, positions them well for continued growth as enterprises and consumers embrace the AI revolution.\n\nWedbush concludes that they believe the tech sector is poised for significant growth fueled by the ongoing AI revolution.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWedbush sees 15% upside left for Nasdaq, tech stocks\n\nTD's chief compliance officer departs amid US anti-money laundering probe\n\nWorld stocks rise, US yields dip amid jobs data, UK labor landslide\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Apple, Alphabet  Microsoft and Amazon",
        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – July 5, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nApple at 52-Week Highs: Can A.I. Drive the Stock Higher?\n\nApple shares hit a 52-week high of $220.38 on Jul 2 and finally closed at $220.27, up 14.4% year to date. Since Jun 10, when the iPhone maker hosted its annual developers’ event, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple shares have jumped 14.1%, outperforming the Zacks Computer-Miniindustry’s gain of 13.8% and the Zacks Computer & Technologysector’s return of 5.8%.\n\nLately, AAPL shares have been gaining attention from investors thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, at WWDC.\n\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL’s Long-Term Prospects\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has expressed his enthusiasm over the opportunities with Generative AI (GenAI). In the fiscal second-quarter earnings call, Cook stated that Apple enjoys a significant advantage in the AI space due to “Apple’s unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple’s silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy.”\n\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad, and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple’s stringent privacy standards.\n\nSiri, powered by Apple Intelligence, has become more natural, contextually aware, and capable of handling complex tasks. Users can communicate with Siri using both voice and text, and the assistant can now maintain context across multiple requests. Siri’s new design features an elegant glowing light around the screen edge when active, and its functionality extends to providing device support and answering detailed questions about using the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a significant enhancement, Apple is integrating ChatGPT into its platforms, allowing users to access its expertise directly within iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia. Siri can utilize ChatGPT’s capabilities, with user consent, to provide more detailed and accurate information. ChatGPT will also be available in the systemwide Writing Tools, enhancing content creation with advanced language models and image generation.\n\nSolid Liquidity Supports AAPL’s Shareholder-Friendly Initiative\n\nApple’s strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generating ability are noteworthy. As of Mar 30, 2024, cash & marketable securities were $162.34 billion compared with term debt of $102.59 billion.\n\nApple returned nearly $27 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 through dividend payouts ($3.7 billion) and share repurchases ($23.5 billion). Its board authorized an additional $110 billion for share repurchases and also raised dividend payout by 4% to 25 cents per share.\n\nStiff Competition, China Worries Hurt AAPL’s Near-Term\n\nChina’s growth remains a worry for Apple due to stiff competition from local smartphone makers, including Huawei. The Chinese government’s directive to state officials not to use non-Chinese phones for work has been detrimental to the iPhone’s demand.\n\nPer Canalys data, the Mainland China smartphone market witnessed 67.7 million units of shipment in first-quarter 2024. Huawei led with a 17% market share, shipping 11.7 million smartphones, while Apple sold 10 million units, down 25% year over year, the most among the top five vendors.\n\nThe issues forced Apple to cut retail prices, which drove iPhone smartphone shipments in April (up 52% year over year) and is also expected to have benefited May sales. However, Apple is suffering from a lack of GenAI capabilities in the iPhone.\n\nConclusion\n\nApple’s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $83.75 billion, indicating 2.38% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings has increased by a penny to $1.33 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nMoreover, Apple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 30.63X compared with the Zacks Computer-Mini industry’s 28.58X and higher than the median of 27.37X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\nHowever, Apple’s AI push is hard to ignore. The Services business has emerged as AAPL’s new cash cow with an expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. An expanding user base of more than 2 billion active devices makes Apple’s investment profile attractive.\n\nMoreover, Apple shares are trading above the 50-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend.\n\nApple currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Tesla, Inc. TSLA and Natural Health Trends Corp. NHTC.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Research Reports for Apple, Meta Platforms and Tesla\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and Tesla, Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock Natural Health Trends Corp. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple’s shares have only slightly outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+14.5% vs. +14.3%). The company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. Apple’s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple’s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\r\n\r\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “Magnificent 7” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have far outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+78.1% vs. +32.7%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia/Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platform is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects.\r\n\r\nAI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 150 million monthly actives. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nTesla’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past year (-17.3% vs. -16.9%). The company’s recently shrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts have been plaguing Tesla. Tesla expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023 amid a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market.\r\n\r\nWith competition intensifying in the EV space, Tesla’s focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game-changer. It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its \"robotaxi\" venture.\r\n\r\nThe successful introduction of its Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China amid stiff competition marks a significant win.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – July 5, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nMarket Breakout: 3 Leading Stocks to Buy Now\n\nUS stock indexes have staged yet another bullish breakout. The economy is steady, employment is robust, inflation continues to fall, and stocks are making record highs – if you aren’t bullish now, I don’t know what else to tell you.\n\nStock Market Generals Grow Profits, Show Powerful Momentum\n\nLife can be very easy in this market, as some of the largest and most prevalent companies in the world are still trading at appealing levels.\n\nThe 'Magnificent 7' continues to grow earnings at an incredible pace, while the stocks also show encouraging momentum. Q2 earnings for the ‘Magnificent 7’ companies are expected to be up +25.5% from the same period last year on +13.1% higher revenues, while the stock prices on several of them push YTD highs.\n\nMy favorite names from the Mag 7 currently are Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet. Also, Nvidia, gets an honorable mention because it too is still a fantastic stock with a top Zacks Rank.\n\nIn the chart below we can see that each of these stocks is showing significant relative strength against the broad market. Apple, although it trails the market YTD, shows the most significant short-term momentum, up 30% in just the last three months.\n\nRising Earnings Trend Lifts Share Price\n\nApple, a consistently successful company with a strong stock performance, is one whose earnings trends I closely monitor. However, over the past two years, earnings revisions have been flat, and while it remains a decent performer, it hasn't delivered any exceptional growth.\n\nNotably, Apple’s earnings revision trend has begun to turn higher for the first time in a while. This is extremely encouraging action, and Apple now enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\n\nAmazon too has seen its earnings revision trend turn higher, giving it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating as well.\n\nApple, Amazon, and Alphabet all have massive tailwinds coming from the AI boom. We learned about Apple’s new AI software integrations, as well as Alphabets new AI agents over the last couple of months, but there are numerous other ways the technology is being used behind the scenes as well.\n\nAt Amazon, its web services business is going to be a huge beneficiary as technology companies ramp up computing power. But AI will also be used at its fulfillment operations, as the massive scale benefits from optimizations. Amazon is also quietly one of the biggest users of new robotics tech, as its operations continue to be automated.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on these developments it’s no surprise we are beginning to see analysts raise earnings estimates.\n\nReasonable Valuations, Especially Alphabet\n\nAlthough Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting a flat earnings revision trend, it still has a lot going for it. It is currently the relatively cheapest stock in the group.\n\nToday, it has a one year forward earnings multiple of 24.4x, which is just above the market average, and below its 10-year median of 26.1x. GOOGL is also expected to grow its EPS 17.5% annually over the next 3-5 years, plans to buy back some $70 billion in shares this year, and is now paying a tidy 0.43% dividend.\n\nAmazon too is trading at a deep historical discount. At 43x forward earnings it is well below its 10-year median of 98.2x, and EPS is forecast to grow 29.6% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nAt 33.4x, Apple is the only one trading above its historical median valuation, but for a company of its quality it is no surprise it earns a premium valuation.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThis bull market continues to charge, fueled by a robust economy, falling inflation, and stellar earnings growth from industry leaders. The \"Magnificent 7\" stands out with their impressive earnings and momentum, offering attractive entry points for investors seeking exposure to top performers.\n\nMoreover, the growing adoption of AI across these companies, particularly in areas like automation and cloud computing, positions them for long-term dominance in the evolving technological landscape. With valuations remaining reasonable and fundamental strength unwavering, this market rally appears poised to extend its winning streak.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "Don’t count the metaverse out just yet. While it started as a costly failure, companies are racing to use it, creating opportunities for some of the top metaverse stocks.\n\nFor example, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) metaverse just debuted in Singapore, which will allow users to build virtual burgers, envision future McDonald’s restaurant designs and participate in contests that will reward users with real food deals and prizes.\n\nIKEA is launching a virtual universe on Roblox (NYSE:RBLX). In fact, its “The Co-Worker Game” will allow users “to live their home furnishing dreams and get paid for it.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) metaverse experience includes virtual roller coasters, mazes and games. “Bringing Six Flags to Roblox has enabled us to create a one-of-a-kind metaverse experience that will engage and entertain our fans in innovative ways,” said Selim Bassoul, CEO of Six Flags.\n\nEven The Rolling Stones are also debuting their music in the metaverse.\n\nBut this is just the start of the metaverse growth story. With demand only set to grow for virtual experiences in entertainment and gaming, analysts at SkyQuest say the metaverse market could be worth nearly $803.3 billion by 2031 from $86.31 billion in 2023.\n\nIn short, it’s time to jump into some of the top metaverse stocks, including:\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top metaverse stocks to buy is Roblox.\n\nAfter gapping from about $40 to a low of $30 on poor earnings, Roblox is back to $37.77, where it’s still a buy. Initially, I’m looking for it to refill its bearish gap at $40. Longer term, I’d like to see the stock rally back to at least $45 on improving earnings.\n\nHelping, recent earnings negativity appears to have been priced into the rebounding stock.  Plus, analysts are bullish. Macquarie, for example, just initiated coverage of RBLX with an outperform rating, noting it’s one of the main “building blox” of the metaverse.\n\n“In our view, there is still a long runway for growth ahead, driven by user growth, better monetization, international penetration and a new advertising initiative,” they added, as quoted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nMoffett Nathanson also upgraded the stock to a neutral rating with a $26 price target following the massive sell off in the stock.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also a buy on weakness.\n\nWhile it’s been driven by artificial intelligence, demand for its chips, and strong earnings growth, it’s also exposed to the metaverse with its Omniverse software.\n\nStory continues\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/foxconn-digital-twin-ai/\n\nWith it, companies can create and test virtual environments all in real time. Foxconn, for example, is using the Omniverse to create a digital twin of its new factory in Guadalajara to train robots in a virtual environment.\n\nEven more impressive, according to VentureBeat.com:\n\n“Such twins enable a company to design a factory in digital form through Omniverse simulations anchored by Nvidia’s chips. The engineers designing the factory can get feedback from the simulation about how good the design is. Once it is perfected, they can build the factory in the real world. And with sensors on the factory, they can get digital information about how good the design really is and then modify the digital design in a feedback loop for continuous improvement.”\n\nAll of which makes shares of Nvidia even more attractive following its 10:1 split.\n\nFidelity Metaverse ETF (FMET) A character inside a virtual world. Metaverse.\n\nSource: Led Gapline / Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you’d rather diversify with 53 metaverse stocks at less than $31 a share, there’s the Fidelity Metaverse ETF (NASDAQ:FMET).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.39%, the ETF tracks the Fidelity Metaverse Index, which tracks the performance of companies that develop, manufacture, distribute, or sell products or services related to establishing and enabling the metaverse.\n\nSome of its top holdings include heavyweights like Nvidia, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nBetter, thanks to the explosive nature of these top stocks, the FMET ETF ran from a recent low of about $26 to $30.94, where it’s still a buy. From its last traded price of $30.94, I’d like to see it test at least $40 a share.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "SPYI ETF: Get Paid Every Month, Enjoy the Massive Yield",
        "content": "What’s better than getting paid a dividend every quarter? How about getting paid one every month? That’s exactly what the NEOS S&P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI) has to offer investors, and it also comes with a massive dividend yield.\n\nI’m bullish on this new monthly dividend ETF from NEOS based on this attractive payout schedule and its show-stopping 11.6% dividend yield, which is an incredible nine times higher than the yield of the S&P 500 (SPX).\n\nWhat Is the SPYI ETF’s Strategy?\n\nAccording to fund sponsor NEOS, SPYI “seeks to distribute high monthly income generated from investing in the constituents of the S&P 500 Index and implementing a data-driven call option strategy.”\n\nThe fund “utilizes a call option strategy that may include both sold and purchased SPX index options, which may provide the opportunity for upside capture in rising equity markets.”\n\nEssentially, SPYI owns the stocks in the S&P 500. It then generates monthly income for its holders through both the dividend payments from these stocks and by selling call options on the S&P 500 to generate additional income via the premiums from these options contracts.\n\nWhile this generates a high level of monthly income, investors should also note that by utilizing this strategy, they are potentially sacrificing some level of upside from capital appreciation. If SPYI’s holding rises above the strike price for the covered call contracts it sells to generate this income, SPYI will forgo much of this additional upside.\n\nYou can see this dynamic in play by looking at the ETF’s results. For example, in 2023, SPYI generated a total return (which includes price appreciation and dividends) of 18.1% for the year. While this was a strong return, it underperformed the S&P 500’s return of 26.3% for the year.\n\nHowever, there’s one thing that SPYI does a bit differently from other ETFs employing this covered call strategy. Rather than investing all of the money it receives from selling call contracts, it has the option to reinvest some of the proceeds back into buying cheaper, further out of the money call options, allowing it to participate in some of this upside if the underlying holding goes beyond the strike price.\n\nAs NEOS explains in the fund’s summary prospectus, the fund seeks to use the S&P 500 call options “to generate a net-credit, meaning that the premium received from the sale of the call options will be greater than the cost of buying the long, out-of-the-money SPX call options.”\n\nIncredible Dividend\n\nWhile the strategy is complex and has some pros and cons regarding capital appreciation and total return, there’s no denying that it’s a powerful way to generate significant income. This is evidenced by SPYI’s mouth-watering 11.6% dividend yield, which is about nine times higher than that of the S&P 500 (currently yielding just 1.3%).\n\nStory continues\n\nNot only that, but SPYI’s yield is easily more than double the 4.35% yield offered by 10-year treasury bonds, making SPYI a compelling income investment no matter what type of interest rate environment we find ourselves in.\n\nETFs employing this strategy have grown in popularity in recent years, and it’s worth noting that SPYI also features a higher yield than many of these. For example, the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI), the largest and most well-known of these ETFs, features a 7.4% yield, and the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) yields 8.8%. These are both impressive yields, but SPYI’s is significantly higher.\n\nIt’s important to note that the level of SPYI’s dividend payout is not set in stone, and the amount can vary from month to month. However, the payouts have been relatively consistent, ranging between $0.47 and $0.50 per month over the past year. Additionally, since its launch in August of 2022, SPYI has paid distributions every month, so it is beginning to build up a strong track record of monthly dividend payments.\n\nSPYI’s Holdings\n\nSPYI offers strong diversification, with 508 holdings. Its top 10 holdings make up a reasonable 38% of the fund. Below, you’ll find an overview of SPYI’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nGiven the fund’s strategy of investing in the constituents of the S&P 500 index, its top holdings unsurprisingly largely mirror those of the broad market index. Its holdings include household names like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nSteep Expense Ratio\n\nOne negative aspect of SPYI is that it features a fairly high expense ratio of 0.68%. This means that an investor in the fund will pay $68 on a $10,000 investment over the course of the year. Assuming that the fund returns 5% per year going forward and maintains this current expense ratio, this investor will pay $379 in fees over a five-year time horizon, a fairly steep total.\n\nThat said, this is a complex, actively-managed ETF, so it is understandable that it has a higher expense ratio than the typical index fund. As long as the ETF keeps paying out large dividends like clockwork each month, most holders will feel comfortable with the above-average expense ratio.\n\nIs SPYI Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SPYI earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 403 Buys, 93 Holds, and nine Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SPYI stock price target of $55.24 implies 9.06% upside potential from current levels.\n\nThe Takeaway: A Strong Option for Income Investors\n\nInvestors should be aware that investing in call options ETFs like SPYI might limit potential capital appreciation. However, with a remarkable yield of 11.6%, it’s hard not to like this ETF anyway. I’m bullish on SPYI as a great option for income investors based on its attractive monthly payout schedule and its massive 11.6% dividend yield. As one part of a balanced portfolio, this is an effective tool for generating frequent, above-average income on a steady basis.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Under-the-Radar Tech Stocks With Millionaire-Maker Upside",
        "content": "There are more than 3,500 publicly listed companies in the U.S. today. Yet a handful of stocks get all the attention from the media, analysts and investors. These tend to be the mega-cap tech stocks that dominate the market and are responsible for the majority of its gains and losses. Attention tends to go to companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) because they have so much influence over the market’s direction instead of some under-the-radar tech stocks.\n\nWhile it makes sense that the most influential stocks should get most of the attention, it also means many great under-the-radar tech stocks. This is disappointing as many of these neglected stocks are quietly rising and beating the returns seen in the broader market. Spotting these hidden gems can add big gains to a portfolio.\n\nHere are three under-the-radar tech stocks with millionaire-maker upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) doesn’t get nearly as much attention as it deserves. Companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) use the microchip-equipment maker’s components. Yet the company and its stock receive only a fraction of the media attention given to its customers. This is largely due to Applied Materials being a going concern since 1967 and being viewed as Silicon Valley’s founding father.\n\nSome of Applied Materials’ equipment is so old that it is housed at the Smithsonian Museum. Regardless of its age, Applied Materials is still posting strong financial results, and its stock is responding. For its fiscal second quarter, Applied Materials most recently announced EPS of $2.09, which was ahead of analyst consensus estimates that called for a profit of $1.99 a share. Revenue totaled $6.65 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $6.54 billion.\n\nThe strong results and bullish forward guidance continue to send AMAT stock higher. In the last 12 months, Applied Materials’ share price has risen 67%.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor an under-the-radar cybersecurity stock, look to Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). The company’s stock is up 18% this year, but it badly trails the gains seen in its competitors, such as CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), whose share price has gained 57%. The big problem at Palo Alto Networks is that the company has missed Wall Street forecasts on several occasions.\n\nMost recently, Palo Alto Networks reported quarterly billings that missed analyst estimates, sending its stock down nearly 10%. For the company’s fiscal third quarter, billings came in at $2.33 billion, missing analysts’ average estimate of $2.34 billion. U.S. Analysts see the disappointing billing figure as a sign of reduced corporate spending on cybersecurity solutions, creating headwinds.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the near-term challenges, 38 Wall Street analysts who cover the company rate Palo Alto Networks’ stock a “strong buy” and expect future gains.\n\nAnalog Devices (ADI)\n\nSource: sdecoret / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Applied Materials, Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is a semiconductor company whose stock flies under the radar of most investors but nevertheless outperforms. So far, in 2024, ADI stock is up nearly 20%. In the last five years, the share price has more than doubled. Also, like Applied Materials, Analog Devices continues to post strong quarterly prints that underpin its share price.\n\nIn May of this year, Analog Devices announced EPS of $1.40 for its fiscal second quarter, beating analysts’ consensus forecast of $1.26. Revenue came in at $2.16 billion, beating expectations for $2.11 billion. The company, which makes semiconductors used in data conversion and signal processing, attributed the strong results to rising orders and demand for its products, particularly in the automotive and industrial sectors.\n\nLooking ahead, Analog Devices raised its forecast for the year’s second quarter, saying it expects revenue of $2.27 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Analysts had forecast $2.16 billion in fiscal third-quarter sales. ADI stock also pays a quarterly dividend of 92 cents, giving it a yield of 1.60%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in AMAT and NVDA.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy and Hold to Channel Your Inner Nancy Pelosi",
        "content": "Nancy Pelosi and her husband, Paul, have done well investing. Paul Pelosi has a master’s degree from New York University and his own investment firm. In just one day in the stock market last week, they made $1.6 million. Their net worth is estimated to be $250 million.\n\nThis has all come legally without any insider information as Paul Pelosi is a savvy investor and Nancy Pelosi is a successful public servant. If they did anything illegal in investing, ethics complaints would have been filed against her long ago. His firm would have been reported to the authorities and shut down. An investigative committee in Congress would have been formed. Just look at the jail time and negative press Paul Pelosi got for a DUI. Imagine what would happen from felonies like insider trading, securities fraud, and tax evasion!\n\nMany politicians and reporters would love to “make their bones” by taking down Pelosi for insider trading. None of this has happened because they have done nothing wrong in their investing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat they have done right is invest in what they know, like Peter Lynch, and bought quality like Warren Buffett. Representing a district close to Silicon Valley, their portfolio has the biggest and best tech stocks starting with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG; NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIf there were an investing guide for Nancy Pelosi stocks, the mission statement would be to invest in companies with a California presence active in the tech community. The following are two stocks the Pelosis should consider and a third that she’s already trading. Each is active in California in some aspect of tech.\n\nArcher Aviation (ACHR) Person holding cellphone with logo of American eVTOL aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nArcher Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) has plans for ports for flying car taxis near San Francisco, the heart of Pelosi’s district. The city is affluent with Silicon Valley, Napa Valley and world-class beaches nearby. Along with paradise comes traffic jams, meaning plenty of business for flying taxis.\n\nThis is a good time to buy Archer, as the stock is down. Most of the market’s gains have come from mega-cap tech stocks. It would add balance to Nancy Pelosi’s stock portfolio, as it leads in its area of tech.\n\nThis can be seen in Archer Aviation’s financials. There is little debt, which shows the company does not have to leverage its future to finance its operations. Earnings per share are up more than double digits this year and are expected to rise almost 10% next year. Strong insider ownership shows bullish sentiment for Archer from those who know it best.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst Citizens Bancshares (FCNCA) First Citizens Bank (FCNCA) logo displayed on smartphone in front of SVB logo in dark background behind phone\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rafapress\n\nHistory repeats itself with First Citizens Bancshares (NASDAQ:FCNCA), based in Raleigh, North Carolina acquiring the assets of Silicon Valley Bank. It was another stellar North Carolina bank, NationsBank from Charlotte, that bought Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), then headquartered in San Francisco, and took the name. Bank of America is now based in Charlotte. First Citizens now has a substantial presence in the California tech community as its banker.\n\nGobbling up assets from failed Texas institutions in the 1980s made NationsBank a national institution. With a presence in California as the banker for the tech sector, First Citizens is now a national player. The stock rose more than 30% last year.\n\nExpect more as the profit margin is high and the price-to-earnings ratio is low, which is generally a bullish combination. Another nice one-two is high institutional ownership and a low short float. This and the stock rise show that hedge funds and other institutional investors are bullish on its expansion into California’s tech community.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you were to believe the negative press about Nancy Pelosi stocks, you would think their holdings in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are insider dealings. But this is ridiculous as Nvidia, based close to Pelosi’s district, is the darling of Wall Street! The Pelosis made nearly $4 million on NVDA call options that they purchased late last year.\n\nThere have been about 20 positive analyst ratings for Nvidia in the last month. There has been one for Alphabet in the last year. Suffice it to say there are a lot of bonuses riding on Nvidia, so expect the analyst crowd to do what they can to keep the price rising.\n\nA Truist analyst expects Nvidia to earn $140 a share. The recent stock split will facilitate that rise, as will a profit margin of over 50%, with sales and earnings soaring.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jonathan Yates did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Sell in July Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "It might be time to look for consumer discretionary stocks to sell. They have exhibited varying performance over the past several months. For example, the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF, a $5.4 billion exchange-traded fund with some 312 different consumer discretionary names, has only risen just under 3% on a year-to-date basis. This is relatively flat compared to the Nasdaq, which has rallied nearly 19% in the same period, and the S&P 500, which has risen 14.5%.\n\nElevated interest rates and inflation that is still too high are the critical disincentives to consumer spending on non-essentials. Moreover, the U.S. Federal Reserve does not seem to be in a hurry to make interest rate cuts, at least until the end of the year. That implies there will still be pressure on consumers going forward.\n\nThe prevalence of tighter consumer budgets also means there are certain stocks in the consumer discretionary sector to avoid in July. Below are three consumer discretionary stocks to sell.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEtsy (ETSY) Etsy logo on a phone screen on a blue background. Phone is in a little cart and there are packages around them. ETSY stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nEtsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) markets itself has a two-sided marketplace wherein buyers and sellers can connect with one another. The platform has typically drawn in special artisans and entrepreneurs, ultimately creating a vibrant seller community that offers a variety of products that consumers would otherwise not be able to buy at other shops. However, with consumers dealing with their current budget constraints, Etsy has had to inject capital into advertising and promotions in order to compete with larger retailers for budget-anxious consumers.\n\nSo far, Etsy is losing that battle. First-quarter earnings results for fiscal year 2024 reported financial figures below Wall Street’s estimates. The platform’s gross merchandise sales (GMS) metric, a dollar value of all the items sold on Etsy’s marketplaces, came in at $3 billion, under analysts’ projection of $3.12 billion. Quarterly revenue and earnings figures were also slightly below estimates.\n\nETSY’s earnings have plummeted 29.6% year-to-date, and deteriorating consumer conditions could make it even more challenging for the platform to grow earnings in the near term.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThough Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a large technology company, its primary sources of revenue are consumer electronics products, such as iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks. The oversupply of electronics from the pandemic years, coupled with less enthusiasm for the next iPhone (or any other smartphone), has caused Apple’s revenue growth to stutter. According to Koyfin, at the end of 2023, revenue, in fact, declined 2.8% year-over-year from $394.3 billion in 2022 to $383.3 billion. Similarly, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, the iPhone maker reported a sales figure of $90.7 billion, a 4.3% year-over-year decline from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s woes have not stopped. Not only does it face even more competition in China due to Huawei’s resurgence, but even the new AI features, dubbed as “Apple Intelligence,” coming to iOS later in the year, are unlikely to get consumers to flock over and buy the next Apple product.\n\nWhile AAPL has risen 12.8%, uncertainty around the company’s future innovations and sales growth could send the stock trending back downward.\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) Deck of a Royal Caribbean (RCL) cruise ship looking over the ocean\n\nSource: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com\n\nFounded in 1968, Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) operates as a global cruise company under the brands Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea Cruises brands. The global COVID-19 pandemic has taken a major toll on Royal Caribbean’s sales and earnings growth as well as outlook. In 2020, revenue collapsed 79.8% to just $2.2 billion, and the following year saw sales plunge even further to $1.5 billion. Thankfully, going into 2022 and 2023, the cruise services have more than recovered. In 2023, Royal Caribbean generated $13.9 billion, representing a 57% year-over-year increase from 2022 and set a record revenue figure for the company overall.\n\nHowever, despite all the recent growth, brewing natural disasters could put that on pause. Hurricane Beryl, currently roaring through the Caribbean, has become the earliest category-five hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean. This will definitely be bad news for RCL stock as different cruise trips will be impacted, and we’re just beginning hurricane season.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "3 Augmented Reality Stocks to Sell in July Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "In Friday’s Q3 2024 strategy outlook, BCA Research forecasted a hard landing for the economy. The Canadian investment research company projects the S&P 500 index drop from current 5,460 to 3,750, indicating a 31% devaluation of the stock market by the end of the year or in early 2025, highlighting the urgency to consider augmented reality stocks to sell.\n\nBCA’s chief global strategist, Peter Berezin, points to the slowdown in job openings and slowed wage growth to spill over to weakened consumer power. Combined with depleted Covid-era excess savings, even the AI-driven boom is not likely to stave off companies from reducing their capital expenditures\n\nAlthough this is reminiscent of recession calls throughout 2023 that failed to materialize, this could be a case of postponement. After all, there is no historical record of the Fed achieving a true soft landing even once. Bearing in mind the softish landing or outright hard landing, these augmented reality stocks to sell should be prioritized.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAt the end of the day, an augmentation is an extra layer, which takes a back seat in a hard landing scenario hitting discretionary spending.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) bread and butter comes from Google Services, the company has dabbled in augmented reality. Having received a similar hype as Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro, Google Glass spectacles ended up getting canceled in 2015.\n\nThe AR experiment suffered from multiple hardware issues. It saw poor voice recognition, along with unsuitable camera quality and battery life, leaving it stranded from mass adoption. Now that AI is at the forefront of Big Tech, Google is revisiting the concept with Project Astra. The company showcased the design at its annual developer Mountain View conference in May.\n\nPresently restricted to a smart phone app to interpret reality, a hands free wearable solution would be the obvious choice. However, Google has become notorious for self-imposed restrictions to accurately interpret reality.\n\nNot only was this demonstrated with Google’s Gemini launch debacle, but hardly a month goes by without a new demonstration of Google’s ideological commitments overriding user experience. Most importantly, a hard landing hit on small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) would significantly cut into Google’s ad revenue.\n\nThe present price exit ramp is aligned with that outlook, as GOOGL stock gained 32% value year-to-date. In fact, GOOGL stock reached an all-time high of $186.86 only recently, on June 27th. Investors should depart GOOGL shares on that good note, considering its 52-week average of $145.30 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a dedicated software platform for generating virtual environments, Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) shifted resources to AR as well. In 2022, the company bought The Wild, a cloud-based extended reality (XR) platform to integrate into its suite of tools.\n\nAll about streamlining tools to remain the 3D leader, Autodesk also launched Workshop AR to test 3D immersion deployment in real-time. However, while Autodesk is both a solid metaverse and AR exposure, a hard recession outlook makes ADSK stock a good choice for one of the augmented reality stocks to sell.\n\nRelying on new licenses, subscription renewals and Autodesk’s dependance on the manufacturing and construction sectors has the company looking at significant cash flow turndowns. SMEs struggling with their own cash flows would likely turn to Autodesk’s free competitors.\n\nIn the latest fiscal Q1 2025 earnings report, Autodesk reported $227 million free cash flow reduction from the year-ago quarter. Year-to-date, ADSK stock flatlined at 5% gains. Similarly to GOOGL, the present ADSK price of $245 is a solid exit point, holding close to the 52-week high of $279 per share.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe most established metaverse company, Meta (NASDAQ:META) is the obvious choice to consider as one of top augmented reality stocks to sell. Despite a continued push for extended reality, the company ended 2023 with a 40% year-over-year drop in VR headset sales.\n\nIn Q1 earnings call, Meta significantly increased its full-year 2024 capital expenditures, from $30-37 billion to $35-40 billion. As expected, the Reality Labs division is expected to continue to rack up operating losses.\n\nIn a hard landing scenario, ad revenue-reliant Meta holds nearly-identical vulnerability to Alphabet. However, Meta doesn’t have the metaverse baggage, which would then be perceived as a luxury at the end of a long line of discretionary spending considerations. On the upside, META stock greatly outperformed the broader market at 41% YTD gains.\n\nAt the present price of $504, META stock is close to its 52-week high of $531, making it an excellent candidate for locking in the profits. Later down the line, a buy-the-dip action should be considered as well.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) recently hit a $3 trillion market cap and is now among the three most valuable companies in the world. Right above it in valuation is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), with a market cap of just under $3.4 trillion, while Microsoft is currently in the top spot at just over $3.4 trillion.\n\nThough Microsoft is a tech stalwart and a safe stock, I think Apple and Nvidia both possess better growth prospects in the long run. So which of them is the most likely to reach a $4 trillion valuation first?\n\nNvidia sports a mammoth growth rate\n\nIt's hard to bet against Nvidia when you consider just how well its business has performed of late. The company is the leading provider of the artificial intelligence (AI) chips that other tech companies need to develop their next-gen software and models. And with AI infrastructure and development still in its early stages, Nvidia could be on the cusp of much more growth.\n\nThat's in stark contrast to Apple, which has been struggling lately to grow its top line at all. AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nBut there is reason to expect that the gap between these growth rates will shrink. While Nvidia is a growth beast, it isn't likely to continue tripling its revenue on a year-over-year basis. As it starts lapping its latest huge numbers, it will become more difficult for it to keep its growth rate so high. And with so many companies loading up on AI chips, Nvidia may be punching above its weight right now. As more competing chips come to market in quantity and chip buyers potentially ease up on their AI-related spending, its growth rate could come down drastically.\n\nOn the flip side, Apple's growth rate should improve thanks to its recently unveiled Apple Intelligence, which will inject AI capabilities into its latest iPhones, Macs, and iPads. That will give users an incentive to get the latest Apple devices when they come out later this year, so it could be the catalyst for a strong upgrade cycle. As Apple dives deeper into AI and enhances its services, it has the potential to tap into more growth opportunities down the road.\n\nApple has the friendlier valuation\n\nWhat may be the biggest impediment for Nvidia's stock to rally much higher in the near future is its extremely high valuation of more than 70 times earnings. AAPL PE Ratio Chart\n\nTrading at a much more modest P/E ratio of around 34, Apple could have more room to rise, especially if its growth rate improves. Meanwhile, Nvidia's multiple means it will have a high bar to meet each and every time it reports earnings. That leaves the stock vulnerable to a sell-off should it have a quarter that falls short of expectations or if management offers a forecast that isn't sufficiently rosy.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile things are going well for Nvidia today, that doesn't mean it will be able to maintain its current pace.\n\nMy prediction: Apple hits $4 trillion first\n\nBoth of these stocks make for good long-term investments, but if I were buying shares today, I would pick Apple over Nvidia.\n\nThere is a lot of excitement around Nvidia now, and that has me concerned that expectations for it may have climbed too high. Apple may not be as popular with growth investors today, but it shouldn't be counted out as it still has a lot more room for growth left.\n\nAnd Apple is the stock that I think will hit $4 trillion first, beating out both Microsoft and Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Finding undervalued breakout stocks in today’s market can be quite a task. Most top-tier blue-chip and long-term investment opportunities, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), are already well-known and heavily purchased.\n\nHowever, as concerns grow about the concentration of investments in a few mega-cap stocks, demand for breakout stocks is increasing. These breakout stocks may not remain so for long and will instead likely turn into the next big media story of runaway growth and strong upward momentum.\n\nDespite the current economic uncertainty, some promising breakout stocks offer a blend of growth, stability, and income. These stocks span various market caps and sectors and could provide significant returns and diversify your portfolio. While no investment comes without risk, these under-the-radar breakout stocks have strong potential to become standout performers in the years ahead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAtlanta Braves Holdings (BATRA) Atlanta Braves stadium\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou don’t need to be a billionaire to own a stake in a sports team. By investing in breakout stock Atlanta Braves Holdings (NASDAQ:BATRA), you can claim a slice of this iconic Georgian sports franchise. Listed in July 2023, this stock provides investors access to the Braves’ sales revenue and income from the associated real estate assets within the Braves ecosystem.\n\nIf you’re looking for high-profile endorsements, just look at some of the company’s major shareholders. Among the backers of Atlanta Braves Holdings is Warren Buffett, who holds a position in this firm as part of his broader investment in SiriusXM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI). The Braves’ former owner, Liberty Media (NASDAQ:LSXMA), is currently in a high-profile merger with SiriusXM. Buffett’s interest in this unique investment ecosystem is a strong endorsement. Additionally, legendary value investor Mario Gabelli is a fan of the stock, predicting that shares could reach $55 in the coming years.\n\nDespite overall market challenges, Atlanta Braves Holdings stands out as a potential home run for investors seeking unique opportunities in the sports and entertainment sectors.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) stands out as more than just a unique breakout stock — it represents a gateway into the burgeoning trillion-dollar space industry. Last year, Rocket Lab gained significant attention with a record-setting number of launches. This year, the company continues to impress with a substantial government contract worth over $500 million and a strong earnings report.\n\nStory continues\n\nRocket Lab’s current launch and contract backlog exceeds $1 billion, providing a promising forecast for potential revenue, even though clients may cancel. With first-quarter revenue hitting $92.7 million, this backlog indicates considerable growth opportunities.\n\nFurther cementing its position in the global space sector, Rocket Lab recently secured a deal with Japanese company Synspective for 10 Electron launches through 2027. This partnership highlights Synspective’s trust in Rocket Lab’s capabilities as a space-based operator and delivery system for its satellites. While the financial terms were not disclosed, the agreement underscores Rocket Lab’s growing role in the space industry, making it a breakout stock with substantial future potential.\n\nGetty Images (GETY) Image of Getty Image logo on gray background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/360b\n\nGetty Images (NYSE:GETY) is an often overlooked breakout stock with significant potential, especially given its unique position in the artificial intelligence sector. Known for its extensive library of stock photos and journalism photography, Getty serves many clients, including creatives, media companies and corporate marketing teams. However, what truly sets Getty apart is its innovative collaboration with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), making it an intriguing AI stock to watch.\n\nEarlier this year, Getty introduced a generative AI image creator powered by Nvidia. This tool simplifies creating customized images for professionals and amateurs, offering a more user-friendly experience than other platforms like Midjourney’s Discord-based service. More importantly to publishers, Getty’s tool also includes robust legal protections for users, addressing growing concerns about copyright issues in AI, as evidenced by ongoing legal battles involving companies like OpenAI.\n\nDespite a slight decline in sales and income in its latest earnings report, Getty saw a significant rise in subscription rates, which now make up 55.4% of its net revenue. This growing subscription base will expand further as Getty’s AI-driven services become more widely adopted. This positions Getty Images as an undervalued stock with promising AI potential, making it a strong candidate among low-priced stocks with upside.\n\nParsons (PSN) Veterans Day. US soldiers. US army. USA patch flag on the US military uniform. United States Armed Forces. Defense stocks\n\nSource: Bumble Dee / Shutterstock.com\n\nParsons (NYSE:PSN) is a defense technology company with a diverse portfolio that positions it as one of the more under-the-radar breakout AI stocks. Unlike companies focusing primarily on software, Parsons integrates AI into hardware-centric technological developments, setting it apart in the industry.\n\nParsons has achieved notable milestones in ballistic missile site development, rocketry hardware, nuclear site management, and large-scale infrastructure projects. These operations demand sophisticated technical data management and oversight, allowing Parsons to lead with AI solutions that enhance its hardware capabilities. This makes Parsons a key player in AI-enabled defense technologies, an area likely to gain more attention as political campaigns bring defense issues to the forefront.\n\nAdditionally, Parsons is expanding its use of AI with innovative drone solutions for infrastructure inspection. These AI-driven tools transform how bridges, roadways, and water treatment facilities are evaluated, making the process more efficient and thorough. As the U.S. faces growing infrastructure challenges, Parsons’ ability to deploy AI to address complex and hazardous environments makes it an essential player in the field, offering significant potential for growth and innovation.\n\nPhotronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) is a small but powerful player in the tech sector with significant growth potential. Unlike typical semiconductor stocks, Photronics focuses on semiconductor photomasks, an advanced technology with substantial future implications.\n\nPhotronics’ photomasks are vital for precision in microchip manufacturing, enabling the development of artificial intelligence and quantum computing through increasingly complex and precise circuitry. These photomasks are essential for shrinking transistors and components, driving Moore’s Law’s progress. This strategic positioning at the intersection of precision and cost-effectiveness places Photronics at the forefront of current and emerging technologies, making it a compelling pick among under-the-radar tech stocks.\n\nValued at just 12x earnings, Photronics offers an attractive entry point for investors. Its steady income stream reflects solid financial health, and despite being relatively young in the semiconductor industry, the company is poised to benefit significantly from the expanding use of semiconductors across various sectors.\n\nPSQ Holdings (PSQH) The façade of the New York Stock Exchange is decorated for the listing of PublicSq (PSQH) via a SPAC with Colombier Acquisition Corp.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those interested in fairly speculative investments, PSQ Holdings (NYSE:PSQH) is a unique breakout penny stock trading around $3.50 per share with a market cap of approximately $110 million. Despite its small size, this company is positioned at the cutting edge of emerging e-commerce trends that could significantly impact the market in the coming years.\n\nPSQ Holdings’ flagship platform is the digital marketplace PublicSquare, which emphasizes helping consumers “shop their values” by aligning purchases with personal beliefs and ethics. While the company’s conservative ethos might initially stand out, the broader concept behind PublicSquare transcends political affiliations. The platform taps into a growing desire among consumers to support businesses that reflect their values and principles.\n\nIn today’s fragmented social media landscape, people often find themselves within like-minded networks or echo chambers. This trend extends to shopping habits, with a rising preference for e-commerce platforms that align with personal values. PublicSquare meets this demand by offering American-made goods, starkly contrasting the declining quality of many overseas products found on giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nNintendo (NTDOY) A yellow Switch Lite from Nintendo (NTDOY) sits in front of a bright pink background.\n\nSource: ESOlex / Shutterstock.com\n\nNintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) consistently makes my list of breakout stocks, and for good reason. The Japanese company exemplifies a business model that stands apart from many American public companies. Instead of focusing on short-term gains, Nintendo takes a long-term approach, prioritizing sustainable growth over immediate profits. This strategy, perhaps, is why Nintendo has been a resilient player in the market since its founding in 1889 as a playing card company.\n\nA look at Nintendo’s balance sheet underscores its commitment to long-term stability. The company maintains a robust cash reserve and carries no debt, providing a solid financial foundation to navigate economic fluctuations and seize new opportunities. This financial strength is so compelling that Microsoft considered acquiring Nintendo in 2020, recognizing its value as a prime low-priced stock with significant potential. Although the acquisition didn’t materialize, Microsoft’s interest highlights Nintendo’s enduring appeal in the market.\n\nRecently, Nintendo has also capitalized on its extensive intellectual property, opening new revenue streams that further enhance its position as a smart investment. The company’s prudent financial management and innovative approach ensure it remains a standout in the gaming industry, making it a compelling choice for investors seeking both value and growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Intel Stock Analysis: A High-Stakes AI Bet That’s Already Priced In",
        "content": "At first glance, it seems reasonable to expect Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock to rally this year since it manufactures AI chips like the ARC A770, A750, and A580 lineups priced at an attractive range.\n\nHowever, the stock is down 38% year-to-date in a year that tech stocks are rallying. Intel’s valuation is still high despite U.S. government support, weak finances, and declining market share in key areas.\n\nGovernmental Funding and Intel Stock\n\nThe U.S. government would like Intel to remain a strong player in the semiconductor industry compared to other emerging Chinese companies.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn March 2024, Intel announced its plans with the U.S. government under the CHIPS Act, which proposed more than $100 billion in the U.S. semiconductor chip industry over the next five years and $8.5 billion directly to Intel.\n\nTo better understand the funding scale, Intel had less than $2 billion in net income last year. One of the key ways Intel plans to use this funding is to develop its AI capabilities.\n\nThat means this funding can help it catch up to competitors in AI chips, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nU.S. politicians seem to believe in this, too. In May 2024, Congressman Michael McCaul purchased Intel stock worth an estimated $250,000 to $500,000.\n\nFurthermore, he is the co-chair and Founder of the Congressional High Tech Caucus and helped write the CHIPs Act. His purchase is a bullish sign that this program could significantly help Intel.\n\nLosing Market Share\n\nOne of the biggest reasons I don’t want to gamble on Intel is that it has lost its market share in its core market with no indication of a comeback. Its market share in desktop CPUs declined again in 2024, with 76.1% versus 80.8% in quarter 1 of 2023, as it continues to lose to AMD.\n\nIn addition, it lost out to ARM (NASDAQ:ARM), when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s computers stopped using Intel in 2020. The same is happening with some PC laptops and Chromebooks as well.\n\nMicrosoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) new PCs, which will have AI functions heavily implemented natively, are set to mainly deliver with ARM-based chips because of their power efficiency while beating out Intel’s speed.\n\nValuation Isn’t Justified\n\nAs a result of its failure to catch up with the rest of the market, Intel’s revenue has tanked. The chart below shows its revenue at $12.72 billion in the latest quarter, which has fallen off a cliff compared to when Intel would make north of $20 billion a quarter.\n\nFor a company that is seeing its revenue decline, its valuation only shot up. It’s currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 32.3x, more than double the amount it was trading in 2022 and likely due to the AI craze.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, as of 2024, it still only has 1% of the market share of AI chips, which has not meaningfully increased.\n\nThe company is being traded almost like a growth stock, while revenue growth has thus been negative, and its AI efforts show no signs of success.\n\nMy Verdict\n\nAI is a catalyst for Intel, and maybe the federal government’s money could help it penetrate the AI chip market to warrant its current valuation, which is double before the AI craze 2022.\n\nHowever, I don’t want to take this bet because it is losing customers in its core segment of desktop CPUs while its AI efforts have been mediocre.\n\nI might’ve considered Intel if its valuation keeps coming down, but for now, buying into Intel is a pure gamble on AI that is already exceptionally priced, as seen in its jump in P/E.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Incredible FAANG Stocks You'll Want to Consider Adding to Your Portfolio in July",
        "content": "It's been a while since the term \"FAANG stocks\" captured investors' attention, mostly because these stocks aren't the red-hot names they used to be. The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" tickers have taken their place as the market's hot-button grouping.\n\nThe thing is, all five FAANG stocks are still incredible investments, and three of them are standout prospects you'll want to consider adding to your portfolio sooner rather than later.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nMost investors know Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has (literally) been the market's most rewarding stock over the past three decades; shares are up more than 260,000% since their 1997 initial public offering. Most investors also understand, however, that the e-commerce giant's highest-growth days are in the past. It's simply too big now to continue growing at its historical pace.\n\nThat doesn't mean its future isn't bright, however. It's just different in a handful of compelling ways.\n\nOne of these ways is a relatively new, intense focus on profitability. Although the company has historically been more interested in expanding its footprint than turning a profit, for the past couple of years it's been closing and canceling warehouses that couldn't operate as cost-effectively as needed. It's streamlining all of its operations to cull costs.\n\nAnd it's working! While its first-quarter top line improved 13% year over year, operating income more than tripled. Notably, its international e-commerce operation swung from a regular loss to an operating profit of $900 million. That's the best this arm's done since early 2021 when the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing. Data source: Amazon Chart by author. Figures are in billions.\n\nAmazon's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, is also firing on all cylinders, bouncing back from soaring operating expenses seen in late 2022 and 2023. Its first-quarter operating income of $9.4 billion is record-breaking and continues to improve. Look for more of the same, too. Mordor Intelligence believes the cloud market is poised to grow at an average annual pace of more than 16% through 2029.\n\nAmazon's newest business is on a roll as well. That's advertising. Amazon.com's third-party sellers forked over $11.8 billion to more prominently feature their products at the website, up 24% year over year.\n\nAmazon shares are already up more than 130% since early last year, reaching new records just last week. Given the profit growth in the near-term and long-term cards though, there's more upside ahead for this FAANG stock.\n\n2. Netflix\n\nIt would be easy to assume the worst for streaming powerhouse Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX). Suspiciously, after a clear slowdown in its customer growth, beginning next year the company will no longer disclose its subscriber numbers. The streaming market itself is also running into a saturation headwind, forcing its leading companies to partner up with peers and competitors to create more marketable bundles. Cable giant Comcast recently unveiled a cable TV package that included Netflix and Apple TV, for example, while Walt Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are pairing up Disney+, Max, and Hulu in a bundle that will be priced at a discount and launched sometime this summer.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust because the crowded industry's maturing, however, doesn't mean Netflix is doomed. It's got a couple of key things working in its favor that could -- and should -- keep the stock's current rally going. One of them is the company's position within the streaming market.\n\nSee, it's not just the original name in the business that gave rise to all the others. It's also still the most popular and \"stickiest\" streaming platform. Nearly 270 million households pay for access to its content ... far more than any of its rivals. Meanwhile, streaming market research house Antenna reports Netflix's customer churn rate stands at only 2%, versus more than 4% for Disney+ and over 6% for Max, for perspective. For most U.S. households that pay for multiple streaming services, a \"Netflix-first and then the others\" kind of mindset still prevails. Habits are powerful.\n\nThe other matter working in Netflix's favor is the rise of ad-supported streaming services. While only about 40 million of its 270 million subscribers (roughly 15%) are paying a lower monthly price in exchange for watching the occasional television commercial, it's an option that will keep its service far more marketable for far longer than it might otherwise have been. Market research outfit Global Market Insight believes the ad-supported streaming market is set to grow at an annualized rate of more than 8% through 2032.\n\n3. Apple\n\nLast but not least, add Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) to your list of FAANG stocks to consider buying before the end of July.\n\nIt's not necessarily an easy name to get excited about owning right now. Although the stock was a must-have for years following 2007's debut of the iPhone, slowing iPhone sales -- which account for about half of Apple's revenue -- have prompted worries regarding its future growth.\n\nThere's a huge new growth catalyst already at work though. That's artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile there's no denying the company was late to the party, it's catching up quickly. Last month Apple unveiled several different AI features for its smartphones, tablets, and computers that will make its wares even more powerful technology (particularly as it pertains to generative artificial intelligence). As Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang writes, \"Apple's introduction of Apple Intelligence will position the company as the leader in the consumer AI experience.\"\n\nIt's not just Apple's consumer-facing artificial intelligence apps that hold so much promise, however. The company's also working on tech that most consumers will never actually see in action firsthand. For instance, it's working on the development of its own chips for use in AI data centers. Although Nvidia's dominance of this market isn't in any immediate danger, The Wall Street Journal reports that these chips could be based on a completely different sort of artificial intelligence called inference rather than the training-oriented architecture that's common right now.\n\nIt remains to be seen exactly what Apple's AI future looks like. But, Apple's got a long history of success. Given Precedence Research's prediction that the worldwide AI market is set to grow an average of 19% through 2032 there's little doubt the company will win at least its fair share of the market's expansion.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple's New Artificial Intelligence (AI) Features Could Push This Semiconductor Company to a $1 Trillion Valuation",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) unveiled its new artificial intelligence features dubbed \"Apple Intelligence\" at its Worldwide Developers Conference a few weeks ago. The highlights include text generation and summarization across apps, advanced AI-assisted photo editing capabilities, and a much smarter and more powerful Siri. It also integrates third-party services like ChatGPT for more advanced prompts.\n\nWhat makes Apple Intelligence so compelling is the amount of AI processing it does on the device. Instead of taking your query, sending it to a server along with any relevant data, waiting for the server to process your request, and then downloading the results to your device, the entire process happens on your iPhone, Mac, or iPad. For more advanced queries requiring a larger foundation model, Apple uses its own servers and system called Private Cloud Compute, which protects users' privacy.\n\nBoth of those developments could be a major win for one of Apple's biggest suppliers. Since all of these new features run on Apple-designed silicon, chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM) could see an increase in orders due to Apple Intelligence. What's more, as Apple leads the way in on-device AI processing, it could push other device makers to buy more advanced chips from TSMC as well. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPushing artificial intelligence to the edge\n\nWith Apple Intelligence, Apple is ushering in the next phase of artificial intelligence known as edge AI (when data and algorithms are processed directly on the end device, in this case a smartphone, tablet, or personal computer).\n\nIn order to process AI queries on device, though, the devices need to be capable. That means hardware that's even just a few years old might not be able to handle AI requests as well as newer devices can, if they can even handle them at all. Apple, for example, is limiting Apple Intelligence features to the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the forthcoming iPhone 16 devices. (Note the limiting factor here is the amount of short-term memory, or RAM, on the device, not the processors themselves.)\n\nAs a result, Apple could see strong demand from users eager to upgrade their phones over the next few years as Apple Intelligence features roll out around the world. And more iPhone sales means more demand for TSMC's chips.\n\nBut TSMC doesn't just supply chips for Apple. It manufactures the majority of chips in the world, accounting for over 60% of the market. That scale gives it a massive competitive advantage over smaller foundries, as it can invest more money in R&D to develop more advanced processes to print more powerful and energy-efficient chips. That ensures it keeps existing customers like Apple that are looking for leading-edge chips, and it attracts more of their business. It also helps TSMC draw in new customers as innovations like edge AI push companies to adopt new chip designs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Apple cloud is just getting started\n\nIn order to support third-party large language models (LLMs) and its own more advanced LLM, Apple created Private Cloud Compute (PCC). The system uses Apple servers that also deploy the tech titan's own chip designs.\n\nIt's worth noting that Apple isn't using the platform to train AI models. It's using PCC to process data and algorithms that would require more compute power than what's available on consumer devices. The first implementation is sending prompts to ChatGPT.\n\nThere's a lot of potential for Apple to grow its data center capacity as it partners with more businesses and developers looking to integrate their AI services with Apple's platform. When the company announced its partnership with OpenAI's ChatGPT, it said it's working to bring more partners to the platform later this year. If Apple pushes developers to use PCC, it could further increase Apple's demand for TSMC's services. It also offers another way for Apple to generate income from developers.\n\nThere's a long runway for Apple to grow AI features through third-party integrations. Just consider the phenomenal growth of the App Store over the past 15 years. Similar growth would be a boon for both Apple and TSMC.\n\nMaking a $1 trillion semiconductor company\n\nTSMC already has a market cap of around $900 billion. Even so, shares look undervalued at today's price given the growth potential spurred by continued demand for AI chips.\n\nThe stock trades for about 27x forward earnings estimates, which is a more than fair price to pay. It should be able to grow its earnings fast enough to justify that price as demand for more advanced chips supports its top-line growth and improves its operating margins. Analysts expect earnings will increase over 25% next year.\n\nA strong iPhone upgrade cycle over the next few years, incremental demand from Apple's new data centers, and the overall push toward edge computing all favor TSMC's continued growth. Its competitive advantage in creating the most advanced, powerful, and energy-efficient chips will serve it well over the next few years. It's only a matter of time before the company tops a $1 trillion market cap.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon.com Inc (AMZN): Why Is It the Biggest AI Story Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stories.\n\nAre Growing Patents in AI from China a Threat to the US?\n\nChina and the United States continue to compete against each other as the AI boom continues to reign in the tech industry. On July 2, Reuters reported that China plans to develop 50 new national and industrial standards for artificial intelligence by 2026. The country aims to standardize systems in the artificial intelligence sector by providing thorough guidelines to companies and budding startups. Furthermore, on July 3, Reuters reported that China filed six times more patents than the United States for inventions in AI like chatbots. On a global scale, more than 50,000 patent applications were filed in the past decade, a quarter of which were filed in 2023 alone. China filed 38,000 generative AI applications between 2014 and 2023, while the United States only filed slightly over 6,200 applications during the same period. Of the total applications, ByteDance, Alibaba Group, and Microsoft filed the largest number of applications. The report added that Chinese patent applications covered a wider range of sectors such as autonomous driving, publishing, and document management. South Korea, Japan, and India were ranked third, fourth, and fifth with the highest number of patent applications.\n\nThe United States, on the other hand, has reportedly accumulated $55.6 billion in venture capital funding in the second quarter of 2024, the highest quarterly total in two years. On July 3, Reuters reported that the surge in venture capital funding is driven by developments in artificial intelligence. Such is a 47% increase from the $37.8 billion raised by startups in the first quarter of 2024. Significant investments include $6 billion by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion raised by CoreWeave. Previously, venture capital funding took a hit, reporting $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 amid high interest rates and sluggish economic growth. While venture capital and investment in AI are increasing, the IPO market remains sluggish.\n\nOpenAI & Anthropic: A Comparative Analysis\n\nWhile the threat of Chinese innovations looms over the United States, startups in the country are disrupting the industry with key innovations. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is a leading artificial intelligence company based in the United States. In February this year, OpenAI closed a deal with venture capital firm Thrive Capital, allowing it to buy some of its shares in a tender offer, bringing its total valuation to $80 billion. This is a threefold increase in its value from a few months ago in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn June 10, OpenAI and Apple announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Users will now be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities on all these devices without having to switch tools. Siri will also be able to reach ChatGPT when a user asks a question and will present them with an answer directly from the chatbot. ChatGPT will be integrated into Apple's writing tools, allowing users to create content when required. The development ensures that user security remains intact. Requests are not stored by OpenAI and IP addresses remain obscured. Users may connect to their ChatGPT account, allowing them to choose their data preferences. The integration will be executed later this year and can be accessed for free without having to create an account.\n\nIn another update, Apple is reportedly positioned to join OpenAI's board. On July 2, Reuters reported that Apple is set to get an observer role on OpenAI's board, part of the agreement made by the two entities a month ago. Phill Schiller, head of Apple App Store and former marketing chief, was selected for this position. The board agreement will take effect later this year. As of yet, Schiller has not attended any meetings.\n\nAnthropic, OpenAI's direct competitor, is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2021. The company is led by Dario and Daniela Amodei as CEO and president. The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.\n\nClaude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models. The company strongly believes that the initiative will enhance AI safety level assessments, improve safety metrics, and develop infrastructure and tools for evaluations. The safety level assessments will encompass cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, model autonomy, national security risks, and social manipulation.\n\nA lot is going on in the AI space and several companies have emerged as interesting AI stories. We have compiled a list of the most interesting AI stories on Wall Street by studying many reports and publications and watching interviews. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, which was sourced from Insider Monkey's proprietary database that tracks over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has become one of the best AI stories on Wall Street. The company is poised for significant growth in AI, thanks to its generative AI tools in Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as Amazon Q, Amazon Bedrock, and Amazon SageMaker. In March, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) invested an additional $2.75 billion in Anthropic, an artificial intelligence safety and research company, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. The company is leveraging Anthropic's models and just launched the Claude 3.5 Sonnet to Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic's most powerful model yet. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is twice as efficient as Claude 3 Opus and is one-fifth of its price. The new AI can perform extremely complex tasks and is well-equipped with skills in producing high-quality and authentic creative content, understanding data and contextual relationships, and developing advanced codes with sophisticated reasoning.\n\nAmazon is also making in-house AI chips such as the AWS Trainium, and AWS Inferentia for deep learning training of more than 100 billion parameter models. The company is on its way to becoming an AI powerhouse. AWS logged $25 billion in revenue, up 17% year-over-year. In 2023, the company spent $48.4 billion in capital expenditure. to advance its generative AI and non-generative AI workloads. As per a recent update, Amazon plans to spend more than $100 billion to fund its projects in artificial intelligence and data centers over the next decade.\n\nMaxim Group's managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte talked about Amazon's AI position in a recent interview on Yahoo Finance. Forte believes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is well positioned to exploit artificial intelligence at the cloud computing and fulfillment center level, especially compared to tech giants like Apple. The company is making advancements in AWS while also employing techniques to automate its operations, which is a positive sign for investors.\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) was held by 302 hedge funds at the close of Q1 2024 with total stakes amounting to $60.37 billion. Of those, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $7.68 billion.\n\nOn July 1, Needham reiterated a buy rating on the stock and maintained its price target of $205. Analysts' median price target of $220 represents an upside of 11% from current levels.\n\nLakehouse Capital is also bullish on the stock. Here are some comments about AMZN from its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered an impressive quarterly result that also came in well ahead of analyst expectations. Net sales increased 13% year-on-year to $143.3 billion and operating profits increased 219% year-on-year to $15.3 billion (vs the high end of guidance at $12.0 billion). As has been the case for several quarters now, the highlight of the result was the significant improvement in profitability metrics, as management continues to drive cost efficiencies across its retail operations and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Bigger picture, we continue to believe that the market underestimates the length of the runway ahead in the core retail business (note that e-commerce sales in the U.S. still only make up 15% of total retail sales) and that there is still significant margin expansion ahead as scale and efficiency benefits continue to come through.\"\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the biggest AI stories right now. You can visit 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Weekto see the other AI stories that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The technology company owns multiple platforms backed by artificial intelligence including Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, Power platform, and Microsoft Cloud. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also reducing its reliance on AI hardware companies to produce efficient infrastructure systems for its AI products. Last year, the company introduced tailored AI chips including the Microsoft Azure Maia AI Accelerator and the Microsoft Azure Cobalt CPU. The Maia AI Accelerator is optimized to run artificial intelligence tasks and generative AI. The Cobalt CPU, on the other hand, is capable of running general-purpose compute workloads on the Microsoft Cloud.\n\nOverall, Microsoft Cloud reported $35 billion in revenue, up 35% year-over-year. Like Amazon, Microsoft is also big on forging partnerships with groundbreaking startups. Earlier this year, the company partnered with Mistral AI, an artificial intelligence company based in France. Mistral AI is capable of bridging communication gaps across different languages. Under the partnership, Mistral AI will gain access to Azure's AI infrastructure to help them develop the next generation of large language models.\n\nThe company's efforts in AI do not end here. Two weeks ago, on June 17, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced its efforts to empower scientists with AI-augmented scientific discoveries at companies like Unilever. Its Azure Quantum Elements platform is a groundbreaking addition to Microsoft's suite of AI products. The platform offers two distinct capabilities including Generative Chemistry and Accelerated DTF. The platform is capable of exploring novel molecular structures at groundbreaking speed and scale. Moreover, it can also dissect and simulate chemical and molecular structures. The platform will be able to expedite chemical research, compressing 250 years of research to only 25.\n\n293 investors were bullish on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) at the close of Q1 2024, with total stakes amounting to $88.16 billion. Among them, Michael Larson's Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust was the largest stakeholder with a position worth $15.36 billion. Wall Street is bullish on the stock.\n\nOn June 21, Citigroup maintained a buy rating on the stock and increased its price target from $495 to $520.\n\nHere are some comments about MSFT from Mar Vista Investment Partners' Q1 investor letter:\n\n\"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to occupy a strong position, poised to capture market share as businesses navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven solutions. The company’s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all sizes.\n\nMicrosoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and adoption of AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT, while enhancing productivity and reducing costs. Consequently, we anticipate that Microsoft’s solutions should exhibit resilience even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, supporting low double-digit growth in intrinsic value within our investment horizon.\"\n\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the biggest AI stories right now. You can visit 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Weekto see the other AI stories that are on hedge funds’ radar.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stories.\n\nAre Growing Patents in AI from China a Threat to the US?\n\nChina and the United States continue to compete against each other as the AI boom continues to reign in the tech industry. On July 2, Reuters reported that China plans to develop 50 new national and industrial standards for artificial intelligence by 2026. The country aims to standardize systems in the artificial intelligence sector by providing thorough guidelines to companies and budding startups. Furthermore, on July 3, Reuters reported that China filed six times more patents than the United States for inventions in AI like chatbots. On a global scale, more than 50,000 patent applications were filed in the past decade, a quarter of which were filed in 2023 alone. China filed 38,000 generative AI applications between 2014 and 2023, while the United States only filed slightly over 6,200 applications during the same period. Of the total applications, ByteDance, Alibaba Group, and Microsoft filed the largest number of applications. The report added that Chinese patent applications covered a wider range of sectors such as autonomous driving, publishing, and document management. South Korea, Japan, and India were ranked third, fourth, and fifth with the highest number of patent applications.\n\nThe United States, on the other hand, has reportedly accumulated $55.6 billion in venture capital funding in the second quarter of 2024, the highest quarterly total in two years. On July 3, Reuters reported that the surge in venture capital funding is driven by developments in artificial intelligence. Such is a 47% increase from the $37.8 billion raised by startups in the first quarter of 2024. Significant investments include $6 billion by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion raised by CoreWeave. Previously, venture capital funding took a hit, reporting $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 amid high interest rates and sluggish economic growth. While venture capital and investment in AI are increasing, the IPO market remains sluggish.\n\nOpenAI & Anthropic: A Comparative Analysis\n\nWhile the threat of Chinese innovations looms over the United States, startups in the country are disrupting the industry with key innovations. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is a leading artificial intelligence company based in the United States. In February this year, OpenAI closed a deal with venture capital firm Thrive Capital, allowing it to buy some of its shares in a tender offer, bringing its total valuation to $80 billion. This is a threefold increase in its value from a few months ago in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn June 10, OpenAI and Apple announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Users will now be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities on all these devices without having to switch tools. Siri will also be able to reach ChatGPT when a user asks a question and will present them with an answer directly from the chatbot. ChatGPT will be integrated into Apple's writing tools, allowing users to create content when required. The development ensures that user security remains intact. Requests are not stored by OpenAI and IP addresses remain obscured. Users may connect to their ChatGPT account, allowing them to choose their data preferences. The integration will be executed later this year and can be accessed for free without having to create an account.\n\nIn another update, Apple is reportedly positioned to join OpenAI's board. On July 2, Reuters reported that Apple is set to get an observer role on OpenAI's board, part of the agreement made by the two entities a month ago. Phill Schiller, head of Apple App Store and former marketing chief, was selected for this position. The board agreement will take effect later this year. As of yet, Schiller has not attended any meetings.\n\nAnthropic, OpenAI's direct competitor, is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2021. The company is led by Dario and Daniela Amodei as CEO and president. The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.\n\nClaude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models. The company strongly believes that the initiative will enhance AI safety level assessments, improve safety metrics, and develop infrastructure and tools for evaluations. The safety level assessments will encompass cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, model autonomy, national security risks, and social manipulation.\n\nA lot is going on in the AI space and several companies have emerged as interesting AI stories. We have compiled a list of the most interesting AI stories on Wall Street by studying many reports and publications and watching interviews. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, which was sourced from Insider Monkey's proprietary database that tracks over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 246\n\nMeta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) moves in AI contribute to its ranking as the third biggest AI story on our list. Meta AI, built on Llama 3, is one of the most advanced AI models developed by the company. Meta AI is capable of complex reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding instructions. Like Microsoft, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is also advancing its AI infrastructure capabilities. In April, the company introduced its next generation of custom chips to manage its AI workloads. The new chips will significantly enhance the company's recommendation ads model on Facebook and Instagram. 30% of posts on Facebook and 50% of content on Instagram are delivered by the company's AI recommendation system. The Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) v1 is the company's first inference accelerator designed in-house, capable of handling high-complexity and low-complexity ranking and recommendation models. The company expects expenditure on AI to expand. As per a recent update, the company looks forward to increasing its capital expenditure from $35 billion to $40 billion, driven by large investments in AI, in 2024.\n\nMeta's growth in producing responsible AI models can be attributed to its strong research capabilities. On June 18, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) launched new AI research models to boost innovation at a much larger scale than before. The company released five new models including image-to-text and text-to-music generation models, a prediction model, and a model that detects AI-generated speech. Meta Chameleon is a family of mixed-modal models capable of understanding, processing, and delivering both text and words at the same time. The AI can take any input of text and words to output any combination of text and words required. To replace standard text and idea generation, the company proposed a multi-token prediction approach that would make large language models significantly more efficient. This approach trains models to predict a variety of future words instantly, replacing the common one-at-a-time approach.\n\nJustin Patterson, Keybanc's managing director, recently talked about Meta's position in the market in an interview on Yahoo Finance. He raised his price target from $475 to $540 amid Meta's strong advertising growth. Patterson pointed out that Meta's ad revenue is increasing every quarter which is a reflection of strong demand and he is optimistic about returns from the AI advertising cycle. Overall, Patterson has noticed stronger engagement across all of Meta's platforms due to AI investments and improvements in its ad models.\n\nMETA was held by 246 hedge funds at the close of Q1 2024, with total stakes amounting to $46.92 billion. Of those, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was the highest stakeholder with a position of $7.07 billion.\n\nOn July 3, Loop Capital reiterated a buy rating on the stock and maintained its price target of $550. Based on price targets from 67 analysts, META's median price forecast of $530 represents an upside of almost 4% from its current price of $509.65.\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the biggest AI stories right now. You can visit 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Weekto see the other AI stories that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The revenue growth was driven by strong demand for the NVIDIA Hopper GPU Computing platform. Compute revenue grew by 5x and networking revenue expanded by 3x compared to the previous year. The Hopper GPU is one of the world's first accelerated computing platforms, built with over 80 billion transistors. Nvidia's advancements in AI are accelerating at a rapid pace. On June 19, the company launched the NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX, a set of microservices that enable the development of autonomous machines using AI.\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy Founder, CEO, and Chief Analyst Patrick Moorhead, recently talked about NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in an interview on Yahoo Finance. He positions Nvidia as the primary provider of AI infrastructure systems. He compares Nvidia's position to Cisco, the driver of infrastructure from the internet age in the early 2000s. Moorhead highlights that the company's dominant position is backed by sustained enterprise demand, and he sees nothing changing in the next six to nine months. However, he suggests that to maintain its dominance, Nvidia needs to emphasize growth in enterprise.\n\nAt the close of Q1 2024, 186 investors were bullish on NVDA, with total stakes amounting to $48.3 billion. Of those, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was the highest stakeholder with a position of $18.74 billion.\n\nOn July 1, Morgan Stanley maintained an overweight rating on the stock and raised its price target from $116 to $144.\n\nHere are some comments about Nvidia from the Meridian Funds Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system-on-a-chip units for the mobile computing and automotive markets. The company has experienced strong performance recently due to booming demand for its data center products, particularly those related to artificial intelligence. A major driver of Nvidia’s recent success has been the growing adoption of its GPU accelerators for AI training and inference across various end markets. The company’s GPUs have become an industry standard for training large language models (LLMs), and its networking solutions, such as NVLink and InfiniBand, are critical to maximizing the performance of AI systems. Nvidia’s latest Blackwell GPU platform is expected to further extend its lead in the AI accelerator market, with significant performance and total cost of ownership benefits over its predecessors. As the AI market continues to expand with growing adoption across enterprises and sovereign nations, we expect Nvidia to maintain its dominance and experience sustained growth in its data center business. Beyond data centers, Nvidia has also benefited from strong demand in its gaming business, which has recovered after a period of inventory digestion in 2022. The company’s gaming GPUs have been well-received, and its focus on the high-end market has supported growth in average selling prices. Looking ahead, we expect the gaming market to remain healthy with ongoing growth potential. Nvidia also sees opportunities to diversify its business and foray into new markets, such as automotive and robotics. We continued to hold our position in Nvidia.\"\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the biggest AI stories right now. You can visit 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Weekto see the other AI stories that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other AI stories.\n\nAre Growing Patents in AI from China a Threat to the US?\n\nChina and the United States continue to compete against each other as the AI boom continues to reign in the tech industry. On July 2, Reuters reported that China plans to develop 50 new national and industrial standards for artificial intelligence by 2026. The country aims to standardize systems in the artificial intelligence sector by providing thorough guidelines to companies and budding startups. Furthermore, on July 3, Reuters reported that China filed six times more patents than the United States for inventions in AI like chatbots. On a global scale, more than 50,000 patent applications were filed in the past decade, a quarter of which were filed in 2023 alone. China filed 38,000 generative AI applications between 2014 and 2023, while the United States only filed slightly over 6,200 applications during the same period. Of the total applications, ByteDance, Alibaba Group, and Microsoft filed the largest number of applications. The report added that Chinese patent applications covered a wider range of sectors such as autonomous driving, publishing, and document management. South Korea, Japan, and India were ranked third, fourth, and fifth with the highest number of patent applications.\n\nThe United States, on the other hand, has reportedly accumulated $55.6 billion in venture capital funding in the second quarter of 2024, the highest quarterly total in two years. On July 3, Reuters reported that the surge in venture capital funding is driven by developments in artificial intelligence. Such is a 47% increase from the $37.8 billion raised by startups in the first quarter of 2024. Significant investments include $6 billion by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion raised by CoreWeave. Previously, venture capital funding took a hit, reporting $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 amid high interest rates and sluggish economic growth. While venture capital and investment in AI are increasing, the IPO market remains sluggish.\n\nOpenAI & Anthropic: A Comparative Analysis\n\nWhile the threat of Chinese innovations looms over the United States, startups in the country are disrupting the industry with key innovations. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is a leading artificial intelligence company based in the United States. In February this year, OpenAI closed a deal with venture capital firm Thrive Capital, allowing it to buy some of its shares in a tender offer, bringing its total valuation to $80 billion. This is a threefold increase in its value from a few months ago in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn June 10, OpenAI and Apple announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Users will now be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities on all these devices without having to switch tools. Siri will also be able to reach ChatGPT when a user asks a question and will present them with an answer directly from the chatbot. ChatGPT will be integrated into Apple's writing tools, allowing users to create content when required. The development ensures that user security remains intact. Requests are not stored by OpenAI and IP addresses remain obscured. Users may connect to their ChatGPT account, allowing them to choose their data preferences. The integration will be executed later this year and can be accessed for free without having to create an account.\n\nIn another update, Apple is reportedly positioned to join OpenAI's board. On July 2, Reuters reported that Apple is set to get an observer role on OpenAI's board, part of the agreement made by the two entities a month ago. Phill Schiller, head of Apple App Store and former marketing chief, was selected for this position. The board agreement will take effect later this year. As of yet, Schiller has not attended any meetings.\n\nAnthropic, OpenAI's direct competitor, is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2021. The company is led by Dario and Daniela Amodei as CEO and president. The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.\n\nClaude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models. The company strongly believes that the initiative will enhance AI safety level assessments, improve safety metrics, and develop infrastructure and tools for evaluations. The safety level assessments will encompass cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, model autonomy, national security risks, and social manipulation.\n\nA lot is going on in the AI space and several companies have emerged as interesting AI stories. We have compiled a list of the most interesting AI stories on Wall Street by studying many reports and publications and watching interviews. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, which was sourced from Insider Monkey's proprietary database that tracks over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer service team in an office setting using the company's Customer 360 platform to communicate with customers.\n\nSalesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 154\n\nSalesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is a prominent AI story and a leading cloud provider, contributing to its ranking on our list. The cloud provider is on its way to becoming an AI powerhouse. The company's AI cloud platform can support any large language model and is built on the Einstein GPT Trust Layer. Key AI products by the company include Sales AI, Customer Service AI, Marketing AI, and Commerce AI. In a recent development, MuleSoft, Salesforce's software company that provides integration software to connect data and applications, launched AsyncAPI which is capable of building AI-powered customer experiences in real-time. The launch will facilitate the widespread adoption of event-driven architectures, allowing businesses to respond to real-time events faster.\n\nOverall, the company is now responsible for 250 petabytes of data for its customers, crucial to the AI transition. The company's Data Cloud is rapidly growing to become its next $1 billion cloud. Data Cloud streamlines AI insights and actions for its customers. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) claims that this is its first step to becoming an AI enterprise and is expecting a major tailwind in revenue due to AI adoption.\n\nOverall, at the close of Q1 2024, 154 investors were bullish on the stock, with total stakes amounting to $16.62 billion. Of those, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $3.27 billion.\n\nCRM is a Wall Street favorite. Its median price forecast represents an upside of 15% from current levels.\n\nHere are some comments about Salesforce from Harding Loevner's Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Leading software companies have the advantage of high switching costs and the ability to incorporate new features into products customers already use. For example, Microsoft has added its Copilot chatbot functionality to everything from search (Bing Chat, recently renamed to just Copilot) to coding (GitHub Copilot) and workplace applications (Copilot for Microsoft 365). Software sold by Microsoft and other companies such as Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), SAP, and ServiceNow are also already deeply integrated into their customers’ operations and workflow.\n\nAs large enterprises search for the right balance, Salesforce’s Data Cloud, a flagship offering, is designed to address a critical issue for them so they can make better use of AI tools. After a hectic buildout over the last few years of “data warehouses” and “data lakes”—two types of repositories for storing and processing data—across the various business units of large companies, many companies are left with what feels like islands of trapped data. Data Cloud solves this by creating a single platform to access and leverage all of an enterprise’s data, eliminating the need to constantly duplicate large amounts of information across different platforms. Users are then able to apply generative-AI technology, such as Salesforce’s Einstein tool, to a more comprehensive dataset, which enables them to better glean customers’ intentions, personalize marketing messages, and automate the processing of customer-service requests. As users build these systems, Einstein’s copiloting functionality helps their programmers work more efficiently so that IT departments with limited budgets and manpower can still develop the necessary tools. Salesforce’s management projects that revenue and earnings will climb about 9% and 45%, respectively, in fiscal 2025, citing the company’s operating leverage and cost discipline. We think these figures are achievable given the renewed focus on profitable growth, and so we added to the stock during the quarter.\"\n\nOverall CRM ranks 6th on our list of the biggest AI stories right now. You can visit 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Weekto see the other AI stories that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 124\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks seventh on our list for its contributions to the AI industry. The semiconductor and IT company is behind the AMD Instrict MI300 Series accelerators, which are capable of managing complex AI workloads. These accelerators have high bandwidth memory and a huge memory density. The company's efforts in AI do not stop here. On June 19, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) announced the launch of an AI-backed smart parking solution for Sun Singapore Systems Ltd, one of the biggest smart parking solutions providers in Singapore. The new AI-based solution improves vehicle license plate recognition accuracy, parking spot vacancy detection, and accident detection.\n\nThe company is disrupting a wide array of industries using AI. The company logged $5.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2024. Data center revenue expanded by 80% year-over-year and 2% from the previous quarter to reach $2.3 billion. The growth in data center revenue was driven by shipments of the AMD Instinct MI300X GPU and sales of its CPU. AMD's MI300 became the fastest product to reach $1 billion in sales in less than two quarters. Based on current results, AMD raised its GPU sales forecast to $4 billion for the year from $3.5 billion guided in January. AMD's chips are also a first choice among tech giants. Microsoft, one of the biggest technology companies, recently added AMD AI chips to its computing products.\n\nOverall, at the close of Q1 2024, 124 hedge fund investors held stakes worth $15.63 billion in AMD. Of those, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $5.21 billion.\n\nHere are some comments about AMD from Meridian Funds Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.\"\n\nOverall AMD ranks 7th on our list of the biggest AI stories right now.

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is a leading artificial intelligence company based in the United States. In February this year, OpenAI closed a deal with venture capital firm Thrive Capital, allowing it to buy some of its shares in a tender offer, bringing its total valuation to $80 billion. This is a threefold increase in its value from a few months ago in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn June 10, OpenAI and Apple announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Users will now be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities on all these devices without having to switch tools. Siri will also be able to reach ChatGPT when a user asks a question and will present them with an answer directly from the chatbot. ChatGPT will be integrated into Apple's writing tools, allowing users to create content when required. The development ensures that user security remains intact. Requests are not stored by OpenAI and IP addresses remain obscured. Users may connect to their ChatGPT account, allowing them to choose their data preferences. The integration will be executed later this year and can be accessed for free without having to create an account.\n\nIn another update, Apple is reportedly positioned to join OpenAI's board. On July 2, Reuters reported that Apple is set to get an observer role on OpenAI's board, part of the agreement made by the two entities a month ago.

The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.\n\nClaude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models.

Adobe, the creative giant, has been disrupting the generative AI industry. The company's AI tools allow users to add and remove images, generate high-quality images, create personalized content, and automate workflows. Some of the major products include Adobe Firefly, Adobe Express, Acrobat AI Assistant, and Adobe GenStudio.\n\nThe company's roadmap to becoming an AI creative giant is fierce. On June 27, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) announced that its Adobe Content Hub is now generally available with the Adobe Experience Manager. The Adobe Experience Manager is a digital asset management system home to an entire database of images and videos, used by many Fortune 50 companies. The Adobe Content Hub, on the other hand, is transforming the content creation process and its usage, by providing users with every brand-approved asset at their fingertips. The hub is integrated with Adobe Express and Adobe Firefly, the company's leading all-in-one design and generative AI tools.\n\nAdobe's AI products are highly popular in the market. Adobe Firefly has been used to generate more than 9 billion images since March 2023. In the second quarter of 2024, the company's document cloud segment logged $782 million in revenue, up 19% year-over-year.  Overall, the company expects its generative AI tools and products to gain momentum in the third and fourth quarters of 2024.\n\nAt the close of Q1 2024, 108 investors were bullish on the stock, with total stakes amounting to $9.03 billion. Of those, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $2.28 billion.\n\nOn June 17, Bernstein maintained an outperform rating on the stock and raised its price target from $653 to $660. Overall, the stock has a median price forecast of $625 based on price targets of 45 analysts. This represents an upside of 10% from its current price of $570.15.\n\nHere are some comments about Adobe from Fred Alger Management's Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a diversified software company that provides document and creative software to a wide audience, including creative professionals and enterprises. Its flagship products, such as Photoshop, Acrobat, and Creative Suite, set industry standards like PDF and Flash, supporting a broad range of Adobe applications. As such, we believe Adobe is a primary beneficiary of the digitization (i.e., converting analog information into digital format) spending theme. Recently, the company announced a generative Al (Gen Al) tool called Firefly which is a family of creative GenAl models which will be incorporated into Adobe’s product suite, which can be utilized by consumers and enterprises to potentially save time and effort by automating tasks like image and text generation. We believe Adobe has the potential to leverage Al by integrating software programs into its existing products and enhancing developer Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to facilitate Al-driven workflows. While the company delivered strong fiscal first quarter operating results, shares detracted from performance after management lowered their fiscal second quarter guidance with Al related growth acceleration being pushed out into the second half of 2024 due to difficult year-over-year pricing comparison. particularly within their creative vertical segment.\"\n\nOverall ADBE ranks 9th on our list of the biggest AI stories right now.

(NYSE:DELL) reported results that exceeded earnings expectations and announced a better than expected AI-optimized server order pipeline.

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is widely considered one of the world's best investors. His success spans decades via his holding company, Berkshire Hathway, one of today's largest corporations. Inside Berkshire, Buffett and his team manage a massive stock portfolio worth over $385 billion.\n\nInvestors can learn a lot from following how Berkshire manages it. One clear takeaway is Buffett's affinity for the U.S. consumer. For example, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), American Express(NYSE: AXP), and Kroger(NYSE: KR) combine for over half of the entire portfolio.\n\nHere is what makes these stocks special and why investors can buy and hold them forever.\n\n1. Apple\n\nThe personal electronics giant is Berkshire's largest holding by a country mile. Apple is 43.1% of Berkshire's portfolio despite Buffett trimming shares this past quarter. Buffett has called Apple the second-best business Berkshire owns, pointing to consumers' loyalty to Apple devices. Buffett could be right; there are over 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide today.\n\nApple's product ecosystem is a beast. Not only do consumers buy phones, accessories, and computers every few years to keep up with the latest technology, but there are multiple ways Apple monetizes its users. It sells various subscription services and takes a cut of all money spent on its app store. Collectively, Apple is a financial juggernaut that generates over $381 billion in annual sales and $101 billion in free cash flow.\n\nCEO Tim Cook returns many profits to shareholders like Buffett, paying dividends and repurchasing shares. The company has reduced its share count by a whopping 36% over the past decade alone, which means Berkshire's massive stake represents more ownership in the business. Apple's best growth days might be over, but its generosity in returning cash to shareholders makes it a stock you can tuck away in your long-term portfolio.\n\n2. American Express\n\nBorrowing money has been a core pillar of American consumerism since the credit card was invented decades ago. American Express didn't invent the credit card, but it's one of today's most famous credit card companies. American Express makes money as one of America's four prominent payment networks. It's also a bank that provides financial services and carries the loans people accumulate on their American Express cards.\n\nAmerican Express is famous for its service and lucrative rewards programs. The company ranks first among U.S. card issuers in customer satisfaction. The company is also profitable enough to pay a steadily increasing dividend and has bought back enough stock to retire over 30% of its shares this decade. Again, powerful brands and returning profits to shareholders are classic Buffett stock traits.\n\nStory continues\n\nCredit cards are not going out of style anytime soon. Credit card debt in the United States is at all-time highs. Meanwhile, American Express's management has noted in earnings calls that millennial and Gen Z consumers are its fastest-growing customer demographic. The future looks bright for American Express, so consider adding the name to your long-term portfolio.\n\n3. Kroger\n\nA grocery store chain isn't as flashy as Apple or American Express, but Kroger is every bit a classic Buffett stock. Kroger is the largest-supermarket company in the United States and second only to general retailer Walmart in annual grocery sales. Its store footprint spans over 2,700 stores and multiple brands. Kroger could soon grow larger; the company is battling a lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission over a $24.6 billion merger with Albertsons. If the merger succeeds, Kroger will have over 5,000 locations.\n\nBuffett bought shares in 2019 before the merger came up. The investment thesis is simple: Food and medicine are basic consumer staples. Kroger's business is recession-proof, evidenced by the company's history dating back to the 1800s. Kroger's size gives it a competitive advantage against smaller competitors who can't source products and sell them at prices as low as Kroger's.\n\nIt probably goes without saying at this point, but yes, Kroger generously returns profits to the company's investors. The company's management has raised the dividend by nearly 300% over the past decade while repurchasing over a quarter of its outstanding shares. Whether or not the merger ultimately goes through, Kroger remains a blue chip business worth holding onto.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Wednesday, July 3, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), as well as a micro-cap stock Natural Health Trends Corp. (NHTC).  The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple’s shares have only slightly outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+14.5% vs. +14.3%). The company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. Apple’s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple’s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\r\n\r\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “Magnificent 7” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have far outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+78.1% vs. +32.7%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia/Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platform is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects.\r\n\r\nAI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 150 million monthly actives. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nTesla’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past year (-17.3% vs. -16.9%). The company’s recently shrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts have been plaguing Tesla. Tesla expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023 amid a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market.\r\n\r\nWith competition intensifying in the EV space, Tesla’s focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game-changer. It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its \"robotaxi\" venture.\r\n\r\nThe successful introduction of its Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China amid stiff competition marks a significant win. Additionally, TSLA’s Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving. While near-term challenges persist, long-term prospects appear promising, driven by its big bet on driverless software and AI.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Natural Health Trends have outperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (+25.6% vs. -10.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $79.12 million shows a promising uptick, with an 11% quarterly order rise and a 1% annual increase, suggesting a market and operational recovery.\r\n\r\nDespite a slight revenue drop, cash flow remains positive, supported by prudent financial strategies, including a $0.20 dividend. The company is capitalizing on emerging markets like India, showing substantial growth, and aligning with global e-commerce trends to boost online sales. Strategic initiatives, new products and member incentives such as MetaBoost are aimed at growth and market share.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenges include a significant membership decline, impacting sales potential, and heavy reliance on volatile markets like Hong Kong and China. Additionally, deferred revenue and regulatory risks in key markets pose financial and operational concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on National Health Trends here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Coca-Cola (KO), S&P Global (SPGI) and Realty Income (O).\r\n\r\nMark Vickery\r\nSenior Editor\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "title": "Market Break Out: 3 Leading Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "US stock indexes have staged yet another bullish breakout. The economy is steady, employment is robust, inflation continues to fall, and stocks are making record highs – if you aren’t bullish now, I don’t know what else to tell you. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nStock Market Generals Grow Profits, Show Powerful Momentum\n\nLife can be very easy in this market, as some of the largest and most prevalent companies in the world are still trading at appealing levels.\n\nThe ‘Magnificent 7’ continues to grow earnings at an incredible pace, while the stocks also shows encouraging momentum. Q2 earnings for the ‘Magnificent 7’ companies are expected to be up +25.5% from the same period last year on +13.1% higher revenues, while the stock prices on several of them push YTD highs.\n\nMy favorite names from the Mag 7 currently are Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOGL). Also, Nvidia (NVDA), gets an honorable mention because it too is still a fantastic stock with a top Zacks Rank.\n\nIn the chart below we can see that each of these stocks is showing significant relative strength against the broad market. Apple, although it trails the market YTD, shows the most significant short-term momentum, up 30% in just the last three months. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRising Earnings Trend Lifts Share Price\n\nApple, a consistently successful company with a strong stock performance, is one whose earnings trends I closely monitor. However, over the past two years, earnings revisions have been flat, and while it remains a decent performer, it hasn't delivered any exceptional growth.\n\nNotably, Apple’s earnings revision trend has begun to turn higher for the first time in a while. This is extremely encouraging action, and Apple now enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\n\nAmazon too has seen its earnings revision trend turn higher, giving it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating as well.\n\nApple, Amazon, and Alphabet all have massive tailwinds coming from the AI boom. We learned about Apple’s new AI software integrations, as well as Alphabets new AI agents over the last couple of months, but there are numerous other ways the technology is being used behind the scenes as well.\n\nAt Amazon, its web services business is going to be a huge beneficiary as technology companies ramp up computing power. But AI will also be used at its fulfillment operations, as the massive scale benefits from optimizations. Amazon is also quietly one of the biggest users of new robotics tech, as its operations continue to be automated.\n\nBased on these developments it’s no surprise we are beginning to see analysts raise earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nReasonable Valuations, Especially Alphabet\n\nAlthough Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting a flat earnings revision trend, it still has a lot going for it. It is currently the relatively cheapest stock in the group.\n\nToday, it has a one year forward earnings multiple of 24.4x, which is just above the market average, and below its 10-year median of 26.1x. GOOGL is also expected to grow its EPS 17.5% annually over the next 3-5 years, plans to buy back some $70 billion in shares this year, and is now paying a tidy 0.43% dividend.\n\nAmazon too is trading at a deep historical discount. At 43x forward earnings it is well below its 10-year median of 98.2x, and EPS is forecast to grow 29.6% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nAt 33.4x, Apple is the only one trading above its historical median valuation, but for a company of its quality it is no surprise its earns a premium valuation. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThis bull market continues to charge, fueled by a robust economy, falling inflation, and stellar earnings growth from industry leaders. The \"Magnificent 7\" stands out with their impressive earnings and momentum, offering attractive entry points for investors seeking exposure to top performers.\n\nMoreover, the growing adoption of AI across these companies, particularly in areas like automation and cloud computing, positions them for long-term dominance in the evolving technological landscape. With valuations remaining reasonable and fundamental strength unwavering, this market rally appears poised to extend its winning streak.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "OpenAI’s reported decision to let Apple sit in on its board meetings is very revealing",
        "content": "After last year’s brief, chaotic ouster of CEO Sam Altman, OpenAI reformed its board and key partner Microsoft got a seat as a non-voting observer. Microsoft had been blindsided by the Altman episode, which had been set in motion by the old board, and this was a way of ensuring it wouldn’t get any further nasty surprises from the company into which it had invested $13 billion.\n\nBut now, according to Bloomberg, another non-voting observer is coming: Apple, as represented by App Store chief Phil Schiller. Apple hasn’t invested anything into OpenAI, but it is integrating OpenAI's models into its devices (for free) and Schiller's role is reportedly part of that agreement.\n\nIt’s not hard to see how the situation may become awkward, as Microsoft and Apple are longstanding rivals that will soon both be using OpenAI’s models to power AI assistants on their competing products. Even by the excessively cozy standards of the U.S. AI sector, this may be too close for comfort. There will have to be a lot of recusing going on during certain board discussions, and that might not be enough to make this work.\n\nBut even without considering the potential for future disputes too deeply, there’s quite a lot to digest about the immediate implications of letting Apple observe OpenAI's board meetings.\n\nThe first and most obvious point is that both parties in the Microsoft-OpenAI love-in are increasingly hedging their bets. It’s been clear for a while that Microsoft is doing this—unsurprisingly, given last year’s turmoil. It absorbed key staff from the AI startup Inflection in March and is now reportedly developing a GPT-rivaling AI model of its own, with Inflection cofounder Mustafa Suleyman leading the effort.\n\nRecently, there have also been hints of OpenAI asserting its own independence in the relationship. The Information reported last week that OpenAI is now making more revenue from directly selling access to its models than Microsoft is making doing the same thing. Building ChatGPT into MacBooks and iPhones is also a big deal, but giving Apple an observer role would confirm that OpenAI and Microsoft are not as tightly intertwined as once seemed the case.\n\nConversely, the reported development also suggests that Apple may not be hedging its bets as much as it appeared to be doing just a few weeks ago.\n\nIt didn’t bring Altman on stage for the announcement of the Apple-OpenAI partnership—he was in the audience—and reporting since then has suggested that Apple may yet also incorporate Google and Anthropic’s AI models into its platforms, as alternatives to OpenAI's ChatGPT. But unless it also plans to take observer roles on each of those companies’ boards, Apple seems set to give OpenAI and its technology an elevated status for a long while yet.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis may also say something about Apple’s progress in developing its own top-tier AI models, which should obviate the need for any such partnerships—when they appear, and if they prove competitive.\n\nI asked all three companies for comment, but none has been forthcoming. More news below—and see you on Friday, as Data Sheet will be taking tomorrow off for the U.S. holiday.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prepare yourself for the AI smartphone wars",
        "content": "Smartphone innovation has largely slowed to a crawl over the last few years. We’re long past the days when each successive generation of phones offered up features that drove waves of excitement among consumers, who’d then wait outside the Apple Store.\n\nBut that might be about to change thanks to AI. At least, that’s what smartphone makers hope.\n\nYes, we’re about to enter a new phase of smartphone sales spin. Prepare yourselves for the great AI smartphone war.\n\nTo be fair, smartphone makers have been adding AI and machine learning capabilities to their devices for years — for everything from improving photo quality to intelligent notifications. But generative AI technologies promise a whole new host of innovations ranging from fresh photo-editing tools and content summarization to live translation and transcription features. And, of course, smarter digital assistants.\n\nGoogle kicked things off last year, including AI features with its Pixel 8 line of smartphones. Samsung followed suit earlier this year with its Galaxy AI platform. And now, Apple is preparing to enter the ring with Apple Intelligence, which is set to launch later this fall.\n\nNot to be outdone, Samsung and Google are also preparing their own major product events in the coming weeks that are expected to include even more AI news.\n\nSamsung will host a Galaxy Unpacked event in Paris, France, on July 10, where it’s expected to show off the next generation of its foldable phone lines: the Galaxy Flip and Galaxy Fold. Google will hold its Made by Google keynote in Mountain View, Calif., on Aug. 13, during which it’s likely to show off its latest Pixel phones. Samsung holds a drone show as part of its launch of the Galaxy S24 smartphone line with AI features. (Joe Maher/Getty Images for Samsung) (Joe Maher via Getty Images)\n\nThe thrust behind all of these moves is that AI will provide exciting new functions for your smartphone that were never before possible. It also means you’ll need to cough up some extra cash to get your hands on those features if your phone can’t take advantage of those AI capabilities.\n\nA battle for your attention and wallet\n\nGoogle and Samsung kickstarted the AI smartphone fight, but Apple's impressive response managed to make generative AI look like a far more approachable and consumer-friendly technology.\n\nThe iPhone maker laid out its plans for Apple Intelligence during its June WWDC event, giving developers and fans alike a glimpse at how the software will work across its Photos, Messages, and Mail apps, as well as with its Siri assistant. The company says you’ll be able to do things like ask Siri to pull up specific pictures from the Photos app. So if you want to see a picture of that time you and your friend Susan went to New York, you can ask Siri to show pictures of Susan in New York, and it will surface them for you.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat’s more, Apple says it’s integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its products, giving users access to the chatbot. The company says you’ll also need to give ChatGPT permission to search the web each time you use it, ensuring you know when you’re using Siri and when you’re using ChatGPT. Apple WWDC event where it introduced its Apple Intelligence AI platform. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nApple also spent a significant chunk of its time going over how it intends to preserve its users’ privacy while using Apple Intelligence’s online functionality. It says it won’t share data with OpenAI — and won’t save any private data from users’ interactions with Apple Intelligence.\n\nSamsung is up next with its Unpacked event where, according to its latest advertising blitz, it will show off all-new generative AI options for its phones. So far, the company has mostly shown that its Galaxy AI can pull off some fancy photo-editing tricks and translation services, so it’ll be interesting to see what it has to rival Apple’s announcements.\n\nGoogle, which provides some of its AI know-how to Samsung, is in a similar position. The company let fly with its generative AI-powered smartphones well before Apple, with options to edit photos and videos, but the software felt more scattered than the kind of comprehensive services Apple plans to provide.\n\nNow the company is gearing up for its next Pixel phone launch and specifically pointing to AI as a key aspect of the phones’ functionality. Google uses its Pixel line more as a blueprint for how its Android phone partners can innovate using its various software services. And part of that means proving to customers that its generative AI features can take on Apple Intelligence.\n\nYou can expect all three companies to start making major advertising pushes for their generative AI platforms throughout the fall and holiday shopping season as each tries to prove it’s the better choice for what they’re banking on as the next major paradigm shift in smartphones.\n\nA choice that, ultimately, you and I will get to make.

        "title": "2 Outperforming Big Tech Stocks to Buy This Quarter",
        "content": "Big Tech stocks have had a stranglehold on the stock market so far in 2024, and this summer could be no different. Two stocks in particular, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL), are poised to extend their ascents.\n\nPer Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, AAPL and GOOGL made the list of 25 best-performing S&P 500 Index (SPX) stocks to own this quarter, historically, in the past 10 years. Apple boasts an average quarterly return of 7.6%, with an 80% win rate, while the Google parent is higher 6.8% of the time and has finished the quarter higher nine times in the last decade. Best Stocks Q3\n\nApple stock was last seen trading at $219.55, just below yesterday's record close of $220.38. The shares are 14.3% higher so far in 2024, with support stepping up at their 20-day moving average before a 6% post-earnings bull gap in early May. On the chart below, note the bullish flag pattern that preceded yesterday's 1.6% gain.\n\nGOOGL is trading at $185.24 at last check, a chip shot from its June 27 record high of $186.05. Compared to AAPL, Alphabet shares are up a much more robust 32.1% this year, and also sport a 53.57% year-over-year lead amid a channel of higher highs. Big Tech Best Q3\n\nBoth equities sport attractively priced premiums at the moment, per their respective Schaeffer's Volatility Indexes (SVI) that sit in the bottom 25th percentile of their annual ranges. Where they differ is that AAPL's Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) sits at 79 out of 100, suggesting the security has tended to exceed options traders' volatility expectations during the past year. GOOGL's SVS, meanwhile, sits at 7, making the equity an intriguing premium-selling candidate.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple Hits 52-Week High: Can AI Focus Drive AAPL Stock Higher?",
        "content": "Apple AAPL shares hit a 52-week high of $220.38 on Jul 2 and finally closed at $220.27, up 14.4% year to date. Since Jun 10, when the iPhone maker hosted its annual developers’ event, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple shares have jumped 14.1%, outperforming the Zacks Computer-Mini industry’s gain of 13.8% and the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 5.8%.\r\n\r\nLately, AAPL shares have been gaining attention from investors thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, at WWDC.\r\n\r\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL’s Long-Term Prospects\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has expressed his enthusiasm over the opportunities with Generative AI (GenAI). In the fiscal second-quarter earnings call, Cook stated that Apple enjoys a significant advantage in the AI space due to “Apple’s unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple’s silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy.”\n\nApple’s Performance Since WWDC Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad, and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple’s stringent privacy standards.\r\n\r\nSiri, powered by Apple Intelligence, has become more natural, contextually aware, and capable of handling complex tasks. Users can communicate with Siri using both voice and text, and the assistant can now maintain context across multiple requests. Siri’s new design features an elegant glowing light around the screen edge when active, and its functionality extends to providing device support and answering detailed questions about using the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\r\n\r\nIn a significant enhancement, Apple is integrating ChatGPT into its platforms, allowing users to access its expertise directly within iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia. Siri can utilize ChatGPT’s capabilities, with user consent, to provide more detailed and accurate information. ChatGPT will also be available in the systemwide Writing Tools, enhancing content creation with advanced language models and image generation.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolid Liquidity Supports AAPL’s Shareholder-Friendly Initiative\n\nApple’s strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generating ability are noteworthy. As of Mar 30, 2024, cash & marketable securities were $162.34 billion compared with term debt of $102.59 billion.\r\n\r\nApple returned nearly $27 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 through dividend payouts ($3.7 billion) and share repurchases ($23.5 billion). Its board authorized an additional $110 billion for share repurchases and also raised dividend payout by 4% to 25 cents per share.\n\nStiff Competition, China Worries Hurt AAPL’s Near-Term\n\nChina’s growth remains a worry for Apple due to stiff competition from local smartphone makers, including Huawei. The Chinese government’s directive to state officials not to use non-Chinese phones for work has been detrimental to the iPhone’s demand.\r\n\r\nPer Canalys data, the Mainland China smartphone market witnessed 67.7 million units of shipment in first-quarter 2024. Huawei led with a 17% market share, shipping 11.7 million smartphones, while Apple sold 10 million units, down 25% year over year, the most among the top five vendors.\r\n\r\nThe issues forced Apple to cut retail prices, which drove iPhone smartphone shipments in April (up 52% year over year) and is also expected to have benefited May sales. However, Apple is suffering from a lack of GenAI capabilities in the iPhone.\n\nConclusion\n\nApple’s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $83.75 billion, indicating 2.38% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings has increased by a penny to $1.33 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nPositive Estimate Revision Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMoreover, Apple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 30.63X compared with the Zacks Computer-Mini industry’s 28.58X and higher than the median of 27.37X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple’s AI push is hard to ignore. The Services business has emerged as AAPL’s new cash cow with an expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. An expanding user base of more than 2 billion active devices makes Apple’s investment profile attractive.\n\nMoreover, Apple shares are trading above the 50-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend.\n\nApple Shares Trade Above 50-Day Moving Average Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Because it may also be difficult to find quotations for penny stocks, they may be impossible to accurately price. Investors in penny stock[s] should be prepared for the possibility that they may lose their whole investment.”\n\nSure, penny stocks are attractive at such low prices.

After all, if they’re putting up their own money, they must have a good deal of confidence in their stock.\n\nHere are three potential penny stock moonshots you may want to consider.\n\nAurora Innovation (AUR) the front wheels of a series of cars in a line\n\nSource: lumen-digital / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last time I highlighted an opportunity in Aurora Innovation (NASDAQ:AUR), Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) had just bought about $75 million worth of the AUR stock. Plus, Volvo Autonomous Solutions just unveiled AB Volvo’s (OTCMKTS:VLVLY) first-ever production-ready autonomous truck in Las Vegas — using Aurora Innovation technology.\n\nThat was on June 5, as shares of AUR traded at around $2.15. Today, it’s up to $2.81, where it’s still a long-term buying opportunity.\n\nHelping, Aurora’s involvement with autonomous trucking gives it exposure to a potential $76 billion market opportunity by 2032 from $35.51 billion.\n\nAlso, while the company didn’t report any revenue for its recent quarter, its earnings per share loss of 11 cents was still better than estimates for a loss of 14 cents. Even better, George Soros’ fund recently picked up about 4.5 million shares of AUR in late March. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies also picked up 477,900 shares in late March.\n\nGlobalstar (GSAT) In this photo illustration the Globalstar (GSAT) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can also look at oversold shares of telecommunications infrastructure company, Globalstar (NYSEAMERICAN:GSAT), which currently trades at $1.07. Fueling interest in the stock, director James Monroe III bought 4.51 million shares of GSAT for about $4.8 million on July 1.\n\nHelping, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently said it would expand the capabilities of satellite messaging on the iPhone. “The new iOS 18 update will broaden the availability beyond emergency messaging, and Messages via satellite will be an option when cellular and Wi-Fi connections are not available,” according to SatelliteToday.com.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s great news for GSAT considering it partnered with Apple for the satellite connectivity components.Even better, funds such as Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies recently bought 156,430 shares of GSAT. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management also bought another 38,230 shares.\n\nWith earnings, while its first quarter EPS loss of a penny was just in line with estimates, its revenue of $56.48 million did beat by $1.74 million.\n\nAtossa Genetics (ATOS) a scientist with protective equipment and microscope in a lab, OBSV stock\n\nSource: luchschenF / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first time I mentioned Atossa Genetics (NASDAQ:ATOS), it traded at 75 cents on April 4, 2023. At the moment, it’s up to $1.20, and is still an attractive buy as it pivots from support.\n\nThe company recently posted encouraging data from a Phase 2 study of its drug (Z)-endoxifen as a neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer.\n\nAs noted by the company, the 40mg EVANGELINE data is “extremely encouraging as it shows that (Z)-endoxifen can not only stop ER+ breast cancer from growing, but it can also shrink or eliminate the tumor, as measured by MRI imaging,” said Dr. Steven Quay, Atossa’s President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nEven better, funds have been aggressively buying ATOS. At the end of March, for example, Israel Englander’s Millennium Management increased its stake in ATOS by 2,040%. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Advisors increased its stake by nearly 1,280%. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies increased its stake by about 8% with the addition of 102,100 shares.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day. That’s because these “penny stocks” are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators.

        "title": "Trade of the Day: Buy Long-Expiry Call Options in Sirius XM (SIRI) Stock Ahead of a Short Squeeze",
        "content": "Audio entertainment firm Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) is struggling to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving world. As a result, SIRI stock has fallen almost 44% since the start of the year.\n\nWhat gives? Back in the day, it seemed consumers couldn’t get enough of the satellite radio platform. However, some paradigm shifts materialized that did not favor SIRI stock.\n\nIn particular, Sirius XM was late to embrace digital streaming technologies. That left the company vulnerable to powerhouse players like Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Further, Covid-19 sparking work-from-home initiatives didn’t help.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCircumstances look bleak, let’s just be real.\n\nHowever, it’s worth pointing out that while analysts see fiscal 2024 as a bust – with earnings per share and revenue projected to decline 6.3% and 1.8%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis – a slow recovery could take place beginning in fiscal 2025. That’s when EPS may rise to 32 cents on revenue of $8.95 billion. These figures basically match 2023’s results.\n\nOn paper, the 2025 projections don’t sound particularly impressive. Still, SIRI stock is responding in a big way.\n\nShort Interest Could Shock the Bears\n\nAccording to Barchart’s proprietary Trend Seeker tool, SIRI stock popped up as a “Buy Signal” recommendation on Tuesday. About 24 hours ago, shares gained almost 8%. Further, in the past five sessions, SIRI has gained more than 17%. Notably, MarketWatch’s automated watch list identified the audio entertainment specialist as a prospective opportunity.\n\nDigging into the data, Fintel shows that the short interest of SIRI stock stands at 24.44% of its float. Further, the short interest ratio – or the number of trading sessions required to unwind all short positions based on average volume – came out to almost three days. As a rule of thumb, short interest above 20% is quite high.\n\nFor the bears, what makes this framework problematic is the possibility of unlimited liability. Let’s consider what a direct short position is – a wager against an enterprise. To initiate a short, a speculator must first borrow the underlying equity from a broker. From there, the trader dumps the shares in the hopes of picking them back up later for cheaper.\n\nWhatever is the difference between the sold price and buy-back price when the speculator returns the equities back to the broker is the profit. However, irrespective of whether the shares fall or rise, the trader is contractually obligated to return the borrowed securities.\n\nLong story short, a real panic can materialize if a targeted stock rises sharply in value. That’s the power of the so-called short squeeze.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrade of the Day: Go Long-Expiry SIRI Stock Call Options\n\nI’m going to get right into it. You always acquire Sirius XM shares in the open market. However, to really boost your risk-reward profile, my idea for the Trade of the Day is to buy long-expiry SIRI stock call options. Specifically, I’m looking at the 2024 Jan. 16 $4 call.\n\nSource: Charts by TradingView\n\nIt’s a high-risk wager since single-digit stocks typically don’t have robust volume for their associated derivatives. Still, relatively speaking, the offering is tempting. On Tuesday’s close, the difference between the ask (38 cents) and the bid (35 cents) divided by the midpoint (37 cents) came out to 8.11%.\n\nFurther, the implied volatility (IV) sits at 42.14%, below the historical volatility (HV) of 51.23%. All other things being equal, this dynamic suggests there’s a greater incentive to buy this call rather than to sell it.\n\nHowever, the real kicker for SIRI stock is that the bulls may be targeting the $4 level. That would make sense because it’s a technically significant barometer, which roughly coincides with SIRI’s 200-day moving average. Also, between March 2023 through March 2024, the $4 line has acted as both support and resistance.\n\nSo, don’t be surprised if under a short squeeze, SIRI shoots back up to this milestone.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "title": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock performs better than its underlying earnings growth over last five years",
        "content": "We think all investors should try to buy and hold high quality multi-year winners. While not every stock performs well, when investors win, they can win big. Just think about the savvy investors who held Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares for the last five years, while they gained 338%. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 30% gain in the last three months.\n\nSince it's been a strong week for Apple shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nOver half a decade, Apple managed to grow its earnings per share at 17% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 34% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Apple, it has a TSR of 354% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nApple provided a TSR of 15% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 35% over five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

        "content": "Blue chip stocks represent companies that have stood the test of time and lead in their respective industries. There is certainly a lot of upside to investing in them as they can strengthen your portfolio and, in some cases, reduce your exposure to bad market conditions.\n\nWhether or not you’re new to the stock market, odds are that you probably already know a couple of blue chip stocks. This is because most blue chip stocks are popular names in the mainstream and belong to some of the biggest companies in the world.\n\nYou’ll notice that most of the following blue-chip stocks share similarities. Among them are a history of delivering impressive financial returns and a strong reputation and status as an industry leader. Let’s take a dive into three of the best blue-chip stocks to buy in July 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American technology company based in Silicon Valley, California. It is most famous for its devices, which include mobile phones, tablets and laptops. Also, Apple produces software and services, such as Apple TV, Apple Music, iCloud and iTunes.\n\nThe company has contributed to the technology sector for over 20 years, starting with its innovation of Macintosh computers in the 1980s. That was followed by its introduction of portable media devices, such as the iPod, in the early 2000s. Today, its newer devices, such as the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, have become status symbols in mainstream media as the pinnacle of technological advancement.\n\nA look at Apple’s illustrious history shows that its status as a blue chip stock is undeniable. It is one of the most profitable tech companies in the world, and its recent quarterly report makes this even more evident. According to the report, Apple generated a revenue of $90.8 billion and has authorized an additional $110 billion for share repurchases.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Berkshire Hathaway stock\n\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is an American multinational holding company based in Omaha, Nebraska. The company is best known for its contributions to the investment sector, where it is largely regarded as a major player.

        "title": "AVGO Alert: Why the 10-1 Broadcom Stock Split Could Ignite a Tech Buying Frenzy",
        "content": "In less than two weeks, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) will split its stock by a 10-to-1 ratio. Shares that currently trade for more than $1,600 each will each be worth about $160 a stub.\n\nA stock split changes nothing about a company. An investor could either buy Broadcom stock before or after the division and he would still own the same company.\n\nYet splits are often viewed by the stock market favorably. They signal management believes additional growth and profits are coming.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBy cutting up their shares into smaller pieces, they also make the stock available to more investors. Not everyone has $1,600 to buy a single share!\n\nYet a stock split is not enough of a reason to buy a company. Over the long haul, the value of a stock is determined by its earnings, not its price.\n\nSo with Broadcom ready to decimate its stock price (using the original meaning of the word “decimate,” or to reduce by one-tenth), let’s review the facts to see if this tech growth stock is worth buying regardless of when you do.\n\nA Closer Look at Broadcom Stock\n\nBroadcom stock used to be bought because it was the premier provider of mobile device chipsets, primarily to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The consumer electronics maker accounts for 20% of all of Broadcom’s $28 billion in annual revenue, or about $5.6 billion.\n\nTo put that in perspective, Broadcom’s top five customers represent 35% of revenue so Apple’s contribution is huge.\n\nWhile mobile device chips are still a significant portion of the chipmaker’s business, more recently Broadcom began focusing on data center infrastructure, such as Ethernet switching and routing silicon.\n\nIt is there where it should get a competitive edge to give the company a substantial runway for future growth.\n\nThe chipmaker is seeing tremendous growth in AI chip sales. They are outpacing the sales of non-AI chip sales, which are on the decline.\n\nCustom AI accelerators and merchant networking chips helped boost AI chip sales 35% in the first quarter. Non-AI chips, on the other hand, dropped 30% year-over-year.\n\nBroadcom anticipates AI chips to bring in $11 billion in revenue this year, representing 25% of total sales. That’s up from 15% in 2023. Management increased its full-year revenue guidance to $51 billion, almost all of it driven by AI.\n\nBroadcom’s Networking Advantage\n\nBroadcom’s competitive edge in networking will be driven by the increased use among hyperscalers of AI clusters.\n\nCEO Hock Tan told analysts during the company’s earnings conference call that “seven of the largest eight AI clusters in deployment today use Broadcom Ethernet solutions.”\n\nStory continues\n\nEthernet switching should become more prominent and take more market share within the generative AI framework.\n\nCompared to traditional front-end networks connecting general purpose servers, we should see AI accelerators grow in importance in back-end network. This is where Broadcom will shine and see its business grow.\n\nAgain, Tan told analysts, “we now expect networking revenue to grow 40% year on year, compared to our prior guidance of over 35% growth.”\n\nBecause of its wireless chip business, but especially due to its work in networking, it has a large and growing competitive edge over the competition.\n\nA Full Complement of Growth Opportunities\n\nThe short answer to whether Broadcom stock is a buy either before or after its stock split is yes.\n\nIts relationship with Apple remains solid regardless of the tech stock’s own AI chip ambitions. Broadcom sells thin-film bulk acoustic resonators filters exclusively to Apple.\n\nPlus, they are included in every iPhone sold. It was only a year ago that Apple and Broadcom signed a multiyear, multibillion-dollar agreement to develop 5G radio frequency components and other wireless connectivity components for the mobile device.\n\nThe networking solutions it is developing as discussed above will provide an exceptionally strong growth component to the business. It will only add to the potential for Broadcom stock.\n\nAdd in the chipmaker’s software business, which it greatly enhanced after acquiring VMware, and you have a complete package of opportunities for massive gains.\n\nAlthough Broadcom stock is premium priced at current valuations, it is worth the cost. That is regardless of whether the stock is selling for $1,600 a share or $160 a share.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Make Up 35.9% of the Entire Nasdaq-100 Index",
        "content": "The Nasdaq-100 index is made up of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. It's often used as a barometer for the performance of the technology sector, but it also features stocks from the retail, healthcare, transportation, and media industries.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 is weighted by market capitalization, which means larger companies have a greater influence over its performance than smaller companies. The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving a surge in the value of some of America's trillion-dollar tech stocks, and the following five now make up 35.9% of the entire index:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has a market cap of $3.3 trillion. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a market cap of $3.2 trillion. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has a market cap of $3 trillion. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a market cap of $2.2 trillion. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has a market cap of $2 trillion.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 is up 18.9% so far in 2024. However, the Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted index -- which assigns the same representation to all 100 companies regardless of size -- is up just 6.2%. The difference can be explained (in part) by the outperformance of the above five stocks, which have delivered an average return of 47.3% year to date.\n\nEach of the five companies has a track record of success spanning decades, and they are now deploying their vast financial resources to dominate the fast-growing AI industry. If they succeed, they could have an even greater influence over the Nasdaq-100 in the future.\n\n1. Microsoft: 8.71% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nMicrosoft is the world's largest company, which is an impressive feat given it was founded way back in 1975. To maintain its near 50-year track record of success, Microsoft had to expand beyond its roots in software development by moving into other growth industries like gaming, cloud computing, and now, AI.\n\nMicrosoft agreed to invest $10 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI last year, and it used the start-up's latest GPT-4 models to develop its own virtual assistant called Copilot. It's capable of answering complex questions, and generating text, images, and computer code on command. Copilot is now integrated into some of Microsoft's flagship products including Windows, Edge, Bing, and 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more), to help businesses and consumers increase their productivity.\n\nEnterprises can also access OpenAI's models through the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, which they can use to develop their own AI applications. Microsoft says 65% of the Fortune 500 companies are already using Azure OpenAI Service, which speaks to the surging demand for this new technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft is a widely recognized leader in AI, and the company is likely to continue creating value for investors over the long term.\n\n2. Apple: 8.5% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, which includes the flagship iPhone, the iPad, and the Mac line of computers. Apple recently announced its own AI software called Apple Intelligence, which was developed in partnership with OpenAI, and it could make the company the world's largest distributor of AI to consumers.\n\nApple Intelligence is expected to launch with the iOS 18 operating system in September. It will transform existing Apple features like the Siri voice assistant, which will draw on the powerful capabilities of ChatGPT. Plus, users will be able to instantly craft text content inside writing tools like Notes, iMessage, and Mail.\n\nApple Intelligence could drive a significant upgrade cycle when the new iPhone 16 smartphone is released later this year, which is expected to come with a new chipset designed specifically for processing AI workloads on-device. Apple's gigantic installed base places it at the forefront of AI's shift away from the data center and into the devices we use each day.\n\n3. Nvidia: 7.89% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nNvidia was a $360 billion company at the start of 2023. In just the last 18 months, it added $2.7 trillion to its market cap to join the $3 trillion club alongside Apple and Microsoft. The company's incredible growth stems from surging demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) for the data center, which are the best in the world for training and inferencing AI models.\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU set the industry benchmark, but the company is gearing up to ship a new generation of chips based on its more advanced Blackwell architecture. Its upcoming GB200, for example, can inference AI models 5 times faster than the H100, which could save developers substantial amounts of money as they typically pay for computing capacity by the minute.\n\nNvidia's data center revenue soared 427% year over year during the recent fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), coming in at a record $22.6 billion. Competition is ramping up but Nvidia remains comfortably ahead, so its run of success looks set to continue (at least in the near term).\n\n4. Alphabet: 5.54% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nAlphabet is the tech conglomerate behind Google, YouTube, Waymo, DeepMind, and more. Google Search remains the organization's largest source of revenue, and considering it has been the window to the internet for over two decades, it arguably has more valuable data with which to develop AI than any other company.\n\nAlphabet has developed a series of AI models, culminating in Gemini, which is designed to compete with OpenAI's GPT-4. Gemini operates as a stand-alone chatbot, but it can also be integrated into popular Google Workspace applications like Docs, Sheets, and Gmail for an extra fee, allowing users to rapidly craft content and boost their productivity.\n\nGoogle Search now also uses generative AI to deliver text-based responses to queries, saving users from having to sift through web pages looking for answers. It's helping to fend off threats from competitors like Microsoft Bing, which is powered by ChatGPT.\n\nInvestors seem to appreciate Alphabet's AI progress, because they have catapulted its stock to an all-time high this year and right into the $2 trillion club.\n\n5. Amazon: 5.33% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nAmazon is one of the most versatile AI companies. The technology powers the recommendation engine on its globally dominant e-commerce website, amazon.com, which learns what products customers like to buy and shows them similar ones in an effort to boost sales. Plus, it offers sellers a suite of AI tools to help them craft more engaging product descriptions, images, and advertisements.\n\nAmazon is also home to the world's largest cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which designed its own AI data center chips, called Trainium and Inferentia; its own family of large language models (LLMs), called Titan; and even its own virtual assistant, called Amazon Q. Plus, Amazon invested $4 billion in leading AI start-up Anthropic, which now uses AWS as its primary cloud provider and has committed to training its future models using Amazon's chips.\n\nAmazon hopes this will entice other start-ups and AI developers into the AWS ecosystem, giving it the edge over competitors like Microsoft Azure.\n\nAmazon's valuation surpassed $2 trillion just last week on the back of its surging stock, which currently trades near an all-time high. That momentum is likely to build as the company reaps more rewards from its aggressive expansion into AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM): The Best Stock Pick By Billionaire Phillipe Laffont?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of Billionaire Phillipe Laffont’s Top 10 “Mostly AI” Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against Philippe Laffont's other stock picks.\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont is a Founder & Portfolio Manager at Coatue Management, L.L.C. His fund’s top 10 holdings comprise of mostly tech stocks which depicts his love for technology. His thirst for technology was such that after graduating from MIT with a computer science degree he applied for a job at Apple multiple times but was rejected every time. This pushed him towards another calling, which was to manage a hedge fund and its holdings.\n\nPhilippe Laffont’s journey towards investing started when he moved to Spain where he started working at McKinsey. It was at this time when he learned about the “boom of the PC” and about the three pioneers of PC industry namely IBM, Dell and Microsoft. He decided to invest in these stocks which churned out more money than he was earning at that time. This led to his endeavors as an investor. In order to learn more about being an investor he got a chance to work at a mutual fund without pay where he learned about different terminologies related to the industry to “get his foot in the door”.\n\nAfter his employment ended in Julian Robertson’s organization, he moved on to gather funds to start investing from his friends and family but most of his funds came from professional brokers and people who admired his entrepreneurial spirit. This led to the launch of his company on January 1, 2000, with $50 million at its disposal and the fund's AUM now stands at $50 billion. His investment philosophy is to provide longevity and good returns for the investors; and to have investors that would bet on him for the long term. Philippe Laffont’s philosophy of helping out people is visible in his efforts to advise people on investing and he believes in helping any new tech “kid” that could become the next Tiktok.\n\nIn his interview at the Bloomberg Invest Philippe Laffont said that he is conflicted about whether small or big companies will be the AI winners. According to him the history of technology indicates that the big gets bigger but new companies have also made it through like Facebook or TikTok. He thinks that AI isn't overhyped and the valuations aren't out of whack right now. Here is what he said:\n\n\"It's true that the mentions of AI in every TV and and written form is very high. And so one could say, Wow, if everybody talks about it, it must be priced in. And the only reason why more positive is I remember when I invested in Apple in 2009 when the iPhone first came out and for years people told me, Why are you invested in Apple? Everybody talks about Apple. And obviously it had an incredible run. So I actually think that sometimes because someone speaks a lot about something, it might be actually a good sign versus an overhyped sign.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPhilippe Laffont thinks the next phase of AI will be real estate with data centers and especially utilities with power. Another phase of AI, according to Philippe Laffont would be robots with artificial brains called humanoids. The technology hedge fund manager also made the following prediction which has a huge implication for the semiconductor stocks:\n\n\"I've made a lot of mistakes, You know, betting on these new technologies like AR/VR turns out to be not so big. 3D printing turns out to be not so big. My estimate is $100 trillion was invested in today's dollar in the PC, CPU based infrastructure. All this is going to get ripped out to put $100 trillion or more in our GPU based infrastructure.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of Coatue Management at the end of the first quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the first quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe. Is TSM Stock a Good Long Term Buy?\n\nA close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) as the biggest foundry enjoys over 50% market share with some of the world’s most advanced chips in its arsenal, including 2nm and 3nm nodes. It supplies chips to major players like Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Nvidia (NVDA). However, analysts have lowered its valuation on the premise that its business could be affected by any future possible conflict between China and Taiwan as it relies heavily on international supply chains. Philippe Laffont cited this geopolitical risk in his interview saying \"That Capex of TSM is in Taiwan, and so at the leading edge a lot of capacity is in one very small area. Forget that it's just in China, it's in a very small area. I think that's very risky.\" Nevertheless, Bank of America Brad Lin increased the earnings and price target estimate since he believes that TSMC is the “key beneficiary and enabler of AI prosperity.”\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) with 29 million shares worth more than $3 billion. Philippe Laffont's fund holds 10 million shares worth $1.4 billion.\n\nBaron Emerging Markets Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed in the first quarter due to investor expectations for a continued strong cyclical recovery in semiconductors and significant incremental demand for AI chips. We retain conviction that Taiwan Semiconductor’s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, 5G, and IoT, will allow the company to sustain strong double-digit earnings growth over the next several years.”\n\nOverall TSM ranks 5th on our list of billionaire Phillipe Laffont's top stock picks. You can visit Billionaire Phillipe Laffont’s Top 10 “Mostly AI” Stock Picksto see the other stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The iPhone maker wants the nation’s highest court to strike references to Apple’s “dominant position” from a decision written by a lower court, which in May tossed out the lawsuit due to a lack of evidence. It’s also objecting to a phrase suggesting “unfair pricing may hurt consumers.”\n\nApple appears to be trying to play down its market position in China, where it’s often neck-and-neck with Huawei Technologies Co. and other high-end smartphone makers at the top of quarterly shipment rankings. The characterization of Apple’s “dominance” — in an official court decision — may get cited in future filings or cases at a time when regulators globally are closely scrutinizing tech giants. At issue is the fee that Apple and its rivals charge developers for hosting their apps on the store — as high as 50% in the case of popular Android mobile games in China, versus a general 30% in much of the rest of the world.\n\nApple’s unusual move to try and alter the language of a decision already in its favor reflects its delicate position in China — both its largest international market and biggest production base. The company is grappling with resurgent rival Huawei and the uncertainty of a ban on the use of foreign devices in many state firms and agencies. Globally, Apple and Google — which runs the Android app store — have been forced to defend app store policies to regulators in Europe and the US.\n\nApple is defending its fees on multiple fronts, including a lawsuit at home in the US and via challenges in Europe, South Korea and Japan. It has consistently argued its commissions are justified by the security and peace of mind that the app store provides users, while giving developers a global showcase.\n\nIn May, a Shanghai court dismissed a lawsuit over that practice, after ruling there was insufficient evidence to show Apple had abused its status. The plaintiff in that case accused Apple of abusing its market position, both with a 30% commission on in-app purchases and by restricting payment methods.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn Apple representative didn’t respond to requests for comment. The plaintiff — surnamed Jin — submitted a separate appeal in which she argued Apple is charging a fee in China that is higher than in Europe and the US, and that the iPhone maker was suppressing transactions through its policies.\n\nThe ruling coincides with moves by major Chinese developers and store operators to try and change the dynamics of the domestic app ecosystem.\n\nIn June, Tencent Holdings Ltd. made a surprise move to pull hit game DnF Mobile off Android app stores operated by Chinese smartphone makers including Huawei and Oppo, citing unspecified “adjustments” in their collaborations. Tencent executives have long expressed frustration over the up-to-50% cut those app platforms take from in-game purchases.\n\nAt the same time, Huawei is considering taking a cut of in-app purchases on its own Harmony mobile operating system, levying a fee for the first time as its smartphones grab market share from Apple.\n\n--With assistance from Jessica Sui.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina’s Investment Bankers Join the Communist Party as Morale (and Paychecks) Shrink Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America The Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before For Tesla, a Smaller Drop in Sales Is Something to Celebrate Japan’s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. will get an observer role on OpenAI’s board as part of a landmark agreement announced last month, further tightening ties between the once-unlikely partners.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDemocrats Weigh Mid-July Vote to Formally Tap Biden as Nominee Powerful Storm Beryl Aims at Jamaica After Grenada Strike S&P 500 Closes Above 5,500 in Record-Breaking Run: Markets Wrap ‘Upflation’ Is the New Retail Trend Driving Up Prices for US Consumers Trump Immunity Ruling Means Any Trial Before Election Unlikely\n\nPhil Schiller, the head of Apple’s App Store and its former marketing chief, was chosen for the position, according to people familiar with the situation. As a board observer, he won’t be serving as a full-fledged director, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter isn’t public.\n\nThe move follows Apple’s announcement in June that it would offer ChatGPT in the iPhone, iPad and Mac as part of a suite of artificial intelligence features. The board arrangement will take effect later this year, and Schiller hasn’t yet attended any meetings, according to the people. Details of the situation could still change.\n\nThe board observer role will put Apple on par with Microsoft Corp., OpenAI’s biggest backer and its main AI technology provider. The job allows someone to attend board meetings without being able to vote or exercise other director powers. Observers, however, do gain insights into how decisions are made at the company.\n\nRepresentatives for Apple and OpenAI declined to comment.\n\nHaving Microsoft and Apple sit in on board meetings could create complications for the tech giants, which have been rivals and partners over the decades. Some OpenAI board meetings will likely discuss future AI initiatives between OpenAI and Microsoft — deliberations that the latter company may want Schiller excluded from. Board observers often do oblige and exit meetings during discussions that are seen as sensitive.\n\nThough Schiller doesn’t lead Apple’s artificial intelligence initiatives, his veteran role as a steward of the company’s brand makes him well-suited to the observer job. The 64-year-old stepped down as head of marketing in 2020, and his current title is Apple Fellow. In addition to overseeing the App Store, he still manages the company’s product launch events. Outside of Apple, he’s a director at medical technology company Illumina Inc.\n\nWith the OpenAI partnership, Apple is teaming up with the biggest and most influential AI startup — but also a business known for controversy and upheaval. OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman was briefly ousted last year over concerns that he wasn’t candid enough with the board. The company also has drawn criticism for downplaying AI safety fears and using a digital voice that sounded similar to actress Scarlett Johansson without an agreement.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe OpenAI integration is one component of Apple’s overall AI strategy, which also includes in-house features. Its technology — called Apple Intelligence — summarizes articles and notifications, creates custom emojis and images, and transcribes voice memos. The effort also includes a revamped version of Apple’s Siri digital assistant, but many of those enhancements won’t arrive until next year.\n\nApple’s partnership with OpenAI isn’t a financial arrangement, at least for now. Instead of money changing hands, OpenAI is getting access to hundreds of millions of potential users. For its part, Apple gains a chatbot feature that many consumers are clamoring for. Users also will be able to access a paid version of ChatGPT on Apple devices, and that could generate App Store fees for the iPhone maker.\n\nApple remains in discussions with Alphabet Inc.’s Google and startup Anthropic about offering additional chatbots to customers. It’s also discussing potential agreements with Baidu Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to bring its AI features to devices in China. Apple Intelligence will launch initially in American English before an international rollout.\n\nTop Apple executives frequently serve as directors of other companies, but joining the board of a high-profile partner is rare. Apple, did, however, briefly hold a board seat at DiDi Global Inc. after investing $1 billion in the China-based Uber rival.\n\n--With assistance from Shirin Ghaffary.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nOnline Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America The Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before Japan’s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found The FBI’s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\n(Reuters) - The former senior Apple lawyer who avoided prison time after pleading guilty to insider trading must pay a $1.15 million fine in a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil case, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Martini in Newark, New Jersey, said that while Gene Levoff \"was not living excessively, his violations were nonetheless especially egregious\" given the lawyer's former role enforcing Apple's insider trading policies.\n\nLevoff had been senior director of corporate law at Apple before the iPhone maker fired him in September 2018.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nProsecutors charged him five months later with making stock trades based on advance nonpublic information about Cupertino, California-based Apple's earnings announcements.\n\nLevoff pleaded guilty to securities fraud in June 2022, and was sentenced by Martini in December to four years of probation, 2,000 hours of community service and a $604,000 forfeiture.\n\nThe proposed SEC fine was triple Levoff's estimated $384,400 profit or avoided losses on six trades.\n\nIn court papers, Levoff called the fine unnecessary, saying he had been punished enough and made no effort to hide his stress-induced trading, which he labeled \"self-sabotage.\"\n\nBut the judge said Levoff, a Stanford University law school graduate, knew his trading was wrong, and could handle the fine given his estimated $13 million net worth.\n\n\"Regardless of why he was trying to get caught, he acted knowingly and willfully,\" Martini wrote.\n\nKevin Marino, a lawyer for Levoff, said in an email: \"We are of course disappointed, but Judge Martini has been fair and even-handed throughout this case and we respect his decision. Mr. Levoff is pleased to put this matter behind him and move on with his life.\"\n\nThe case is SEC v Levoff, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 19-05536.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Richard Chang)",

        "title": "3 AI Stock Winners Defying Tech Sector Turbulence",
        "content": "With the kick-off of the year’s second half underway, investors may wonder if the same themes that outperformed in the first half will continue to work. Undoubtedly, AI chip stocks will still stand out as exciting growth bets for investors looking to play the technological revolution.\n\nGiven the likelihood that the artificial intelligence (AI) boom will extend for many years, it’s probably a tad too soon to dump your biggest AI winners just because the first half saw a slight uptick in volatility.\n\nIndeed, for long-term benefit growth in AI, investors will need to face volatility head on. This is not just on a weekly basis, but perhaps over a quarterly basis.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStaying invested in the top AI stocks will entail plenty of turbulence along the way. An example is the odd 15-20% correction like the one recently experienced by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Perhaps expect the near halving of a stock if fear becomes the main emotion on Wall Street.\n\nEither way, let’s examine three stocks that have defied recent tech turbulence and could continue doing for 2024’s second half.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nDespite posting a remarkably strong finish to the second half, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares still trailed the performance of the Nasdaq 100 year-to-date (YTD). With an explosive first day to the second half, with AAPL stock surging close to 5% on July 1, perhaps Apple could be in a position to lead tech higher.\n\nToday, AAPL shares are at new all-time highs, $220 per share, while NVDA stock is off more than 8% after running into a speed bump in June. Indeed, Nvidia was in the driver’s seat of tech and AI in the first half. For the second half, I view Apple as having the better, perhaps less-appreciated catalysts. And these may fuel a second-half surge that could be tops for the Magnificent Seven.\n\nIt’s not just the coming AI features on iOS 18 and the positive impact on iPhone sales, either. Apple seems to be catching a break in China for a change. A Bloomberg report recently noted that iPhone shipments rose 40% for the month of May. Prior discounts seem to have worked in a big way.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) ChatGPT logo seen on the smartphone, Microsoft (MSFT) logo seen on the laptop. Microsoft Copilot\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another tech titan that’s stood tall in the face of slight turbulence. MSFT stock is at new highs of $458.79 per share, with June turbulence barely affecting the $3.4 trillion tech and AI behemoth.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives views Microsoft (as well as Nvidia) as driving the AI revolution. He’s certainly not wrong. These two AI stocks are at the very top of their class right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nIves sees Microsoft as driving a “Bugatti” (a really, really fast car) at “100 mph” in the AI race, where most of its peers drive markedly slower cars. Specifically, Ives noted that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) drives a mere “minivan.” That’s an interesting analogy that tells the story of current happenings in AI.\n\nAs AI supercharges the Azure cloud business, Amazon may struggle to stay atop the cloud. Recently, Amazon Web Services (AWS) doubled the value of credits for startups, which may suggest worry over Microsoft’s cloud momentum. In any case, Microsoft looks unstoppable and perhaps still somewhat affordable, even as the trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio flirts with 40 times.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) Image of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise's building\n\nSource: zakiahza / Shutterstock.com\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprises (NYSE:HPE) stock has been holding strong after some late-June turbulence.\n\nOver the past month, HPE stock has risen more than 18%, marking an impressive finish to the first half, which saw HPE surge close to 25%.

        "title": "PayPal Stock Analysis: The One Threat You Can’t Afford to Ignore",
        "content": "If you’re reluctant to invest in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), that’s understandable. It’s difficult for PayPal to protect its market share in the crowded and highly competitive fintech space. However, a moderately sized portfolio position in PayPal stock could still offer excellent returns over the long term.\n\nMy previous analysis of PayPal suggested the share price will easily reach $90. Today, in light of a well-known technology company’s intentions in the payments-processing market, I’m moderating my bullish stance. In other words, PayPal is still a great company, but it’s too risky to overload your portfolio with PayPal shares right now.\n\nPayPal’s Notable New Hire\n\nPayPal CEO Alex Chriss called 2024 a “transition year” for the company. As you might expect, the “transition” will include shifting PayPal’s focus toward artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat’s easier said than done, so PayPal is getting some help from a highly experienced executive. Specifically, the company appointed Srini Venkatesan as PayPal’s new chief technology officer (CTO).\n\nVenkatesan has previous experience at Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Yahoo! and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Chriss emphasized that Venkatesan’s “experience leading technology, digital transformation, and AI personalization from inside some of our largest customers and partners will be invaluable” to PayPal.\n\nIt’s a hire that PayPal’s shareholders can celebrate. It shows that Chriss and PayPal are serious about the company’s “transition” and focus on AI-enhanced services. Hopefully, Venkatesan’s positive influence will show up in PayPal’s upcoming quarterly reports.\n\nA Major Threat to PayPal\n\nMaybe you remember a time when PayPal was among a small handful of players in the payments-processing space. For a while, it seemed that old-fashioned credit-card companies were PayPal’s only real competition.\n\nIn the 2020s, however, there’s a technology juggernaut seeking to steal PayPal’s share of the market. Of course, I’m referring to the one and only Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nNot long ago, Barron’s reported that Apple revealed a “way to simplify transferring money through Apple Cash” at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). In particular, iPhone users who use iOS 18 “will be able to tap phones with someone else, and swap Apple Cash without having to share personal information.”\n\nThis is a problem for PayPal that investors can’t easily ignore. Analysts certainly aren’t overlooking the competitive threats to PayPal. For example, Goldman Sachs analysts are “cautious on branded checkout competitive dynamics longer term, as mobile-based wallets continue to gain share.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a similar vein, Threadneedle founder Ann Berry is concerned that PayPal “should be winning on gaining share.” Berry and the Goldman Sachs analysts didn’t mention Apple by name in those quotes, but there’s no denying that Apple has the resources to cause ongoing competitive problems for PayPal.\n\nPayPal Stock: Still a Good Value but Be Careful\n\nWith a GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.66x, PayPal certainly isn’t overvalued. Plus, PayPal and Chriss are making a smart move by hiring technology-industry veteran Venkatesan.\n\nOn the other hand, I’m reluctant to go full-on bullish about PayPal now. The Apple threat will be a serious, ongoing issue for PayPal.\n\nTherefore, investors should mitigate their risk by only holding a small portfolio position in PayPal stock. Furthermore, for diversification’s sake, it’s not a terrible idea to balance out your PayPal share position with some Apple stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation",
        "content": "Ever since the Federal Reserve went on a crusade to increase interest rates and slow the progression of inflation at the beginning of 2022, investors have been cheering for a Goldilocks-type of economic soft landing. Last month, this narrative remained intact.\n\nThe S&P 500 index surged +3.5% for the month, the technology-heavy NASDAQ rocketed +6.0% (fueled by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other AI-related companies), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average a more modest +1.1% move thanks to the contribution of older economy stocks.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nDespite the looming presidential election this November and the recent debate, the stock market has continued on a +56% bull market tear since the October 2023-low, eight months ago (see chart below). The not-too-hot, not-too-cold economic data have provided comfort to investors. For example, growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the broadest measurement of economic activity, was positive (+1.4%) during the first quarter and it is expected to modestly accelerate in the second quarter (+2.2%), as forecasted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nIn addition, the job and inflation stories are staying consistent with the soft landing plot line, as well. The unemployment rate has been creeping higher, but currently remains near multi-decade lows at 4.0%. Inflation also continued its downward trend as evidenced by last week's Core PCE inflation data (the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge), which came in at +2.6%, the lowest level since March of 2021 (see chart below). Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nGasoline and food costs are significant inputs to the overall declining inflation dynamics. The two largest crops in the United States are corn and soybeans, and with those prices down significantly year-over-year (see chart below), it should come as no surprise that consumers are finally seeing some relief in skyrocketing food prices. Declining gasoline prices have also chipped-in to the improving inflation outlook. Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nWith all these economic statistics harmoniously aligning with a soft landing scenario, investors are currently comfortable in forecasting one interest rate cut over the next six months, and three and a half interest rate cuts over the next 12 months (see chart below). Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nSource:Yardeni Research\n\nBut a bull market cannot survive on interest rate cut expectations alone. Over the long-run, stock prices generally follow the direction of corporate profits, and as the chart below indicates (red line), fortunately, the path of profits has been rising after a period of stagnation last year.\n\nStory continues Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nSource: Yardeni Research\n\nThe last eight months have been an exhilarating ride in the overall stock market, which has been propelled by the multi-trillion dollar technology companies participating in the A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) buildout revolution (i.e., NVIDIA, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet-Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), et.al.). However, neither trees nor stock markets can grow, uninterrupted, to the sky forever. The recent environment has been jubilant for investors, but party participants cannot go on forever without experiencing a hangover. The best advice is to celebrate responsibly, while managing the risk of your investment portfolio, because eventually the cops will arrive and the party will come to an end.\n\nThis article is an excerpt from a previously released Sidoxia Capital Management complimentary newsletter (July 1, 2024).\n\nDISCLOSURE: Sidoxia Capital Management (SCM) and some of its clients hold positions in individual stocks , certain exchange traded funds (ETFs), including NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL, META, and AMZN but at the time of publishing had no direct position in any other security referenced in this article.

Nvidia's stock currently trades at a hearty 21x estimated forward sales, up from 12x just two months ago.\n\nMeanwhile, the stock recently traded at roughly 100% above its 200-day moving average.\n\nIn May, Nvidia reported above-consensus results for the quarter, with hosts of positive fodder for the bulls. Nvidia execs called out that demand for AI chips would continue to outstrip supply well into 2025.\n\nThe company is now beginning to build out AI factories, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told Julie Hyman and Dan Howley.\n\n\"Now you have software to think of, you have automotive to think of, you have robotics to think of, and that's already pushing us easily past $10 trillion [market cap for Nvidia] by 2030,\" I/O Fund lead tech analyst Beth Kindig toldSeana Smith and Brad Smith on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief.\n\nNothing is guaranteed in tech land, Danes reminds the investing masses.\n\n“I’d love to pretend like I know exactly where AI is going over the next five years,” he said. “We’re all trying to understand and put the pieces together to derive investment theories and action in our client accounts.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn an episode of 'Opening Bid', Bradesco head of equity strategy Ben Laidler makes the case for a 100% gain in the S&P 500 over the next five years.

        "title": "Investors have found peace in another Trump presidency",
        "content": "Investors are keeping calm and carrying on, as thoughts of a second Donald Trump presidency begin to percolate amid President Joe Biden's prime-time debate debacle.\n\n\"The one takeaway from the debate last week was the market has sort of made its peace with Donald Trump being the next president,\" Bradesco head of equity strategy Ben Laidler said on my 'Opening Bid' podcast (video above or listen here). \"We saw markets sort of edge up a little bit and we didn't see that volatility.\"\n\nTrump and Biden left debate-watchers stunned, with the former spewing falsehoods and the latter appearing frail and out of touch.\n\nSince the debate aired the evening of June 27 though, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average are only down fractionally.\n\nShares of market leader Apple (AAPL) have gained about 1.6%, while Amazon (AMZN) has seen its stock trade sideways.\n\nMorgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson says he received client interest to rotate into 2016 \"Trump Trades\" in the cyclical and small-cap space, the morning after the debate.\n\n\"Market expectations for fiscal expansion, reflation, and less regulation under a Trump presidency drove these initial moves, in our view,\" Wilson said in a client note.\n\nOne area to watch to see if Laidler's thesis is fully correct: the sizzling AI trade.\n\nShares of AI bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) are off by 3% in the wake of the debate.\n\nSays Laidler, \"I think investors are looking back to the first Trump presidency and thinking, you know, that was fairly pro business and I made a lot of money — maybe we're going to get a repeat of that.\"\n\nInvestors generally enjoyed solid returns during the Trump presidency, despite various surprise events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the storm of the Capitol. Not to mention fresh tariffs on key trading partner China.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average returned 56% during the Trump presidency, according to data crunched by LPL Financial. The Dow notched 126 new highs.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed more than 50%.\n\nApple's stock surged in excess of 350% during the Trump presidency, part of a broad rally in tech stocks.\n\nPros say the gains were fueled primarily by the Trump tax cuts boosting corporate profits, and the wealth effect from stocks spurring consumer spending.\n\nBut those expecting sunshine and rainbows in a potential Trump presidency may want to dial back expectations, at least initially.\n\nWilson points out the backdrop for stocks is much different than in 2016.\n\n\"We would argue that the cycle is more mature today than it was in 2016, as evidenced (among other variables) by the two and a half year decline in the Conference Board Leading Economic Indicator series,\" Wilson said.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The market welcomed a reflationary playbook in 2016. Inflation was not a headwind to consumers in the way it is now, and the US economy was recovering from a manufacturing/commodity recession, the recovery of which was aided by the prospects of a pro-fiscal/reflationary policy regime. Today, inflation is a notable headwind to consumers and fiscal sustainability dynamics are top of mind for the bond market.\"\n\nFord (F) CEO Jim Farley says consumers may get a little nervous around the presidential election, but doesn't believe it will materially stunt demand for autos.

        "title": "7 Long Haul Stocks to Create Lasting Wealth",
        "content": "Creating long-term wealth in the stock market is fundamentally simple: Pick a time-tested strategy, stick to it, sell your losers and ride out the winners, be patient and keep investing. It sounds relatively simple and it is but the question of which long haul stocks are likely to create wealth still arises.\n\nHistory has shown again and again that identifying sure winners is not as easy as it appears. Simply consider the stocks of companies that dominated several decades ago that no longer exist or are nearly bankrupt. Radio shack comes to mind, and retailers like Kmart also deserve a mention.\n\nThe point is that the brands and stocks that appear to be long-term winners sometimes turn out not to be. That makes establishing a long-term position difficult when times get tough. Just remember, do your research and stick to your plan. Long-term wealth doesn’t come from abandoning a plan when things get dicey. Then you’re trying to time the market which rarely works.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best tech stocks to consider in the quest to build wealth for the long haul.\n\nOf course, we can simply look back at its performance over the past 10 years and use that to suggest that it will continue to win. It has returned an average of nearly 29% over the past decade so it’s hard to argue against Microsoft. It has returned an even more impressive 36% over the past 12 months.\n\nThat increased rate of return is an obvious product of Microsoft’s strength in relation to artificial intelligence. The company invested early and heavily into AI and has reaped the benefits. Those benefits appear especially in Microsoft’s cloud division, Azure, where growth has outpaced top line results.\n\nThat’s the overarching point here, and the reason investors should look to Microsoft as a long haul stock to create long-term wealth: Microsoft was already a behemoth and got that much more powerful as a result of the early AI surge.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) a line of Coca-Cola (KO) cans\n\nSource: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has long been recognized as a long-term stock worthy of investment. However, I believe some investors may have begun to question the validity of that assertion as global tastes shift.\n\nWhat I’m referring to specifically is the shift away from sugary, carbonated beverages toward healthier alternatives. Sugar is more demonized than it has ever been. In turn, Coca-Cola should logically be at risk.\n\nHowever, the company isn’t at risk and that truth is borne out through a few simple metrics. If Coca-Cola were in trouble it would show in the company’s gross margins. The company wouldn’t be as capable of charging higher prices if demand were worsening and that would show up as weaker margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Coca-Cola’s gross margins are just about exactly where they’ve been for the past 10 years. Much higher than the majority of competitors and very steady overall. Coca-Cola is one of a few buy and hold stocks that will cause no heartache and continuously reward through dividend income. It’s as easy a choice as ever.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) satisfies one of the oldest maxims of investing: Dividends reinvested create long-term, compounding wealth that rich stock investors love.\n\nThis recent article spells out an exact scenario in which O stock is held over the last 10 years. It lays out the returns under a dividend reinvestment plan and one on which dividends are collected as cash. Unsurprisingly, the dividend reinvestment plan yields greater returns overall. Yet, the returns while collecting cash are also strong.\n\nI’d recommend following the dividend reinvestment plan especially given the fact that O stock pays a monthly dividend that increases the frequency of compounding opportunities. However, that cash in hand can be used to seek other long-term wealth building opportunities as well.\n\nThe company continues to thrive and recently raised its earnings and investment guidance. Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) was increased as well. That’s where dividends are paid from in real estate investment trusts (REITs) including Realty Income. It all continues to look very strong for the company as an investment.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a 10X stock. That’s true of the shares of the last decade during which it has provided average annual returns of 26.4%. That means that $1,000 invested in Apple a decade ago is now worth more than $10,000.\n\nWe aren’t living in the past though and the markets are forever forward looking. Until very recently, those markets were not particularly fond of Apple and its stock. That changed when Apple delivered good news at the annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).\n\nThe company unveiled its much anticipated take on AI, Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence will be more pragmatic and geared toward user experience primarily. That is in opposition to other tech firms where a land grab approach has dominated early on.\n\nThe addition of AI to the iPhone is particularly important to Apple and its stock. It is expected that updated, AI capable iPhones will revive slumping sales of late. Even if AI doesn’t spike iPhone sales immediately, they will return as the economy improves on rate cuts later this year. Apple has proven to be a winner for the long haul through its ability to create products that have mass appeal and create a cult like following.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are dozens of things to potentially talk about in relation to Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock and its long-term outlook. Let’s focus on its strength versus other U.S. Oil Majors and how the company is approaching the energy transition. Both of those factors, when combined, suggest that Exxon Mobil is an excellent long-term wealth building investment.\n\nMost energy investors are going to go one of two ways when it comes to overall strategy: They’ll invest in green-leaning European energy firms or side with fossil fuel dominated American firms. Those who find more appeal in the latter category will likely whittle their choice down to Exxon Mobil and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). I’d suggest choosing XOM because the company is far better at investing capital than its competitor. That ability to reap a higher return on invested capital than cost is referred to as ‘value creation’. Exxon Mobil excels in that regard.\n\nThat suggests to me that Exxon Mobil is particularly adept at reading market trends over time and investing appropriately. I can only imagine that the company will be better than its competition as it relates to directing capital during the energy transition as well.\n\nPhilip Morris (PM) An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.\n\nSource: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.com\n\nPhilip Morris (NYSE:PM) is the best-positioned of the major tobacco stocks for the next 10 years. For that reason, I believe it’s also the best choice to deliver long-term wealth to investors.\n\nAll of the major tobacco stocks are undergoing a massive, transitory period during which cigarette smoking has fallen and these companies have been forced to pivot.\n\nHowever, it is Philip Morris that has handled the transition best. Over the past five years its share prices are up 32%. That’s not great when compared to the broader market but it is much better than Altria (NYSE:MO) and British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI), both of which have fallen during the same period.\n\nPhilip Morris has introduced products that meet changing consumer demand profiles including the incredibly popular Zyn nicotine pouches. The company can’t even keep up with demand for the product.\n\nThat’s part of the broader narrative suggesting that Philip Morris is a great buy and hold stock. It provides a strong dividend and is managing the tobacco transition very well.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock has certainly been much stronger in the past. The company is facing issues from multiple angles and currently trades for less than $260 per share after beginning 2024 at $297.\n\nWhether it’s boycotts related to the Middle East or claims of rampant price gouging, McDonald’s has certainly seen better days. McDonald’s doesn’t expect the effects of those boycotts to worsen demand further but also expects no improvement until the war ends. Some believe the war to be unwinnable and that a peace accord could soon materialize as a result.\n\nMcDonald’s also recently released its popular $5 value meal that includes a McDouble or a McChicken, a four piece nugget, small fries, and a small drink. The company is running the promotion in response to claims that it had gotten too expensive during the ongoing inflationary period. Its release should spike sales and are expected to produce profits at the same time.\n\nThose factors suggest McDonald’s should rebound in the short term. It still plans to grow rapidly in the near future and the company wants to reach 50,000 global locations by 2027. If McDonald’s achieves that goal it will be the fastest period of expansion in company history.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "We recently published a list of the 10 Best AI Momentum Stocks to Benefit from Volatility Ahead. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWolfe Research has joined the ongoing market correction chorus as more and more experts warn of volatility ahead amid soaring valuations led by AI. Wolfe Research, however, believes investors would stick to mega-cap tech stocks to survive through this volatility.\n\n“Our sense is that volatility will continue to pick up over the summer. However, we expect this to generally benefit the Mag 7, secular growers, and the overall Momentum Trade in the weeks ahead.”\n\nWolfe analysts expect investors to pile into quality stocks that “they can count on” amid economic “data surprises” ahead. The firm expects “these themes to continue to benefit from an environment in which growth is slowing but the Fed is expected to kick off a deep cutting cycle.”\n\n“Further, our sense is that the biggest companies driving these trends will once again put up very solid results during 2Q earnings season.”\n\nSince Wolfe believes investors are poised to stick with Magnificent Seven stocks in the upcoming volatility and called The Information Technology (SPG1200-45)(XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) “big winners”, we picked Mag. 7 stocks and top 3 AI stocks from the XLK for this article. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) the Best AI Momentum Stock to Benefit from Volatility Ahead?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nWolfe Research believes the Mag. 7 group of stocks is poised to benefit from any volatility this summer. Since Apple is part of the group, the stock should be watched closely.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) skeptics have long believed that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a laggard in the AI race, but experts say Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) almost always makes its own way and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will come roaring back in the AI competition and surpass Microsoft and Alphabet. The first signs of Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI capabilities are here. Last month, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) revealed new M4-powered iPad Pro and claimed that its devices, powered by Neural Engine,  will be “more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.” Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Neural Engine is Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) neural processing unit (NPU) that accelerates AI workloads.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter the latest AI announcements at the WWDC event, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares added over $215 billion in market cap and closed at a record high on June 11. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\n\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in “denial” about Apple’s AI potential.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 26X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock’s overvalued, given Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales growth of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was pressured in the quarter as investors fretted over softening demand for smartphones, regulatory action from the US Department of Justice, and the Chinese government mandates restricting iPhone use by government officials. Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to believe the company remains competitively advantaged and benefits from the Apple ecosystem, which has an installed base of over 2 billion devices and over 1 billion paying subscribers. We believe the Apple ecosystem will support a more predictable cash flow stream, which should grow intrinsic value high-single-digits over our investment horizon.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Momentum Stocks to Benefit from Volatility Ahead. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Think You Know Apple? Here's 1 Little-Known Fact You Can't Overlook.",
        "content": "With fiscal 2023 revenue of $383 billion and a current market cap of $3.4 trillion (as of July 1), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the most widely followed companies on the face of the planet. It sells some of the most popular products out there, and the brand carries incredible power and recognition.\n\nMany investors are likely confident they're very familiar with Apple. However, there's one little-known fact that can't be overlooked when it comes to this \"Magnificent Seven\" business.\n\nGoing digital\n\nIn fiscal 2023, Apple generated $298 billion, or 78% of its total revenue, from the sale of hardware devices. And unsurprisingly, the iPhone represented the vast majority of this figure. This isn't groundbreaking news. Apple's success can be attributed to its ability to create beautifully designed and easy-to-use products that consumers can't seem to get enough of. And this is what it's still known for today.\n\nHowever, the software and services segment has been rising quickly in importance, and it could be something that many investors might not realize.\n\nLast fiscal year, $85 billion, or 22% of total revenue, came from software and services. This figure is up 84% compared to fiscal 2019. That pace of growth is much faster than the 39% gain registered by the device segment during the same time. In other words, this hardware business is slowly transitioning to a digital enterprise.\n\nApple's software and services offerings include AppleCare, iCloud, Pay, Card, Music, Fitness+, TV+, News+, Arcade, and the App Store. Additionally, digital advertising is lumped into this segment as well.\n\nBesides driving faster growth, this division helps Apple on the bottom line. Software and services posted a stellar gross margin of 75% in Q2 2024 (ended March 30), comparing very favorably to the 37% gross margin on devices. As less revenue is derived from hardware, the tech giant should theoretically see profits rise.\n\nSoftware and services also benefit Apple because they are precisely what creates the company's powerful ecosystem. The great Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway has a $171 billion stake in the company, once clearly articulated what makes Apple so special.\n\nHe said that if you offered someone $10,000 on the condition that they could never use an iPhone again for the rest of their life, that person would most likely decline. I believe this is because of Apple's hardware and software and how well they work together to attract and lock in consumers.\n\nShould you buy Apple stock?\n\nThere are currently more than 2 billion active Apple devices across the globe. This gives the business unrivaled distribution when it comes to developing and launching new software offerings and features. Consequently, it's still critical to understand that hardware remains vital to Apple's success.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut this is proving to be a problem. Now that 17 years have passed since its initial launch, the iPhone is a mature product. Shareholders can't expect this single product to drive sizable, durable growth over the long haul. In fact, Apple's revenue dropped 2.8% in fiscal 2023. And it's only projected to increase at a compound annual rate of 5.3% over the next three years.\n\nThe muted growth prospects are the key reason why I don't believe investors should be buying this stock. The other obvious reason is Apple's valuation. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34, which represents an eye-popping 57% premium to the trailing-10-year average. This leads me to believe that returns going forward are likely to disappoint.\n\nWhile Apple is one of the most competitively advantaged and financially sound businesses the world has ever seen, that doesn't automatically mean it deserves a spot in your portfolio right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $757,001!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Foxconn's fledgling Indian supply chain is deep in an employment scandal over allegations the Apple supplier refused to hire married women for its factory in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe National Human Rights Commission, India's human rights watchdog, called for a detailed report into Foxconn's hiring practices within a week in notices to both India's labor ministry and the Tamil Nadu state government.\n\nThe Commission is the latest group to pressure India's government over Foxconn since a report from Reuters, published early last week, alleged the Apple supplier rejected married women from assembly jobs at its main iPhone plant near Chennai, in the state of Tamil Nadu.\n\nHiring agents and Foxconn HR sources quoted by Reuters blamed \"family duties, pregnancy, and higher absenteeism\" for the policy.\n\nSince the report, India's opposition parties and the women's wing of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party have urged the government to investigate.\n\nIn a statement, Foxconn refuted allegations of employment discrimination, claiming that almost 25% of women employed in its latest hiring round are married. Foxconn generally outsources its recruitment of assembly-line workers to third-party vendors.\n\nFoxconn in India\n\nFoxconn, the world's largest contract manufacturer, began assembling iPhones in India in 2017. It first focused on older models, but started assembling Apple's flagship phones in India in 2020. Last year, Indian-made iPhone 15 models launched on the same day as those manufactured in China, a major milestone for Apple and Foxconn's Indian manufacturing.\n\nBesides Apple, Foxconn makes products for other brands like Amazon, Google, and Sony. Google is reportedly partnering with Foxconn to make its Pixel phones in Tamil Nadu.\n\nFoxconn's China operations have also grappled with employee complaints in recent years. In November 2022, workers at its iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, China staged huge protests over late pay and COVID lockdowns.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures edge down as investors prepare for incoming labor market data during a holiday-shortened trading week. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is due to speak at an European Central Bank event, with the Fed's potential interest rate path for the rest of the year in focus. Elsewhere, U.S. federal prosecutors are reportedly awaiting a decision from Boeing (NYSE:BA) on a plea deal to settle charges linked to two fatal crashes.\n\n1. Futures lower\n\nU.S. stock futures pointed lower on Tuesday after the main averages on Wall Street rose in light pre-holiday trading in the prior session.\n\nBy 03:19 ET (07:19 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 96 points or 0.3%, S&P 500 futures had dipped by 17 points or 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had fallen by 83 points or 0.4%.\n\nAll three of the indices finished higher on Monday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite boosted in particular by a jump in Big Tech names like electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and iPhone giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Trading volumes were relatively muted as equity markets prepared to shutter for the U.S. Independence Day holiday on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, investors remained focused on the release of key U.S. labor market data this week, including job openings figures on Tuesday and the monthly non-farm payrolls report on Friday. The numbers could factor into how the Federal Reserve approaches potential interest rate cuts later this year.\n\n2. Powell to speak at Sintra\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell is set to participate in a panel at a European Central Bank conference in Sintra on Tuesday, with markets keen to see if he will provide any new cues on interest rates.\n\nPowell's comments will serve as a precursor to the publication of minutes from the Fed's June policy gathering on Wednesday, when the central bank's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) signaled that it only expects to reduce borrowing costs once this year -- down from three in March.\n\nYet traders, buoyed by hopes for a continued cooling in U.S. inflation, are still betting the Fed will roll out roughly two cuts in 2024 beginning in September, according CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) closely-monitored FedWatch Tool.\n\n\"There has been a tendency from Powell to be a bit more optimistic than the FOMC consensus on disinflation, and we think there are some downside risks for the dollar ahead of today’s speech,\" analysts at ING said in a note.\n\n3. Federal prosecutors awaiting Boeing decision on plea deal - AP\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department is waiting for Boeing to accept a plea deal to settle felony fraud charges related to two fatal crashes of its 737 Max planes, according to the Associated Press.\n\nStory continues\n\nCiting people familiar with the matter, the AP said Boeing has until the end of the week to either accept or reject the offer, which would also see the company agree to independent monitoring for compliance with anti-fraud laws.\n\nThe proposal stems from a Justice Department finding earlier this year that Boeing had misled regulators who had approved the 737 Max, violating the terms of a 2021 agreement shielding the firm from prosecution over deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nWhile accepting the deal would save Boeing from a potentially bruising courtroom battle, it threatens to cloud over its ongoing attempt to move beyond a dangerous mid-air panel blowout in January on one of its jets operated by Alaska Airlines.\n\n4. Billionaire Barry Diller eyeing possible Paramount bid - NYT\n\nBillionaire Barry Diller is considering a bid to take over Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) after the studio he formerly led pulled out of a merger with Skydance Media, the New York Times reported on Monday.\n\nDiller’s media conglomerate IAC signed nondisclosure agreements with National Amusements, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, the NYT report said, citing people close to the matter. A nondisclosure agreement usually precedes negotiations over a deal.\n\nThe NDAs were also signed sometime after deal talks between Paramount and Skydance fell through earlier in the year, the NYT report said.\n\nDiller had bid for Paramount in the early 1990's, but was outbid by Sumner Redstone, whose daughter Shari now controls the studio. Diller had also led the studio in the 1970's and 80's, and was credited with reviving it through several popular projects.\n\nParamount is the parent company of several major networks, including CBS, MTV and Nickelodeon. The firm has engaged in sale talks with several potential suitors over the past year, but none have so far borne fruit.\n\n5. Crude hovering near two-month highs\n\nCrude prices inched up on Tuesday, holding near two-month highs on expectations for rising fuel demand during the U.S. summer.\n\nBy 03:20 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) had gained 0.1% to $83.42 a barrel, while the Brent contract had climbed 0.1% to $86.71 per barrel. Both benchmarks touched to their highest levels since the end of April during the previous session.\n\nGasoline demand in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, is expected to ramp up as the summer travel season gathers steam due to the Independence Day holiday.\n\nTraders will also be looking at the latest data on U.S. crude stockpiles from the industry body American Petroleum Institute later in the session, as well as possible disruptions from Hurricane Beryl on U.S. oil refining and offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures lower, Fed's Powell to speak, Boeing plea deal - what's moving markets\n\nSri Lanka to save $5 billion after bilateral debt rework, president says\n\nECB's next rate cut an easy decision before choices become hard, Wunsch says\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple's China issues could hamper iPhone sales in 2025: Analyst",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is expected to launch its next-generation AI-centric iPhone in September, but the company's Apple Intelligence software platform may not be enough to spark a new sales supercycle in 2025. That's according to UBS Global Research analyst David Vogt, who says Apple's market share losses in China to homegrown companies like Huawei, act as a \"material governor on iPhone unit growth.\"\n\nApple is heavily dependent on iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market by total revenue behind the Americas and Europe. In 2023, China accounted for $72.56 billion of Apple's $383.3 billion in revenue. The Americas brought in 162.6 billion, while Europe made up $94.3 billion.\n\nThe resurgence of Huawei, which was initially kneecapped by US sanctions on high-powered smartphone chips in 2019 but has since released phones with sufficiently advanced chips, has meant increased competition for Apple in China. That, coupled with a tepid economic environment, led to slower iPhone sales in the region in the early part of the year.\n\nApple has attempted to goose sales for Chinese consumers, offering deep discounts across the Greater China market. And by some measures it's working. According to Bloomberg, iPhone shipments increased as much as 50% in April and 40% in May.\n\nDespite those gains, Huawei could still pose a threat to Apple's growth in China. To counter that, and build sales in other regions, the company announced its new Apple Intelligence platform during its WWDC event in June. But according to Apple, the software, which infuses generative AI technologies across apps ranging from Messages and Photos to the iPhone's Calculator app, requires powerful processors only found in the iPhone 15 Pro line and, presumably, future iPhones.\n\nThat means users who want to take advantage of Apple Intelligence but have older iPhones or even the standard iPhone 15 will have to pony up to use the new software.\n\nStill, Apple isn't the only company rolling out generative AI technologies. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Samsung have already debuted their own generative AI-powered smartphones, and you can expect more Android device makers to do the same.\n\nSamsung is also gearing up for its annual Unpacked event next week, where it is expected to launch its newest foldable phones, while Google is aiming to announce its own updated Pixel smartphone lineup in August.

        "title": "9 Stocks to Sell as AI Surges Ahead",
        "content": "I’ve got a surprising fact for you:\n\nNew technologies are often astonishingly S… L… O… W… to take off.\n\nIn 1950, there were only 25 million registered vehicles in America, or one for every six people. Though Henry Ford had introduced the Model T more than four decades earlier, many families still saw no reason to buy a car.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat’s because, besides “working,” cars — like all new technologies — needed three other ingredients to succeed:\n\nInfrastructure. Cars need roads, gas stations and service centers. Culture. People must want to drive. Incentives. Car-friendly regulations need to be in place.\n\nIn the automobile’s case, the technology required the National Highway System expansion of 1955, suburbanization and a rise of American car culture before it could truly take off. By 1970, there were 118 million cars on the road. By 1990, almost 200 million.\n\nThe automobile also illustrates how these three ingredients develop in phases. The Official Microsoft Blog calls December 20, 1922, “The Day the Horse Lost Its Job” after New York City’s last horse-drawn fire wagon was replaced with a motorized engine. Streetcar usage declined soon after, when motor cars began clogging up streets. It would take several more decades for railways to eventually succumb; between 1967 and 1972, six major railroads went bankrupt after competition from trucks and other intermodal transport options ate into profits.\n\nThe same was true for the fax machine, the personal computer and … even the internet. Infrastructure, culture and incentives are built in stages. That’s why Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) “beat” booksellers decades ago, yet still has trouble competing against fresh grocers and big-box stores like Costco (NASDAQ:COST).\n\nToday, the same battle is taking shape with artificial intelligence.\n\nSome businesses will survive for decades against this new technology. Surgeons, structural engineers and hang-gliding instructors all work with life-or-death situations. So, while AI might enhance the jobs in the near term, it would take significant cultural and regulatory shifts to replace these positions with AI.\n\nBut other companies are already beginning to struggle. These firms are finding themselves on the wrong side of history… and are failing to mount a counteroffensive.\n\nThis week, the writers and analysts at InvestorPlace.com consider three categories of firms – and nine stocks among them – that are especially exposed to “losing their job” in these early days of artificial intelligence…\n\nLow-End Content Creation: Where AI Will Hurt the Most A photo of a person's hands on a laptop keyboard. Several notebooks are on a desk surrounding the laptop.\n\nSource: Undrey / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThe lowest-hanging fruit for an AI takeover may be generic content creation – the stock imagery, clickbait articles and other low-quality content you see online.\n\nThat’s because AI already has the three ingredients to compete:\n\nInfrastructure. AI-generated content is now often indistinguishable from generic human-created stuff. Culture. Consumers are becoming more accepting of low-quality AI-generated content. Incentives. Regulations around AI-generated content is lax, so companies have an incentive to cut costs by using AI.\n\nNBC, for instance, found it wise to launch an AI version of announcer Al Michaels to read sports recaps from the Paris 2024 Olympics. Similarly, here are three companies that could soon see their content-producing “jobs” replaced by AI:\n\nShutterstock (NYSE:SSTK). This week at InvestorPlace.com, Thomas Niel notes that Executive Chairman Jonathan Oringer is selling millions of dollars’ worth of shares into strength – a big red flag in his book. The company specializes in stock images and footage, which are at risk of being replaced by AI-generated content. IZEA Worldwide(NASDAQ:IZEA). InvestorPlace Chief Investment Analyst Luke Lango previously turned bearish on this content creation firm… in 2021. He saw how much trouble the firm’s influencer-marketing-as-a-service was running into. Now, at InvestorPlace.com, we note how the firm is missing on earnings and revenues – a bearish sign of more losses to come. Fiverr International (NYSE:FVRR). In April, Ian Bezek noted that there were good reasons to be skeptical of Fiverr, an online marketplace for freelancers offering their services. He notes that AI will be able to perform many rudimentary tasks offered by Fiverr in coming years. A recent 20% price spike now gives investors an ideal window to take profits.\n\nMidtier Services: The Next to Fall A stack of open textbooks on a table in front of a chalkboard background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nProfessional services will be the next area to worry about. This segment still lacks some of the infrastructure required to turn AI into usable products. (Data collection remains a fragmented and incomplete industry, making it difficult to train specialized AI.) There’s also a culture issue of relying on AI to do important (though nonessential) tasks. The IRS will probably reject “AI did my taxes” as a reason to waive tax penalties.\n\nNevertheless, it’s only a matter of time before AI grows “smart” enough to compete. Our analysts find two companies that are already seeing earnings drop as a result.\n\nChegg (NYSE:CHGG). Louis Navellier and his team note that Chegg is facing some critical problems due to the rise of artificial intelligence. Generative AI platforms are able to help students – and even do work for them – cutting into demand for the homework assistance and online tutoring services that Chegg provides. Earnings are expected to slide 8% this year. 2U (NASDAQ:TWOU). Muslim Farooque warned in January that online education firm 2U was struggling with mounting debt costs and continuous cash burn. Shares have fallen 82% since that article. The rise of AI is now compounding this issue, because chatbots are increasingly able to tutor and help with homework. This month, 2U announced it will do a 1-for-30 reverse stock split, which is a historic sign of more losses to come.\n\nCrowding Out: The Small Become Smaller a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFinally, the rise of AI will favor larger tech companies with access to data and enough computing power to use it. To borrow the same automobile example from earlier, it’s like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) or General Motors (NYSE:GM) using its dominant positions in the 1920s and 1930s to develop more powerful and efficient engines, crowding out smaller players like Brewster, Durant Motors and hundreds of others.\n\nThat puts smaller firms at a disadvantage, as the writers at InvestorPlace.com note this month. AI is already consolidating some fragmented markets, and the trend will only continue as artificial intelligence widens this gap between the “haves” and “have-nots.”\n\nVeritone (NASDAQ:VERI). Muslim Farooque observes that this AI-powered media and advertising company is at the mercy of Amazon. Veritone relies on the tech giant for 30% of its sales, and its data intelligence offerings could be quickly eclipsed if the tech giant horizontally expands into the space. Viktor Zarev goes further and calls Veritone another generic AI service provider with no competitive moat. BigBear.ai Holdings (NYSE:BBAI). Ian Bezek writes how this AI data mining and analytics firm is losing significant contracts at a time when larger rivals are growing. “Stop and think about that for a minute,” he notes in a recent update. “In the midst of the biggest imaginable AI boom possible, BigBear.ai’s revenues plunged 22% over the past 12 months.” The company competes directly against public cloud firms like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which have far greater financial resources. SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN). Tyrik Torres calls SoundHound an overhyped stock to sell before it crashes and burns. He notes that the the company’s product is “not very unique” from what is already on the market, which puts it in direct competition with better-funded firms like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung, which have their own top-tier vocal-recognition software. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Finally, Louis Navellier and his team observe this week that Intel continues to fall behind rivals. “AI and foundry growth revival is far from a near-certainty for INTC,” they say. They see shares falling into the mid-$20s by 2025. Analysts predict the firm will only grow its research and development (R&D) budget in the low single-digits through 2027, right as rivals are upping their R&D spending by 60% or more annually.\n\nThe Internet… but 10X Bigger\n\nThe AI developments I’ve been describing are exactly what happened with the internet in the early 2000s. Poorly run firms without the ability to adapt were the first to get wiped out. Service providers like travel agencies were next. Finally, smaller tech players disappeared as large internet firms took over.\n\nAnd almost all new technologies follow this same arc.\n\nBut major technologies and the investing mania that follow them don’t come around very often… maybe once every generation. In fact, Louis Navellier is predicting that AI will be the last major financial mania that he or anyone over the age of 50 will see in time to capitalize on it.\n\nLouis talks about all that – plus what “financial mania” could lead to the rise of a “New America” that’ll be almost unrecognizable to anyone from our generation – in more detail in his brand-new special event, Prediction 2024.\n\nYou can check out that free event by going here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung owned shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).

        "title": "Europe’s privacy laws put Meta in a tight spot. Now its antitrust laws are going in for the kill",
        "content": "A week ago, Apple became the first company to face preliminary charges under the EU’s new Big Tech antitrust law, the Digital Markets Act. Now, again as predicted, it’s Meta’s turn.\n\nThough they involve the same law, the two cases are in many ways very different.\n\nApple stands accused primarily of making it difficult and overly expensive for app developers to steer their iOS users to cheaper deals off the platform, where Apple doesn’t get to take its lucrative revenue cut. Meta, however, is in trouble for charging a hefty monthly fee to Facebook and Instagram users who won’t “consent” to being surveilled across Meta and third-party services for ad-targeting purposes. This allegedly violates the DMA because, in the words of the European Commission:\n\n“[Meta’s model] does not allow users to opt for a service that uses less of their personal data but is otherwise equivalent to the ‘personalized ads’ based service [and because it] does not allow users to exercise their right to freely consent to the combination of their personal data.”\n\nOne case is about restricting developers; the other about railroading users. However, both take aim at core business models. Apple still earns most of its money from selling iPhones, but services (including App Store commissions) are the second-most important part of its revenue mix, and perhaps one day the most important. The data of Meta’s users is and probably always will be its lifeblood. Both cases therefore have enormous ramifications for their targets’ future revenue flows.\n\nWhat the Commission is doing to Meta is essentially data-protection enforcement through antitrust means.\n\nThe DMA’s rules reflect the increasing tendency of tech antitrust regulators to treat piles of data like the moat-building competitive asset they are. The Commission mentions “potential advantages compared to competitors who don't have access to such a vast amount of data, thereby raising high barriers to providing online advertising services and social network services.” However, while there’s a solid theoretical basis to this trend, it’s hard to escape the idea that regulators are also taking this tack because others have failed.\n\nWhat Meta has done here isn’t just allegedly illegal under the DMA; it also very likely violates the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect over six years ago. But enforcement of the GDPR has been patchy and achingly slow, largely because it’s the responsibility of underfunded national privacy regulators (the Irish Data Protection Commission in Meta’s case.) To avoid this problem, the DMA puts the European Commission itself in the role of enforcer, while also demanding a resolution to the case within a year of the investigation opening—which, for both Meta and Apple, makes next March the deadline for averting disaster.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe DMA also threatens much higher fines than the GDPR’s 4% of global annual revenue—up to 10%, or even 20% if the company persistently breaks the rules.\n\nFunnily enough, Meta only attempted its pay-or-consent tactic because GDPR-based court rulings removed all its other legal options for profiting off its users’ data without their actual free consent. “Subscription for no ads follows the direction of the highest court in Europe,” Meta protested in a statement this morning that also claimed its model “complies with the DMA.”\n\nSo, in a sense, privacy law corralled Meta into this position, and now antitrust law is going in for the kill.

        "title": "Why the Trump-Biden debate debacle isn’t shaking the confidence of excited tech investors",
        "content": "A tough on the eyes presidential debate might've left viewers with more concern than confidence (or questions than answers), but there are still plenty of reasons investors should remain bullish on red-hot tech darlings such as Nvidia (NVDA).\n\n“From a tech perspective, the political environment won’t change that much under either [candidate],\" Goldman Sachs portfolio manager Brook Dane told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his ‘Opening Bid’ podcast (see video above or listen here).\n\nDane says a combination of ingrained bullish sentiment around tech stocks, and their strong outlook for profits and cash flow should deflect election concerns. AI companies are particularly shielded from political worries given how fast they are expanding, Dane added. President Joe Biden, right, and Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump, left, during a presidential debate hosted by CNN, Thursday, June 27, 2024, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nFormer president Donald Trump and current president Joe Biden left debate watchers stunned last week, with the former spewing falsehoods and the latter appearing frail and out of touch.\n\nPressing topics like tech regulation and the rising influence of AI remained on the back burner.\n\nTech investors noticed the lack of attention on said hot-button issues, and continued to stick with mega cap winner, largely because of the facts Dane laid out.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) recently climbed to a $3.34 trillion market cap, making it the world's most valuable company. Shares traded mostly sideways after the contentious first debate.\n\nApple (AAPL) shares barely budged —it's only down slightly from its 52-week high of $220.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) held firm as well; it's down a hair from the record high it closed on June 27.\n\nRegardless of who wins, Dane acknowledges an environment of tighter scrutiny around social media companies and the relationship between the US and China.\n\nBut AI names could still do well. “I think Washington in general is lagging behind understanding how profound this change is and how structural it is,” he said.\n\nCalls from experts like Dane will be put to the test again soon.\n\nThe election cycle's next events include the Republican National Convention scheduled for July 15-18 in Milwaukee, the Democratic National Convention from August 19-22 in Chicago, and another presidential debate on September 12.\n\nIn the meantime, tech companies promise to show us we haven’t seen anything yet.\n\n“What we are going to see from these tools over the next two to five years is incredibly profound,” Dane said. “It’s going to fundamentally change the way people work and interact with technology.”\n\nBradesco's head of equity strategy Ben Laidler also thinks the election is a non-event for investors in the medium-term. He believes we are in the early innings of a bull market for stocks.

        "content": "Megacap Stocks Hit Record Highs: Should You Buy Into The Hype?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nThe stock market has remained upbeat despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, with the benchmark S&P 500 index and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index hitting all-time closing highs last week. The AI-frenzy drove major tech giants to massive highs, driving the Nasdaq composite index up by over 18% this year.\n\nThe slowing inflation levels have boosted consumer sentiment, propelling hopes for a rate cut soon. According to data released by the Commerce Department, the core personal consumption expenditures price index rose at its slowest annual rate in more than three years in May.\n\nHowever, despite the bullish outlook, broader concerns still linger, raising questions regarding the sustainability of the tech surge.\n\n\"We may see more volatility,\" John Tyner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, said. \"All in all, everyone is enjoying the last 10 months of the market because it's been easy, [but] at some point, the complacency will have to end.\"\n\nApple\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the second-largest company in the world by market capitalization, has been bouncing back lately, with its shares rising over 9% year-to-date.\n\nApple's iPhone sales fell by 10% year-over-year in the quarter ended March 30, 2024, due to slowing demand in China, its biggest market. However, the company has been taking active steps to boost overseas sales by offering steep product discounts. Interestingly, according to a Bloomberg report, Apple's iPhone shipments to China rose by 50% in April and by 40% in May.\n\nApple also approved a $110 billion share repurchase plan last month, marking a 22% increase from the prior year's $90 billion repurchase plan.\n\nThe company hopped on the AI bandwagon by launching Apple Intelligence earlier this month, integrating a custom artificial intelligence system across all its products.\n\n\"Our unique approach combines generative AI with a user's context to deliver truly helpful intelligence. It can access that information privately and securely to help users do the things that matter most to them. This is AI as only Apple can deliver it, and we can't wait for users to experience what it can do,\" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO.\n\nWedbush Securities currently has an \"Outperform\" rating on Apple, with a price target of $275, indicating a potential upside of nearly 30%.\n\nGoogle\n\nShares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have risen by over 30% so far this year, shrugging off sentiment regarding a potential slowdown in the field of AI. The company's better-than-expected earnings report for the fiscal first quarter and its first-ever dividend payout drove share prices significantly. In April, Google's board of directors approved a $70 billion share repurchase program.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, some believe that Google has lost ground in the AI war, as evidenced by Rosenblatt Securities' recent downgrade of GOOGL stock from \"Buy\" to \"Neutral.\" This comes as EU regulators inspect Google's partnership with South Korean phone maker Samsung to embed the former's generative AI technology into the Galaxy S24 smartphone series.\n\n\"We are also sending requests for information to better understand the effects of Google’s arrangement with Samsung to pre-install its small model Gemini Nano on certain Samsung devices,\" said Margrethe Vestager, EU competition chief.\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "title": "Nokia’s latest mega deals aim to reinvent a company associated with mobile phones it no longer sells",
        "content": "Good morning.\n\nHow will Apple reinvent itself? That day is coming. While deep discounts in China led to a 40% increase in iPhone shipments in May, iPhone sales and market share have been trending down. My Gen Z kids—Apple’s most loyal generation—would rather upgrade their battery right now than buy a new phone.\n\nWill we even need smartphones by 2030? Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark likes to talk about digital-physical fusion, predicting we’ll implant a lot of technology in our bodies.\n\nLundmark knows about disruption. He first worked for Nokia between 1990 and 2000, helping the Finnish company become the world’s biggest mobile phone maker with a market cap of $250 billion the year he left. In 2020, he returned to be president and CEO of a company that had one-tenth the value and no phone business, having sold it in 2014 to Microsoft, which shut it down at a loss about a year later.\n\nNokia didn’t die. Like many brands faced with decline, the Finnish company followed a path of reduction, resistance, reflection, and reinvention to reemerge in a different—if somewhat diminished—form. (Former smartphone rival BlackBerry is now a niche player in cybersecurity and software solutions.) Nokia is today a network infrastructure and services company, making products like 5G cellular antennas.\n\nI caught up with Lundmark last week after Nokia announced two major deals: the $375 million sale of its undersea internet cable unit, and its $2.3 billion acquisition of Infinera, which will boost Nokia’s U.S. presence and product offerings for data centers.\n\n“What we want to do is to accelerate our exposure to AI-driven markets,” Lundmark said. “In many aspects, the future of this industry will be decided in the North American market. You have the most sophisticated carriers, all the web scalars. Big tech is very much driven by North America.”\n\nDoes it matter that most people still associate the Nokia name with products that his company no longer makes? “The carriers know us,” he said. “But we really need to take the brand equity from the mobile phone area and reposition for different types of enterprise networks … We’re working with ports, mines, manufacturing companies and expanding to the defense sector as well.”\n\nAfter all, name recognition doesn’t guarantee success. Apple started 2024 as the world’s most valuable brand, according to Brand Finance. It still shelved its EV ambitions and launched its Vision Pro headset to mixed reviews. Apple Intelligence could boost iPhone’s market share or become table stakes in a world pivoting to AI. And the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit could further impact Apple’s business model.\n\nStory continues\n\nEvery major technology shift brings new names to the fore. For Nokia’s Lundmark, what matters now isn’t size but profitability. “It's equally important to stop doing things as it is to start new things,” he said. “We want to focus on segments where we believe that we have global leadership.”\n\nMore news below.\n\nDiane Brady\r\ndiane.brady@fortune.com\r\nFollow on LinkedIn\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Excellent Stocks That Can Beat the S&amp;P 500",
        "content": "We all want to beat the market. It's easier said than done, but doing your homework can give you an edge on the standard portfolio of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) these days. Here are three stocks that have beaten the S&P 500 that I think can do it again over time.\n\n1. Apple\n\nAn investment gem for years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was in the news a few weeks ago for becoming more valuable than Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). The company has outpaced the S&P 500 by 234% over the last five years.\n\nIt is one of Warren Buffett's favorites, and for good reason. Its products have lots of utility, and the phone and computer businesses have a significant barrier to entry. You need deep pockets and infrastructure to get involved in this game. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNaysayers to my Apple pick will likely point to last year's 2.8% decline in revenue and the weak first quarter of 2024. What I think is being missed here is the potential demand that Apple could create from the integration of AI-based programs into its products.\n\nMost recently, the chatter around Apple has been its announcement of Apple Intelligence, its planned AI business, and potential partnership with Meta Platforms on generative AI. This could be exactly what Apple needs to gain the momentum seen by stocks such as Nvidia, whose semiconductor chips are essential to AI-based businesses.\n\nI like Apple as a play on this burgeoning business, since it stands to be a new source of demand for the tech company. It has the product lineup necessary to implement AI in a way that will appeal to its large consumer base. As I said before, Apple's devices offer a lot of utility. Integrating AI into them only stands to increase that advantage.\n\n2. Costco\n\nCostco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) is a blue chip gem. The discount king creates consistent annual growth and earnings for shareholders, and its low-price strategy positions it well in our inflationary economy, where consumers are looking for the best deals.\n\nCharlie Munger, Warren Buffett's late partner, loved Costco, and it's easy to see why. It has outpaced the S&P 500 by 134% over the last five years, using a strong member base that drives comparable store sales (comps). In the first 16 weeks of the company's fiscal year, total comps increased by 4.7%, with a 12.6% increase in e-commerce. May sales results showed comps gained 6.4%, with e-commerce sales gaining 15.3%.\n\nThose figures don't match Nvidia's, but the key here is consistency and profitability over time, and a business model that is beneficial to consumers at any time. Costco has averaged double-digit revenue growth over the last five years, just a part of years of revenue and net earnings increases, and there seems to be little sign that the story will change.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Cava\n\nWish you could go back and buy into Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) before it was Chipotle? Cava Group(NYSE: Cava) just might be your shot.\n\nThe latter restaurant chain operates very similarly to its Mexican counterpart but focuses on Mediterranean cuisine. I'd challenge you to find many competitors of scale in the Mediterranean space, and Cava might be a great long-term play.\n\nHaving gone public only last year, Cava shares have beaten the S&P 500 by roughly 100% in that time. The restaurant chain has seen significant growth as it pushes to create a similar story to Chipotle. First-quarter revenue increased 30.3% year over year to $256 million, while its total number of restaurants increased 22.8% year over year, to 323 locations.\n\nFor being such a young company, and a quintessential growth stock, Cava has found profitability particularly early, making $13.28 million last year. To be fair, that's not significant on a per-share basis, amounting to a mere $0.12 per diluted share, but compared to a loss of $1.30 the year prior, I like seeing a company focused on profitability early.\n\nFull-year guidance is looking for comps growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, with net new-store openings of 50 to 54. To be clear, this is an investment fully focused on growth. Earnings are not the primary thing that will drive the share price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Wall Street looks set to start the new week and quarter on a positive note ahead of Friday’s crucial payrolls report. Meta Platforms could face EU charge, and Boeing finally completes its purchase of Spirit Aerospace.\n\n1. Futures marginally higher ahead of key payrolls release\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Monday, at the start of a holiday-shortened week which culminates with Friday’s widely-watched nonfarm payrolls report.\n\nBy 04:20 ET (08:20 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 50 points, or 0.1%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 11 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 62 points, or 0.3%.\n\nWall Street is coming off a mixed quarter, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite adding 3.9% and 8.3%, respectively, boosted by continued excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.7%.\n\nThe Nasdaq notched its third positive quarter in a row for the first time since a five-quarter streak ending in 2021.\n\nInvestors will be focusing their attention on Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report as they look for fresh indications on when the Federal Reserve might start to cut interest rates.\n\nAdditionally, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is to make an appearance at the European Central Bank’s annual forum in Sintra, Portugal on Tuesday, while Wednesday’s minutes of the Fed’s June meeting will be parsed for the central bank’s view of the economic outlook and the factors influencing the monetary policy outlook.\n\n2. EU to charge Meta Platforms - FT\n\nThe European Union is set to charge Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) with breaking the bloc's digital rules, according to a report by the Financial Times, released Monday.\n\nThe newspaper reported that the regulators will say that they are worried about Meta's \"pay or consent\" model, noting that this choice provides a false alternative, with the financial barrier forcing them to consent to their personal data being tracked for advertising purposes.\n\nThe EU’s Digital Markets Act was designed to rein in the power of the 'Big Tech' firms and ensure a level playing field for smaller rivals, and saw the region’s regulators last week charging Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with breaching the bloc's tech rules.\n\n3. Boeing to buy Spirit Aerospace, finally…\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) announced Monday that it would buy Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR) in a $4.7 billion all-stock deal, with the planemaker finally agreeing a deal for the key supplier after months of talks complicated by Spirit’s interactions with Boeing’s main rival Airbus.\n\nBoeing’s move to take back control of Spirit stems from a desire to resolve the quality problems that have plagued the key supplier in recent years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe total deal value will be about $8.3 billion including debt, and followed Boeing's decision to buy back its former subsidiary, which had branched out into supplying Airbus (EPA:AIR) and others since becoming independent almost two decades ago.\n\nAirbus said it would receive $559 million in compensation from Spirit, and would take over core activities at four of the supplier's plants in the United States, Northern Ireland, France and Morocco.\n\nSpirit said it also planned to sell businesses and operations in Scotland and Malaysia that support Airbus programs. It also plans to sell operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland that do not support Airbus programs.\n\n4. National Rally prevails in French elections\n\nFrance's far-right National Rally party and its allies reached 33% of the national popular vote in the first round of parliamentary elections, the interior ministry said, after Sunday’s vote.\n\nThe leftwing New Popular Front came in second with 28%, while President Emmanuel Macron's centrist bloc reached 20%.\n\nThis result has seen the euro bounce, with the single currency touching a two-week high, while the CAC 40, the French benchmark equity index, traded higher, rebounding after losses of around 6% since French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved parliament.\n\nAt 04:20 ET (08:20 GMT), EUR/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.0758, while the CAC 40 rose 1.9%.\n\nInvestors have been concerned that the far-right, as well as the left-wing alliance, have pledged big spending increases at a time when France's high budget deficit has prompted the EU to recommend disciplinary steps.\n\nHowever, this result was better than feared, but also suggests more volatility this week ahead of next Sunday's runoff with the final outcome likely to depend on alliance-building.\n\n5. China’s private PMI helps crude prices\n\nThe Chinese economy showed signs of growth in June, helping crude prices rise Monday on hope that the world’s largest importer can benefit from the solid momentum in the global economy.\n\nChina's Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI), a private survey, rose to 51.8 in June from 51.7 in May earlier Monday, growing at the fastest clip in more than three years, above the break-even line of 50.0 that separates growth from contraction.\n\nThis positive result has boosted sentiment after official PMI data released on Sunday showed China's manufacturing activity fell for a second month in June and services activity slid to a five-month low.\n\nBy 08:20 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.9% higher at $82.27 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.8% to $85.70 per barrel.\n\nBoth contracts gained around 6% in June, after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, extended most of its deep oil output cuts well into 2025.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMeta Platforms charge, Boeing deal, French elections - what's moving markets\n\nSouth African rand gains after Ramaphosa announces new cabinet\n\nBIS sends government debt warning before important elections\n\nView comments",

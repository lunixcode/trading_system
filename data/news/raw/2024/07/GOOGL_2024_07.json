        "title": "Breaking Down the Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard",
        "content": "Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\n\nHere are the key points:\n\nFor the 285 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, or 54.3% of the index’s total membership, total earnings are up +9.8% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues, with 80.7% beating EPS estimates and 59.6% beating revenue estimates.\n\nExcept for the revenue beats percentage, which at 59.6% is near the lowest for this group of 285 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period, all of the other performance metrics are tracking better relative to what we have seen in other recent periods.\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, total earnings for the index are expected to be up +9.0% from the same period last year on +5.3% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth pace since the +10% earnings growth rate in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nQ2 earnings for the ‘Magnificent 7’ companies are expected to be up +27.6% from the same period last year on +13.9% higher revenues. Excluding the ‘Mag 7’, Q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to +5.1% (from +9.0%).\n\nMicrosoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOG, and Tesla TSLA kicked off the Q2 reporting cycle for the ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks, with the market unimpressed with either of the reports. This contrasted with the companies’ Q1 releases when Alphabet and Tesla were up big on the quarterly results while Microsoft was only modestly down.\n\nThere is no surprise in the Tesla sell-off, as the company not only missed estimates but also had nothing good to say about the near-term outlook. The EV maker has been suffering competitive challenges in its core market, prompting it to cut prices that are weighing on its margins. As a result, Tesla’s Q2 earnings were down -45.3% on +2.3% higher revenues. Given Tesla shares’ gain of more than +40% in the three-month period ahead of the quarterly release, the post-release sell-off makes perfect sense.\n\nThe sell-off in Alphabet and Microsoft shares is far more challenging to understand, as both of the Tech giants handily beat estimates and showed broadly positive trends in all of their businesses.\n\nThe issue in the Alphabet report appears to be the market’s disappointment with a bigger-than-expected capital spending level of $13.2 billion in the period relative to expectations of $12.2 billion. Management also indicated that they saw underspending as a bigger risk at this stage of the AI rollout than the alternative, which was interpreted as indicative of an elevated capex spend trend compared to what investors had been factoring in.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe issue with Microsoft appears to be the seeming deceleration in the company’s Azure unit. However, management explicitly stated that demand remained strong and that it’s faced challenges in meeting the demand due to capacity issues.\n\nWe don’t see elevated capex by Alphabet, Microsoft, or any other Tech operator as a negative, but this appears to be the case with Tech investors at this stage. Perhaps the market would like to see a tangible path toward monetization for all the AI-centric investments in which Alphabet, Microsoft, and its peers are currently engaged in.\n\nThis also means that capex spending levels in the coming Meta and Amazon reports will similarly receive close scrutiny.\n\nFor the Mag 7 group as a whole, Q2 earnings are expected to be up +27.6% on +13.9% higher revenues, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBeyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +17.9% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\n\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.4%, followed by another strong showing expected next year. The chart below shows how the aggregate earnings total for the Tech sector has evolved over the past year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nA big contributing factor to the Tech sector’s positive earnings outlook is the sector’s margins outlook, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year’s record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector’s productivity.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that this year’s +8.4% earnings growth on only +1.8% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +8.1%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +4.1%. In other words, about half of this year’s earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\n\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Here's What Investing $1,000 in Billionaire Bill Ackman's Portfolio Could Have Made You This Year\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nBillionaire Bill Ackman is making headlines after reports that the much-hyped IPO of his investment fund Pershing Square USA is eyeing to raise just about $2 billion, significantly lower than the initial plans of $25 billion. Regardless of how this IPO performs, Ackman remains one of the most successful value investors of all time, worth over $9 billion. However, Ackman’s fund Pershing Square has been posting lackluster returns as the broader market continues to buy high-growth tech stocks and value investing takes a back seat. As of the end of June, Pershing Square Holdings was up about 5.7% this year, compared with 15% gains for the S&P 500.\n\nCheck it out: Earn potential monthly cash flow from Sunbelt real estate with just $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nAckman's investing philosophy is simple: buy stocks trading at highly discounted valuations with strong underlying businesses and cash flows and hold them for years. The billionaire's portfolio is highly concentrated (just seven stocks).\n\nAs megacap tech stocks begin to see signs of correction, the broader market is looking beyond tech and moving toward value stocks again. Amid these changing dynamics, let's see what a $1,000 investment in Ackman's portfolio would have returned this year.\n\nBut before calculating how much you'd have made investing $1000 in Ackman's portfolio, let's see the holdings of Ackman's fund, Pershing Square.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\n\nStock Performance in 2024: +17%\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is Bill Ackman’s biggest holding as of the end of the March quarter. The billionaire's fund, Pershing Square, has a stake of over $2.16 billion in the company. As of July 30, Chipotle shares were up about 17% in 2024.\n\nHilton Hotels Corporation\n\nStock Performance in 2024: +21.46%\n\nPershing Square owns a $1.96 billion stake in Hilton Hotels Corporation Common Stock (NYSE:HLT) as of the three-month period ending March. It's another profitable investment of billionaire Ackman as the stock is up about 21.5% this year.\n\nRestaurant Brands\n\nStock Performance in 2024: -11%\n\nRestaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) has disappointed billionaire Ackman this year, as the stock is down about 11%. Pershing Square has a $1.76 billion stake in the company that owns Burger King and Tim Hortons.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet Class C\n\nStock Performance in 2024: +23%\n\nBill Ackman owns about 9.4 million Alphabet Inc. Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares through his fund Pershing Square as of the end of March. GOOG is up about 23% so far this year.\n\nCanadian Pacific Kansas City\n\nStock Performance in 2024: +4%\n\nCanadian railway company Canadian Pacific Kansas City Ltd (NYSE:CP) is an important stock in Pershing Square's portfolio. The fund has a $1.33 billion stake in the company. CP shares are up about 4% this year.\n\nHoward Hughes Holdings\n\nStock Performance in 2024: -13%\n\nReal estate company Howard Hughes Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HHH) is one of the losers in billionaire Bill Ackman's portfolio this year, down 13% so far. Pershing Square's stake in the company is valued at about $1.33 billion.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Class A\n\nStock Performance in 2024: +23%\n\nAccording to filings with the SEC, Bill Ackman owns about 4.4 million Alphabet Inc. Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares through Pershing Square. The net worth of these shares is over $657 million. The stock is up about 23% this year.\n\nTrending: With returns as high as 300%, it’s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires. Uncover the secret.\n\nHow Much Would You Have Made If You Invested $1,000 in Billionaire Ackman's Portfolio At The Start of 2024?\n\nWe assume an equal-weighted distribution of $1,000 in Ackman's portfolio, which means each of the seven stocks gets an investment of roughly $143.\n\nInvestment in each stock = $1,000/7 = $142.857\n\nFirst, we will calculate dollar gains (and losses) on each investment. We will use this formula:\n\nGain or Loss = Investment per Stock x Performance Percentage ​\n\nDollar gains from CMG: $24.30\n\nDollar gains from HLT: $30.14\n\nDollar gains from QSR: -$15.73\n\nDollar gains from GOOG: $32.89\n\nDollar gains from CP: $5.72\n\nDollar gains from HHH: -$18.59\n\nDollar gains from GOOGL: $32.89\n\nAdding all these gains (and losses), the total gains on our $1,000 investment this year would be roughly $92. If you had invested $1,000 in Bill Ackman's portfolio at the start of this year, your investment would have increased to around $1092.\n\nThere Are Better Options Than Investing Like Ackman\n\nThe stock market isn't the only option for today's investors. The current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity to earn massive yields. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, this Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

        "title": "Amazon set to join Big Tech's spending surge as AI race heats up",
        "content": "By Deborah Mary Sophia\n\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com is expected to join Google and Microsoft on Thursday in reporting a surge in capital spending on artificial intelligence as Big Tech companies rush to capitalize on the booming technology.\n\nThe e-commerce giant's capital investments - mostly for building cloud and generative AI infrastructure - is expected to have risen 43% in the second quarter to $16.41 billion, according to LSEG data. That represents a roughly $1.5 billion increase from the previous three months.\n\nThe steep spending is also expected to pressure Amazon's margins, outweighing benefits from cost cuts and supply chain efficiencies that are aiding the retail unit's profitability.\n\nThe company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has long dominated the cloud-computing market but it has been facing tough competition from Microsoft in recent quarters after the Windows maker rolled out AI-powered services to its Azure cloud business.\n\nIn response, Amazon has partnered with the likes of Anthropic and offered startups free credits that cover the cost of using major AI models to boost the market share of its AI platform Bedrock. It also named a new head for the AWS unit in May.\n\nMicrosoft and Google-parent Alphabet also said earlier this month they would plow ahead with investments even as the payoff from AI takes longer than some investors had hoped. This knocked Big Tech stocks whose valuations have soared this year on the promise of AI.\n\n\"Amazon's capex spend will certainly be scrutinized closely. It has been slow on the adoption of AI and is skewed towards smaller companies which have struggled in the high interest-rate environment,\" said Ben Barringer, analyst at Quilter Cheviot.\n\n\"We would expect AWS to start speeding things up in its AI development going forward.\"\n\nAmazon shares have risen about 23% this year. The stock has shed more than 6% since July 8, when it hit a record, part of a broader market selloff led by U.S. megacaps.\n\nGrowth at AWS is likely to have stayed similar to the previous quarter at just over 17%, according to LSEG data. But, Morgan Stanley analysts said: \"AWS needs to grow 18%+ in order to ... ensure investors of AWS's (AI) positioning and its ability to generate high-teens growth through this heavy capex investment period.\"\n\nAs a result of the spending increase, Amazon's gross profit margin growth is expected to have slowed to 1.3% in the April-June quarter, compared with 2.6% in the previous quarter and an average of 2.7% over the past two years.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowth in its North American retail business likely slowed to 8% between April and June, from 12.3% in the January-March quarter, amid signs of a wider slowdown in consumer spending and some competition from new and fast-growing Chinese players such as Temu and Tiktok Shop that are enticing more U.S. shoppers.\n\nAmazon's total revenue is expected to have grown 10.6% to $148.56 billion - the slowest rise in five quarters.\n\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Devika Syamnath)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Facebook and Instagram parent Meta (META) reported its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines. But the company warned it expects to see \"significant\" capital expenditures growth in 2025.\n\n\"While we do not intend to provide any quantitative guidance for 2025 until the fourth quarter call, we expect infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint,\" CFO Susan Li said in a statement.\n\nAI spending is a key measure for Wall Street as investors anxiously await a return on Big Tech’s investments in the technology. During its prior quarter, Li raised the company’s full-year total expense estimate from between $94 billion and $99 billion to between $96 billion and $99 billion.\n\nFor the second quarter, Meta saw earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 on revenue of $39.07 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $4.74 on revenue of $38.3 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Meta recorded EPS of $2.98 on revenue of $31.9 billion during the same period last year.\n\nThe company’s Family of Apps revenue, which includes revenue from Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, clocked in at $38.72 billion, higher than estimates of $37.7 billion. Meta saw revenue of $31.7 billion in the segment in Q2 last year.\n\nMeta stock climbed more than 4% following the report. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg during an appearance at SIGGRAPH 2024 in Denver, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBeyond its advertising revenue, Wall Street is still trying to determine how much longer Meta will need to plow money into AI before it sees some kind of revenue payoff.\n\nLast week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Meta’s latest open-source large language model (LLM) called Llama 3.1. What’s more, the Facebook founder said the industry should focus on open-source AI rather than closed-source models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nMeta’s Reality Labs segment, which includes its mixed reality hardware and software, saw revenue of $353 million in the quarter versus expectations of $376 million. That's better than the company reported in the same quarter last year, but the segment continues to hemorrhage cash.\n\nIn Q2, Meta reported that the segment lost some $4.49 billion, slightly below expectations of $4.53 billion. It lost $3.8 billion in Q1. The division has also been plagued by turnover and a lack of clear vision, adding to Reality Labs’ troubles, Yahoo Finance’s Yasmin Khorram reported.\n\nMeta’s announcement also comes after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced on Tuesday that he secured a $1.4 billion settlement between the state and Meta over the company’s alleged use of Texans’ biometric data without their permission for its Tag Suggestions feature.\n\nStory continues Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Trivago to Focus on Resolving User ‘Irritation’ With Metasearch",
        "content": "Trivago CEO Johannes Thomas was interviewed at his company's AI event earlier in 2024. Trivago/YouTube\n\nOne reason German hotel price-comparison site Trivago invested $10 million in Holisto is to resolve the “irritation” Trivago users feel when they get bounced around to many other sites to make a booking.\n\n“The product gap is basically that we see user irritation with leaving our site and landing on dozens of different sites,” Trivago CEO Johannes Thomas told analysts Wednesday during the company’s second quarter earnings call.\n\nThat’s a flaw that Trivago is trying to address in the metasearch model.\n\nWhen Trivago offers a hotel deal and users navigate to third-party advertiser sites to book, they encounter landing pages of varying quality, he said, adding that’s an especially acute problem on a mobile phone.\n\nTo address the issue before the pandemic, Trivago had a product called Express Booking, which gave customers — and advertisers — a landing page with a consistent users experience. Express Booking was a casualty of the pandemic, however, and discontinued.\n\nBut Trivago partnered with Holisto in 2022 to create a new user experience.\n\nThomas said Trivago can now offer advertisers, which are seeking to attract bookers, a co-branded “funnel,” which would lift their conversion rates i.e. turning lookers into bookers.\n\nIn a Skift interview after the earnings call, Thomas explained that Express Booking was “Trivago hosted, advertiser branded.” He said the new product for advertisers, Trivago Book&Go, provides a standardized booking experience, is Trivago branded, and is more integrated into Trivago than was Express Booking.\n\nHolisto, which created the Trivago Book&Go product, is the only advertiser using it now, but Trivago will reach out to other advertisers, Thomas said.\n\nThe following screenshot is an example: It is branded Trivago Book&Go, but powered by the advertiser, Algotels, which is a Holisto brand. Algotels facilitates the booking, and will send the email conformation.\n\n“So you have the less-known booking sites like Priceline that might be known in the U.S., but it’s not known in Europe,” Thomas said during the earnings call. “And then we would have a co-branded booking funnel that gives Priceline more trust and would also be part of lifting conversion.”\n\nSo the goal is to make the booking more fluid and consistent for users, turn them into repeat customers, and increase conversions for advertisers.\n\nGoogle Provides Headwinds\n\nTrivago officials said Google started making changes to Google Hotels and advertising formats a year ago, and they took a toll on Trivago’s performance marketing and revenue in the second quarter of 2024, particularly in Europe. However, Trivago officials expressed satisfaction with the progress of its branded advertising campaigns.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the Skift interview, Thomas said Google Hotels took more market share, and Google’s Property Promotion Ads downplayed text ads, which were a source of Trivago revenue. Thomas said because of Trivago’s renewed push into branded TV ads and video, Google is a declining factor in Trivago’s revenue mix, and the company should be done with the worst of the Google impact in early 2025.\n\nThe Numbers and Outlook\n\nIn the second quarter, Trivago’s net loss, driven by higher expenses and Google headwinds, was $5.3 million, compared with net income of $6.28 million a year earlier. Revenue fell 5% to $128.6 million in the second quarter.\n\nOn the upside, officials forecast that revenue will increase in the second half of 2024, and the company will achieve adjusted EBITDA break even for the full year.\n\nThe company notched a $5.8 million adjusted EBITDA loss in the second quarter.\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google is making adjustments to its search engine to reduce the prevalence of sexually explicit fake content high in results, responding to the explosion in non-consensual unsavory content people have created using generative artificial intelligence tools.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nKamala Harris Wipes Out Trump’s Swing-State Lead in Election Dead Heat Intel to Cut Thousands of Jobs to Reduce Costs, Fund Rebound Ukraine Receives First F-16 Fighter Jets After Long Wait Luxury Heir Alleges His $13 Billion Hermès Fortune Has Vanished Iran’s Leader Orders Retaliatory Strike on Israel, NYT Says\n\nWhen that AI-generated content features a real person’s face or body without their permission, that person can request its removal from search results. Now, when Google decides a takedown is warranted, it will filter all explicit results on similar searches and remove duplicate images, the company said Wednesday in a blog post. The Alphabet Inc. unit also said it had improved its search ranking systems so that explicit fake content would not appear as top results — a change that Bloomberg reported in May was already in the works.\n\n“We’ve long had policies to enable people to remove this content if they find it in search, but we’re in the middle of a technology shift,” said Emma Higham, a product manager who spearheads protections for Google’s generative AI technology in search and other apps, in a briefing with reporters. “As with every technology shift, we’re also seeing new abuses.”\n\nIn 2023, Bloomberg found that Google Search was the top traffic-driver to websites hosting deepfakes, or sexually explicit AI-generated pornography. On Google, a search for many well-known celebrities matched with the word “deepfake” pointed users to MrDeepfakes.com and other sites that largely exist to trade in pornographic imagery. One year ago, Google Search accounted for 44% of the 4 million desktop visits to MrDeepfakes.com, according to data from Similarweb.\n\nGoogle has been adjusting the results for queries specifically seeking deepfake content tied to someone’s name. Instead of showing those images, the search engine will be trained to surface high-quality, non-explicit content, like news articles, when those results are available, the company said. So far, such changes have reduced exposure to explicit image results on these types of queries by over 70%, Google said.\n\nBetween April and May, US-based search traffic to the top two deepfake pornography websites plummeted, according to data from Similarweb published in a May Bloomberg report.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle is also demoting websites that feature a high volume of pages that have been removed from search because they violated policies against explicit fake content, the company said in its blog post.\n\nIn a separate interview, Higham, the product manager, said that Google is facing new challenges in deciding when to take action on non-consensual explicit imagery and when to leave results on its search engine untouched, citing the need to balance users’ ability to find information with their online safety. Advocates have criticized Google for de-ranking, rather than completely de-listing, the deepfaked content.\n\n“We have to be careful about not taking too blunt an approach and having unintended consequences on access to information,” Higham said, referencing adult performers who may not want explicit, consensual content to be de-ranked on the search engine. “But when we’re seeing high-risk queries and a high risk of fake explicit content showing up non-consensually, we are taking strong action now.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow to Calculate the Value of an MBA ‘Dancing With Death’: What It’s Like to Dismantle a Ship Inside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter Scammers Target Middle East Influencers With Meta’s Own Tools The Miseducation of America’s Nurse Practitioners\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Apple and other tech giants turned to dividends — ‘They’ve won’",
        "content": "Investors raked in record dividend payments last year, and more of Big Tech is joining the party. After helping drag the market to record highs, mega caps like Meta and Alphabet have joined fellow tech giants Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia in returning cash to shareholders. While dividends may be more commonly associated with traditional value stocks, rather than market darlings helping drive the A.I. boom, analysts said the move opens these stocks to new categories of investors—and utilizes cash that has few places to go.\n\nFacebook-parent Meta introduced a 50-cent dividend in February, which helped fuel a historic rally for the stock. Three months later, Alphabet followed suit with a dividend of 20 cents per share, sparking a 10% gain in the Google-parent’s shares.\n\nIn doing so, the companies finally joined the likes of Microsoft, which first declared a dividend in 2003, and Apple, which reinstated its quarterly dividend in 2012 after suspending it for 17 years. In the first quarter of 2024, the latter two companies were the third- and eighth-biggest dividend payers in the world, according to the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index.\n\nCompanies in growth-mode are typically focused on reinvesting in the business, not redistributing earnings back to shareholders, but CFRA Research’s Angelo Zino and Baird’s Ted Mortonson both said these dividend payments don’t represent a threat to future dominance.\n\n“I don’t view it as a problem,” Mortonson said. “I view it as they’ve won. They’ve won the technology side. They've won on the business-model side, and they're going to win on the Gen AI cycle.”\n\nMassive cash flows and few acquisition options make Big Tech dividends natural move\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven,\" a movie-inspired moniker that refers to Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, accounted for half of the S&P 500’s total gains last year, according to a report from Morgan Stanley. Amazon and Tesla—the latter an outlier in the group due to its much weaker profitability—are the only two members that do not pay a dividend.\n\nIn May, Nvidia increased its dividend by 150%, from $0.04 to $0.10, but only to make way for a 10-for-1 stock split that resulted in a quarterly payout of just $0.01. It's worth remembering the dividend yields for Big Tech remain quite low relative to the rest of the market. The average yield for a dividend-paying stock in the S&P 500 is about 2.3%, according to Barron’s. That’s well above the likes of Microsoft (0.73%), Apple (0.55%), Alphabet (0.47%) and Meta (0.42%), per Morningstar.\n\nStory continues\n\nZino noted these companies' payouts represent a marginal portion of their free cash flows, which together exceed $200 billion as of last quarter. With a collective cash balance of over $400 billion, including a whopping $162 billion at Apple, there's only so many ways for the tech giants to deploy it.\n\nOne option is massive share buybacks. Meta's and Alphabet’s dividend announcements came with $50 billion and $70 billion repurchase authorizations, respectively. Apple set the record for the largest buyback in U.S. history by repurchasing $110 billion of shares in May, topping the $100 billion mark it previously set in 2018.\n\nPotential acquisitions, however, appear to be drying up as Big Tech draws antitrust scrutiny. Widely expected regulatory hurdles, for example, might have scuttled talks over Google’s $23 billion bid for cybersecurity startup Wiz last week.\n\nSo, despite hefty investments in AI, there’s plenty to reinvest and then some.\n\n“They better pay a dividend,” Mortonson said of the tech giants, “because they’re going to be free cash flowing better than some countries.”\n\nBoth Mortonson and Zino noted paying dividends makes these Big Tech stocks eligible for inclusion in income and dividend funds, expanding their investor pools dramatically. The recent sell-off of tech stocks, meanwhile, could also make these companies more appealing to value-focused investors.\n\n“We see potential for them to significantly hike those dividends here over the next three years or so,” Zino said.\n\nFor investors seeking both eye-watering growth and consistent returns, it just might be a win-win.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nTech stocks led the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lower Tuesday as the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) closed at the lowest level since early June.\n\nIt was the fourth day the tech-heavy index lost 1.5% or more in the month of July, especially notable as there had not been any losses of that magnitude in the two prior months.\n\nAhead of June's Consumer Price Index reading on July 11, the Nasdaq 100 had been up 23% year to date. But after the CPI registered its first monthly drop in inflation since 2020, investors kicked off a stomach-churning rotation from large stocks into small.\n\nSince then, the Nasdaq has surrendered half those gains, sending many investors into relative shock upon learning that the laggard Russell 2000 index (^RUT) has nearly caught up to the volatile index known as home to the largest tech players.\n\n\"[I] didn’t have [the] Russell 2000 catching the Nasdaq 100 year-to-date on my bingo card to start this month. Getting close,\" wrote Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets and former NYSE floor governor.\n\nThe Russell 2000 is now sporting a better return this year than the artificial intelligence-fueled S&P Select Tech SPDR Fund (XLK) — and it's only a few points away from catching the S&P 500.\n\nIn the month of June alone, the Nasdaq outperformed the Russell 2000 by over 7 percentage points. Then, in July, the relationship violently inverted such that the Russell outperformed the Nasdaq by nearly 14 percentage points. It's the biggest month-to-month flip in leadership that we have data for, going back to 1988.\n\nThe narrative in the press followed the rotation as grave concerns over market concentration in the Magnificent Seven gave way to a small-cap miracle rally.\n\nTo be clear, sector rotation is a healthy feature of bull markets. When a leading group of stocks takes a back seat, other pockets of the market should take their place such that — at the index level — volatility is subdued. Extremes on either side average out.\n\nBut, given the speed and strength of the recent move, Wall Street is now assessing the damage to institutional portfolios.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley's derivatives team, \"volatility of the last two weeks started out being very rotational.\"\n\nHowever, as the move gained steam, institutions began reining in leverage (borrowed money) and reducing directional bets on stocks. \"What began as a de-grossing event has quickly turned more towards a shift in directional exposure to equities,\" the team continued.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of this, and there's still a Fed meeting later today and a Meta quarterly report to close July.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Just Dropped More Than 18% In 15 Days. Should Investors Be Worried?",
        "content": "It's been quite the ride for Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) investors over the past few years. If you were lucky enough to buy in 2022 before the stock went on a tear, you could be up nearly 800% -- not a bad return. The semiconductor designer almost singlehandedly supplies the artificial intelligence (AI) industry with its enormously powerful \"superchips\" and is rewarded handsomely for it.\n\nAs Nvidia posted earnings that beat already sky-high expectations quarter after quarter, investors quickly jumped on board and many watched as their portfolios swelled. You could be forgiven for thinking that up was the only direction its share price could move, but over the last month, it's retreated. It's down more than 18% since July 10.\n\nSo what gives? Should investors be worried? In short, probably not. Stocks naturally retreat after big gains. It's to be expected; in fact, it's healthy. Yes, 18% is a lot, many stocks move less over the course of a year, but we've got to keep perspective here. Remember, Nvidia is up over 115% already this year.\n\nHowever, we also don't want to stick our heads in the sand, especially with a stock that is so hot. Hype can be a real danger; a healthy skepticism is always the right attitude to maintain in the market. There are some real factors that may be contributing to the retreat.\n\nInvestors are questioning the viability of AI as a whole\n\nNvidia isn't alone in seeing its stock dip. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite as a whole saw one of its worst days in a long time after Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) reported its second-quarter earnings on July 23. Maybe this surprised some investors. After all, Alphabet actually beat earnings per share (EPS) consensus estimates and reported a nearly 14% year-over-year jump in revenue. Strange that the stock would dip then, no? Well, investors were focused on the increase in capital expenditures.\n\nThe company is spending a lot of money in its quest to stay ahead of the AI pack -- even more than many expected -- and it looks like this will continue for some time. There is a concern that the return on this investment won't be enough to justify the spending.\n\nThis is a legitimate concern and my top word of caution for Nvidia investors. Alphabet and the rest of big tech will only pay exorbitant sums of money for Nvidia's chips if they are making exorbitant sums of money from the AI products they create. No one expects there to be parity here right away; it will take time. At some point, however, if a balance isn't reached, Alphabet et all will have to slow their AI-directed spending, and the Nvidia gravy train will dry up.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think this recent dip is likely, in part, a reflection of this concern.\n\nDespite the retreat, this isn't the time to jump ship\n\nIt's important to maintain a long-term investing horizon. Find a good company and stick with it, so long as the long-term thesis still holds. Certainly, there are exceptions, but this is not one of them; it is likely a blip in the long-term trajectory of Nvidia. The company is still positioned at the very center of a market that could be absolutely massive.\n\nBig tech is gearing up to spend upward of $1 trillion on AI in the coming years, mostly focused on building out data centers. Guess what's one of the most essential and expensive parts of a data center -- the very chips that Nvidia makes. Even if AI fails to deliver in the way it needs to, it will take years before big tech backs off its investments.\n\nOnly time will tell if the promise of AI becomes a reality, but at this point, Nvidia still looks like a solid bet.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Hold for at Least a Decade",
        "content": "The stock market has fluctuated greatly in recent years, highlighting the importance of dedicating a portion of your holdings to reliable long-term growth stocks.\n\nMacroeconomic headwinds saw the S&P 500 index plunge 20% in 2022. Excitement over tech stocks and artificial intelligence (AI) prompted a recovery the following year, with the same index rising 24% in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has popped 14% so far this year, and it is on track to at least equal last year's growth.\n\nHowever, recent market uncertainty fueled by unforeseeable events like a global pandemic and a subsequent economic downturn suggests it's not a bad idea to fortify your portfolio with historically reliable investments. The tech market is an excellent place to start, known for its wealth of growth stocks that have boosted the Nasdaq Technology Sector by 370% over the last decade. For reference, the S&P 500 has risen 176% in that period.\n\nSo, here are two growth stocks to buy in 2024 and hold for at least a decade.\n\n1. Amazon: A surprisingly great value\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has delivered impressive growth in its 30 years of business. Over the last decade alone, its stock has climbed more than 1,000%. Meanwhile, annual revenue has risen 545%, and operating income skyrocketed over 20,000%. The company's success is mainly owed to consistent reinvestment in its business, which has seen it expand to the far corners of tech.\n\nAmazon has become a behemoth of a brand, with solid positions in markets such as e-commerce, cloud computing, video streaming, grocery, AI, and more. The company has achieved leading market shares in multiple industries, with growth catalysts across tech that could boost earnings for years.\n\nMoreover, according to a recent Blomberg report, the company's cash hoard is expected to swell to $100 billion in 2024. The figure could see Amazon introduce its first dividend in the near future, with Ami Asset Management's Andrew Zamfotis stating, \"A dividend might be inevitable, and would really signal that it is going to be more focused on spending and profitable growth.\"\n\nThe company has previously been hyperfocused on reinvestment. However, with its free cash flow projected to nearly double this year, conditions could be ripe for a cash reward to investors.\n\nShares in Amazon are up about 20% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500 by about 6 points. Yet, consistent sales growth has kept the company's stock a value. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe table above shows that Amazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is at an attractive 3 and about in line with its five-year average. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is high at 51, yet well below its five-year average, signaling a buying opportunity. For reference, Amazon's stock has risen 88% in the last five years while maintaining this average.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeing below its average for both metrics represents a bargain, making Amazon a no-brainer growth stock to buy in 2024.\n\n2. Alphabet: Reliable financial growth\n\nLike Amazon, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has enjoyed stellar gains in its time. Its stock has soared 458% since 2014, with annual revenue and operating income rising 365% and 411%, respectively.\n\nThe company's success stems from an impressive roster of subsidiaries, which includes brands like Google, Chrome, Android, YouTube, and even Fitbit. These products have elevated Alphabet's business, allowing it to hit $61 billion in free cash flow this year. The company has used its abundance of cash to invest heavily in AI and reward loyal investors, introducing its first dividend in June with a quarterly payout of $0.20 per share.\n\nAlphabet's new dividend is a promising vote of confidence from executives, representing the belief that the company will continue expanding its earnings for the foreseeable future.\n\nOn July 23, Alphabet reported its second quarter of 2024 earnings. The company delivered revenue growth of 14% year over year, with operating income jumping 26%. Alphabet profited from significant gains in its Google Cloud segment, where revenue rose 28% year over year, and operating income almost tripled.\n\nGoogle Cloud is the world's third-largest cloud platform after Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft's Azure. However, Google Cloud has made impressive strides this year, consistently beating its competitors in growth. Alphabet's business has long been centered around digital advertising, which remains a lucrative division. Still, cloud computing will likely be a key growth driver over the next decade as AI continues to boost the industry.\n\nAlphabet is easily one of the most reliable growth stocks, with years of consistent financial and share price appreciation. Its P/E currently sits at an attractive 24, below its five-year average and lower than many of its rivals'. In addition to generating reliable financial gains, Alphabet is a growth stock you can buy now and hold indefinitely.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Fed decision, BOJ, Microsoft, Meta Platforms - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- The Bank of Japan hiked interest rates earlier Wednesday, putting the focus on the Federal Reserve, which concludes its July meeting later in the session. Wall Street looks set to end the month on a positive note as investors digest earnings from the likes of Microsoft.\n\n1. BOJ hikes, and the Fed is next…\n\nThe Bank of Japan started the week’s central bank parade earlier Wednesday, raising interest rates and signaling its resolve to unwind a decade of massive monetary stimulus.\n\nThe Japanese central bank hiked its overnight call rate target to 0.25% from 0-0.1% by a 7-2 vote and laid out a detailed quantitative tightening plan that will reduce monthly bond buying in several stages to around Y3 trillion, half the current rough target, by early 2026.\n\nWednesday's rate hike comes amid some improvements in Japanese inflation over the past two months, especially as consumer spending improved on stronger wages.\n\nThis trend furthered the central bank’s forecast that inflation will climb to its 2% annual target sustainably, and that monetary conditions will have to tighten accordingly.\n\nIn the U.S., by contrast, a benign June inflation report has investors looking for the policymakers to lay the groundwork for a September rate cut.\n\nThe Federal Reserve concludes its July meeting later Wednesday, and is widely expected to maintain its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, as it has done since last July.\n\nFutures are fully priced for a quarter-point easing in September, with a small chance of a reduction of 50 basis points, and have 66 basis points of easing priced in by Christmas.\n\n2. Futures rise as investors digest corporate results\n\nU.S. stock futures rose Wednesday as investors awaited the conclusion of the latest Federal Reserve meeting while parsing through a series of important earnings reports.\n\nBy 04:10 ET (08:10 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 77 points, or 0.2%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 42 points, or 0.8%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 252 points, or 1.3%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve concludes its two-day policy meeting later in the session, and investors will be looking for clues over the timing and number of rate cuts to expect this year.\n\nThere are more earnings to digest Wednesday, including from Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) [see below] after the close. Other names set to release numbers include Boeing (NYSE:BA) before the bell, as well as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) and Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) later on.\n\nThis is the final session of July, and both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are on course to end the month lower, with the latter seen losing over 3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, on the other hand, is on track to finish the month higher by more than 4%, as the market rotated out of the major tech stocks into companies that are smaller and more cyclically oriented.\n\n3. Microsoft’s cloud growth disappoints\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointed with its fourth-quarter update after the close Tuesday, as the tech giant indicated it would spend more money on artificial intelligence infrastructure, even as growth slowed in its cloud business.\n\nThis offered another sign that the payoff from hefty investments in the technology may take longer than Wall Street had hoped.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud business, Azure, which is widely viewed as a barometer for AI demand, grew 29%, marking a slowdown from 31% growth seen in the previous quarter.\n\nAdditionally, AI-related growth accounted for about 8% of Azure's total growth, up from 7% in the third quarter.\n\nHowever, this came as Microsoft continued to ramp up investments, with capital spending jumping to $19 billion in the quarter, up from $14 billion in the prior quarter, and nearly double the $10.7 billion seen a year ago.\n\nIt wasn’t all bad news for the sector though, as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) increased its 2024 forecast for artificial intelligence chip sales by $500 million and said supplies would remain tight through 2025.\n\n4. Meta expected to see jump in revenue\n\nMeta Platforms is the latest of the mega-cap tech giants to release quarterly results this week, with the numbers due after the close Wednesday.\n\nMeta, which owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, among other products and services, is expected to report a 20% rise in quarterly revenue, helped by strong ad sales driven by the Olympics and elections in several countries.\n\nHowever, like fellow tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft, investors will want to see if the billions it is spending on tech infrastructure to support AI development is starting to yield returns.\n\n\"We remain positive on Meta and think Reels, Messaging and AI-driven ad improvements are still early, and could lead to positive product surprises and revenue upside,\" analysts at BofA Securities said.\n\n\"With political spend, and potential TikTok ban in 1Q'25, Meta could also see an ad spend benefit in 2H'24.\"\n\n5. Crude prices rise on elevated political tensions\n\nCrude prices soared Wednesday after the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran ratcheted up tensions in the Middle East, raising the prospects of a wider conflict hitting supplies.\n\nBy 04:10 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 1.8% to $76.08 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.7% to $79.38 a barrel.\n\nMultiple media reports said that Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike, and could mean a potential escalation in the Israel-Hamas war, which stretched into a ninth month in July.\n\nIt could also result in a resurgence in tensions between Iran and Israel, after a series of missile strikes between the two earlier this year, and furthered fears of an all-out war in the Middle East, especially after Israel carried out strikes against Lebanon-based, Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah on Tuesday.\n\nThis news has overshadowed data from the American Petroleum Institute showing on Tuesday that U.S. inventories saw a draw of nearly 4.5 million barrels last week.\n\nThe reading marked a fifth straight week of draws in U.S. inventories, as fuel demand remained underpinned by the travel-heavy summer season.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFed decision, BOJ, Microsoft, Meta Platforms - what's moving markets\n\nWorld Bank approves $1.5 billion in financing for Ethiopia\n\nBOJ Governor Ueda's comments at news conference\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.’s Azure cloud-computing service posted a slowdown in quarterly growth, disappointing investors anxious to see a payoff from huge investments in artificial intelligence products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nKamala Harris Wipes Out Trump’s Swing-State Lead in Election Dead Heat Luxury Heir Alleges His $13 Billion Hermès Fortune Has Vanished Intel to Cut Thousands of Jobs to Reduce Costs, Fund Rebound Tech Stocks Hit as Microsoft Down 6% in Late Hours: Markets Wrap Rich Hong Kong Families Sell Mansions at Discounts to Repay Debt\n\nRevenue from Azure, Microsoft’s main growth engine in recent years, rose 29% in the fiscal fourth quarter, compared with a 31% jump in the previous period. About 8 percentage points of the increase in the recent period was attributable to AI, up from 7 percentage points in the prior quarter.\n\n“It was really about the cloud services number — it needed to just be a little higher,” Doug Clinton, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said on Bloomberg Television. Still, the accelerated contribution from AI confirms business momentum with that emerging technology, wrote Raimo Lenschow, an analyst at Barclays.\n\nChief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been infusing Microsoft’s product line with AI technology from partner OpenAI, including digital assistants called Copilots that can summarize documents and generate computer code, emails and other content. The company also is selling Azure cloud subscriptions featuring OpenAI products. Alongside rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Google, Microsoft has been spending billions to construct new data centers to meet demand for cloud computing and power-hungry AI services.\n\nOn a call with analysts Tuesday, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said that although Azure growth will continue to slow in the current quarter, which ends in September, investments in data centers and servers will let the company capitalize on demand and accelerate Azure growth in the second half of fiscal 2025.\n\nMicrosoft’s shares fell about 4% in extended trading, paring earlier losses of as much as 9.1%. The stock had closed at $422.92 in New York, for a gain of 12% in 2024.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, which ended June 30, capital expenditures — closely watched by investors as the company embarks on its historic AI build-out — jumped to $19 billion, including server farm leases, from $14 billion in the previous quarter. That number will increase in the new fiscal year, Hood said.\n\nIn an interview, investor relations chief Brett Iversen said Microsoft currently lacks sufficient capacity to fulfill customer demand for cloud and AI services. “We’re building out for that as quickly as we can,” he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn recent weeks, skittish investors have signaled impatience with tech companies’ efforts to profit from their massive investments in AI. Last week, the shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. sank after the company surprised Wall Street with sharply higher costs that overshadowed strong sales.\n\nMany of Microsoft’s corporate customers are only just starting to use new AI assistants, which still struggle to understand the context of some requests and handle commands involving multiple apps. The Copilot service, which doubles the cost of a monthly subscription to about $60 per user for corporations, is expected to eventually generate a robust flow of recurring revenue.\n\nIversen said customers are increasingly adopting the company’s higher-tier Office 365 product, which includes generative AI features. Sales from commercial cloud products including Azure and office applications rose 21% to $36.8 billion, Microsoft said, about in line with Wall Street estimates.\n\nTotal revenue in the fourth quarter increased 15% to $64.7 billion, while adjusted profit was $2.95 a share, the company said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts on average estimated sales of $64.5 billion and per-share earnings of $2.94.\n\nOn the call, Nadella said the number of people using Copilot at work doubled quarter-over-quarter. Use of Copilot within GitHub, which allows for AI assistance in software development, accounts for 40% of revenue growth within that business, he added.\n\nThe company’s Xbox video-gaming unit posted 61% growth in content and services revenue, much of that fueled by the $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard, which was completed in October.\n\nHours before reporting its financial results, Microsoft’s Azure and Office 365 services suffered partial outages, which also took down services by customers including Starbucks Corp.\n\nJust a couple of weeks earlier, some 8 million computers running Microsoft’s Windows operating system crashed after the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. released a flawed software update. Though the outage was caused by CrowdStrike, “Microsoft may still have to deal with negative perception around perceived vulnerabilities to its operating system,” Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citigroup, wrote ahead of earnings.\n\nNadella touted progress in the company’s cybersecurity products during the call with investors. The company says it has more than 1.2 million security customers, and Defender for Cloud, a security product, passed $1 billion in revenue over the past year. “We continue to prioritize security above all else,” Nadella said.\n\n(Updates with CEO comment from conference call in final paragraph.

        "title": "FACT FOCUS: Google autocomplete results around Trump lead to claims of election interference",
        "content": "With fewer than 100 days until the 2024 election, social media users are claiming that a lack of Google autocomplete results about former President Donald Trump and his attempted assassination is evidence of election interference.\n\nMany posts include screenshots showing what the autocomplete feature, which predicts what users are trying to type, has generated for text such as “attempted assassination of tr” or “president donald.” Among the pictured results for the former phrase are references to other assassination attempts, including that of Harry Truman and Gerald Ford, but nothing for Trump. The latter provides two options — “president donald duck” and “president donald regan.”\n\nMultiple high-profile figures, including Trump and sitting members of Congress, promoted the claim across social media platforms, collectively amassing more than 1 million likes and shares by Tuesday. Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGoogle attributed the situation to existing protections against autocomplete predictions associated with political violence, noting that “no manual action was taken” to suppress information about Trump.\n\nSearch engine experts said there are many reasons that could explain why some autocomplete results concerning the former president were not appearing.\n\nHere’s a closer look at the facts.\n\nCLAIM: Google is engaging in election interference by censoring autocomplete results about former President Donald Trump, including the assassination attempt at his Pennsylvania rally on July 13.\n\nTHE FACTS: It is true that Google’s autocomplete feature as of Monday was not finishing certain phrases related to Trump and the assassination attempt as shown in screenshots spreading online, but there is no evidence it was related to election interference.\n\nBy Tuesday, some of the same terms were providing relevant autocomplete results. The text “president donald” now also suggests “Donald Trump” as a search option. Similarly, the phrase “attempted assassination of” includes Trump’s name in autocomplete predictions. Adding “tr” to the same phrase though makes the option disappear.\n\nCompleted searches about Trump and the assassination attempt done on both Monday and Tuesday yielded extensive relevant results regardless of what autocomplete predictions came up.\n\nGoogle told the AP that its autocomplete feature has automated protections regarding violent topics, including for searches about theoretical assassination attempts. The company further explained that its systems were out of date even prior to July 13, meaning that the protections already in place couldn’t take into account that an actual assassination attempt had occurred.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditional autocomplete results now appearing about Trump are the result of systemic improvements — rather than targeted manual fixes — that will affect many other topics, according to the company.\n\n“We’re rolling out improvements to our Autocomplete systems to show more up-to-date predictions,” Google told The Associated Press in a statement. “The issues are beginning to resolve, and we’ll continue to make improvements as needed. As always, predictions change over time and there may be some imperfections. Autocomplete helps save people time, but they can always search for whatever they want, and we will continue to connect them with helpful information.”\n\nSearch engine experts told the AP that they don’t see evidence of suspicious activities on Google’s part and that there are plenty of other reasons to explain why there have been a lack of autocomplete predictions about Trump.\n\n“It’s very plausible that there’s nothing nefarious here, that it’s other systems that are set up for neutral or good purposes that are causing these query suggestions to not show up,” said Michael Ekstrand, an assistant professor at Drexel University who studies AI-powered information access systems. “I don’t have a reason not to believe Google’s claim that this is just normal systems for other purposes, particularly around political violence.”\n\nThorsten Joachims, a professor at Cornell University who researches machine learning for search engines, explained that autocomplete tools typically work by looking at queries people make frequently over a certain period of time, providing the most frequent completions of those queries. Beyond that, a search engine may automatically prune predictions based on concerns such as safety and privacy.\n\nThis means that it’s plausible that Google’s autocomplete feature wouldn’t have accounted for recent searches about the assassination attempt on Trump, especially if its systems indeed had not been updated since before the shooting.\n\n\"Depending on how big the window is that they’re averaging over, that may simply not be a frequent query,” Joachims said. “And it may not be a candidate for autocompletion.” He added that it’s typical not to update a search model on a daily basis, given the costs and technical risks involved.\n\nA 2020 Google blog post about its autocomplete feature describes how the system reflects previous searches and why users might not see certain predictions, including those that are violent in nature. The post also explains that predictions may vary based on variables such as a user’s location, the language they speak or rising interest in a topic.\n\nBoth Ekstrand and Joachims agreed that proving bias in a complex system like Google’s search engine from the outside would be extremely difficult. It would require much more data than just a couple of searches, for example, and would risk setting off the company’s protections against data scraping, reverse engineering and fraud.\n\n“In general, claims that platforms are taking particular targeted actions against specific people on political bases are hard to substantiate,” Ekstrand said. “They sometimes, I’m sure, happen, but there’s so many other explanations that it’s difficult to substantiate such claims.”\n\nJoachims noted that the demographics of Google’s user base could impact the results of such a study if they skewed toward one side of the political aisle or another and therefore searched more for their preferred candidates. In other words, the way the system works would make it difficult to probe the system.\n\nTechnical issues aside, limiting autocomplete predictions as a method of political influence could simply be bad for business.\n\n“Even if Google would like to do that, I think it would be a very bad decision because they could lose a lot of users,” said Ricardo Baeza-Yates, a professor at Northeastern University whose research includes web search and information retrieval.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- S&P futures were flat and Dow futures fell in evening deals on Tuesday as investors hunkered down before a decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve, while disappointing earnings from Microsoft weighed on major technology stocks.\n\nBut Nasdaq futures rose, aided by a rebound in chipmaking stocks following stronger-than-expected earnings from AMD, which showed artificial intelligence still remained an earnings driver for the sector.\n\nS&P 500 Futures steadied at 5,476.75 points, while Dow Jones Futures fell 0.4% to 40,795.0 points by 19:39 ET (23:39 GMT). Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.4% to 19,021.0 points.\n\nMicrosoft cloud revenue misses estimates despite spending increase\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell more than 3% in afterhours trade after its fourth-quarter cloud revenue growth missed Wall Street estimates. The stock had fallen as far as 7%, but pared losses after it said on an earnings call that cloud growth would accelerate in the coming quarters.\n\nWhile the firm’s overall earnings just edged past estimates for the June quarter, revenue from Azure, the company’s cloud business, grew 29%, missing estimates of 30.2% and also slowing from the 31% rise in the prior quarter. This came even as investment in AI saw capital expenditure surge by $5 billion in the quarter.\n\nAzure is Microsoft’s main platform for its AI offerings, and serves as a barometer for demand for the sector. The Redmond, Washington-based tech giant is among the frontrunners on Wall Street to monetize AI, having tied up with OpenAI to release a slew of products over the past year.\n\nMicrosoft’s earnings sparked losses across most of its heavyweight tech peers, given that they came just a week after earnings from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) showed a similar trend.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), which are set to report earnings on Wednesday, fell 1% and 0.7%, respectively, while Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which will report earnings on Thursday, fell 0.5%.\n\nChipmakers rebound on strong showing from AMD\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) surged over 8%, while rival NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) added 5.4% after AMD clocked stronger-than-expected earnings and forecast upbeat revenue for the current quarter, citing strong demand from AI.\n\nAMD’s earnings sparked gains across chipmaking stocks.

Christopher Jasper reports:\n\nBoss Guillaume Faury said Tuesday that disruption to supply chains at his own company and a safety and quality-control crisis at rival Boeing are having a knock-on effect for carriers relying on new fleets to deliver ambitious reductions in CO2 output.\n\nAir New Zealand said earlier it would drop the 2030 goal as delivery delays make it increasingly likely that less-efficient jets will need to be retained. At the end of March it had outstanding orders for five Airbus A320neo short-haul jets and eight Boeing 787 widebodies.\n\nMr Faury conceded that the move reflected “the broader situation of slower deliveries from the aircraft manufacturers. Replacing the old generation of planes with modern ones is a significant driver of CO2 reduction. And a slowdown in the ramp up has an impact on the speed of the replacement.”\n\nHe said that new aircraft typically reduce fuel burn and emissions by 20pc, rising to as much as 40pc when very old models are being stood down.\n\nAir New Zealand, which withdrew from the UN-backed Science Based Targets initiative, said efforts to reduce emissions were also being held back by the lack of availability – and cost – of sustainable aviation fuel.\n\nAirbus confirmed that it expects to deliver 770 airliners this year, down from an initial target of around 800, as suppliers struggle to meet demand for components including engines, seats, cabin trim and landing gear. The company has pushed back plans to lift A320 build rates to 75 per month by a year to 2027 as a result of the parts crunch.\n\nOperating profits at the company fell by more than half in the second quarter as its space business booked a charge of €989m against underperforming telecoms, navigation  and observation programmes, more than flagged in a profit warning last month. Faury said Airbus is evaluating all options for the division, including a restructuring or partial sale.\n\nStory continues\n\n07:23 PM BST\n\nNvidia slumps as Big Tech sell-off deepens\n\nUS chip giant Nvidia dropped 5.7pc today as investors waited with bated breath for a steer from tonight’s Microsoft results on how well artificial intelligence-focused companies are performing.\n\nThe sell-off of technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq index down 1pc.\n\nMicrosoft, widely seen as a frontrunner in the artificial intelligence race, will release its quarterly results at 9pm today.

Christopher Jasper reports:\n\nThe closure of the £500m Restoring Your Railway fund, announced by Rachel Reeves on Monday, leaves the future of projects across England and Wales hanging in the balance in a blow to small-town Britain.\n\nThe fund was established in 2020 as part of Boris Johnson’s “levelling up” agenda and has so far helped finance the reopening or near reopening of two lines and six stations. A dozen more projects are at an advanced stage and 20 others have received some funding.\n\nBriefing notes issued following the Chancellor’s speech, in which she claimed that Labour had inherited a £22bn hole in the public finances from the Tories, suggest that scrapping the Restoring Your Railway programme will save £76m next year.\n\nRailFuture, which campaigns for better passenger and freight services and has 20,000 members, said Ms Reeves’ intervention was “shortsighted” and at odds with Labour’s aim of putting infrastructure and construction at the heart of plans to revive the economy.\n\nRead the full story...

Melissa Lawford reports:\n\nAngela Rayner, the Deputy Prime Minister, will cut the capital’s housebuilding target from 100,000 homes per year to 80,000 as she tears up the Tory method for calculating housing need.\n\nMs Rayner plans to scrap the old system that placed a huge emphasis on building in cities, according to her draft National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) published on Tuesday.\n\nAlthough this will mean more houses are needed in many rural parts of the country, the demands on London are being cut in a move that will make targets easier to hit for Mr Khan, the capital’s Mayor.\n\nMs Rayner intends to restore councils’ mandatory targets after they were scrapped by the Tories, as part of Labour’s manifesto pledge to build 1.5m homes over the next five years.\n\nRead the full story...

Its stock is down 1.5pc.\n\nOther megacap stocks such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook-owner Meta, Alphabet and Tesla also fell, as investors refrained from big bets ahead of tech earnings scheduled through the week.\n\nAI favorite Nvidia slumped 6.2pc, leading a sharp erosion in chip stocks and pushing the Philadelphia Semiconductor index of 30 top US semiconductor companies down 2.9pc.\n\nLast week, results from Tesla and Google-owner Alphabet induced a broad-based market sell-off in the previous week.\n\nThe bar is set high for these highly valued technology behemoths, whose quarterly results will be scrutinised for signs they have the momentum to spur further AI-led equity rallies.\n\nBrian Klimke, chief market strategist at Cetera Investment Management, said:\n\nBig Tech has had a great rally and for it to continue, they’re going to have to show benefits of AI and the investments they made in it.\n\nIf not, we could see more of a rotation into smaller cap stocks and value stocks.\n\n05:17 PM BST\n\nPfizer lifts profit forecast on strong sales of cancer and heart drugs\n\nPfizer raised its annual profit forecast on Tuesday. Bits shares dipped 0.9pc this afternoon with investors unconvinced that over its future plans.\n\nIt was helped by cancer treatments acquired through a $43bn deal for Seagen and strong sales of its heart disease drug as the company deals with a sharp revenue drop from Covid products.\n\nThe market for Pfizer’s Covid vaccine and treatment has shrunk by billions of dollars a year.\n\nPfizer chief Albert Bourla responded with several acquisitions, including the Seagen deal and cost-cutting measures. The New York-based drugmaker has also sharpened its focus on cancer treatments.\n\nInvestors fled from Pfizer as Covid worries declined and the company’s shares are trading at around half their pandemic-era highs.\n\nJ.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott said he expects Pfizer’s stock to continue to trade in the current range due to limited revenue growth and stronger expectations for many of its rivals.\n\nHe said:\n\nWe believe stronger new launch performance and/or further progress on the pipeline will be necessary to significantly change the narrative.\n\n05:13 PM BST\n\nFacebook agrees $1.4bn settlement in privacy lawsuit\n\nFacebook-owner Meta has agreed to a $1.4bn (£1.1bn) settlement with Texas in a privacy lawsuit.\r\n\r\nThe tech giant is to pay out over claims that it used biometric data of users without their permission, officials from the US state said on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nKen Paxton, the Texas Attorney General, said the settlement is the largest-ever secured in a legal action by a single state. In 2021, a judge approved a $650m settlement with the company over similar claims in Illinois.\r\n\r\nFiled in 2022, the Texas lawsuit alleged that Meta was in violation of a state law that prohibits capturing or selling a resident’s biometric information, such as their face or fingerprint, without their consent.\r\n\r\nMeta, which made no admission of wrongdoing, said:\n\nWe are pleased to resolve this matter, and look forward to exploring future opportunities to deepen our business investments in Texas, including potentially developing data centers.

The top riser was Standard Chartered, up 5.9pc, followed by Burberry, up 3.7pc. The top faller was medical device company ConvaTec, down 5.8pc, followed by gambling group Entain, down 5.5pc.\n\nMeanwhile, the mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 0.9pc. The top riser was wealth manager St James’s Place, up 24.8pc, followed by sausage roll giant Greggs, up 5pc. The biggest faller was Ocado, down 6pc, followed by City firm Close Brothers, down 2.9pc.\n\n04:33 PM BST\n\nMicrosoft shares dip 1pc ahead of results\n\nMicrosoft shares have dipped this afternoon as investors wait for tonight’s financial results.\n\nThe software giant, with a market capitalisation of $3.1 trillion (£2.4 trillion), has benefited hugely from the hype around artificial intelligence.\n\nIts shares up more than quarter in the past year, with investors hopeful that it is able to translate its investments in AI into greater revenues at its cloud computing unit Azure.\n\nTed Mortonson, managing director at wealth management firm Robert W. Baird, said:\n\nMicrosoft has to beat in a big way and they’ve got to show Gen AI monetisation. [It is] the most over-owned name globally, next to Nvidia. So those two really have to put up some good numbers.\n\nAnd you’re going to have to see Azure accelerate ... to make it work.\n\n04:25 PM BST\n\nDrug giant’s sales in China cause shares to sink\n\nShares in the drug giant Merck plunged 10pc after shipments of its Gardasil vaccine in the important China market declined in the second quarter, sparking investor concerns.\n\nGardasil, which prevents cancer caused by the human papillomavirus, has been one of Merck’s top growth drivers aside from cancer immunotherapy Keytruda - the world’s top-selling prescription medicine - with much of its increase coming from demand from China.\n\nSales of the drug have more than doubled since 2020 and are expected to close in on $10bn (£7.8bn) this year.\n\nMerck said it was trying to determine the reason for the change in China, where it was seeing lower shipments from its distributor Zhifei to vaccination centers.\n\n04:22 PM BST\n\nWorld stocks mixed amid investor jitters, while commodities tumble\n\nWorld stocks are mixed in choppy trading today. Investors are jittery ahead of major corporate earnings reports and central bank moves - with the much-anticipated Microsoft rates out after 9pm tonight.\n\nMeanwhile, concern over the global economic outlook dented commodities and oil prices touched lows from early June.\n\nBrent Crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, fell 1.4pc as worry over Chinese energy demand outweighed any concern about tensions in the Middle East or Venezuela.\n\nCopper and iron ore prices were also lower, and aluminium fell to multi-month lows. It came after little by way of support from China’s Politburo, which at its July meeting announced no new detailed efforts to boost the economy.\n\nChris Scicluna, an economist at Daiwa Capital, said:\n\nChina has got its own problems and doesn’t look like it’s going to snap into gear.\n\nUnderstandably, we might have been hoping for the global economy to be gaining traction and momentum to be picking up ... but it looks like maybe things are coming off the boil a bit.\n\nThe MSCI World index dropped 0.3pc. However, the pan-European Stoxx 600 rose 0.5pc, and France’s Cac 40 and Germany’s Dax both rose 0.4pc. The FTSE 100 is down 0.2pc.\n\n04:10 PM BST\n\nUS job openings fall as high interest rates slowly cool a hot labour market\n\nUS job openings fell slightly last month, a sign that the American labour market continues to cool in the face of high interest rates.\n\nThere were 8.18m job vacancies in June, down from 8.23m in May, the US Labor Department reported this afternoon. The June number was stronger than expected: forecasters had expected 8m job openings.\n\nStill, the report showed other signs of a slowing job market. Employers hired 5.3m people, the fewest since April 2020 when the pandemic was hammering the economy.\n\nThe number of people quitting their jobs - a decision that reflects confidence in their ability to find higher pay or better working conditions elsewhere - slid to 3.3m, the fewest since November 2020.\n\nBut layoffs dropped to 1.5 million, lowest since November 2022 and down from 1.7 million in May, a sign that employers remain reluctant to let go of staff.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its meeting this week but to begin cutting them at its next gathering in September.\n\n04:05 PM BST\n\nUS consumer confidence edges up in July\n\nAmerican consumers felt more confident in July as expectations over the future rebounded.\n\nThe Conference Board, a business research group, said that its consumer confidence index rose to 100.3 in July from 97.8 in June.\n\nThe index measures both Americans’ assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months.\n\nThe July figure was slightly higher than market expectations, according to Briefing.com.\n\nDana Peterson, Conference Board chief economist, said:\n\nConfidence increased in July, but not enough to break free of the narrow range that has prevailed over the past two years.\n\nEven though consumers remain relatively positive about the labor market, they still appear to be concerned about elevated prices and interest rates, and uncertainty about the future ... things that may not improve until next year.\n\n03:57 PM BST\n\nInvestors ‘investors pile back’ into FTSE 250\n\nThe FTSE 250 has jumped by 1.2pc in trading today, as investors warm to the index - which contains UK-focused stocks.\n\nThe FTSE 100 is currently flat.\n\nChris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG, said:\n\nNews from Standard Chartered has helped provide some support to the FTSE 100, but fresh weakness for mining stocks and Diageo’s poor results have cast a shadow over the index.\n\nThe FTSE 100’s recent poor performance has seen its mid-cap cousin the FTSE 250 move further ahead, as investors pile back into UK-focused stocks despite the tough times ahead highlighted in the chancellor’s statement yesterday.\n\n03:54 PM BST\n\nYen weakens before Bank of Japan rate decision\n\nMarkets believe there could be an interest rate hike tomorrow by the Bank of Japan.\n\nThe Japanese central bank will announce its rate decision at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday. Markets are currently pricing in a 55pc chance of a 0.1 percentage point hike.\n\nThe yen weakened against the pound and the dollar ahead of the decision. It follows a significant rally this month that has seen the dollar lose around 4pc against the Japanese currency.\n\n“We’ve obviously had a very big move in the month of July,” said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies in New York. Traders “are probably cleaning up ahead of the events, and month-end flows are dominating today.”\n\nSome economists are also not convinced that the BOJ is ready to hike rates.\n\nJane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank, said:\n\nThe market certainly has been quite excited about a rate hike, but economists and Bank of Japan watchers are far less certain.\n\n03:47 PM BST\n\nWall Street drifts as profit reports keep pouring in\n\nAmerican stock indexes are drifting in quiet trading this afternoon as profit reports keep pouring in from big companies during Wall Street’s so-called earnings season.\n\nThe S&P 500 is down 0.1pc. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.4pc, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4pc.\n\nTrading on Wall Street has been relatively quiet so far this week ahead of profit reports from some of the market’s most influential companies. Microsoft will say how much it earned during the spring after trading ends this evening.

meaning it sold more than a year ago.\n\nIt also said Irn-Bru was growing its share of the soft drinks market in England as the brand, badged Scotland’s “other national drink”, grows in popularity across the border.\n\nThe company launched a new advert for the drink linked to the Scotland men’s football team qualifying for the Euro 2024 tournament, which it said had been “highly successful”.

whoever wins the White House in November, the chief executive of global bank Standard Chartered said.\n\nOur reporter Michael Bow has the details:\n\nBill Winters said he expected the new US administration’s “hawkish” approach to stay in place for next four years, with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump likely to maintain the same foreign policy of the last eight years.\n\n“The Biden administration has been very hawkish on China, with the combination of trade restrictions and sanctions and the Trump administration was also hawkish on China,” he said.\n\n“Whoever wins this election, Harris or Trump is likely to continue to be hawkish on China.”\n\nThe US presidential run-off in November is likely to pit Harris against Trump after President Biden announced he would not run again.\n\nStandard Chartered is based in the UK but its clients are based in Asia, leaving it more exposed to rising US-China tensions.\n\nMr Winters said the bank had swerved any fall-out from the chilly relationship so far, saying the services offered by the bank benefited from China having to “open up”.\n\n11:06 AM BST\n\nOil prices fall amid doubts over China

the eurozone economy grew faster than expected, according to economists.\n\nJack Allen-Reynolds of Capital Economics, said:\n\nThe eurozone’s recovery continued at a decent pace in Q2 and it should get a small boost from the Paris Olympics in Q3.\n\nBut the bigger picture is that the timeliest surveys are fairly weak and we expect the economy to undershoot consensus forecasts over the next few years.\n\nIn the third quarter, we think that the Olympics will add about 0.2pc to France’s GDP, raising eurozone GDP by 0.04 percentage points.\n\nBut that boost will disappear in the fourth quarter and the latest surveys suggest that underlying growth prospects are subdued.\n\nJuly’s PMIs were surprisingly weak and the European Commission’s economic sentiment indicator, published this morning, was some way below its long-run average too.\n\nTogether with the better-than-expected second quarter growth number, this will reinforce ECB policymakers’ view that there is no rush to loosen monetary policy significantly.\n\n10:15 AM BST\n\nEx-BT boss Jansen hired as WPP chairman\n\nWPP has appointed former BT boss Philip Jansen as its new chairman as the advertising giant grapples with the rapid

        "title": "Meta to report second quarter earnings with ad sales, AI spending top of mind",
        "content": "Facebook and Instagram parent Meta (META) reports its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, and the company’s AI spending and advertising business performance are set to take center stage.\n\nAI spending is a key measure for Wall Street as investors anxiously await a return on Big Tech’s investments in the technology. During its prior quarter, Meta CFO Susan Li raised the company’s full-year total expense estimate from between $94 billion and $99 billion to between $96 billion and $99 billion.\n\nFor the second quarter, Meta is expected to report earnings per share of $4.74 on revenue of $38.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Meta saw earnings per share of $2.98 on revenue of $31.9 billion during the same period last year.\n\nThe company’s Family of Apps revenue, which includes revenue from Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, is expected to come in at $37.7 billion, up from $31.7 billion in Q2 last year. Like Google, Meta could get a lift from advertising surrounding this year’s election as well as the Olympics. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg during an appearance at SIGGRAPH 2024 in Denver, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“Meta heads into its Q2 earnings in a position of strength,” Forrester VP and research director Mike Proulx said ahead of the company’s earnings announcement.\n\n“Expect to hear continued growth in Reels as Meta’s short-form video solution cuts into TikTok’s market share. And while Threads has proven it can go head-to-head with X, whether it can effectively monetize or not remains a question,” Proulx added.\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill offered a similarly positive outlook for Meta, writing in an investor note that the firm’s intra-quarter checks have continued to remain bullish on the social media giant’s growth.\n\n“Most of the experts we spoke with noted healthy ad budgets with 'strong' Meta spend growth, albeit some starting to see impact of tougher [comparisons],” Thill said.\n\nWhile Meta’s advertising revenue looks set for strong performance, that doesn’t mean that every aspect of the company’s earnings report will be positive. Wall Street is still trying to determine how much longer tech companies will need to plow money into AI before they see some kind of revenue payoff.\n\nLast week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Meta’s latest open-source large language model (LLM) called Llama 3.1. What’s more, the Facebook founder said the industry should focus on open-source AI rather than closed-source models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\n“AI remains the dominant focus for Meta as the battle of the LLMs is just getting started,” Proulx said. “Expect mentions of ‘the metaverse’ or Horizon Worlds to be little to none during the earnings call.”\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking of Meta’s Reality Labs segment, analysts are anticipating the business to generate revenue of $376 million, up from $276 million in the same period in 2023. Still, Reality Labs continues to hemorrhage cash.\n\nIn Q1, Meta reported that the segment, which is tasked with developing the hardware and software meant to power Zuckerberg’s metaverse dream, lost some $3.8 billion. The division has also been plagued by turnover and a lack of clear vision, adding to Reality Labs’ troubles, Yahoo Finance’s Yasmin Khorram reported.\n\nMeta’s announcement also comes after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced on Tuesday that he secured a $1.4 billion settlement between the state and Meta over the company’s alleged use of Texans’ biometric data without their permission for its Tag Suggestions feature.

        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL has experienced a 21.4% jump in its stock price year to date, outperforming the Zacks Internet – Services industry, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500 index’s returns of 15.8%, 18.3% and 14.6%, respectively. \r\n\r\nThis impressive performance can be largely attributed to the company's strong positioning in the cloud computing area. Alphabet division Google’s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and especially generative AI have been major positives.\r\n\r\nIn second-quarter 2024, the Google Cloud segment, which derives revenues from fees collected for Google Cloud Platform services and Google Workspace collaboration tools, generated revenues of $10.35 billion (12.2% of the total revenues), up 28.8% year over year.\r\n\r\nBeside these, Alphabet, known as the search giant, is constantly benefiting from solid search momentum, the growing popularity of Android and strength in YouTube.\n\nYear-to-Date Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGenerative AI Strength: Key Catalyst\n\nAlphabet is riding on solid momentum in Google Cloud, which is enjoying growing customer momentum due to generative AI strength.\r\n\r\nGoogle is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini.\r\n\r\nThe company offers an enterprise-focused AI code completion and assistance tool, Gemini Code Assist, which is driving its momentum among various enterprises.\r\n\r\nSolid momentum in Google’s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is another positive. Google also added Anthropic’s newly released model, called Claude 3.5 Sonnet, to Vertex AI. The launch of the latest image generation model, namely Imagen 3, in preview for Vertex AI customers with early access, is a plus.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s introduction of various open-source tools to support generative AI projects and infrastructure is a plus.\r\n\r\nThe company recently made Gemma 2, which belongs to its family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models called Gemma, available to researchers and developers across the globe in both 9 billion (9B) and 27 billion (27B) parameter sizes.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s unveiling of LearnLM, a family of generative AI models designed for conversational tutoring on various subjects, is noteworthy.\n\nStrong Customer Base Drives Growth\n\nStrengthening generative AI capabilities, along with Google Cloud’s other robust cloud solutions, expanding data center network, and an increasing number of infrastructure regions, are constantly bolstering its customer base.\r\n\r\nRecently, Workday WDAY extended its partnership with Google Cloud to accelerate the integration of generative AI technology into its platform. Workday plans to leverage Google’s Gemini models and Vertex AI in order to aid in quick AI-powered code generation, troubleshooting and information retrieval.\r\n\r\nCintas partnered with Google Cloud to develop a generative AI-powered knowledge center to accelerate its digital transformation. Cintas is leveraging Google Cloud’s Vertex AI in order to build its gen AI-backed search engines to empower employees.\r\n\r\nVictoria's Secret & Co. is in a multi-year strategic partnership with Google Cloud to enhance online shopping experiences globally and improve operational efficiency. Victoria’s Secret is utilizing Google Cloud’s AI and generative AI technologies to develop a novel conversational assistant that will provide personalized product recommendations. Powered by Vertex AI, the chatbot intends to deliver individualized advice based on unique preferences and experiences.\r\n\r\nAn expanding customer base is expected to aid the performance of Google Cloud in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nFor 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Cloud revenues is pegged at $41.93 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 26.7%.\r\n\r\nThe growing prospects of Google Cloud place Alphabet well in the highly competitive cloud market.\r\n\r\nIn the global cloud infrastructure market, Google Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider, reaching a record 10% market share in the first quarter of 2024, per Synergy Research Group. This narrows the gap with market leader Amazon’s AMZN AWS and the second-largest player Microsoft’s MSFT Azure, which accounted for 31% and 25% of the market, respectively. The \"Big Three\" control around 67% of the expanding cloud industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this data-driven world, wherein cloud has become mainstream for most businesses, Alphabet’s solid Google Cloud momentum due to compelling cloud solutions, expanding customer base and growing generative AI capabilities are expected to benefit its near and long-term prospects.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for third-quarter 2024 revenues is pegged at $72.73 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 13.6%. The same for third-quarter earnings stands at $1.83 per share, indicating a rise of 18.1% from the year-ago reported figure. The EPS estimate has been revised upward by 0.5% in the past seven days.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $296.37 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 15.5%. The same for 2024 earnings stands at $7.62 per share, which implies year-over-year growth of 31.4%. The EPS estimate has moved north by 0.3% over the past 30 days. However, it moved down by a penny in the past seven days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlthough Alphabet is known as the third-largest global cloud player, it faces stiff competition from Amazon and Microsoft, which poses significant risks. The company also keeps grappling with severe litigation issues across various regions, which do not bode well.\n\nMoreover, Alphabet is currently trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 6.63X compared with the industry’s 5.53X, reflecting a stretched valuation.

        "title": "Google’s antitrust defense could benefit from the threat of SearchGPT",
        "content": "The new risk Google faces from AI challengers could play a role in the ultimate outcome of a landmark antitrust trial where a judge must decide whether the tech giant illegally monopolized online search.\n\nThe trial, brought by the Justice Department and a group of US states, centers on the government’s argument that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) illegally blocked rivals from competing. Google claims it came to dominate search because its service was better.\n\nBut even as the company waits for a ruling from US District Court Judge Amit Mehta, fresh threats to its preeminence are emerging via new ways of searching the web.\n\nThese threats could improve Google’s odds of lessening any consequences if Judge Mehta does find it liable for breaking competition law, according to antitrust experts.\n\n\"If a violation is found, Google will say the market is already solving itself,\" George Washington University antitrust law professor William Kovacic said. Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai departs federal court last October in Washington DC, after testifying in the antitrust case against his company. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nJust last week Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI debuted a new prototype search engine called SearchGPT and positioned it as a new means of searching the web — a potential threat to Google's long-standing search dominance.\n\nMicrosoft's Bing also has generative AI features powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT, as well as its Copilot and Prometheus software.\n\nGoogle, for its part, offers generative AI capabilities in its AI Overviews — its latest search product powered by its Gemini model. The company also offers its LaMDA, T5, PaLM, and GLaM models. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. His company debuted a new prototype search engine called SearchGPT and positioned it as a new means of searching the web. (Photo by Jason Redmond / AFP) (Photo by JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) (JASON REDMOND via Getty Images)\n\nOther new ways of searching the web are offered by AI-fueled large language models (LLMs), like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, introduced in November 2022, and Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine designed using multiple LLMs that attracted major funding from Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang.\n\n'Market developments are already solving the problems'\n\nNew search options won't necessarily help Google's defense of its past behavior, but they could significantly soften a punishment if the US government and states prevail in their antitrust trial.\n\nThat's because Google would have an opening to argue during a separate phase of the trial that any anticompetitive problems identified in the complaint no longer exist, or have dwindled.\n\nThe argument Google can make to the judge is \"'you don’t have to do a lot here, because the development of new products, new technology, the emergence of competitive alternatives means that market developments are already solving the problems identified,'\" Kovacic said.\n\nStory continues\n\nBakerHostetler’s antitrust and competition practice leader, Carl Hittinger, agreed that market changes that open up more options for consumers could work in Google's favor. Amit Mehta, left, acting as an attorney before the New York State Supreme Court in 2012. He now is the judge overseeing the Google antitrust case. Photo: DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images) (DON EMMERT via Getty Images)\n\n\"If consumers move over to another product, if they have that option and they can, then there's no anticompetitive harm there,\" Hittinger said.\n\nOn the other hand, the judge may not view SearchGPT and emerging search platforms as direct Google Search competitors since, for now, those products are not pre-installed as defaults across a variety of devices.\n\nOne of the key factors for the judge to consider in crafting a remedy, Hittinger said, is what's in the public interest.\n\n'It's an awesome responsibilty'\n\nThe government has yet to say what precise remedy it desires should it prevail.\n\nRemedies can include injunctive relief, such as controls on a company's future conduct, or structural relief, like requiring divestitures.\n\nFederal rules also allow Google to ask Judge Mehta to reopen the case, prior to his decision, in order to consider new material evidence. And even if an injunction is issued, new and material evidence can be brought into court to request that it be amended.\n\nIf Google is found liable, it is expected to appeal the case. That could come with a request from Google to table the remedies phase until the case has made its way through the appellate system.\n\nKovacic predicted that the governments will prevail on at least some of their claims, and said no matter what the outcome, Judge Mehta's decision is consequential.\n\n\"You can imagine how hard of an issue this is for the court,\" Kovacic said. \"Holding the fate of the entire search sector — it's an awesome responsibility.\"\n\nThe Google antitrust trial is the most prominent since another landmark case in the 1990s that eventually forced Microsoft (MSFT) into a settlement that opened its computer operating system to competitors in the early 2000s. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates pictured in 2001, the year his company agreed on the framework for a settlement in the government's marathon antitrust case against the software giant. Photo by HENNY RAY ABRAMS/AFP via Getty Images (HENNY RAY ABRAMS via Getty Images)\n\n'The landscape changes'\n\nIt remains to be seen what the antitrust trial and new rivals in the search business will mean for Google and its parent, Alphabet.\n\nCertainly a lot is at stake. In 2023, Google's search advertising business generated more than $175 billion in revenue.\n\nCoupled with Google's YouTube ads and Google network revenue, advertising accounted for a staggering $237 billion of the company's $307 billion in total revenue.\n\nBut the new marketplace threats to Google’s search empire still have a ways to go to unseat the leader.\n\nSo far, LLMs and rival search platforms haven’t radically changed how most internet users search the web. Bing gained about 1% of the search market share since the launch of Copilot, but Google still holds more than 90% of it.\n\nHittinger, who represented AT&T in another landmark antitrust case that ended in a breakup of the telecommunications giant in the 1980s, said changes in technology tend to impact difficult antitrust cases.\n\n\"While you're deciding the case, the world moves on and the landscape changes,\" he said.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Supported by Cloud, AI Units, Microsoft Is on a Path of High Growth",
        "content": "Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is often considered a reference stock for the technology sector, being one of the two largest stocks by market cap along with Nvidia (NVDA) (they have been swapping places over the last few weeks). Despite exceeding a whopping $3 trillion market capitalization and sitting at the top of the market, the company has exciting days ahead with double-digit growth thanks to the quality of its cloud business and its ability to incorporate artificial intelligence in all major business units and customer solutions.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MSFT. List of 52-Week Lows List of 3-Year Lows List of 5-Year Lows Supported by Cloud, AI Units, Microsoft Is on a Path of High Growth\n\nDecentralized structure is main growth engine\n\nStock analysts often highlight the products of Microsoft when referring to its growth. The company's growth potential is, however, rooted in its organization and not in specific products like Azure or Copilot.\n\nMicrosoft is a very large corporation with a complex structure. If I had to compare it to an animal, it would be the octopus as the company has three primary arms that have a number of subdivisions under each, which support the overall company. The main divisions are Intelligent Cloud (including the high-growth Azure unit), Personal Computing (including Windows and Gaming, which holds the recently acquired Activision Blizzard subsidiary) and Productivity & Business Processes, which encompasses all the corporate solutions (Teams, Skype, Outlook, etc.). Supported by Cloud, AI Units, Microsoft Is on a Path of High Growth\n\nSource: Lexchart\n\nOne of the reasons I believe the company will continue to grow is there will always be a business unit (or several) that will fuel the overall growth of the company. The highly decentralized structure has been in the DNA of the company since the years of Bill Gates (Trades, Portfolio), and seemingly encouraged by current CEO Satya Nadella. Autonomy of business units leads to innovation and ultimately consistent growth of the overall company, independently of potential market cycle and trend shifts.These units power Microsoft's growth engine\n\nMicrosoft's current growth catalyst is Intelligent Cloud, in particular its cloud solution Azure. The company managed to implement AI technology into the software to create rapid and custom-built solutions for its customers. According to the earnings report released on April 25, the Intelligent Cloud has been the fastest-growing business unit with 21% year-over-year revenue growth, second only to Xbox's 62% growth, of which 61% is a net impact of the Activision acquisition.\n\nWithin the Intelligent Cloud segment, server products and cloud services (which includes Azure) grew 24%. This growth rate is well above Amazon Web Services' 17% growth, showing the software is catching up. Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS is still in first place with 31% market share, but Azure is trailing close behind with 24% market share.\n\nStory continues Supported by Cloud, AI Units, Microsoft Is on a Path of High Growth\n\nSource: Mordor Intelligence\n\nThe company is likely to continue outperforming its competitors, particularly AWS, given it is a few steps ahead in terms of AI relative to Amazon. Being the main investor in OpenAI (Microsoft invested around $13 billion) helped and will continue to help it stay ahead of competition in terms of AI, with perhaps the only serious threat being Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Despite the competition, the space is large enough for all these companies to continue on a path of growth. Indeed, the cloud computing market is expected to grow at a 16.40% compounded annual rate in the next five years. Therefore, given Azure's AI capabilities and backing by other business units of Microsoft, it is not unreasonable to assume continued growth above 20%.\n\nFinancials\n\nMicrosoft's financials are solid and enviable. Its balance sheet is pristine. Despite the $68.70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard to boost its stagnant Gaming & Personal Computing segment, the company still has $80 billion in cash on hand, which is sufficient for another large acquisition. Its total debt amounts to $106 billion and with $70 billion of expected free cash flow it would generate in 2024, the company could easily repay all of its debt in a hypothetical scenario. Supported by Cloud, AI Units, Microsoft Is on a Path of High Growth\n\nFurther, free cash flow continues to trend higher year after year. Free cash flow is an indicator that is appreciated by investors as it shows the ability of a company to efficiently manage its business. Rising free cash flow is also an excellent indicator for the coming years; the cash generated by the company can support acquisitions and investments into the business that will in turn trigger new growth catalysts (i.e., investment in OpenAI, acquisition of Activision).\n\nFree cash flow is also a reassurance for shareholders as an uptrend also increases the likelihood of cash returned to investors in the form of share buybacks. Microsoft already returned $8.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends in the last quarter, according to its latest earnings report. The dividend yield is rather low (0.67%) - in part due to fast-paced stock price growth - but the dividend payments have been rising consecutively for 19 years. Supported by Cloud, AI Units, Microsoft Is on a Path of High Growth\n\nRevenue has been growing at an average rate of 14% over the last five years. Its return on capital averaged 30% per year and its earnings margin averaged 40% in the same period, which altogether further confirm the business is efficiently managed and the cash it generates continues to support and fuel its growth.\n\nValuation\n\nAt first glance, the stock may appear slightly overvalued. It is trading at 23 times last 12 months earnings and 27 times forward earnings, which puts it on the higher range of its historical valuation. However, it is important to note Microsoft's valuation has been on the rise since the Global Financial Crisis, with earnings multiples expanding. This is typical of companies that show sustained high growth, and it is likely that the multiples will continue expanding in the coming years. Supported by Cloud, AI Units, Microsoft Is on a Path of High Growth\n\nFrom a pure multiple perspective, the stock may indeed not be undervalued, as shown by the GF Value chart above.\n\nBut when computing the valuation via a discounted cash flow model, we can see the stock may actually be undervalued by approximately 20% to 25%. For the calculation, I used the actual total earnings per share in the last 12 months and a (very) conservative 7.50% growth rate for earnings per share. This gave me a stock value of $496 per share. Interestingly, this is in line with Citi analyst Tyler Radke's initial price target ($495) before he hiked it to $520, citing recent media reports in relation to OpenAI's doubled annualized revenue and Microsoft's cloud deal with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).\n\nMain risk factor to my case\n\nIn the technology sector, the main threat is always obsolescence, which is rooted in lack of innovation and results in the competition overtaking it. Especially for large and successful companies, staying at the top for decades is particularly hard. This requires consistency in the management team. There is one large exception here, however: the company's octopus-like structure and continued investments in distinct business units. These numerous tentacles of innovation and growth allow Microsoft to remain one of the top-performing companies and to minimize any adverse impacts when one or even multiple business units are struggling.\n\nBottom line\n\nDespite having reached an impressive market cap, Microsoft still has wonderful years ahead of double-digit growth. Artificial intelligence is yet another tailwind that is already boosting its cloud business and putting the company as one of the likely AI leaders.\n\nIts direct exposure to OpenAI additionally increases the likelihood of Microsoft staying ahead of the competition in the sphere of generative AI. Its structure ensures innovation and finds new growth catalysts in a rapidly changing technological landscape. The stock is attractively valued and represents a buying opportunity for long-term tech-focused or diversified investment portfolios.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The UK’s competition regulator has confirmed it is investigating Google’s parent company and its partnership with fellow AI firm Anthropic over concerns it could impact competition in the AI market.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has published an invitation to comment from “any interested party” on the partnership.\n\nAlphabet is reported to have invested more than two billion dollars in Anthropic over several funding rounds for the US start-up – an approach that has become common in the tech sector, with many of the biggest names investing heavily in AI start-ups. Alphabet has invested heavily in Anthropic (Alamy/PA)\n\nBut this approach has caught the attention of regulators in recent months, with the CMA publishing a report earlier this year which warned of potential risks to fair and open competition in the AI space.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt specifically highlighted what it called an “interconnected web” of more than 90 partnerships and strategic investments from the biggest names in tech – including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft – and emerging AI firms, a set-up it warned could be used to consolidate power and resources within the sector among a few companies.\n\nAmazon, as well as Alphabet, has invested heavily in Anthropic, while Microsoft is the largest investor in ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI has also formed a partnership with Apple to embed ChatGPT into future generations of the iPhone as part of Apple’s plans to bring more generative AI tools to its products.\n\nRegulators have argued that these large investments and partnerships could see the biggest tech firms able to gain some control over the direction of emerging AI firms, without attracting the regulatory scrutiny that a full acquisition might.\n\nIn its announcement, the CMA said: “The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering whether it is or may be the case that this partnership has resulted in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that relevant merger situation has resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.”\n\nAlphabet has been contacted for comment.\n\nEarlier this month, the CMA also confirmed that it was investigating Microsoft’s hiring of staff from Inflection AI, after it named the firm’s former boss as the leader of its new Microsoft AI unit, with several other members of staff following him to Microsoft.",

The details of HCA’s nurse-handoff pilot testing, as well as tests of an AI-powered documentation app for emergency room physicians in use at HCA hospitals, are being reported on in-depth for the first time by Bloomberg.\n\nAI is a once-in-a-generation technological breakthrough, like the automobile or the internet, that has the power to transform everything. For the past two years, Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc., has been working furiously to bring generative AI to the public with a chatbot and more conversational search results. But the technology could also help the company finally conquer what has become one of its most elusive goals: making inroads in health care. And breaking through in the $4 trillion US health-care industry just might give Alphabet a leg up against other tech competitors in the AI race.\n\nAfter years of strategy shifts, billions of dollars in investments and a long list of health-care moonshots that have failed to take off — like glucose-sensing contact lenses, cancer-detecting pills and Google Glass for surgery — Alphabet needs a win. The nurse handoff note is one of the many areas of health care that providers want artificial intelligence to improve, cutting down on tedious, clerical parts of the job to leave them more time with patients. But Google’s ambitions are even grander. The company sees promise in AI that, one day, might be trained on all of humanity’s medical knowledge and could deliver personalized health insights to patients.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI has the “potential to transform health on a planetary scale,” Karen DeSalvo, Google’s chief health officer, said at an annual company event in March.\n\nBut right now, the technology simply isn’t good enough.\n\nThere are still questions about whether Google’s AI can consistently deliver high-quality health information, according to more than 30 physicians, nurses, health-care executives, industry analysts and experts that Bloomberg interviewed for this story. And patients and health-care workers are skeptical about artificial intelligence in general. Over the past few months, nurses and other caregivers have protested the use of AI in hospitals, citing concerns about the technology’s potential to harm patients and replace human jobs. Some 60% of Americans would be uncomfortable with medical providers relying on AI to deliver health care, according to a survey conducted last year by the Pew Research Center.\n\nThen there’s the wide chasm between Alphabet’s utopian vision of using AI to democratize health care and the tools it’s piloting, which for the moment are largely focused on streamlining industry inefficiencies. The nurse handoff technology that Loomis tested, which was developed by HCA using Google’s AI, is currently being used with real patients at four HCA Healthcare hospitals in Tennessee and Florida. Google has also partnered with medical-transcription company Augmedix on a tool for automatically documenting ER visits. Other projects include an experiment with Deloitte to use chatbots to help health systems answer people’s questions about accessing care and a family of large language models, akin to ChatGPT, called MedLM that doctors could deploy in a number of ways.\n\n“We are incredibly intentional about our pacing when it comes to developing AI models for health care,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement in response to questions from Bloomberg News. “We publish research, conduct studies with health-care organizations, pilot new models or tools, gain feedback and iterate. There is a big opportunity but we need to do it safely to get it right.”\n\nGoogle isn’t the only tech giant that has stumbled on its way to disrupting the stodgy and splintered US health-care industry. Apple Inc. ditched or delayed countless initiatives, including a glucose monitor and health clinics. Amazon.com Inc. shuttered a telehealth service and a project that aimed to lower employer health insurance costs. Microsoft Corp. shut down a 12-year effort to improve medical records management. Oracle Corp.’s $28 billion acquisition of Cerner Corp., which the company said would transform health-care technology, led instead to lost customers and slipping sales. The companies have all poured billions of dollars into giving health care a Silicon Valley makeover; so far none of them have produced much in the way of results.\n\n“If Google’s overall ambition is to completely disrupt the health-care industry, well, nobody in the big tech world has succeeded,” said Rajiv Leventhal, a senior analyst with Emarketer researching digital health. “Health care is a unique beast.”\n\nAn AI revolution\n\nGoogle’s dream of a tech-enabled health revolution began almost two decades ago. In 2008, after a year and a half of development, the company launched a free personal health record platform, dubbed Google Health, that attracted high-profile partners including Walgreens, the American Heart Association and the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nFor Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, health care is deeply personal. Several years ago, Page fell ill and his vocal cords were paralyzed, weakening his voice. Brin’s mother has battled Parkinson’s disease for 25 years, and Brin carries a genetic mutation that puts him at higher risk of eventually developing the debilitating brain disorder himself.\n\nStandardizing health records and bringing them online, they believed, would help people better manage their health and allow the industry to treat sick people more efficiently. But the company shuttered the records platform just four years after it launched. It would be the first of many health projects to enter the Google graveyard.\n\nNow, AI has created a fresh opportunity for Alphabet in health. In late 2022, after the tech giant declared a “code red” over the popularity of a new AI program called ChatGPT, a small team within Google’s AI division sprinted over the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday stretch to publish research on its new health-focused AI model, called Med-PaLM — the first AI system to achieve a passing score when answering US medical exam-style questions. Google said the AI had the potential to transform health care by allowing doctors to retrieve medical knowledge quickly to support their clinical decisions. More advanced versions of the model, called MedLM, are now available to the tech giant’s health-care cloud clients, including some hospitals and medical centers.\n\n“The pace at which things are moving is really a revolution,” said Yossi Matias, head of Google Research in an interview with Bloomberg this March.\n\nGenerative AI is developed by ingesting and learning from vast amounts of data, which enables it to, for example, automate tasks like summarizing a health record or interpreting an X-ray. Google thinks that someday, its health-focused AI could create personalized care plans, responding to people’s health as they age or even anticipating disease. Theoretically, an AI system that can perfectly recall the details of any published medical research would fare better than a doctor who can’t possibly remember everything. This AI could also be infinitely scaled and deployed anywhere, including places with few doctors or nurses.\n\n“This technology has the ability to be a care multiplier,” said Greg Corrado, cofounder of an internal research lab, Google Brain, in an interview. For the last seven years he has focused on applications of artificial intelligence to health. A Google spokesperson later added that the generative AI technologies that Google is testing in hospitals are not meant to substitute for human care, and said its tools are being built to keep humans as part of the process.\n\nBut Alphabet has a long way to go before its AI is diagnosing patients. It has struggled to develop a unified health strategy, with fractured efforts dispersed across different divisions. Verily, a sister company of Google, works on life sciences initiatives, including a recent push into testing wastewater for viruses. Another Alphabet arm, Calico, focuses on aging and age-related diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer.\n\nWithin Google itself, the health efforts are wide-ranging. In 2021 it acquired fitness tracking company Fitbit for $2.1 billion, a bid to challenge Apple and others in the wearable health-tech space. Another group works on clinical tools, like software that can interpret retinal scans to hunt for signs of blindness. Its medical research includes work on sequencing and interpreting genomes using AI. Through the cloud, Google offers enterprise health-care companies a platform to develop their own AI apps, like chatbots and other software that can help search through health records, using the company’s flagship AI model, Gemini.\n\nThe company said there are also several efforts across Google that already utilize AI to democratize access to health care, such as AI-powered screenings for lung and breast cancer; work on expanding access to information on health conditions via products like Google search and its visual search app Lens; and scientific research through efforts like AlphaFold, a landmark AI tool for predicting protein structures.\n\nBut the company’s generally scattered approach has hindered Alphabet’s ability to make meaningful progress. “Google has put their hats in many different areas, but they’ve struggled to figure out how they can best help the industry,” said Leventhal, the Emarketer analyst.\n\nGoogle said its work in health care is meant to support different parts of the overall health ecosystem and that individual groups within Alphabet pursue their own set of objectives and strategies in health. “Our North Star is to help people everywhere live longer, healthier lives, to contribute meaningfully to scientific research and to improve health-care delivery for all,” a company spokesperson said.\n\nIn recent years, in order to test its technology and explore market opportunities for it, Google has turned to partnership deals like the one with Nashville-based HCA Healthcare, the largest health system in the country by bed size, with 182 hospitals across the US. At Google’s health event in March, leaders from both companies stood side by side to present insights from HCA’s early tests of Google’s AI-powered nurse-handoff note. According to a company spokesperson, across all HCA Healthcare hospitals, more than 60,000 handoffs occur each day. In a recent internal survey, 89% of nurses who are testing the tech found it was “somewhat” or “very” helpful, HCA added.\n\n“Some of these dreams that we’ve placed in health-care technologies and what they could do for us, I’m seeing them come true today,” said Canaan Stage, a leader of clinical operations at HCA Healthcare, during the presentation. “I’m giddy. That’s maybe the best word I can say.”\n\nAnother tool powered by Google’s AI that is available across four HCA Healthcare emergency room facilities is an app designed by Augmedix that can automatically transcribe patient visits and turn them into digestible reports. This could save doctors a lot of time; according to a recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, they spend over eight hours a week writing up their notes.\n\n“A lot of the energy now is around generative AI trying to help doctors and nurses and care systems deal with documentation, information management, a lot of this work that many people in health care view as an overwhelming wall of drudgery,” said Corrado, the Google AI research director.\n\nBut even for this seemingly lower-risk use case for generative AI, the technology can’t be deployed without backup. Michael Schlosser, HCA Healthcare’s senior vice president of care transformation and innovation, said having humans in the loop is a must because there’s still a possibility that AI tools will miss relevant information, or even generate made-up symptoms or past patient history — what’s known in AI lingo as a hallucination. “If the AI missed something, and then the next caregiver was unaware of that, that kind of thing can become dangerous,” said Schlosser.\n\nWhen HCA doctors use the technology, he said, each physician is responsible for checking the AI-generated notes carefully, before inputting the data into a patient’s electronic health record. A representative of HCA added that doctors and nurses checking the output of the AI technology results in feedback that is then used to further train the AI. “We see improvements in the technology week over week using this technique,” the representative, Harlow Sumerford, said in an email. HCA also said having humans in the loop is critical and doctors would always be responsible for approving and confirming the accuracy of the information generated by AI, regardless of how advanced the tech becomes.\n\nSarah West, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute, a policy research center, said Google has marketed AI tools for use in health-care settings even as the industry still lacks sufficient standards for validating the systems to make sure they don’t make critical mistakes. “Google is under a lot of pressure right now to find its place in this ecosystem,” West said in an interview. “The pressure to turn a profit is very high.”\n\nAnother important question is whether the notoriously sclerotic health industry is willing to embrace AI on a wide scale. Decades after the internet became widely accessible, some 12% of US physicians still haven’t made the transition to electronic health records. Many hospitals and doctors’ offices still rely on the fax, which can communicate with other offices no matter what record-keeping software they use. And it’s harder to hack.\n\n‘Two different languages’\n\nGoogle’s first health bet, the online health record, failed because the company hadn’t really made connections with the industry it was trying to change — the doctors, nurses and hospitals actually delivering care to patients. Patients had to track down often incomplete records from different doctors and continually update them online, which made the service too much of a hassle. Microsoft and others failed at similar attempts.\n\nAfter that first flop, Page and Brin were only more motivated. In 2013, they recruited Andy Conrad, a geneticist and former top scientist at Lab Corp., to join Google’s secretive life-sciences unit, which would eventually become Verily. Google let researchers and engineers pursue audacious goals like glucose-monitoring contact lenses for diabetics, a cancer-detecting pill and an enormous personal health study called Project Baseline, which aimed to collect longitudinal health data from around 10,000 participants and pursue new research on how to decrease rates of diabetes and heart disease.\n\nThe projects grabbed headlines. But they also suffered from a clash of cultures behind the scenes, according to Obi Felten, a former Google executive who worked on the company’s early health efforts and left in 2021. The technologists wanted to move fast and see results; the doctors and scientists wanted to move slowly and methodically. “I literally felt sometimes like it was two different languages,” said Felten.\n\nAcross the company, Google’s health projects were a hodgepodge of efforts, some of which sprung up because an executive was passionate about the area, rather than because they fit an overarching strategy, according to two former employees. By 2018, Google Health had hundreds of employees and Verily over a thousand, but their portfolios were a haphazard collection of moonshots, many of which failed to get off the ground.\n\nGoogle needed a more disciplined strategy. In 2018, it tapped a new executive, the former head of the health network Geisinger, David Feinberg, to come up with one. But months after Feinberg arrived, he faced a controversial news cycle. Google had been working on a search tool for the US Catholic health-care network Ascension. The Wall Street Journal detailed how some Google employees had gotten access to sensitive health data, prompting a federal inquiry that the company had to answer for. Google noted that the probe didn’t go anywhere, and said it had followed federal privacy rules throughout the project. Eventually the company still wound down the effort, though it kept the technology, integrating it into some tools it sells to health enterprise companies on its cloud platform.\n\nWhen Covid swept through the world, it looked like Alphabet finally had an opportunity to make a large-scale impact in health care. In March 2020, then-President Donald Trump surprised Americans — and Google — by promising nationwide testing from the tech company. Verily launched a testing project shortly thereafter, and California eventually spent $62.5 million contracting with the Alphabet unit to run testing sites in 28 counties. But seven months later, two of the state’s most populous counties cut ties with Verily, citing privacy concerns. Within a year, California ended the contract completely. Verily’s tests ended up accounting for less than 1% of all Covid tests in 2020.\n\nA Google spokesperson said the company’s Covid efforts extended beyond its virus-testing contract with California. Verily partnered with RiteAid, the US Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and others, the spokesperson said, and provided software that enabled over 6 million people across 16 states to get tested. As testing shifted from laboratory-based PCR testing to at-home rapid testing, Verily switched focus to using wastewater to estimate population-level pathogen incidence, the spokesperson added.\n\nNot long after, Google changed strategy again. The company had built up its health division during the pandemic, and now it decided to disband it. Employees working on health products were redistributed to other units at the company. As part of the reorganization, Feinberg also left Google.\n\nThough key divisions at Google have employees working on health tools within their own units, the only dedicated health team at the company is now led by DeSalvo, a physician who was appointed chief health officer in 2019. She spearheads a small team of clinicians that leads health strategy for Google and counsels other parts of Google on health-related issues.\n\nIn an interview, DeSalvo said that because people naturally ask Google questions about their health, it’s the company’s responsibility to meet them with high-quality information. Every time someone searches Google to identify their weird skin rash or figure out whether they just have the flu or some sort of rare and terrible cancer, they are involving Google in their health.“The reality is, even if we didn’t want to think about health, we’re getting asked about it all the time,” DeSalvo said.\n\nMissing details\n\nOne morning in February at the University of Central Florida’s Lake Nona hospital, which is part of HCA Healthcare, emergency room physician Alex Stinard walked into the room of a 56-year-old patient who complained of lower back and leg pain. Stinard fired up the Google AI-powered medical transcription app, Augmedix Go, then placed his smartphone at the edge of the bed and hit record. He talked with the patient for seven minutes, asking her where it hurt, and placing his hands on different parts of her body.\n\nAfter the consultation, he thumbed through the Augmedix Go summary of the visit on his phone. It generated text more quickly than Stinard’s usual note-taking process, and was more organized, too.\n\nBut like Loomis, Stinard noted that the AI had missed some things. It didn’t pick up on the fact that she had no tenderness to her middle back and neck, and that she had reported normal leg strength, vital details for an accurate diagnosis.\n\nA new challenge for Google in the era of generative AI is applying the technology in the service of delivering more high-quality information to people. The results so far have been mixed. In May, Google announced AI Overviews for search written by generative AI, the same underlying technology it uses for its health-care apps. The launch didn’t go well. Some AI Overviews offered embarrassing suggestions, advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza, for example. In response, Google implemented new guardrails, in part to prevent the feature from inadvertently presenting satirical content as fact.\n\nGoogle’s generative AI tools in health are trained to be far more focused on delivering medically accurate answers. According to a Google spokesperson, “on health queries, we always had strong guardrails in place for the quality of content we display and since launch, we’ve added additional triggering refinements to enhance our quality protections.” But the episode shows how easily AI — without the help of human judgment — can veer down the wrong path. That’s why many checks and balances are still in place for Alphabet’s AI health tech. For instance, with Augmedix Go, practitioners like Stinard must double-check the AI’s work.\n\n“Overall, I think Google has struggled to gain trust amongst consumers and also physicians, that they should have access to health data and that they will put the appropriate safeguards in place,” said Leventhal, the health-care analyst.\n\n“We understand that health is human,” Google said in a statement. “AI is not a replacement for doctors and nurses, for human judgment, the ability to understand context, the emotional connection established at the bedside or understanding the challenges patients face in their zip codes.”\n\nBut for Alphabet to truly transform health care — for its AI to do more than play secretary to practitioners — the company will have to gain more trust.\n\nRob Bart, chief medical information officer at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said the conversation on generative AI’s role in medicine falls into two buckets. “There’s clinical operational efficiency and effectiveness. That’s the place most organizations are currently comfortable,” Bart said. “Then there’s clinical diagnostic medical decision-making. We’re not so comfortable with that yet.”\n\n--With assistance from Julia Love and Ilena Peng.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n‘Dancing With Death’: What It’s Like to Dismantle a Ship The Miseducation of America’s Nurse Practitioners Scammers Target Middle East Influencers With Meta’s Own Tools How Sonny Angels and Smiskis Took Over TikTok Joe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy’s New Kingmaker\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned -7.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has lost 6.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.4%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.62 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GOOGL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $72.73 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $296.37 billion and $330.33 billion estimates indicate +15.5% and +11.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "My Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Just Proved Again Why It's the Best Buy of the Group",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" has been a dominant group in the market over the past few years. It's made up of:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nMy top Magnificent Seven stock to buy just reported its latest results, and they were outstanding. However, the market didn't reward the stock, and it's down alongside the rest of the group. Is this a buying opportunity for one of the best stocks on Wall Street? I think so.\n\nAlphabet's business is rising steadily\n\nMy favorite stock in the Magnificent Seven right now is Alphabet. Over the past year, Alphabet has posted some excellent results and is starting to perfect its artificial intelligence (AI) product offering.Additionally, its advertising segment (which accounts for around three-fourths of all revenue) is doing well for how mature the business segment is. In the second quarter, sales rose 11% year over year to $64.6 billion. W\n\nWhile some investors may be concerned that this growth isn't nearly as quick as it needs to be for Alphabet to stand out, I don't view it that way. Alphabet's ad segment is a reliable business that creates massive cash flows for the company, allowing it to invest in next-generation technology like AI. It also funds the growth of another vital segment: Google Cloud.\n\nGoogle Cloud is the smallest of the big three cloud computing players. This size disadvantage can be traced back to Google's late entry into this market, but it's still growing quickly. In Q2, revenue grew 29% year over year to $10.3 billion. It also posted an operating margin of 11%, which is still far behind what industry leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) delivered in the first quarter with a 38% margin. Once Google Cloud reaches scale and improves its operating margin to similar levels, this segment will provide a meaningful profit boost, although that is still some years away.\n\nAltogether, Alphabet's quarter was solid, with revenue growing 14% year over year and earnings per share (EPS) rising from $1.44 to $1.89. It was hard to find a fault in the quarter, but it was also difficult to find a \"wow\" moment.\n\nThe stock fell 5% the day after trading, dragging the rest of the market down with it. But I think this pullback is a mistake and provides investors with an opportunity to get into the stock, now that it's down around 10% from its highs.\n\nUnlike its peers, the stock doesn't have an expensive premium\n\nFor the most part, the Magnificent Seven stocks are incredibly pricey when compared to the broader market. However, Alphabet doesn't have the same premium, so investors don't have as much risk on the table by investing in Alphabet. After the pullback, Alphabet's stock trades for 23 times forward earnings.\n\nStory continues GOOG PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile that only retraces its valuation to a few months ago, it prices it in the vicinity of the broader S&P 500 index, which trades at 22.7 times forward earnings. When you buy Alphabet stock at these levels, you're essentially buying an above-average company for a market-average price. That's a great deal, and investors should take advantage of it.\n\nThrough Alphabet's consistent revenue growth, expanding dividend, and aggressive share repurchase programs (Alphabet repurchased over $15 billion in stock during Q2), it's a shoo-in for a company that can grow earnings faster than 10% annualized. That's a fantastic investment proposition, and it's one that investors need to understand.\n\nYou don't have to hit a home run every time you invest. Sometimes, the steady growers that can outperform the market by a couple of percentage points each year are the best investments, and I think Alphabet falls into this category.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "When You Look Back in 5 Years, You'll Wish You'd Bought This $2 Trillion Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock",
        "content": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the technology conglomerate behind Google, YouTube, autonomous driving company Waymo, and artificial intelligence (AI) developer DeepMind (to name just a few of its subsidiaries).\n\nGoogle remains the dominant internet search engine globally, and it used that success to build other businesses like Google Cloud and Google Workspace (which includes Gmail and Google Docs). But as the window to the internet for over 20 years, Google Search is also a repository of some of the most valuable data in cyberspace, which gives Alphabet an incredible edge in the AI race.\n\nAlphabet is already generating billions of dollars in revenue from AI specifically, and the best is probably yet to come. Its stock is very cheap based on one widely used valuation metric, and when investors look back on this moment in five years, they might wish they had bought it today. Image source: Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet is weaving AI throughout its entire business\n\nGoogle has a 91% global market share in the internet search industry, but it came under threat last year following the rapid adoption of OpenAI's ChatGPT. AI-powered chatbots can provide direct answers to almost any question, creating a more convenient experience compared to Google Search, which requires the user to sift through webpages to find the information they need.\n\nIt prompted Alphabet to launch its own family of AI models called Gemini, which power a new Google Search feature called AI Overviews. Overviews speed up the search experience by delivering text-based responses at the top of Google's traditional web results. They include reference links so the user can view the source of the information, and Alphabet says they are receiving more clicks than the links that appear in traditional search results. That could have positive implications for advertising revenue when AI Overviews roll out more broadly.\n\nGemini is also available in Google Workspace for an additional monthly subscription fee. It integrates into productivity applications like Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Gmail, allowing users to rapidly create content and speed up their workflows. One Workspace customer, Click Therapeutics, is using Gemini to analyze patient feedback to build digital treatment plans, and the use cases will likely expand further over time.\n\nGoogle Cloud is another critical component of Alphabet's AI strategy. Like most top cloud providers, Google Cloud offers AI data center infrastructure fitted with chips from leading suppliers like Nvidia. However, Alphabet also designed its own chips in-house, and its new Trillium tensor processing unit (TPU) delivers 5 times more compute performance than the previous version.\n\nStory continues\n\nDevelopers use that computing power to perform AI training and inferencing to deliver the most advanced AI models, so faster chips can translate into cost savings and higher-quality outcomes. Google Cloud also offers a library of ready-made large language models (LLMs), including Gemini, which developers can use to accelerate the creation of their applications.\n\nGoogle Cloud just crossed a noteworthy milestone\n\nAlphabet generated a record $84.7 billion in revenue during the second quarter of 2024 (ended June 30), a 14% increase from the year-ago period. Google Search remained the dominant part of the conglomerate, accounting for more than half of that revenue.\n\nGoogle Cloud was the standout performer, though, because its sales grew by 29% to $10.3 billion. It was the first time the segment crossed the $10 billion mark, and AI played a key role in achieving that milestone. Alphabet said its AI infrastructure and solutions have already generated billions of dollars in revenue to date, with over 2 million developers currently using them.\n\nBoth of those numbers are likely to rise in the future as more businesses integrate the technology into their day-to-day operations.\n\nAlphabet continues to carefully manage its costs to drive profitability. Its total operating expenses ticked up 8.6% during Q2, and since that was much slower than the pace of its revenue growth, more money flowed to the bottom line. As a result, the company's earnings per share soared 31% year over year to $1.89.\n\nCapital expenditures are one thing investors are watching closely, because building AI infrastructure is incredibly expensive. Alphabet spent $13 billion on capital expenditures during Q2, and it expects to spend at least $12 billion per quarter for the rest of 2024. The company warned this could temporarily pressure its profit margins, but the long-term payoff from having more AI capacity could outweigh any short-term negatives.\n\nAlphabet stock is cheap\n\nAlphabet generated $6.97 in earnings per share over the last four quarters, and based on its stock price of $167.28 as of this writing, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24. That is a 24.7% discount to the Nasdaq-100 index, which has a P/E ratio of 31.9, implying Alphabet is heavily undervalued compared to its big-tech peers.\n\nAlphabet's P/E ratio is also the cheapest among every other company with a valuation of at least $2 trillion: NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nNvidia, Microsoft, and Apple trade at an average P/E ratio of 45.2. That number is heavily skewed by Nvidia, so I'm not suggesting Alphabet stock will climb that high. However, it might be appropriate for the stock to rise 45% to trade in line with the average P/E ratio of Microsoft and Apple, which is 35.\n\nAfter all, Alphabet's earnings growth of 31% during Q2 was substantially faster than what both Microsoft (8.9%) and Apple (13.5%) are forecast to deliver in their upcoming quarters. Plus, Alphabet might have an edge over both companies in the AI space, because they rely heavily on third-party developers like OpenAI for their AI software.\n\nSimply put, besides the fact Alphabet is generating strong growth already with promising long-term potential thanks to AI, there is a clear case its stock should be trading much higher based on the valuations of some of its peers in the tech industry.\n\nTherefore, when investors look back on this moment a few years from now, they might be glad they scooped up Alphabet shares at the current price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By Yuvraj Malik\n\n(Reuters) - Meta Platforms is expected to report a 20% rise in quarterly revenue, helped by strong ad sales driven by the Olympics and elections in several countries, but investors will want to see if its spending on AI is starting to yield returns.\n\nThe social media giant, like its tech rivals Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft, is spending billions on tech infrastructure to support AI development. In April, Meta's upward revision in full-year expenses shaved off nearly $170 billion from its market capitalization in a single day.\n\nAlphabet's warning last week that capital expenses would stay high this year, overshadowed a jump in ad sales and pushed its stock down.\n\nMeta is betting on an open-source approach for its generative AI push. The company released its mostly free Llama 3.1 artificial intelligence model last week, and said developers can use and modify its AI models free of charge.\n\nIt has burnished its ad-buying products with AI tools and introduced new AI features such as a chat assistant to drive engagement on its social media properties. On Monday, it said it would roll out a new tool called AI Studio that would allow users to create, share and design personalized AI chatbots.\n\n\"We are bullish on Meta's position as a key pillar of open-source AI,\" Jefferies analysts said, adding that the company could potentially unlock new revenue streams by licensing its AI models or creating AI apps.\n\nMeta shares have risen 32% this year, compared with a near 16% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nThe company will also need to show its bread and butter ad business is thriving when it reports second-quarter results on Wednesday.\n\nGroupM, one of the world's largest media buying firms, raised its 2024 global advertising growth forecast to 7.8% in June, from 5.3% in December, which augurs well for Meta.\n\nSmaller ad-dependent companies Pinterest and Snap are scheduled to report results on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\n\"We remain positive on Meta and think Reels, Messaging and AI-driven ad improvements are still early, and could lead to positive product surprises and revenue upside,\" analysts at BofA Securities said.\n\n\"With political spend, and potential TikTok ban in 1Q'25, Meta could also see an ad spend benefit in 2H'24.\"\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Shounak Dasgupta)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Obama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year Returns. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other stocks in former U.S. president Barack Obama's portfolio.\n\nFormer United States President Barack Obama took office during one of the worst recessions in U.S. history, yet the stock market reached new highs during his tenure. Stepping into office in 2009, the year after stocks plummeted nearly 40% amid the financial crisis of 2007-2008, Obama made a remarkably well-timed market prediction. On March 3, 2009, just days before the S&P 500 hit an intraday low of 666 and a closing low of 676.53, the then-president stated, \"What you're now seeing is profit-and-earnings ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you've got a long-term perspective on it.\" By the time he left office on January 20, 2017, the S&P 500 had soared to 2,263.69, reflecting a gain of about 225% since his predictive remark.\n\nThe \"Obama Years\" coincided with rapid technological advancements that significantly impacted the stock market. Apple Inc.'s iPhone, introduced less than two years before he took office, exemplified this era of innovation. In addition, during Obama's presidency, billionaire Reed Hastings transformed Netflix Inc. from a DVD rental-by-mail company into a video-streaming giant, revolutionizing entertainment consumption. On the other hand, renewable energy, particularly solar energy, struggled during the president's tenure. Despite the administration's solar subsidies, investors were largely disappointed as those subsidies eventually faded. First Solar Inc., one of the largest U.S. solar equipment producers, saw its stock plummet by as much as 74% due to falling solar panel prices, making it the worst-performing S&P 500 stock of the Obama era.\n\nHow Did the Obamas Make Their Money?\n\nFrom speaking at events worldwide to writing memoirs and signing a major production deal with Netflix, the Obamas have led a busy and highly lucrative life post-White House. Michelle Obama's first memoir, \"Becoming,\" published in November 2018, became that year's No. 1 best-selling book. Her second book, \"The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times,\" also achieved bestseller status. Similarly, Barack Obama's latest memoir, \"A Promised Land,\" sold nearly 890,000 copies within 24 hours of its November 2020 release. These ventures, along with the six-figure pension that all former presidents receive, have significantly boosted the Obamas' net worth, which is at least $70 million according to the International Business Times. The New York Post, however, estimates their fortune to be much higher, at $135 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, Barack Obama’s income isn’t limited to speaking fees and pensions. Like many other wealthy individuals, he has invested significantly in the stock market. So what does his portfolio look like? When he took office in 2009, Obama, like all presidents, was required to make financial disclosures by law. At that time, Obama held $200,000-$450,000 in the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares that tracks the S&P 500 index, according to a report by CBS News.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThese investments were selected from the top holdings of the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares, one of Barack Obama's primary investments during his presidency, according to official disclosures. We have provided each stock's trailing 10-year returns to assess their performance over the decade. Data from approximately 919 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024 was also analyzed to determine the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each firm.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple, our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy picks 14 small and large-caps every quarter and it has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNote: The stocks are sorted in ascending order of their trailing 10-year returns.\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nTrailing 10-Year Returns: 21.05%\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), a prominent player in the technology sector, is best known for its flagship product, Google, a search engine handling billions of daily queries. The company’s portfolio extends to diverse platforms for video streaming and productivity, with YouTube being a standout asset. The internet giant is also engaged in retailing electronic devices such as smartphones, ultra-thin notebooks, and speakers.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) recently showed its commitment to artificial intelligence (AI) by unveiling new AI features and products at its Google I/O developer conference on May 14. The biggest announcement from the conference is that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is set to fully incorporate AI overlays into its Google search results. Currently being rolled out, these new overlays are expected to reach 1 billion people by the end of the year.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s CEO Sundar Pichai announced back in April that YouTube and Google's cloud business are projected to achieve a combined annual run rate exceeding $100 billion by the end of 2024, underscoring major revenue streams for the tech giant. YouTube reported $8.1 billion in ad sales for the first quarter ending March 31, its highest Q1 revenue to date, reflecting a 21% year-over-year increase from $6.7 billion in Q1 202\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Texas-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), holding 46.3 million shares worth more than $6.99 billion.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 8th on our list of former U.S. president Barack Obama's portfolio stocks. You can visit Obama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year Returnsto see the other stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has gotten so much hype for the past two years that it's fair to question whether it's gone too far. Perhaps the market has reached this point; large technology companies and high-flying AI stocks have started selling off over the past few weeks.\n\nTech giant Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) stock price has dropped 13% from its recent high, and now ChatGPT developer OpenAI is challenging Alphabet's ultra-important Google Search business.\n\nAlphabet recently announced second-quarter earnings results, allowing investors to take the company's pulse and sniff out potential concerns.

Search revenue (not including YouTube) was $48.5 billion in Q2, up almost 14% from last year.\n\nSearch has become a somewhat unsung hero because it's been around since the start, and newer businesses like cloud get a lot of attention. Remarkably, Google Search could still have a lot of growth ahead. Over a third of the global population still lacks internet access, and Google's global dominance (over 90% worldwide market share) essentially guarantees growth as more people connect to the web.\n\nDon't get me wrong; Alphabet's other businesses are all doing great; YouTube ad revenue was up 13%. Google Cloud grew revenue by nearly 30%, and its operating profits almost tripled as it became increasingly profitable.\n\nDespite massive spending on AI hardware and software development, the company has maintained an enormous cash hoard of $100 billion (against just $13 billion in debt). Management even acknowledged its high spending on the earnings call, cautioning it would rather overspend than get caught flat-footed by competition.\n\nWhy investors shouldn't fear OpenAI's search ambitions\n\nAlphabet stock dropped after AI developer OpenAI announced it was testing an AI-powered search engine called SearchGPT. OpenAI's flagship product, ChatGPT, is a large language model that burst onto the scene as the fastest-growing app in history and lit the powder keg of AI hype on Wall Street. Naturally, a perceived threat to Google, Alphabet's golden goose, is a negative.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut investors should pump the brakes because Alphabet has been through this already. Remember, OpenAI partnered with Microsoft to install ChatGPT features into Microsoft's Bing search engine early last year. The monthly market share data indicated that it had virtually no impact on Google.\n\nAnd Alphabet didn't just sit on its hands, either. The company has woven numerous AI features into Google Search and its other products. So, what will OpenAI offer that Google Search can't? OpenAI has stated its product will deliver more concise results. Time will tell if SearchGPT can successfully gain market share. Don't underestimate Google's brand power -- it routinely ranks among the world's most familiar and known brands.\n\nSearchGPT has a lot of work to do before it establishes itself as a legitimate threat to Alphabet.\n\nWhy the stock is a buy today\n\nContinued success in Google Search and Cloud revenue gives analysts a straight-line view of the business. Consensus estimates call for long-term earnings growth averaging 17% annually. Assuming Alphabet delivers, the stock's forward P/E under 22 seems like a great buying opportunity.\n\nI generally buy stocks with a PEG ratio of less than 1.5, and Alphabet's is 1.25 today. The PEG ratio compares a stock's valuation to the company's expected earnings growth. It's signaling that Alphabet is a good value for the growth you might get. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe numbers look good on their own; the investment seems more compelling when considering Alphabet's dominant core business, excellent balance sheet, and widespread efforts to lead in AI technology. How much AI could help the company grow over the next five to 10 years is still unclear.\n\nThere is more than enough going on in Alphabet to justify buying and holding the stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT)\n\nTraders will be looking to Microsoft’s fiscal fourth quarter results after the US close on Tuesday evening as tech earnings are underway. Microsoft’s report follows Google parent Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) earnings announcement last week.\n\nAnalysts tracked by FactSet expect fourth-quarter sales to rise 14.6% year-on-year to $64.4bn (£50bn) and earnings per share to increase 9.3% to $2.94. This compares to Microsoft recording $56.2bn in sales and $2.69 in earnings per share a year ago.\n\nThe fiscal year numbers look even brighter, with analysts expecting sales to rise 15.5% to $244.8bn with earnings per share up 20.6% to $11.83.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCloud revenue is expected to come in at $36.8bn with Intelligent Cloud revenue, which includes Azure, set to hit $28.7bn.\n\nTruist’s Joel Fishbein wrote in a note: “We believe Microsoft is set to outperform across most enterprise categories, particularly Cloud, AI Services and Copilot adoption.”\n\nShares of Microsoft were up 13% year to date on Tuesday.\n\nMcDonald's (MCD)\n\nMcDonald’s reported its first year-on-year decline in like-for-like sales since 2020 during the pandemic, the fast food chain revealed, as customers cut back on spending.\n\nSales fell 1% in the April to June period compared with a year earlier.\n\nDemand at its restaurants fell in the US and France, while price wars in China also weighed on sales.\n\nMcDonald's has been facing a backlash from customers after raising prices significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also boycotted over the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nBoss Chris Kempczinski said the weak results forced the fast food chain into a \"comprehensive rethink\" of pricing. He told investors last night that the firm would lean on discounts in a bid to stop the sales decline.\n\nRead more: Shop inflation steady in July as clothing and footwear prices drop\n\nExecutives pointed to recent promotions, such as the $5 happy meal in the US and a campaign in the UK where diners can select three items for £3.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald's has increased prices on key items faster than its peers, said Bank of America analyst Sara Senatore.\n\n\"Consumers are savvy, aware of that,\" she said. \"The $5 meal that they have launched may be starting to change perceptions, but we are not seeing a trend change yet in terms of transactions and that's what they're going to need to see.\"\n\nShares rose 3.7% on the back of the update.\n\nGreggs (GRG.L)\n\nGreggs was on a roll on Tuesday as summer drinks and pizza deals boosted sales. Shares surged more than 6% in London as like-for-like sales climbed 7.4% with underlying pre-tax profits hitting £74.1m for the six months to 29 June.\n\nThe Greggs App saw participation increase to 18.3%, close to doubling last year’s 10.6%, which is expected to drive higher purchase frequency going forward due to the loyalty scheme on offer.\n\nThe high street bakery chain added that sales were helped by new menu options, with iced drinks such as its mango and strawberry cooler and the strawberries and cream refresher now available in 500 shops, and with plans to roll out to a further 200 shops this year.\n\nRoisin Currie, chief executive, said: “Greggs has made good progress in the first half of the year, further broadening our range of on-the-go food and drink whilst making it more accessible to more customers.\n\n“Our cost outlook for 2024 remains unchanged and we continue to trade in line with our plan. The board remains confident in the long-term growth strategy, and we are investing to support that growth.”\n\nGreggs said it remains committed to its long-term aims to have “significantly” more than 3,000 shops across the UK, having opened 99 new shops and closed 18 to reach 2,524 in the first half.\n\nMamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"Management has reiterated its outlook, with trading in line with expectations and cost inflation expected to moderate within the range of 4-5% as previously guided.\n\n\"Greggs has unique growth opportunities and a compelling value proposition, which puts it in a strong position particularly in this tough consumer landscape.\"\n\nDiageo (DGE.L)\n\nDiageo shares were down 10% after annual results revealed a 1.4% drop in sales and a warning that challenging conditions have continued.\n\nSales declined for the first time since 2020 as the London-listed drinks firm, which owns Smirnoff and Johnnie Walker, wrestled with falling demand in Latin America and the Caribbean. It also posted a 2% dip in sales in North America.\n\nUnsold inventory in Mexico and Brazil led to a profit warning and a loss of market share in the United States, its biggest territory.\n\nMeanwhile, European sales rose 12% while in the UK they were particularly strong, with a rise in demand for Guinness of nearly a third.\n\nThe company said: \"The consumer environment continues to be challenging with conditions we saw towards the end of fiscal 24 persisting into fiscal 25.”\n\nRBC Capital analyst James Edwardes Jones said this was \"not reassuring\" given comments from other consumer companies, which have warned US consumer confidence is under pressure.\n\n\"We expected these results to be grim, and so they were,\" he said.\n\nAnalysts had expected a 4.5% fall in annual operating profit. Diageo had previously said sales in Latin America and the Caribbean would fall by between 10% and 20%.\n\nOverall, group net sales were also slightly worse than forecast, declining 0.6% organically.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – July 30, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nMagnificent 7 Earnings Preview: Can Investors Buy Tech Now?\n\nGet ready for some action this week in the stock market as four of the Magnificent 7 tech giants — Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple —gear up to report their quarterly earnings.\n\nThese tech titans have been the primary drivers of this year’s return, pushing the market to new heights. But with the recent bout of market volatility, the big question remains: Is now the time for investors to dive into tech stocks?\n\nHere, we will explore the broader picture of the sector and potential outcomes of these quarterly earnings reports and try to figure out if any or all of them are worthy additions to investor portfolios at current levels.\n\nStrong Earnings Growth… But AI Concerns Loom\n\nLast week, following the quarterly report from Alphabet, investors started to grow cautious. Concerns about overinvestment into AI infrastructure and its ability to generate profits moving forward have been the main cause of selling over the last week.\n\nManagement’s comments about Capex regarding AI will be an important talking point for all these stocks.\n\nAlong with weakness in Alphabet, Semiconductor stocks and the other Mag 7 stocks have experienced considerable selling. But are these concerns overblown? I think they may be, and with another quarter of impressive growth likely coming, and reasonable valuations from the group, this dip could be a buying opportunity.\n\nAmazon is expected to post a 63.64% year-over-year increase in earnings to $0.54 per share, with revenue projected at $140.88 billion, driven by robust AWS and North American retail operations. Apple, despite a slight revenue dip to $81.64 billion, is forecasted to achieve earnings of $1.19 per share, bolstered by its services and wearables segments.\n\nMeta Platforms anticipates a significant earnings jump to $3.04 per share, a 45% jump and $31.05 billion in revenue, fueled by strong ad revenue and user engagement. Microsoft is projected to deliver $2.72 per share in earnings and $62.03 billion in revenue, reflecting Azure's impressive performance and continued strength in Office and LinkedIn.\n\nOverall, the Mag 7 is expected to bring in +26.8% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.7% higher revenues.\n\nValuations: Amazon and Meta are Relatively Cheap\n\nLooking at the valuations of these tech giants we see a spectrum of results. Although they are broadly trading at reasonable levels, two of them look much more appealing than the others.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms stands out with a free cash flow (FCF) yield of 4.1%, above its 10-year median of 3.2%, making it particularly attractive. Amazon too boasts an FCF yield of 2.6%, above its 10-year median of 1.8%.\n\nApple, on the other hand, has a FCF yield of 3%, which is below its 10-year median of 5.7%, indicating it may be pricier relative to its historical norm. And Microsoft shows a similar trend with an FCF yield of 2.2%, below its 10-year median of 3.6%.\n\nUncertainty Into Year End but Forecasts are Strong\n\nI think it may be a bit of a crapshoot buying these names ahead of earnings, but the reasonable valuations and secular tailwinds these companies enjoy make them compelling buys if they sell off further following the reports.\n\nCritical to the performance of these stocks through the end of the year is investors' perception of AI. Can these companies turn a profit in their new AI products? The answer is probably yes, but shareholders want to see hard evidence.\n\nAnother worthy consideration is the setup in the broader market and the approaching US Presidential Election. Big tech has been carrying the market higher all year, and it may be time for a pause in this run. Additionally, as the election approaches so does the perceived uncertainty, and investors may rotate into defensive sectors until after it concludes.\n\nHowever, it is hard to understate the long-term growth catalysts at these big tech companies – they are almost all expected to grow earnings faster than the market, which will drive even higher stock prices in the coming years.\n\nAny pause they take now, or in the coming months, is likely an opportunity to acquire shares in these generational assets.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Fed meeting, Microsoft earns, BP dividend - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve starts its latest policy-setting meeting, while investors look forward to more corporate earnings, particularly from the important tech sector. BP has already impressed with its second-quarter numbers.\n\n1. Fed starts policy-setting meeting\n\nThe Federal Reserve starts its July policy meeting later in the session, and after a benign June inflation report, investors after looking for the policymakers to lay the groundwork for a September rate cut.\n\nThe U.S. central bank concludes its latest meeting on Wednesday, and is widely expected to maintain its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, as it has done since last July.\n\nInvestors are looking for signals about when and how many rate cuts may occur this year, and will therefore be intently following any policy guidance issued by the central bank, as well as the post-meeting press conference with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nFed officials have repeatedly stated that they are looking for more evidence that inflation is steadily returning to 2% before cutting rates, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated earlier this month that the central bank may not wait until inflation reaches this target before cutting rates.\n\nFutures are fully priced for a quarter-point easing in September, with a small chance of a reduction of 50 basis points, and have 66 basis points of easing priced in by Christmas.\n\n2. Futures edge higher with corporate results in focus\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Tuesday as investors awaited the start of the latest Federal Reserve meeting as well as key corporate earnings.\n\nBy 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 60 points, or 0.1%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 12 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 35 points, or 0.2%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is set to start its two-day policy meeting later in the session, and investors will be looking for clues over the timing and number of rate cuts to expect this year.\n\nThe main earnings release Tuesday will be from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) after the close, but there will also be results from the likes of Merck (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Procter&Gamble (NYSE:PG) before the open, as well as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) post closing bell.\n\nSo far, more than 40% of the S&P 500 companies have reported their results with 79% posting earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to LSEG.\n\n3. Microsoft’s Azure sales in spotlight\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) releases its quarterly results after the close Tuesday - the first of a series of numbers from the tech giants this week, including Facebook-parent Meta (NASDAQ:META) on Wednesday and then both Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors will be looking to see if sales in Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing business have picked up enough to justify the billions of dollars being spent on artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nThe software behemoth is expected to report that Azure's growth stayed steady quarter-over-quarter at about 31% between April and June, according to data from Visible Alpha, helped by its tie-up with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft's capital spending likely surged about 53% year-over-year to $13.64 billion in the period, according to 16 analysts polled by LSEG. A big step up from the $10.95 billion in expenditure it recorded in the previous quarter.\n\nShares of Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell sharply last week after the company reported a quarterly capital spending that exceeded estimates by nearly $1 billion, while the revenue boost from AI integrations remained modest, sparking a selloff in major tech companies.\n\n4. BP (NYSE:BP) lifts its dividend after Q2 results\n\nBP (LON:BP) released impressive second-quarter results earlier Tuesday, resulting in the energy giant raising its dividend after beating profit forecasts.\n\nBP reported an underlying profit of $2.76 billion for the second quarter of the financial year, up from $2.59 billion in the same quarter in 2023, and slightly higher than the $2.72 billion it earned in the first three months of the year.\n\nThe oil major generated substantial cash flow of $8.1 billion, enabling it to lower net debt to $22.6 billion as well as raising its dividend by 10% and announcing another share buyback, worth $1.75 billion, for the last quarter.\n\n“Our decision to increase our dividend by 10%, and extend our buyback program commitment to 4Q 2024, reflects the confidence we have in our performance and outlook for cash generation,” said CFO Kate Thomson.\n\n“We are maintaining a disciplined financial frame and remain committed to growing value and returns for BP.”\n\nAt 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), BP shares rose 2.5% to £4.65, trading largely flat year-to-date.\n\n5. Crude prices remain weak\n\nCrude prices steadied Tuesday, traded near two-month lows on continuing concerns about demand in China, the world's largest crude importer, while traders shrugged off the risk of conflict escalating in the Middle East.\n\nBy 04:00 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.1% to $75.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $79.09 a barrel.\n\nTraders were seen pricing out a risk premium from crude after media reports said Israeli officials were not seeking all-out war with Lebanon in their retaliation for a rocket strike that killed 12 in Israel-occupied Golan Heights.\n\nCrude prices are trading near two-month lows amid persistent concerns over slowing demand, especially in top importer China after last week’s weak growth data.\n\nThat said, the Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, pledged at the end of its July meeting to pursue a \"proactive\" fiscal policy, suggesting more stimulus ahead.\n\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets later in the week to discuss output levels, although recent weakness in crude is likely to see the cartel downplay any plans for scaling back production cuts.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFed meeting, Microsoft earns, BP dividend - what's moving markets\n\nBank of Korea board split on rate cut timing amid hot housing market, minutes show\n\nNew UK government cuts billions of pounds of spending to fix 'unsustainable' finances\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The 2024 Q2 earnings season picks up considerable steam this week, with a notably busy reporting docket. We’ll hear from many different companies, a list that includes several cloud computing players such as Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN.\n\nBoth stocks have been sensitive to their cloud results, often dictating the post-earnings move. We already heard from another notable cloud player, Alphabet GOOGL, and the results provided some insight into what to expect from MSFT and AMZN. Let’s take a closer look.\n\nAlphabet Posts Positivity\n\nAlphabet’s quarterly release was overall positive. The company enjoyed 31% EPS growth on nearly 14% higher sales. Both figures exceeded our consensus expectations, building on its recent streak of quarterly positivity.\n\nCloud showed great growth, with revenues of $10.3 billion nearly 30% higher year-over-year and reflecting a quarterly record. In addition, operating income from Google Cloud saw a sizable jump, reported at $900 million vs. $191 million in the year-ago period.\n\nOverall, the results were positive, but shares faced pressure following the release due to some uncertainty about AI CapEx. Alphabet has regularly exceeded our consensus cloud expectations as of late, as shown below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicrosoft's Cloud Looks to Deliver Again\n\nCloud revenue growth of 23% year-over-year positively shocked investors in its latest release, showing stabilization after a few periods of slowing growth rates. Earnings and revenue expectations have overall remained stable over recent months, with the company expected to enjoy 8% EPS growth on 14% higher sales.\n\nRecent cloud results from the company have consistently exceeded our consensus expectations, as shown below. For the upcoming release, the $28.7 billion estimate suggests a 20% climb from the year-ago period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWill Amazon Post Robust Results Again?\n\nAWS delivered great results in the company’s latest period, with net sales of $25 billion showing 17% year-over-year growth and snapping a recent streak of negative surprises on the metric. For the upcoming print, the Zacks Consensus estimate for Cloud revenue stands at $25.9 billion, reflecting a 17.2% Y/Y climb. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings and revenue expectations for the upcoming release have primarily been muted, but big growth is expected, with EPS expected to be up 63% on 10% higher sales. Easing costs and operational efficiencies have aided profitability in a big way, leading to meaningful margin expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that the chart below is on a trailing twelve-month basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nSeveral major cloud players report this week, a list that includes Mag 7 members Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT. Google parent Alphabet GOOGL recently unveiled its cloud results, which were overall positive and showed great growth.\n\nInvestors will undoubtedly be laser-focused on the Y/Y growth rates these cloud businesses will post, as a deceleration could cause some spooks. On the flip side, better-than-expected growth could easily usher in post-earnings positivity, though other metrics will also be in focus.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Apple relied on chips designed by Google rather than industry leader Nvidia to build two key components of its artificial intelligence software infrastructure for its forthcoming suite of AI tools and features, an Apple research paper published on Monday showed.\n\nApple's decision to rely on Google's cloud infrastructure is notable because Nvidia produces the most sought-after AI processors.\n\nIncluding the chips made by Google, Amazon.com and other cloud computing companies, Nvidia commands roughly 80% of the market.\n\nIn the research paper, Apple did not explicitly say that it used no Nvidia chips, but its description of the hardware and software infrastructure of its AI tools and features lacked any mention of Nvidia hardware.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nApple did not comment on Monday.\n\nThe iPhone maker said that to train its AI models, it used two flavors of Google's tensor processing unit (TPU) that are organized in large clusters of chips.\n\nTo build the AI model that will operate on iPhones and other devices, Apple used 2,048 of the TPUv5p chips. For its server AI model, Apple deployed 8,192 TPUv4 processors.\n\nNvidia does not design TPUs but rather focuses its efforts on so-called graphics processing units (GPUs) that are widely used for AI efforts.\n\nUnlike Nvidia, which sells its chips and systems as standalone products, Google sells access to TPUs through its Google Cloud Platform. Customers interested in buying access must build software through Google's cloud platform in order to use the chips.\n\nApple is rolling out portions Apple Intelligence to its beta users this week.\n\nReuters reported the use of the TPU chips in June, but Apple did not disclose the full extent of its reliance on Google hardware until Monday's research paper.\n\nGoogle did not return a request for comment, while Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nApple's engineers said in the paper it would be possible to make even larger, more sophisticated models with Google's chips, than the two models it discussed in the paper.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple unveiled a slew of new AI features at its June developer conference, including integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT technology into its software.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company's stock ticked down 0.1% to $218.24 in regular trading on Monday.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "title": "Microsoft to report fiscal Q4 earnings as Wall Street eyes AI revenue and spending",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) will report its fiscal fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday as Wall Street continues to look for signs that the massive wave of AI investments among Big Tech firms is starting to pay off.\n\nFor the quarter, Microsoft is expected to report earnings per share of $2.94 on revenue of $64.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft reported EPS of $2.69 on revenue of $56.2 billion during the same period last year.\n\nCloud revenue is expected to come in at $36.8 billion with Intelligent Cloud revenue, which includes Azure, set to hit $28.7 billion.\n\nDuring its prior quarter, Microsoft announced that AI services contributed 7 percentage points of growth to its Azure and other cloud services revenue. That was up from 6 percentage points in Q2 and 3 percentage points in Q1. The company initially began reporting AI contributions in Q4 of last year, saying AI added 1 percentage point of growth to Azure at the time.\n\nShares of Microsoft are up 13% year to date.\n\nMicrosoft’s report follows rival and Google parent Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) earnings announcement last week, during which the company said it is seeing an uptick in cloud revenue partially due to interest in AI products.\n\nStill, Google didn’t offer specific numbers on the impact of AI on the cloud business, leaving some analysts like UBS Global Research’s Stephen Ju to predict that revenue benefits from the company’s AI spending might not come until the first half of 2025 at the earliest. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build conference at Seattle Convention Center Summit Building in Redmond, Washington, on May 21, 2024. (Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images) (JASON REDMOND via Getty Images)\n\n“Our checks for Microsoft have been robust this quarter again, as we believe the AI tidal wave with Redmond in the driver's seat is accelerating cloud deal flow for Azure with strong momentum into the rest of 2024/2025,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an investor note ahead of Microsoft’s announcement.\n\nAccording to UBS Global Research analyst Karl Keirstead, Microsoft has also been grabbing more market share from Google and Amazon.\n\n“In terms of share shifts among AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, the most consistent theme in this round of checks was the number of customers and partners that cited share gains by Microsoft resulting from its early lead on the AI front,” Keirstead wrote in a recent note about the three major cloud players.\n\n“This has been a recurring theme from checks over the last 6-12 months and the commentary about Azure’s relative strength felt consistent with prior checks,” he added.\n\nOutside of how much Microsoft is making on AI, investors will want to know how much more the company plans to spend on the technology moving forward. In Q3, Microsoft reported capital expenditures of $14 billion as it continues to build out its AI infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring Alphabet’s earnings call, CFO Ruth Porat said the company spent $13 billion on capital expenditures, up from $12 billion in the prior quarter, adding that the vast majority of that spending is going toward AI.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is set to report earnings on Aug. 1.\n\nShares of Google are up 22% year to date, while shares of Amazon are up 23%.

        "title": "Will the Next Batch of Tech Earnings Encourage Investors to Rotate Back In?",
        "content": "Another chance for mega tech to impress investors\n\nThis week the megacaps get another chance to prove themselves when Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Apple (AAPL?) all report second-quarter earnings.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) got the reporting party started on Tuesday after-the-bell to little fanfare. Disappointing results from both those names led to a general selloff on Wednesday, which saw the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite clocking their worst performance since 2022. Weakness was obvious in Tesla's results, which missed earnings per share expectations by 9 cents and saw auto revenue slip 7% year over year.[1] On the other hand, Alphabet handily beat expectations on both the top and bottom line, but it was worse-than-expected YouTube advertising revenue that caused investors to punish the stock.[2] Alphabet shares took another leg lower on Thursday when OpenAI announced the prototype of its search engine, SearchGPT. As a result of these early earnings results, other mega-cap tech names such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta and Apple fell in sympathy.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MCD.\n\nThe markets climbed their way out of the trenches late last week, boosted by a better-than-expected gross domestic product report which saw the U.S. economy expanding by 2.80% [3] and the June Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCEPI) that showed inflation continuing to ease.[4] Despite that, many tech names ended the week lower, with Meta, Microsoft and Apple down approximately 2% for the week, Nvidia falling 3% and Alphabet down nearly 6%.\n\nThe bar was set high coming into the second-quarter season with little room for error for corporations releasing results. Despite the recent rotation out of tech, many of these names still have very rich valuations and investors want to see they are justified by strong fundamentals. Thus far, the trend of investors rewarding positive surprises less than usual and punishing negative surprises more than usual remains in play.\n\nAccording to FactSet, the current consensus for S&P 500 EPS growth is for 9.80% year over year, an increase from 9.70% last week.[5] Thus far 78% of companies that have reported have surpassed analyst profit estimates, while only 60% have beaten on revenues.[6]\n\nSecond peak week\n\nThis week marks the second peak week of the second-quarter earnings season with nearly 2,500 companies anticipated to release results. All eyes will be on mega tech once again, as Microsoft reports on Tuesday, Meta on Wednesday and Apple and Amazon on Thursday, all after the close.?\n\nStory continues Will the Next Batch of Tech Earnings Encourage Investors to Rotate Back In?\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nOutlier earnings dates this week\n\nAcademic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.[7]\n\nThis week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their second-quarter 2024 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. Ten companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, eight of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those names are F5 Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV), McDonald's Corp. (NYSE:MCD), IDEX Corp. (NYSE:IEX), Meta Platforms, Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA), The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY), Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) and Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). The two names with positive DateBreaks Factors are ANSYS Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) and Smurfit WestRock PLC (NYSE:SW).\n\n* Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company's 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.\n\nMcDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Monday July 29, BMODateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\nMcDonald's Corp is set to report second-quarter 2024 results on Monday, July 29. While this is only two days later than they reported last year, it would be the latest they've ever reported for the second quarter.\n\nMcDonald's rang the alarm on the U.S. consumer last quarter after disappointing earnings per share results pointed to a pull-back in discretionary spending. Consumers continue to be even more discriminating with every dollar that they spend as they faced elevated prices in their day-to-day spending, which is putting pressure on the industry, CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's first-quarter earnings call.\n\nThe Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Wednesday July 31, BMODateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\nBoeing is set to report second-quarter 2024 results on Wednesday, July 29, the latest they've ever reported for the second quarter, but still sticking with their Wednesday reporting trend.\n\nAfter all of the setbacks and bad press Boeing has received this year, it probably isn't particularly surprising to see them move their earnings date later. On Wednesday the planemaker plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge for misleading U.S. regulators in order to get the 737 Max jetliner approved before it was ready, leading to two fatal crashes.[8] It isn't just the issue with the 737 Max jetliners, but other models such as 777 freighters that are incomplete and awaiting additional parts or updated software, costing the company about $1 billion a month as they scramble to get these idle planes up and running.[9]\n\nSecond-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis season peak weeks will fall between July 22 and Aug. 9, with each week expected to see over nearly 2,000-plus reports. Currently Aug. 8 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,438 companies anticipated to report. Thus far only 69% of companies have confirmed their earnings date (out of our universe of 11,000-plus global names), so this is subject to change. The remaining dates are estimated based on historical reporting data.?

        "title": "US stock futures fall with Fed meeting, mega tech earnings on tap",
        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures retreated in evening deals on Monday as sentiment remained strained in anticipation of a Federal Reserve meeting and earnings from some of the country’s biggest companies.\n\nA rebound in technology stocks ran out of steam this week, with the sector nursing deep losses over the past two weeks amid profit-taking, a shift into more economically sensitive sectors and underwhelming earnings from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nTraders were reluctant to buy back into the sector, with several tech majors set to report quarterly earnings this week, beginning with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.2% to 5,494.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.2% to 19,169.75 points by 19:13 ET (23:13 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.2% to 40,707.0 points.\n\nMicrosoft to kick off next round of major tech earnings\n\nThe Redmond, Washington-based tech giant is set to report its June quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the firm is set to clock strong growth in earnings on the back of more artificial intelligence products, investors will be watching for any increased expenditure, and whether AI demand appeared to be sufficiently boosting earnings.\n\nThe increased caution comes after high AI spending and some sluggish revenue metrics soured otherwise strong earnings from peer Alphabet last week. The stock had tumbled after its earnings.\n\nBeyond Microsoft, tech heavyweights Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are set to report earnings on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nOther major earnings are also on tap this week, with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Merck&Company Inc (NYSE:MRK), Procter&Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) due in the coming days.\n\nWall Street indexes were largely unchanged on Monday amid caution ahead of the earnings. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% to 5,463.54 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.1% to 17,370.33 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1% to 40,539.93 points.\n\nFed meeting awaited for more rate cues\n\nMarkets were also on edge before a Fed meeting this week, with the bank widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of the meeting on Wednesday.\n\nBut any signals on when the bank plans to begin cutting rates will be closely watched, given encouraging signs from inflation and positive comments from Fed officials in recent months.\n\nMarkets are pricing in a 25 basis point cut by the Fed in September, according to CME Fedwatch.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStory continues\n\nUS stock futures fall with Fed meeting, mega tech earnings on tap\n\nAd group WPP lines up former BT boss Philip Jansen as its new chair, FT reports\n\nMeta to let users to create custom AI characters\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google responds to Elon Musk’s accusations of a ‘search ban’ on Trump: ‘We’re working on improvements’ to auto-complete results",
        "content": "Google has responded to Elon Musk, Donald Trump Jr., and other top GOP figures’ accusations that the search engine is interfering in the election with its auto-complete results.\n\nOn Sunday evening, several X users posted photos showing that when they typed “assassination attempt on” into Google’s search engine, the website showed only auto-complete results for assassination attempts on former President Ronald Reagan, Bob Marley, and other figures, omitting the July 14 attempt on former President Donald Trump’s life.\n\nEven when Fortune typed in “assassination attempt on Trump” on Chrome using incognito mode, no auto-complete showed up on the results. Clicking “enter” on the result, however, yielded several recent news articles about the incident in Butler, Pa.\n\nElon Musk, who owns X, also weighed in, posting a photo of him searching for “President Donald,” which suggested “President Donald Duck” before “President Donald Trump.”\n\n“Wow, Google has a search ban on President Donald Trump,” Musk posted. “Election interference?”\n\n“Probably just a coincidence that Alphabet (Google) employees were the top donors to Biden,” he snarked in another X post.\n\nFortune—searching in incognito mode on Chrome—could not replicate Musk’s results: Auto-complete did not show any predictions on searches for “President Donald” or “President Trump.” Auto-complete also did not show any predictions for “President Joe” or “President Biden.”\n\nSeveral top GOP figures were enraged by the auto-complete results posted on X and immediately accused Google of “gaslighting” the American people and trying to influence the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"Big Tech is trying to interfere in the election AGAIN to help Kamala Harris,\" Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., wrote on X. \"We all know this is intentional election interference from Google. Truly despicable.\"\n\nGoogle told Fortune that the company did not take “manual action” on the auto-complete predictions, and will be “working on improvements” to its auto-complete feature.\n\nIn terms of the assassination attempt queries, Google’s systems have “protections against Auto-complete predictions associated with political violence, which were working as intended prior to this horrific event occurring,\" the spokesperson wrote to Fortune. \"We’re working on improvements to ensure our systems are more up-to-date.\"\n\nAs for the “Donald Duck” search that Musk highlighted, the spokesperson said that “auto-complete is currently not working as intended” in response to searches for the names of past presidents and the current vice president.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We're looking into these anomalies and working on improvements, which we hope to roll out soon,” the spokesperson said. “Our auto-complete systems are dynamic, so predictions will change based on common and trending queries.”\n\nBarry Schwartz, an expert on online search and the founder of the Search Engine Roundtable, a news service about search engines, told Fortune that Google’s response “makes sense.”\n\n“You can search wherever you want, and Google will show it to you, but it won’t do an auto-complete ‘suggestion’ that you do violence toward politicians,” he said.\n\nImagine if the attempt never happened, but typing in “assassination attempt on Tru” in Google suggested “assassination attempt on Trump,” Schwartz said: That would be encouraging violence.\n\nBut the attempt did happen, so Google should show auto-completion for that sentence, he added. In all likelihood, “they just didn’t update their filter,” he said—nothing more nefarious.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Wall Street is still jittery on GLP-1s",
        "content": "Wall Street's concerns about GLP-1s' impact on medical device makers and other sectors were back in full swing after glucose monitoring device seller Dexcom (DXCM) slashed its full-year guidance after an earnings miss last week.\n\nHowever, Dexcom's troubles appear unrelated to the weight loss and diabetes drug frenzy, as competitors such as Abbott (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT) haven't been pressured by the miss, once again allaying Wall Street's fears.\n\nThe company attributed its guidance to a fumbled sales strategy.\n\n\"It was a much more disruptive expansion that we've had in the past, and that did lead to a lot of disruption, particularly at the beginning of the quarter. We saw things getting better toward the end,\" said CEO Kevin Sayer on an earnings call.\n\nThe Street previously pressured food and beverage stocks on fears of long-term declines expected from GLP-1 use. That has proven to not be the case, even as the GLP-1 market is expected to reach $130 billion by 2030.\n\nStill, medical device stocks have been through a roller-coaster ride in the past year, in part on Wall Street's reaction to data and updates about GLP-1s.\n\nTake, for example, an announcement in June from Eli Lilly (LLY), maker of the weight-loss drug Zepbound, that its GLP-1 formula helps reduce incidents of sleep apnea. The data showed greater reduction for those who use pressurized breathing masks, known as CPAP machines, but the news still sent stocks of CPAP makers down.\n\nThat includes ResMed (RMD), a leader in the space. CEO Mick Farrell told Yahoo Finance he sees the news as a tailwind rather than a sign of trouble.\n\n\"They're going to bring more patients into my funnel, and we're going to continue to grow,\" Farrell said.\n\nHe sees the opportunity growing further as tech companies like Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Samsung, and the Oura ring offer sleep monitoring software on their devices. This, he said, will bring more awareness about sleep apnea, and therefore more patients.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nUnderpenetrated market\n\nIn the past year, there have been multiple instances of Wall Street predictions dooming sectors based on GLP-1 data, but experts insist the reality is that the potential frenzy has been tamped primarily by supply constraints.\n\nJPM analysts said in a note in August 2023, in response to one company's earnings showing lower volumes of bariatric surgery in a quarter, \"Unless patients commit to using GLP-1s for life, which many aren’t keen to do, they’ll likely still progress to bariatric surgery, which remains extremely underpenetrated.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe idea of being an underpenetrated market holds true for continuous glucose monitoring devices and CPAP machines, along with bariatric surgery. And it's also true for GLP-1s, which have only been available in a limited number of countries and markets to date, as both the market leaders work to add manufacturing capacity.\n\nWall Street jitters haven't spared the GLP-1 makers, either. The current duopoly of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk (NVO) is being threatened by several hundred clinical trials for rival GLP-1s. Among those being closely watched are Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN), Pfizer (PFE), and the biotech Viking Therapeutics (VKTX).\n\nRoche recently announced positive early-stage trial data, while Viking is beginning its final-stage clinical trial — the news within the span of a week sent Eli Lilly's stock diving. It traded down 14% in eight days and lost $120 billion in market value. But the same news didn't drag Novo's stock as much.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "content": "The overall stock market has been reeling over the last week or so. The S&P 500 index and NASDAQ have fallen by 4% and 6%, respectively, since July 16 due to uncertainty regarding the future of artificial intelligence. This has caused major tech sell-offs among oversold giants such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Investors are also buying into small and mid-cap stocks in hopes of gains following interest rate cuts expected this year.\n\nEven though many investors seek out large-cap stocks with high trading volume, specifically within the tech sector, many other industries are experiencing an inflow of investments. It is important for investors not to overreact and make rushed decisions in a market downturn.\n\nMany companies are still performing well, and investors are excited about their future. Of the stocks with 52-week highs during this dip in the stock market, three are well-known by investors and offer substantial upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) A Thermo Fisher Scientific sign out front of an office in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) is a life science service company that offers specialty laboratory and diagnostics equipment for industries such as pharmaceuticals, genetic sciences, agriculture and government.\n\nOver the past fifty-two weeks, its share price has risen by 6%.

Tesla Inc.’s TSLA stock also suffered following its earnings results due to a lack of details from CEO Elon Musk on the company's self-driving vehicle efforts (read: Time for Covered Call ETFs?).\n\nMost artificial intelligence (AI) technology leaders, including semiconductor giants like NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, took a beating in the middle of last week. Many feared that the huge AI investments made by big tech companies would pay off later than expected.\n\nThe scale of profitability of those investments is also unknown now, while the high valuation of the AI stocks is a concern for many investors. But does this fear make sense? Should you buy the dip in “Magnificent Seven” – Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and NVIDIA and their ETFs? Was the latest selloff healthy?\n\nLet’s find out.\n\nWill Return on AI Investments Be Realized Later Than Expected?\n\nA lack of visibility makes it difficult to determine a return on investment for big tech’s AI capex. Microsoft's capex on generative AI in data centers is expected to grow from $16 billion in fiscal 2024 to $23 billion in fiscal 2027, per Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss, as quoted on investors.com.\n\nMeanwhile, he predicts generative AI revenues of $5.3 billion in fiscal 2024 and $37.9 billion in fiscal 2027. Those estimates assume a \"relatively modest\" gross profit margin of about 50% in fiscal 2027. But then, with AI producing decent results in multiple business areas, the adoption of and the demand for AI tools is likely to go higher in the coming days globally.\n\nIn a 2024 McKinsey survey, 39% of respondents witnessed lower costs resulting from AI adoption in their organization, as quoted on Forbes. This means that over the long run, the AI business may prove to be at least a volume-driven revenue engine, if not realization driven.\n\nMeanwhile, investments in AI are being made in full stride by big tech companies, sensing the potential. So, if you are not buying the momentum now and are waiting for the realization of a proper return-on-investment, you may be missing out on the current rally. And by the time, you want to jump into the AI initiative, the move might already be priced in.\n\nWhat Does Valuation Say?\n\nOne should not forget that the AI king NVIDIA currently trades at a forward P/E of 42.1X versus 46.8X for the Semiconductor-General sub-industry. Alphabet trades at a forward P/E of 22X versus 23X for the Internet Services Market sub-industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft’s forward P/E stands at 32.3X versus Underlying Computer-Software Market’s P/E of 34.6X. Meta’s forward P/E stands at 23X, a 35% discount to its underlying sub industry software market’s P/E of 35.4X.\n\nAmazon AMZN, however, looks pricey given its forward P/E of 39.8X, trading at a premium to the sub-industry e-commerce market’s forward P/E of 27.5X. That said, we all know that Amazon today is more than an e-commerce company, it’s more in the information technology league. Apple AAPL trades at a P/E of 33.1X versus the underlying computer mini-market’s P/E of 31.3X.\n\nNeed to be Choosy on AI Pick?\n\nPrimarily, all big techs are investing billions in AI, but not everyone is tasting the same success. Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT fired on all cylinders in its initial days of launch in late 2022. OpenAI has now posed its most direct challenge yet to Alphabet’s Google: a search engine that uses artificial intelligence baked in from the beginning.\n\nOpenAI is testing SearchGPT, which will combine its AI technology with real-time information from the web to allow people to search for information. However, we are yet to be sure that OpenAI will be seen as great a success in Internet search as Google. While Alphabet initially stumbled on the Gen-AI initiative, Google has made the Gemini AI free version faster with a 1.5 flash update.\n\nAre ETFs Better Bets?\n\nThe above-mentioned valuation and demand for AI show that the charm of big techs is still present. The likely Fed rate cuts in the near term should boost these growth companies even more. However, if you are unsure about picking the right AI stock, the ETF or basket approach is good for you. Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS will give you direct exposure to the “Mag 7” stocks. The fund was off 5.5% last week, opening a good entry point now.\n\nOther ETFs that can offer you a good amount of “Mag 7” exposure include Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF XLG, Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK and QQQ.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Alphabet upgraded, Arm downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls",
        "content": "Alphabet upgraded, Arm downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nPhillip Securities upgraded Alphabet (GOOGL) to Buy from Accumulate with a price target of $205, up from $195. Alphabet is still the dominant player in digital advertising and the market leader in artificial intelligence, the firm tells investors in a research note. Wells Fargo upgraded Booz Allen(BAH) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $165, down from $168. The firm thinks issues driving the Q1 EBITDA shortfall are \"temporary and mostly behind us,\" and says the company should see accelerating top-line growth as late Q1 hire utilization kicks in and year-over-year comparisons ease. RBC Capital upgraded Sarepta Therapeutics(SRPT) to Outperform from Sector Perform with an unchanged price target of $182. The firm has increased conviction that once past the Q2 earnings report, the \"significant near-term launch inflection\" it models is increasingly likely. Guggenheim upgraded Akamai Technologies(AKAM) to Buy from Neutral with a $128 price target. The firm believes Akamai is \"finally set up to transform itself\" from a content delivery network company to a platform. Deutsche Bank upgraded 3M (MMM) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $150, up from $110. The firm is \"very impressed\" with CEO Bill Brown's first interaction with the Street, saying \"he shared a very well thought-out, detailed assessment of his key areas of focus.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nHSBC downgraded Arm (ARM) to Reduce from Hold with a price target of $105, up from $100. The firm sees short-term downside risk to Arm's earnings from increasing Android smartphone uncertainty. Raymond James downgraded Charter (CHTR) to Underperform from Market Perform without a price target. With management \"unwilling to give deeper insight\" into its strategy or economics, Raymond James' analysis suggests Charter's shares will underperform the group. Barclays downgraded Bristol Myers(BMY) to Underweight from Equal Weight with an unchanged price target of $41. The stock has rallied 25% over the past 11 days supported by multiple drivers, but the company hasn't address investors' key focus, which is longer-term trough guidance, the firm said. Deutsche Bank downgraded General Dynamics (GD) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $320. The firm says the target price offers 10% upside from current levels, which is closely aligned with historical equity market returns, and as such, it prefers a more substantial market beating return for Buy-rated stocks. Piper Sandler downgraded Charles Schwab(SCHW) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $64, down from $80. Schwab has announced that over the next several years it plans to lower balance sheet duration and reduce the size of its bank by relying more heavily on third party banking relationships, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nLake Street initiated coverage of GigaCloud (GCT) with a Buy rating and $50 price target. GigaCloud's platform connects manufacturers, primarily in Asia, with resellers, primarily in the U.S., and allows for a seamless transaction for large parcel items between sellers and buyers, notes the analyst, who thinks the business is more insulated from other e-commerce players given it is completely B2B and works directly with product suppliers. KeyBanc initiated coverage of Simulations Plus(SLP) with an Overweight rating and $47 price target. The firm sees the company and the biosimulation industry in the early growth stages with less than 5% of an $8B total addressable market penetrated. TD Cowen initiated coverage of Astria Therapeutics(ATXS) with a Buy rating and $35 price target. The firm cites the likelihood of STAR-0215 Phase III success and the company's \"significant potential\" in hereditary angioedema prophylaxis for the Buy rating. Laidlaw initiated coverage of Abivax (ABVX) with a Buy rating and $48 price target. The firm says obefazimod affords a unique mechanism of action which has demonstrated \"robust\" Phase IIb results in ulcerative colitis, and bodes well for a positive outcome of the ongoing Phase III study. Roth MKM initiated coverage of Nuwellis (NUWE) with a Buy rating and $17 price target, citing projected future revenue from Aquadex and Vivian device consoles and consumable circuits in fluid overload.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet (GOOGL) International Revenue Performance Explored",
        "content": "Have you evaluated the performance of Alphabet's (GOOGL) international operations for the quarter ending June 2024? Given the extensive global presence of this internet search leader, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial strength and potential for growth.\n\nIn the current global economy, which is more interconnected than ever, a company's success in penetrating international markets is crucial for its financial health and growth journey. Investors must understand a company's dependence on overseas markets, as this offers a window into the company's earnings stability, its ability to benefit from varied economic cycles and its potential for long-term growth.\n\nInternational market involvement serves as insurance against economic downturns at home and enables engagement with economies that are growing more quickly. Still, this move toward diversification is not without its challenges, as it involves navigating through the fluctuations of currencies, geopolitical threats, and the distinctive nature of various markets.\n\nOur review of GOOGL's last quarterly performance uncovered some notable trends in the revenue contributions from its international markets, which are commonly analyzed and tracked by Wall Street experts.\n\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter stood at $71.36 billion, increasing 15% year over year. Now, let's delve into GOOGL's international revenue breakdown to gain insights into the significance of its operations beyond home turf.\n\nA Look into GOOGL's International Revenue Streams\n\nDuring the quarter, APAC contributed $13.82 billion in revenue, making up 19.4% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $13.39 billion, this meant a surprise of +3.26%. Looking back, APAC contributed $13.29 billion, or 19.7%, in the previous quarter, and $12.73 billion, or 20.5%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nOther Americas (Canada and Latin America) accounted for 6.9% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $4.94 billion. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -38.78%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $8.07 billion. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Other Americas (Canada and Latin America) contributed $4.65 billion (6.9%) and $4.51 billion (7.3%) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nOf the total revenue, $24.68 billion came from EMEA during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 34.6%. This represented a surprise of +6.23% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $23.24 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $23.79 billion, or 35.2%, and $22.29 billion, or 35.9%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nInternational Market Revenue Projections\n\nFor the current fiscal quarter, it is anticipated by Wall Street analysts that Alphabet will report a total revenue of $72.73 billion, which reflects an increase of 13.6% from the same quarter in the previous year. The revenue contributions are expected to be 19.4% from APAC ($14.1 billion), 10.5% from Other Americas (Canada and Latin America) ($7.64 billion) and 33.3% from EMEA ($24.25 billion).\n\nAnalysts expect the company to report a total annual revenue of $296.37 billion for the full year, marking an increase of 15.5% compared to last year. The expected revenue contributions from APAC, Other Americas (Canada and Latin America) and EMEA are projected to be 19% ($56.39 billion), 8.9% ($26.28 billion) and 33.3% ($98.81 billion) of the total revenue, in that order.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe dependency of Alphabet on global markets for its revenues presents a mix of potential gains and hazards. Thus, monitoring the trends in its overseas revenues can be a key indicator for predicting the firm's future performance.\n\nWith the increasing intricacies of global interdependence and geopolitical strife, Wall Street analysts meticulously observe these patterns, especially for companies with an international footprint, to tweak their forecasts of earnings. Importantly, several additional factors, such as a company's domestic market status, also impact these earnings forecasts.\n\nEmphasizing a company's shifting earnings prospects is a key aspect of our approach at Zacks, especially since research has proven its substantial influence on a stock's price in the short run. This correlation is positively aligned, meaning that improved earnings projections tend to boost the stock's price.\n\nOur proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, with its externally validated exceptional track record, harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions to serve as a dependable measure for anticipating the short-term price trends of stocks.\n\nAt present, Alphabet holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). This ranking implies that its near-term performance might mirror the overall market movement. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nReviewing Alphabet's Recent Stock Price Trends\n\nOver the preceding four weeks, the stock's value has diminished by 8.3%, against a downturn of 0.2% in the Zacks S&P 500 composite. In parallel, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which counts Alphabet among its entities, has depreciated by 4.6%. Over the past three months, the company's shares have seen a decline of 0.1% versus the S&P 500's 7.5% increase. The sector overall has witnessed an increase of 8.1% over the same period.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this company have returned -8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has lost 8.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.82 per share, indicating a change of +17.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.4%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.62 indicates a change of +13.1% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GOOG _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $72.74 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $292.14 billion and $325.77 billion estimates indicate +13.9% and +11.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Jim Cramer: Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Stock is ‘Cheap’ —  Ads Market is ‘Fantastic’ and YouTube is ‘Killing It’",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation.Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a program last week tried to make sense of the decline in tech stocks, saying companies with the “best fundamentals” got “hammered once again.”\n\n“I did not expect that to happen.”\n\nCramer said that sometimes it’s difficult to own the “winners.” The CNBC host said it’s important to understand the bear cases around stocks otherwise you will never know what “you are up against.”\n\nJim Cramer tried to find out whether the latest decline in top tech stocks was just a “periodic selloff” that presented an “opportunity.”\n\n“When we get this kind of rotation, you never know whether these stocks are selling off because there’s something wrong or because they are up huge.”\n\nJim Cramer pointed to a caveat when it comes to holding winning stocks. When you have the losers, there are no profits, but when you own winners in your portfolio, you can see losses because people want to take some profits off the table, Cramer said.\n\nThe CNBC host said when top stocks go down, people holding those in their portfolios often end up thinking about whether they should also sell these stocks and if something has “changed.”\n\n“From what I can tell you, nothing has changed about the stocks we are going talk about tonight. But it is true that the stocks are a heck of a lot more expensive than they were one year ago.”\n\nIn this program, we took a look at some top tech stocks that fell last week and explained the reasons they lost value according to Jim Cramer. We also discussed these companies’ fundamentals and hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Jim Cramer Talking About Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Falling Stock Amid Latest Market Rotation?\n\nGoogle\n\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nJim Cramer, while trying to analyze the reasons behind Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) latest fall, said that Alphabet is “cheap” and the ad market is “fantastic” while YouTube is “killing” it. But why did the stock go down?\n\nCramer said people are noticing that Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search business might be in trouble amid the rise of ChatGPT and other language models.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Perhaps people think wait a second, I am using their AI platform as well as Microsoft’s, so are their regular search numbers are going down. It’s a legitimate question, I know I use search much less, I go to ChatGPT. Many other people are doing the same thing. What happens, people want to sell first and get their questions answered later whether their search is being hurt by AI.”\n\nDeepwater’s Gene Munster thinks that Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is going to win the “AI arms race.” While talking to CNBC, the analyst said that Google search business is “intact, no need to worry.” Munster’s thesis is based on his in-depth testing of several large language models and chatbots including Google’s Gemini. Munster also thinks other chatbots do not offer a strong imperative for users to switch from Google search as of yet.\n\nWedbush’s Dan Ives in a fresh note named Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) as one of the stocks that can benefit from the AI boom.\n\nAccording to a latest UBS report, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls in all three layers of the AI value chain – enabling, intelligence and application layer. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an AI enabling player because of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud Platform, while Gemini makes it a key player in the intelligence layer. On the application layer, UBS believes Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has an edge with its Duet AI assistant and advertising. All these catalysts make Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) a company that could benefit from the $1.2 trillion AI opportunity by 2027, UBS said.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the company is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note-taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrated with other Google apps. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) app urges users to sign up for ‘Google One AI Premium’ plan, which has a $19.99 price tag.  Google saw advertising revenue accelerate in Q1 2024, boosted by YouTube in particular growing by almost 21% last quarter. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The top absolute contributors were Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft, and Amazon. Turning briefly to positions we do own, Alphabet represented our top absolute contributor. The stock responded positively to attractive across-the-board results that beat expectations, with excitement around GenAI driving growth in its cloud business. Additionally, the company introduced a dividend and announced an additional $70B share buyback, beginning to show prudent capital allocation discipline in our view.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Implied Volatility Surging for Alphabet (GOOGL) Stock Options",
        "content": "Investors in Alphabet Inc. GOOGL need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Aug 16, 2024 $30.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Alphabet shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Alphabet is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Internet - Services industry that ranks in the Top 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, six analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while seven have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.82 per share to $1.83 in that period.\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about Alphabet right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

        "title": "3 Cheap Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Investors have an ambivalent relationship with low-cost stocks. While they often seek to buy shares at a relatively low price, they also know that many \"cheap\" stocks are such because of a weakened investment case.\n\nNonetheless, the late Charlie Munger advised investors that it is better to buy a great company at a fair price than a fair company at a great price. Thus, investors should look for bargains in a relative sense rather than seeking the lowest valuations possible.\n\nFortunately, the tech market offers such value stocks, and investors should consider these three stocks while they sell at a low price.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nInvestors seem to have perceived Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) as less attractive amid the rise of generative AI. But it is much too early to count out this company.\n\nFirst, it has a long history of AI innovation and has declared itself an \"AI first\" company since 2016. And it recently combined some of its AI-related entities into Google DeepMind to focus its efforts. It also responded to perceptions that it had fallen behind by developing Google Gemini to remain a force in the generative AI field.\n\nMoreover, it has a $100 billion cash hoard and has shown it is willing to spend it to stay competitive. In the first six months of 2024, it spent $25 billion on property and equipment, almost double the $13 billion during the same period in 2023.\n\nIt has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27. While not a record low, it is the cheapest stock with a market cap above $2 trillion. Considering its long history in AI, its research efforts, and its tremendous cash position, Alphabet is a low-cost stock that belongs on investors' watch lists.\n\n2. Qualcomm\n\nAmong AI chip companies, most of the focus centers on Nvidia, even as companies like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel try to take market share.\n\nHowever, the company that might emerge as the one best able to compete is Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM). As the leading smartphone chipset maker, it has developed a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip that supports AI applications for smartphones. This could help Qualcomm stock as AI fosters a need for an upgrade cycle in the smartphone market.\n\nAnd it has diversified into other products. Besides developing Internet-of-Things and automotive applications, it has also created a chip that supports PCs, making it a direct competitor to AMD and Intel.\n\nFurthermore, revenue has returned to growth, with $19 billion in revenue reported in the first two quarters of fiscal 2024 (ended March 24), up 3%. That should continue to rise amid an industry recovery.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the previous year, the semiconductor stock is up 55%, likely in anticipation of strong sales for its AI-capable chipset. And given the attention surrounding that topic, investors will probably see its 25 P/E as a bargain that is too good to ignore.\n\nIBM\n\nIf you had not paid attention to International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) lately, you might have assumed that the tech industry passed it by. That was arguably becoming true until IBM acquired Red Hat in 2019.\n\nThrough that purchase, IBM redefined itself as a cloud company, particularly with its ability to leverage the hybrid cloud. Today, it is the sixth-largest cloud infrastructure company by market share. Image source: Statista.\n\nAlso, its position in the cloud necessitated its AI development, and through watsonx, it can support generative AI applications for its clients, reinforcing its position in today's tech market. Perhaps no other stock combines these elements better than IBM.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has increased its payout for 29 straight years, and at $6.68 per share, it offers a dividend yield of 3.6%, almost triple the 1.3% return of the S&P 500.\n\nInvestors have begun to take notice of IBM's value proposition, and the stock is up more than 35% over the last year, and at a P/E ratio of 21. As shareholders continue to benefit from IBM's recovery and rising stock price, they can still add shares at a low cost.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the chance to become one of the biggest and most impactful technological innovations of our time. The applications of the technology are still in the very early innings, as is the buildout of the infrastructure needed to test large language models (LLMs) and run AI inference.\n\nLet's look at three stocks set to be AI winners that you can buy and hold onto for the next decade. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the biggest AI winners thus far, but that doesn't mean it won't continue to be a long-term winner. The company's graphic processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of the infrastructure buildout to help power AI applications. As companies rush to create their own AI applications, demand for Nvidia's chips has been through the roof.\n\nTo maintain its lead in the space, Nvidia has sped up its innovation cycle, and it is looking to introduce new chip architecture on an accelerated schedule. At the same time, the company's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software platform is a differentiator for the company and has helped it create a wide moat. The software platform is generally what developers are taught on to program GPUs, helping make Nvidia's chips and software platform the industry standard. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nDespite the stock's strong performance, Nvidia still trades at an attractive valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 30 based on 2025 analyst estimates. Given its growth potential, that is a bargain.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nDon't let the slide in Alphabet's(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) stock following its second-quarter results fool you. The company posted strong results that show it is set to become an AI winner.\n\nThe company's cloud computing segment, Google Cloud, is making great strides, seeing Q2 revenue growth of 29% to $10.4 billion, as the segment benefits from developers using its AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions. Importantly, though, this is a very fixed-cost business where the company has just gained the necessary scale. As such, profitability is starting to soar, with Q2 operating income going from $395 million a year ago to $1.2 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the fears that AI could negatively impact Google Search have thus far been unfounded, with the company seeing search revenue jump 14% last quarter. Alphabet is just beginning to tap into the power of AI with its search, developing AI overlays to answer some queries. After some initial hiccups, users are beginning to engage with the new feature, and the company is in the early days of monetizing (profiting from) these AI overviews. The company plans to introduce new search and shopping ads with the format soon.\n\nStory continues GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nTrading at a forward P/E of under 20 based on 2025 analyst estimates, the stock is one of the cheapest mega-cap tech stocks out there and a great stock to buy and hold for the long term.\n\n3. Adobe\n\nWhile chip stocks related to building out AI infrastructure have been the big early AI winners, software companies have the potential to be strong AI winners as well. One such company embracing AI and leading the charge is Abobe(NASDAQ: ADBE), which holds a dominant position in the creative software space with programs such as Photoshop and InDesign. It is also the leading PDF solution company through its Acrobat programs.\n\nThe company has been pushing the use of AI into its products, with such AI features as generative fill, text to image, generative shape fill, and generative remove, using the Firefly AI models that it has developed. Adobe is still in the early days of monetizing AI, as right now, it lets users trial its AI capabilities for free before they have to buy generative credits. The company should find a better to way to profit from its AI capabilities in the future, but right now, it is helping drive solid growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's AI-powered Adobe Express app, which helps create graphics and videos for social media, looks like it could be a long-term AI winner.

        "title": "Microsoft's costs in focus as fears rise over slow payoff from AI",
        "content": "By Aditya Soni\n\n(Reuters) - Microsoft investors will have one big question when the tech giant reports earnings on Tuesday: has growth in its Azure cloud-computing business picked up enough to justify the billions of dollars being spent on artificial intelligence infrastructure?\n\nWidely seen as the front-runner in the race to make money from AI, thanks to its tie-up with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Microsoft is expected to report that Azure's growth stayed steady quarter-over-quarter at about 31% between April and June, according to data from Visible Alpha.\n\nThat would be in-line with the company's forecast, but investors are expecting a bigger contribution from its AI business in the fiscal fourth quarter after it accounted for 7 percentage points of Azure's growth in the first three months of the year.\n\nMicrosoft's capital spending likely surged about 53% year-over-year to $13.64 billion in the period, according to 16 analysts polled by LSEG. A big step up from the $10.95 billion in expenditure it recorded in the previous quarter.\n\nFears that runaway spending by tech giants on data centers would yield little payoff in the short term have dogged the U.S. stock market this month amid signs that Wall Street may have become too optimistic about earnings growth.\n\nShares of Google-parent Alphabet fell more than 5% last week after the company reported a quarterly capital spending that exceeded estimates by nearly $1 billion, while the revenue boost from AI integrations remained modest, sparking a selloff in major tech companies.\n\nAlphabet said its quarterly capital expenditure would stay high for the rest of 2024 at or above $12 billion.\n\n\"Investors will be very focused on Microsoft's ability to continue to accelerate revenue growth, especially the portion related to AI. If revenue acceleration doesn't materialize and increases in capex continue, investors may be disappointed,\" said Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson.\n\nMicrosoft has said it needs to spend on data centers now to overcome the capacity constraints that are hampering its ability to capitalize on AI demand.\n\nIts view echoes that of other tech companies, including Alphabet. The Google parent's CEO, Sundar Pichai, said last week that \"risk of under-investing (in AI infrastructure) is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing.\"\n\n'WELL POSITIONED'\n\nThe spending surge has allowed Microsoft to court more business from its large enterprise client base by offering expanded access to its AI cloud service and rolling out features such as its 365 Copilot assistant for Word and Excel.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft has said the $30-per-month Copilot service, which can summarize heaps of emails into a few bullet points or speedily complete lines of computer code, is used by half of the Fortune 500 companies.\n\nThe Redmond, Washington-based tech giant is, however, yet to disclose the revenue contribution from the service, and analysts believe Copilot's impact will be more apparent in the back half of calendar year 2024.\n\n\"While a lot of focus has been on consumer-facing applications like ChatGPT, (generative AI) is potentially a larger opportunity for enterprise and Microsoft is just incredibly well positioned to capitalize on their install base,\" said Igor Tishin, analyst at Harding Loevner, a $55 billion asset manager that counts Microsoft and Alphabet among its largest holdings.\n\nMicrosoft shares have risen about 13% this year, adding more than $350 billion to the company's market value. The stock hit a record high on July 5, but has dipped nearly 9% in the recent tech selloff. It has underperformed a 14.5% rise in the S&P 500 this year.\n\nThe company is expected to post a 14.6% increase in overall revenue for the April-June period, compared with 17% growth in the previous quarter.\n\nThat is mostly down to slower growth in its personal computing business that includes Windows and the Xbox gaming division. The productivity business - home to the Office suite of apps, LinkedIn and 365 Copilot - is expected to post growth of about 10%.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Shinjini Ganguli)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – July 29, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Alphabet GOOGL and Tesla TSLA.\n\nTime to Buy the Dip on Alphabet Following Earnings?\n\nAlphabet reported earnings Tuesday and beat analysts’ estimates on both the top and bottom line, yet the stock is rolling over. Is it time to get out of the stock? I think not, and rather it would be a fantastic buying opportunity.\n\nThere are two primary reasons for Alphabet's sell-off following its recent earnings report, both of which I believe are temporary. First, the overall market weakness is weighing on the stock. Second, there are concerns about whether the significant capital expenditures on AI infrastructure will generate sufficient near-term profits.\n\nWhile the concerns are reasonable, Alphabet is such a sturdy asset that I believe you can overlook any near-term concerns as the long-term still looks so fruitful for the company.\n\nBut what is especially compelling is that GOOGL is trading at a relatively discounted valuation, while business fundamentals are strong, and the company enters exciting new technological ventures.\n\nFor investors who are keen on buying leading technology stocks at a discount, Alphabet may be the next addition to your portfolio.\n\nEarnings Beat but the Alphabet Stock Falls\n\nAlphabet has reported a solid second quarter for 2024, showcasing strong performance across its key segments and continued innovation in artificial intelligence. The company's results underline its robust financial health and strategic investments in AI and cloud infrastructure.\n\nAlphabet delivered revenues of $85 billion, marking a 14% year-on-year increase. This growth was driven by strong performance in Search and Cloud services. The Cloud segment achieved quarterly revenues exceeding $10 billion for the first time, alongside a notable $1 billion in operating profit.\n\nSearch revenues reached $48.5 billion, growing 13.8% year-over-year while Cloud revenues saw a slight acceleration, growing 28.8% to $10.4 billion. AI is playing a pivotal role here, with the majority of Alphabet's top 100 customers utilizing AI-driven services.\n\nAdditionally, seeing a reacceleration of the core search business is a fantastic development as many investors had begun to doubt it.\n\nFurthermore, notes about the development at Waymo are very encouraging and have the potential to open another massive business opportunity for Alphabet.\n\nHuge Potential in Autonomous Driving\n\nAlphabet announced that they would be committing another $5 billion to expansion at Waymo, and I think investors are still underestimating the incredible potential here.\n\nStory continues\n\nWaymo has made significant strides, delivering over 50,000 paid rides per week across San Francisco and Phoenix. But most importantly, Waymo has focused on optimizing its service for profitability and scalability, making strategic decisions that enhance its configurability across various vehicle types and conditions.\n\nThis is a very different approach than Tesla is taking, as Alphabet believes providing the underlying technology will be a superior business model and is similar to the way GOOGL influences the mobile computing industry with Android. They make no devices but are the most widely used mobile software in the world.\n\nWaymo is also taking a bottom’s up approach, developing its own sensors to control the whole tech stack. Alternatively, Tesla relies solely on camera-based vision and must manage all the additional logistics of producing a full vehicle. The longer it takes Tesla to get full self-driving to actually work, the more I am favoring Waymo in leading the industry.\n\nAlphabet Stock Trading at a Discount\n\nAs noted, Alphabet is trading at a valuation that I consider to be appealing for long-term investors. Today, GOOGL is trading at 22x forward earnings, which is below its 10-year median of 26.1x and below the market average.\n\nBecause I believe Alphabet is among the best companies in the world, I think it unreasonable that it trades in line with the average of the index. With continued strong performance across business segments, and some incredible growth catalysts, I think Alphabet is compelling at current levels.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nDespite Alphabet's recent post-earnings dip, this may be an opportune moment for investors to buy the stock.\n\nAlphabet's second-quarter earnings report showed strong performance across key segments, with impressive growth in Search and Cloud services. The company continues to lead in AI-driven innovations, reinforcing its competitive edge. Additionally, the significant investment in Waymo highlights Alphabet's potential in the autonomous driving market, offering another promising growth avenue.\n\nAt its current valuation, Alphabet presents an attractive opportunity for long-term investors. For investors seeking to capitalize on a leading technology stock at a discount, Alphabet is a compelling choice.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Tesla, Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Microsoft are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – July 29, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Tesla TSLA, Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, Meta META and Microsoft MSFT.\n\nBreaking Down Magnificent 7 Earnings\n\nMarket participants showed their disappointment with last Tuesday's results from two of ‘The Magnificent 7’ stocks: Google parent Alphabet and Tesla.\n\nThe worrisome aspect of the market reaction to these two reports, particularly to the Alphabet release, is that this could be a precursor of what to expect this week from four other members of the group – Microsoft on Tuesday, July 30th, after the market’s close (AMC), Meta Platforms on Wednesday AMC, July 31st and Apple on Thursday AMC, August 1st.\n\nIt is hard to say anything positive about the Tesla report, but the Alphabet report had a lot of positives. Unlike Tesla, which missed consensus estimates on the back to continued margin pressures, Alphabet beat estimates and had a number of other positives in its results, including search and cloud.\n\nInvestors instead zeroed in on the bigger-than-expected capital expenditure figure, which fed into creeping worries about ever-rising AI-centric capex without a timeline for when the spending will start to pay off. Alphabet management’s comment on the capex question that underinvesting represented a bigger risk than the alternative likely added to the market’s worries. A bigger jump in search growth that could be attributed to the company’s AI investments would have eased some of those worries, but that was not the case.\n\nThe capex will likely be front and center in this week’s Meta and Microsoft reports as well. Concerning Amazon, a leader in the cloud space through its Amazon Web Services business, there are questions about the business’ decelerating growth trend in recent quarters when Microsoft and Alphabet are showing accelerating growth trends.\n\nApple has started making some AI announcements lately, but many in the market appear skeptical of its efforts. The more significant near-term Apple questions are about the evolving iPhone trends in China.\n\nReturning to the Alphabet and Tesla results, Alphabet’s earnings were up +28.6% from the same period last year on +15% higher revenues. Tesla’s Q2 earnings were down -45.3% on +2.3% higher revenues.\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +26.8% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.7% higher revenues.\n\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +16.8% from the same period last year on +9.5% higher revenues.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks leading the rising estimates trend.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, July 26th, we have seen Q2 results from 207 S&P 500 members, or 41.4% of the index’s membership. Total earnings for these 207 index members are up +0.6% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues, with 79.7% beating EPS estimates and only 57.5% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nThe Q2 reporting cycle really ramps up this week, with more than 1000 companies on deck to report results, including 170 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 stocks, this week’s line-up includes a representative cross-section of reports from different sectors, including bellwethers like McDonald’s, Procter & Gamble, Pfizer, Starbucks, Mastercard, Boeing, DuPont, Exxon, Chevron, and others.\n\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low level of Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentage of 57.5% is a new low for this group of 207 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6.9% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues.\n\nAs we have been flagging all along in this space, we experienced a notably favorable revisions trend ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season, with estimates for Q2 holding up far better than other recent periods. In the three-month period from the start of the quarter through June 30th, Q2 estimates for the S&P 500 index fell the least relative to the comparable periods of other recent quarters.\n\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.7% on +1.7% revenue growth.\n\nThe expected revenue growth pace improves to +4% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +8.4% on an ex-Finance basis.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Will Mag 7 Earnings Meet Expectations?\n\nZacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Sunday as focus turned to an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting for more cues on interest rate cuts.\n\nFocus was also squarely on a string of June-quarter earnings from Wall Street’s biggest companies, such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which are due in the coming days.\n\nWall Street indexes had rebounded sharply on Friday after PCE price index data- which is the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge- read mostly within expectations for June, driving up optimism that the central bank will begin cutting rates in September.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.2% to 5,512.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.4% to 19,244.50 points by 19:40 ET (00:40 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 40,931.0 points.\n\nFed meeting set to provide rate cut clarity\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nBut any signals from the central bank on when it plans to begin cutting interest rates will be closely watched, amid increasing signs that inflation had cooled in recent months.\n\nA slew of Fed officials also said in recent addresses that the central bank was gaining more confidence in its battle against inflation, and that it did not need to see inflation reaching its 2% annual target to begin cutting rates.\n\nGeneral consensus is that the Fed will keep rates steady this week, but potentially offer signals on a September rate cut. Traders were seen pricing in a 25 basis point cut by the Fed in September, CME Fedwatch showed.\n\nApple, Microsoft set to report earnings\n\nEarnings reports from some of Wall Street’s biggest companies are on tap this week, with Microsoft and Apple set to report on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nOther tech majors including Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) are also set to report earnings through the week.\n\nThe results come in the wake of an extended rout in technology stocks, as the sector was walloped by profit-taking and as expectations of rate cuts saw investors pivot into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nUnderwhelming earnings from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) last week also sparked increased caution ahead of the tech earnings, with investors waiting to see whether increased investment in artificial intelligence was bearing fruit.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.1% to 5,459.10 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 1% to 17,357.88 points on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1.6% to 40,589.34 points.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise with Fed, big tech earnings in focus\n\nAppleâ€™s AI features will not be included in initial launch of iOS 18- Bloomberg\n\nApple's artificial intelligence features to be delayed, Bloomberg News reports\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why the tech stock selloff isn't over yet: Wall Street strategists",
        "content": "The tech rout is far from over.\n\nThat’s the warning from strategists this week as investors dump big tech stocks in favor of previously unloved areas of the market. The Nasdaq 100 closed the week down 2.7%, marking the third week in a row of declines, with the technology sector suffering its largest single-day percentage drop since October 2022.\n\nThe culprits: bets on Fed rate cuts, Tesla’s (TSLA) lackluster earnings, and fears about Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) AI spending ramp.\n\n“Valuations were priced to perfection from an earnings standpoint and from an interest rate standpoint, that eventually we would see some sort of a valuation correction,” Verdence Capital Advisors chief investment officer Megan Horneman told me.\n\nHorneman, who warned the AI trade is “hitting a wall,” added that this week’s rotation out of big tech is only the start of a “valuation correction.”\n\nThe significant shift under way has pushed small caps to the top of investors' buying lists. The Russell 2000 (RUT) recorded weekly gains for the third week in a row, marking its best three week stretch since 2022. Data compiled by Bespoke found that the outperformance spread between the Russell 2000 and the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) over the last 12 trading days, in favor of the small-cap index, is the second most extreme in the history of the two indices.\n\n“With multiples as high as they are for the Mag seven, they're building in earnings growth. And if you don't see that earnings growth, that means that valuations come into question,” Commonwealth Financial Network’s Brad McMillan explained to me.\n\n“There’s a threat of more pressure ahead,” McMillan said.\n\nAnd that risk of slower profit growth, coupled with increased spending on AI, could signal that the “epic momentum reversal” will persist, unless big tech raises forward revenue guidance, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn a note to clients, Goldman Sachs’ David Kostin wrote investors are starting to worry about the prospect of “overinvestment” in AI without timely proven returns, noting that Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet are driving the bulk of the spending.\n\n“Consensus estimates of 2024 and 2025 capex and R&D spending by the hyperscalers have increased by $65 billion compared with expectations at the start of the year. However, analysts have lifted their sales forecasts for 2025 and 2026 by only $36 billion — a gap of nearly $30 billion,” Kostin wrote.\n\n“These firms during the past six months have dramatically increased their planned spending on AI initiatives but it is not apparent when the return will come — in 2027, 2028, 2029, or perhaps not at all,” he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs our markets reporter Josh Schafer noted, two charts in Yahoo Finance’s Chartbook suggest further selling ahead. Analysis by Truist’s Keith Lerner found that the S&P 500 sees an average correction of about 9% in the second half of the year, after the index rallies more than 10% in the first six months.\n\nMeanwhile, BMO Capital Markets chief investment officer Brian Belski’s review of past performance found that stocks usually drop an average of 9.4% in the second year of a cyclical bull market, which started in October 2022.\n\n“This market has become quite frothy with everybody looking to big cap tech stocks and chasing the market,” Belski told me. “It's really difficult to be overweight Apple or overweight Nvidia … especially given how much they've rallied.”\n\nSafe to say, earnings results this coming week from Meta, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft will be a crucial measuring stick. Any sort of disappointment, similar to what we saw from Alphabet and Tesla this week, could trigger more carnage for the tech market.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia's Run-Up? My Best AI Stock to Buy and Hold.",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has undoubtedly been the hottest topic in the business world in the past year and a half. Executives are trying to better position their companies to take advantage of this trend. And the investment community is figuring out ways to profit from what many see as a revolutionary technology.\n\nThere's no denying that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the poster child of the AI boom. The company is firing on all cylinders. And the stock has gone bonkers, catapulting 2,500% higher in the past five years and 682% since the start of 2023.\n\nIf you missed Nvidia's monster rally, don't worry. Perhaps it's time to consider what I believe is the best AI stock to buy and hold.\n\nNvidia's impressive run\n\nNvidia is known for selling graphics processing units that power AI applications. The company has a stranglehold on the market. It has a whopping 98% revenue share of the data center GPU industry. Nvidia essentially sells the picks and shovels that power AI systems that other businesses are investing aggressively in. This puts it in a favorable competitive position to benefit from the ongoing AI gold rush, which many observers think is still very much in the early innings.\n\nIt's not a surprise that growth has been tremendous. In fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), revenue was up 126% versus the prior year. And during the fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), the good times continued, with sales rising 262%. It's also encouraging to see that Nvidia is extremely profitable, reporting an operating margin of 65% in Q1.\n\nNvidia's momentum is impressive, as the business benefits from heightened spending on AI-related infrastructure. However, investors shouldn't expect Nvidia's spectacular growth to continue indefinitely. That's an unrealistic assumption.\n\nWhile the company's success has been eye-popping, the valuation has gotten stretched. Shares trade at a nosebleed price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 67.3. It might be too late to buy the stock, as optimism has gotten sky-high.\n\nDon't forget about Alphabet\n\nThe market always falls in love with a hot growth story. This has pushed Nvidia's market cap to $2.8 trillion. But investors shouldn't ignore a dominant internet firm that I believe is well positioned in the AI race. I'm talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG).\n\nThe tech titan has been utilizing AI and machine learning as far back as 2001 in its flagship service, Google Search. It's not new to this technology. In fact, CEO Sundar Pichai positioned the business to focus more on AI initiatives in 2016. While the introduction of ChatGPT might have spurred a race to develop AI products quickly, it's worth pointing out that Alphabet was ahead of the curve.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis puts Alphabet in a prime position because its products and services are used by billions of people worldwide every day. It doesn't necessarily need a killer AI app to drive financial gains. It can constantly launch new AI features to its user base to almost instant adoption, something only a select few other companies can do.\n\nAlphabet's Gemini AI models are \"making Google's own products better,\" Pichai said on the Q2 2024 earnings call. In the Google Cloud segment, AI will be a big focal point to better serve clients with their various needs, making Alphabet an even more important mission-critical partner.\n\nIt's hard to argue with the belief that Alphabet will be a leader in the AI race. Besides being a leading enterprise at the cutting edge of the internet and technology, it has unrivaled resources to invest heavily. As of June 30, the business had $101 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on the balance sheet, much more than the $13 billion in long-term debt. Plus, it has exceptional talent and tech know-how.\n\nAt a P/E ratio of 26.4 and with forecast earnings-per-share growth of 19.4% between 2023 and 2026, Alphabet is my best AI stock to buy and hold.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Big Tech earnings, a Fed meeting, and the July jobs report: What to know this week",
        "content": "The stock market rally is in its most fragile state in months ahead of Wall Street's busiest week of the summer.\n\nThe S&P 500 (GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) recently had their worst single-day drops since 2022 as the indexes struggled to recover losses during a Friday rally. All three major averages closed the final full week of July lower. The S&P 500 was down more than 1%, while the Nasdaq fell over 2.3%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose about 0.6%.\n\nIn the week ahead, a Federal Reserve meeting, the July jobs report, and earnings from Big Tech stalwarts Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) will drive the direction of markets to kick off August.\n\nUpdates on job openings, activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, and consumer confidence are also on the calendar.\n\nA busy week of corporate earnings awaits, with 171 members of the S&P 500 expected to report quarterly results. AMD (AMD), Arm (ARM), Boeing (BA), McDonald's (MCD), and Starbucks (SBUX) will be among the companies highlighting the schedule.\n\nA September 'signal'\n\nThe Fed will announce its latest monetary policy decision next Wednesday. Markets largely expect the central bank to hold rates steady at its July meeting.\n\nRecent updates in the economy have investors eyeing when the Fed's first cut will come though. In June, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out the cost of food and energy and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 2.6% over the prior year, its lowest annual increase in more than three years. Separate data for the month showed a significant decrease in another inflation metric, the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market has shown signs of cooling. The ratio of job openings to unemployed workers is back at pre-pandemic levels, and last month, the unemployment rate hit its highest level since November 2021.\n\nThis has prompted markets to price in the Fed's first cut in September, and investors will be keenly listening to Jerome Powell's press conference on Wednesday for any confirmation.\n\n\"The overall tone from the meeting, including from Chair Powell's press conference, should signal that a rate cut in September is a reasonable baseline without pre-committing to this action,\" Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti wrote in a note to clients. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell departs after holding a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on interest rate policy in Washington, U.S., May 1, 2024. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nLabor market look\n\nFriday will bring a fresh look at monthly job additions as economists continue to debate whether recent cooling in the labor market represents normalization or more significant deterioration.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe July jobs report is expected to show 175,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy, with unemployment holding steady at 4.1%, according to data from Bloomberg. In June, the US economy added 206,000 jobs while the unemployment rate rose to 4.1%.\n\n\"The 180K increase to payrolls we expect in July would still be a respectable gain, but would underscore that, directionally, the jobs market is deteriorating,\" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients. \"By a range of measures, including the unemployment rate, quit rate, level of temporary help workers and small business hiring plans, the labor market is not only softer than a year or two ago, but weaker compared to its pre-pandemic state.\"\n\nGiven this backdrop, whether unemployment holds steady or ticks up as it has for the past three months will be in particular focus.\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nThe stock market's recent slump has included a big sell-off in tech.\n\nSince July 10, Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) — which tracks Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — has dropped about 12%.\n\nTruist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner recently told Yahoo Finance the pullback has made sense given the runup in Big Tech stocks over the past year and how overstretched positioning in many of the large tech stocks had become. This, combined with investors rotating into less-loved areas of the market rally that could benefit from the Fed cutting interest rates, has become the hallmark of the market action over the past two weeks.\n\nEarnings from four of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple — could change that. But as the sell-off after Alphabet and Tesla earnings showed in the prior week, it's been a tough season to impress investors with earnings.\n\n\"When we look at the earnings that we've seen over the last week, I don't think the earnings are bad,\" Lerner said. \"I don't think the businesses, the fundamental business trends, are bad, but I just think that they were not good enough relative to these really high [expectations].\"\n\nAnd, to Lerner's point, stocks that miss on Wall Street estimates for earnings, revenue, or both are seeing significantly worse price reactions in the next trading day than typically seen over the past five years, according to research from Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel.\n\nFor now, Emanuel wrote in a note to clients, \"earnings remain a catalyst for volatility, not higher S&P 500 prices.\"\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, July (-14.2 expected, -15.1 prior)\n\nEarnings: McDonald's (MCD), Philips (PHG), Tilray (TLRY)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P CoreLogic 20-city year-over-year NSA, May (7.2% prior); Conference Board consumer confidence, July (99.7 expected, 100.4 prior) JOLTS job openings, June (8.14 million prior); Dallas Fed services activity, (-4.1 prior)\n\nEarnings: Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), BP (BP), Caesars Entertainment (CZR), Electronic Arts (EA), First Solar (FSLR), JetBlue (JBLU), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), Merck (MRK), Pinterest (PINS), Pfizer (PFE), Procter & Gamble (PG), Starbucks (SBUX), SoFi (SOFI)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended July 26 (-2.2% prior); ADP private payrolls, July (+168,000 expected, +150,000 prior); Minnesota Chicago PMI, July (44.0 expected, 47.4 prior); Employment cost index, second quarter (1.0% expected, 1.2% prior); Federal Reserve monetary policy decision (no interest rate change expected)\n\nEarnings: Meta (META), Altria (MO), Arm (ARM), Boeing (BA), Carvana (CVNA), Generac (GNRC), Humana (HUM), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC), Mastercard (MA), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), Paycom (PAYC), Qualcomm (QCOM)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, July, (+19.8% prior); Unit labor costs, second quarter (+4% prior); Nonfarm productivity, fourth quarter (+1.6% expected, +5.2% prior); Initial jobless claims, week ending July 27 (235,000 prior); S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, July final (49.5 prior); Construction spending, month-over-month, July (+0.2% expected, -0.1% prior); ISM manufacturing, July (49 expected, 48.5 prior); ISM prices paid, July (52.1 prior)\n\nEarnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Block (SQ), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Canada Goose (GOOS), Coinbase (COIN), ConocoPhillips (COP), Crocs (CROX), DraftKings (DKNG), Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Mobileye (MBLY), Moderna (MRNA), Roku (ROKU) SiriusXM (SIRI), Wayfair (W)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, July (+175,000 expected, +206,000 prior); Unemployment rate, January (4.1% expected, 4.1% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, July (+0.3% expected, +0.3% prior); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, July (+3.7% expected, +3.9% prior); Average weekly hours worked, July (34.4 expected, 34.3 prior); Labor force participation rate, July (62.6% previously); Factory orders, June (+0.5% expected, -0.5% prior); Durable goods orders, June final (-6.6% prior)\n\nEarnings: Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Dividend Stocks Making Inroads in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in 2024",
        "content": "Tech stocks are more known for their long-term growth than their dividends, as many of the industry's top performers either have no dividend to speak of or offer a relatively small one. However, even a small dividend can be a nice bonus on top of reliable price appreciation.\n\nThe tech-driven Nasdaq Composite index has soared about 289% over the last 10 years, with much of its recent growth fueled by a surge in artificial intelligence (AI). That technology has massive growth potential in the coming years, projected to reach nearly $2 trillion in spending by 2030. Meanwhile, some of the biggest players in the market offer dividends that, consistently reinvested, could expand your positions in this hypergrowth industry.\n\nAs a result, a dividend-paying AI stock could offer the best of both worlds: significant long-term growth and a cash bonus. So, here are three dividend stocks making inroads in AI in 2024.\n\n1. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) paid its first quarterly dividend in 1992, at $0.10 per share. That figure has fluctuated considerably since then, reaching as high as $0.365 in 2022. For years, the company was known for offering one of the most generous dividends in tech, but recent restructuring saw its quarterly payout decrease to $0.125 in 2023, and it has yet to rise.\n\nYet, a decreased dividend is likely the right move for Intel's long-term success as it ventures full force into AI. Intel has been in a rut in recent years, challenged by rising competition in the chip market and a lack of direction. But since the start of last year, management reorganized its business to expand and invest in two key growth areas: AI and its foundry division.\n\nIntel's new focus has seen it debut a range of AI-capable chips and begin construction on the first of at least four chip plants it will build in the U.S. Each of these moves broadens and diversifies the company's role in AI -- and tech in general -- which will likely boost earnings in the coming years and allow it to reward investors with dividend growth.\n\nA price-to-sales ratio of 2 makes its stock a bargain right now and too good to ignore given its potential.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is new to the dividend game, initiating it on June 16 with a 0.44% yield and quarterly payout of $0.20. The cash-rich company has more than $16 billion in free cash flow and $101 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is reinvesting its earnings in the budding AI market. As the home of potent brands like Google, YouTube, and Android, Alphabet has the unique opportunity to integrate AI across its product lineup and become a leading driver in the public's adoption of the technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has started by expanding Google Cloud's AI capabilities, adding generative features to Google Search, and improving its digital ad technology.\n\nThe company posted its second-quarter 2024 earnings on July 23. Revenue rose 14% year over year, beating Wall Street estimates by $450 million. Operating income climbed 26% to $27 billion, profiting from significant growth in its AI-focused Google Cloud.\n\nAlphabet's stock recently was trading at 26 times its earnings, a great value compared to its potential, making it worth considering this month.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is easily one of the most reliable dividend stocks active in AI. Management has consistently raised its payout every year since 2013, no matter the market conditions. The quarterly amount has risen 226% since 2013, reaching $0.75 in 2023, for a yield of 0.67%.\n\nThe company has become one of the biggest threats in AI thanks to a lucrative partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI and extensive financial resources. That heavy investment gave Microsoft access to some of the most advanced AI models in the industry, allowing it to elevate its business with the technology. And earnings show the company is already profiting from its AI expansion.\n\nIn the third quarter, Microsoft's revenue rose 17% year over year; operating income increased by 23%. The impressive growth was primarily fueled by its productivity and cloud businesses, which have both introduced a range of new AI features since the start of last year.\n\nMicrosoft hit $71 billion in free cash flow this year, outperforming its biggest cloud rival, Amazon, which reached $46 billion. Microsoft's price-to-earnings ratio of 37 means its stock isn't the best value, but its generous dividend and growth potential make it worth its premium price, with its stock a no-brainer right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Monster AI Growth Stocks to Buy Before They Join Microsoft and Apple as $3 Trillion Companies",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) delivered what can only be described as monster returns for shareholders over the last five years. The stocks surged 2,490% and 195%, respectively, while the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) advanced a mere 80%.\n\nBetter yet, that outperformance could continue in the coming years. Nvidia and Alphabet should benefit as businesses invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure, so much so that they could join Microsoft and Apple as members of the elite $3 trillion club in the near future.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nNvidia could be a $3 trillion company by the end of 2024\n\nNvidia currently has a market capitalization of $2.7 trillion, meaning shares would need to increase 11% for the company to reach a $3 trillion valuation. That could happen by the end of 2024. My reasoning is simple: Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI), and businesses are spending money hand over first where AI is concerned.\n\nCase in point, five large cloud computing companies -- Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Oracle -- will record $181 billion in capital expenditures (capex) this year, according to JPMorgan Chase estimates. That implies 36% growth in capex spending, a substantial acceleration from 10% growth last year, primarily due to AI infrastructure buildouts.\n\nFew (if any) companies will benefit more than Nvidia. The chipmaker holds 98% market share in data center GPUs and up to 95% market share in AI processors, according to Mizuho Securities. Nvidia is also gaining momentum in other data center hardware categories. Its Grace central processing unit (CPU) is ramping toward a multibillion-dollar product line, and its InfiniBand/Ethernet networking platforms are already a multibillion-dollar business.\n\nIndeed, Nvidia could cross the $3 trillion threshold when it announces second-quarter results on Aug. 28. Wall Street underestimated sales and earnings growth in each of the last four quarters. Another low estimate could cause the stock to pop, and such an outcome seems plausible. CFO Colette Kress recently said that demand for H200 and Blackwell GPUs is \"well ahead of supply, and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year.\"\n\nBlackwell GPUs are state-of-the-art chips that can accelerate AI training and inference by factors of four and 30, respectively, compared to the previous Hopper generation. They are also more power efficient, such that they reduce the total cost of ownership by a factor of 25. CEO Jensen Huang recently told investors, \"The Blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 34% annually over the next three years. That makes its current valuation of 66 times earnings seem fairly reasonable, and it puts a $3 trillion valuation within easy reach. In fact, assuming earnings grow as quickly as analysts expect, Nvidia would be a $4 trillion company in 2026, even if shares trade at a more reasonable 45 times earnings.\n\nAlphabet could be a $3 trillion company by the end of 2025\n\nAlphabet currently has a market capitalization of $2.1 trillion, meaning shares would need to increase 43% for the company to achieve a $3 trillion valuation. That could happen by the end of 2025. Alphabet is the largest adtech company and third-largest cloud infrastructure provider worldwide. Grand View Research expects those markets to grow at annual rates of 22% and 21%, respectively, through 2030.\n\nBuilding on that, Alphabet has invested billions of dollars in AI product development over the years. Indeed, Forrester Research recently recognized its dominance in AI infrastructure solutions, and the company is bringing that expertise to bear on its adtech and cloud computing businesses.\n\nAlphabet recently added a conversational feature in Google Ads that lets brands create campaigns with natural language. It also introduced AI-powered image generation and profit-optimization tools to boost conversion rates. Those innovations should keep Google top of mind for advertisers. Additionally, CEO Sundar Pichai says AI Overviews in Google Search are boosting engagement and increasing user satisfaction, which should allay concerns about the company losing share in internet search.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet has drawn more than 1.5 million developers to Google Cloud with Gemini, a multimodal model that can process language, images, video, audio, and computer code. The company is monetizing Gemini in several ways. For instance, Gemini powers a conversational assistant that automates tasks in Google Workspace applications, and it powers a conversational assistant that accelerates coding projects. Also, Gemini can be fine-tuned and used to build custom generative AI applications.\n\nInvestment bank UBS recently published a report (Artificial Intelligence: Sizing and Seizing the Investment Opportunity) that divides the AI value chain into three layers: the enabling layer, the intelligence layer, and the application layer. UBS analysts wrote, \"We see the largest near-term opportunities in the enabling layer,\" which includes semiconductor companies like Nvidia and cloud computing companies like Alphabet.\n\nWith that in mind, Wall Street expects Alphabet to grow earnings per share at 17% annually over the next three years, yet shares trade at a relatively inexpensive valuation of 24 times earnings. By comparison, Wall Street expects Microsoft to grow earnings per share at 14% annually, yet the stock commands a relatively pricey valuation of 37 times earnings.\n\nIf Alphabet meets those expectations and the market affords the stock the same valuation as Microsoft, it would be a $4 trillion company by the end of 2025. In that context, reaching $3 trillion is easily achievable, and investors should consider buying a position in this stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Buy Alphabet Stock on This Dip. Here's Why.",
        "content": "There's no disputing that Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is spending an uncomfortable amount of money. That's why its stock fell following the release of last quarter's results, in fact, despite topping revenue and profit estimates for the three-month stretch -- there's just a lot of cash coming right back out of its growing business.\n\nMaybe the market's lost some perspective here. Alphabet stock's recent pullback is arguably less of a warning and more of an opportunity to anyone willing to take a step back and see the bigger picture.\n\nAlphabet stock's tumble makes sense -- on the surface\n\nIt would be great if Google's parent was spending less and growing more. On balance though, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai's got the right idea, and is balancing spending with potential. Moreover, his company is still showing strong, investment-worthy performance in the face of headwinds and stiff competition.\n\nBut first things first.\n\nFor its second quarter ending in June, Alphabet turned $84.7 billion worth of revenue into a per-share profit of $1.89. Both figures are up from year-earlier comparisons of $74.6 billion and $1.44 per share. And, perhaps more important, both numbers beat expectations for earnings of $1.84 per share on sales of $84.2 billion. Data source: Alphabet Inc. Chart by author. Revenue and income figures are in billions of dollars.\n\nGoogle's cloud computing business showed particularly strong revenue and operating income growth, although the company's breadwinning advertising business also made good progress compared to a modest increase in traffic-acquisition costs.\n\nThere were stumbling blocks, though. One of them is YouTube's slowdown. Although last quarter's revenue of nearly $8.7 billion was up 13% year over year, that's less than analysts were anticipating for the ad-driven video platform. It's also slower than Q1's sales growth of 20%.\n\nPerhaps investors' top concern with Alphabet's second-quarter results, however, is the amount of money the company's still spending on major projects. CFO Ruth Porat explained during Q2's earnings call that $13.2 billion worth of capital expenditures -- mostly investments in its artificial intelligence (AI) offerings -- were made during the quarter versus expectations of only around $12 billion. That's roughly how much Alphabet intends to spend in each of the next few quarters, too, extending losses linked to the development of its AI offerings.\n\nInvestors latching on to these two details, however, are overlooking a handful of other bullish nuances buried in the company's second-quarter numbers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe glass is actually half-full, and then some\n\nOne of these nuances has already been highlighted. That's traffic acquisition costs that aren't rising nearly as rapidly as revenue. This expense was only up 6% year over year in Q2.\n\nAnother detail from the company's second-quarter results being glossed over is just how much profit Google's cloud computing arm is producing. Although it remained in the red until the first quarter of last year, now that it's in the black a little bit of top-line growth is producing an exaggerated degree of bottom-line benefit. Of Google Cloud's second-quarter revenue of more than $10.3 billion, nearly $1.2 billion was turned into operating income. Data source: Alphabet Inc. Chart by author. Figures are in billions of dollars.\n\nGiven the trajectory of this arm's sales and profits, look for cloud to become an even bigger earnings contributor in the foreseeable future.\n\nIt's also worth adding that while Alphabet is shelling out more on AI-related capital expenses than most investors like, it's curbing other costs without crimping its ability to conduct business. Sales and marketing costs last quarter were in line with year-ago figures even though advertising revenue grew, for instance, while general and administrative spending actually fell 9% from nearly $3.5 billion to less than $3.2 billion this time around. Most of that decrease reflects a reduction in Alphabet's employee headcount.\n\nMore than anything though, investors may want to accept that there's a major payoff in the cards for all the spending on artificial intelligence Alphabet is doing now. As Pichai explained during the company's second-quarter earnings conference call, \"The risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here.\" These investments will not only allow Alphabet to continue building its free, consumer-facing Gemini I platform, but also to continue the development of revenue-bearing AI chatbots and enterprise-specific assistants well into the future.\n\nIt matters simply because this is where artificial intelligence's commercial future lies. Precedence Research predicts the worldwide enterprise AI market will swell from roughly $14.5 billion this year to more than $270 billion by 2032, with prospective customers recognizing its value at the same time developers like Google continue refining their offerings. That's an annualized growth rate of 44%, jibing with Mordor Intelligence's expectation that enterprise AI will drive average annual sales growth of 52% for a similar time frame.\n\nDon't miss what everyone else is looking past\n\nSo why are most investors only looking at Alphabet's second quarter through a bearish lens, and extending a sell-off that was underway well before Tuesday evening's release of its second-quarter numbers? Because the market is fickle, for one, eager to change its mind at the drop of a hat. The broad bearishness that's been brewing for several days may also have something to do with investors' pessimistic moods.\n\nShort-term noise doesn't change long-term reality, though. And the reality here is simply that Alphabet is still a powerhouse, and is still positioned to thrive on its deep leadership of the web-search advertising market. Improvements on the AI front will only cement its leading role on this stage.\n\nIn the meantime cloud computing is rapidly becoming a significant growth engine with an operating margin that could continue to soar before finally catching up with those of Amazon and Microsoft. Only about one-tenth of Google Cloud's second-quarter cloud sales was converted into operating income, for perspective, versus 37% for Amazon Web Services and a similar figure for Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud arm (including Azure). This prospect doesn't appear to be factored into Alphabet stock's present price at all.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- It’s set to be a big week for markets with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan all set to hold policy meetings. Also in the spotlight will be Friday’s U.S. jobs report and more big tech earnings results. Here's your look at what's happening in markets for the week ahead.\n\nFed decision\n\nWith markets currently pricing in an 88% chance of a September rate cut amid signs of cooling inflation and an uptick in the unemployment rate this week’s policy statement by Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be firmly in the spotlight.\n\nThe Fed, which concludes its July policy meeting on Wednesday, has said it wants to be confident inflation is moving sustainably towards its 2% target before cutting interest rates.\n\nInflation data on Friday underscored expectations for the U.S. central bank to set the stage for a September rate cut this week.\n\nThe Fed has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range since last July. It has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points since 2022.\n\nNonfarm payrolls\n\nWednesday’s Fed statement will put the already closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, due out on Friday, under heightened scrutiny as investors try to gauge whether recent signs of cooling in the labor market continued in July.\n\nEconomists are expecting the U.S. economy to have created 177,000 jobs in July, moderating from 206,000 in the prior month.\n\nThe unemployment rate, which has ticked higher in each of the past three months, is expected to hold steady at 4.1%.\n\nAhead of Friday’s report the U.S. will release data on JOLTS job openings on Tuesday.\n\nBig tech earnings continue\n\nBig Tech earnings are set to continue in the coming days and any disappointments could potentially further roil markets already on edge amid worries over stretched stock valuations.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday, followed by Facebook-parent Meta (NASDAQ:META) on Wednesday and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday.\n\nDisappointing numbers could re-ignite the worries that caused a bruising selloff in U.S. stocks on Wednesday, when both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their worst day since late 2022.\n\nThe huge run-up in tech stocks may have set a high bar for their results. Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) whose earnings were one of the triggers for the selloff, actually reported better-than-expected revenue, but investors grew wary that rising spending on AI infrastructure could squeeze margins, sending shares 5% lower.\n\nBank of England meeting\n\nThe BoE meets on Thursday with investors divided over whether policymakers will deliver their first rate cut since 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe level of uncertainty is higher than usual in the run-up to the meeting as key central bank officials have not spoken publicly for over two months due to rules in the lead up to Britain’s July 4's general election.\n\nInvestors have been left guessing whether recent higher-than-expected service price inflation is enough to prevent the BoE cutting rates from their 16-year high of 5.25%.\n\nLast month, the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to keep rates on hold, but minutes of the decision recorded that it had been a \"finely balanced\" decision for some of the policymakers who had not voted for a cut.\n\nBank of Japan decision\n\nThe BOJ concludes its latest policy setting meeting on Wednesday and speculation over the prospect of a rate hike is mounting after high-profile politicians, including the prime minister, hinted at the need for near-term policy normalisation.\n\nThe impact of the weak yen on household and business spending appears to be turning the exchange rate into a central issue for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's leadership convention in September.\n\nThe fact that the currency has rebounded by a staggering 10 yen per dollar from three-decade lows at the start of the month hasn't deterred some from predicting a July hike.\n\nThey argue the BOJ can get the most bang for its buck by hiking into a rallying yen. Others worry a fragile economy and weak consumer sentiment couldn't weather higher borrowing costs, with slowing U.S. growth set to have a knock-on effect already.\n\n--Reuters contributed to this report\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTop 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead\n\nAustralia signs $1.4 billion deal to upgrade navy submarines\n\nBeing boring key to central bank success says SNB's Jordan\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence tools can help “improve the lives” of UK workers and boost the economy, the managing director of Google UK and Ireland has said.\n\nDebbie Weinstein said the company’s research has shown there is a “£400 billion economic opportunity for the UK by 2030” if AI tools are correctly used to help workers with daily tasks.\n\nSome concerns have been raised about the potential for generative AI tools to disrupt the jobs market and replace some humans in work, particularly in administrative tasks, but the Google UK executive said the tech giant – which is one of the leaders in AI – wanted to upskill workers so that AI was used by many to support them in their work, not replace them.\n\nGoogle has recently published research with think tank Public First which found that nearly two-thirds of jobs across the UK could be enhanced or improved by the use of AI, with every sector impacted in some way.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“The world has clearly been captivated by AI over the last year and we’re incredibly excited by the extraordinary breakthroughs that it’s going to enable, but also the everyday improvements in people’s lives,” Ms Weinstein told the PA news agency.\n\n“What this research really unpacks is this idea that not only is there this big economic opportunity for the country, but actually it’s an opportunity to improve the working lives of millions of British people.\n\n“When I think about my own use of how these tools are improving my life and I think about the way it’s helping me compose emails or summarise notes for meetings or even research particular topics, it’s really been an unlock in terms of not just productivity, but frankly, my enjoyment and fulfilment in my work.\n\n“So then we think about how do we translate that into potential for everyone? I think that’s what we get really excited about.”\n\nAlongside the research, the technology giant has announced plans to launch a range of pilot schemes to find different ways workers can improve their digital skills, as well as overcome any habit or trust issues which prevent some people from using AI.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We have about a decade-long history, at Google, of doing digital skills training – where we trained about a million Brits … and I’d say where we are today is we can play a similar role with AI,” Ms Weinstein said.\n\n“The goal really is to develop some insights and best practices that we can then scale through businesses, through policymakers but also through Government.\n\n“Ultimately, what I would say success looks like is that there’s millions of British people that have more satisfaction with their working lives, and at the same time we’re able to unlock this £400 billion of productivity and growth for the UK.”",

        "title": "Earnings Derail Stock Rally Over Doubts on AI, Consumer Strength",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The latest earnings reports are fanning two worries that were already gnawing away at the US stock market: That the euphoria about artificial intelligence had run too far and that — at some point — consumers spending will start to stall.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Risks Losing Voters He Needs With Loaded Attacks on Harris Paris Sticks to Olympics Opening Event Plans After Rail Sabotage JD Vance’s ‘Cat Ladies’ Insult Sparks Criticism of Trump’s VP Pick Kamala Harris Narrows Gap With Trump in Polls From Her First Week Fed’s Favored Price Gauge Rises at Mild Pace, Spending Holds Up\n\nWhile profits overall are still expanding at a solid pace and banks’ earnings have continued to swell, those concerns have derailed a stock-market rally that until this month kept pushing major indexes to fresh record highs.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 Index slid 2.6% in its third straight weekly loss after Alphabet Inc.’s results stoked a broader concern about how long it will take for investments in artificial intelligence to pay off. At the same time, updates from Southwest Airlines Co., United Parcel Service Inc., Whirlpool Corp. stoked worries about a potential pullback by consumers.\n\nThat’s heightened the stakes as earnings continue to roll out next week, including those from the tech bellwethers Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.\n\n“The setup for the next week is the bar is as high as it’s ever been and the headwinds are as strong as they’ve ever been,” said Max Gokhman, senior vice president at Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions.\n\nThe sentiment is a shift from what held sway during much of this year, when optimism about soft landing in the economy and investor obsession with all things artificial intelligence pushed the S&P 500 into 38 records.\n\nThe direction of the economy has remained well intact, with recent data showing solid economic growth and easing inflationary pressure. That bolstered bets that the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates sooner than expected, fueling gains in small-cap stocks that generally have a higher debt burden.\n\nTo be sure, there have been plenty of bright spots in the earnings picture. About 69% of companies in the S&P 500 that have already posted their results reported higher per-share earnings than a year ago, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence as of Friday morning show. And banks surpassed the sell-side’s expectations, while a profit squeeze for industrial companies may be coming to an end.\n\nMoreover, those that posted disappointing figures have generally not been severely punished, at least so far. Companies in the S&P 500 that have trailed projections on both earnings per share and sales have underperformed the broader S&P 500 Index by an average of 1.6% within a day of reporting, the least since 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nBanks surpassed the sell-side’s expectations, and a profit squeeze for industrial companies may be coming to an end.\n\nBut the scale of the market’s run up this year has left some investors wary, particularly when it comes to the big technology companies. With Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon.com Inc. all investing heavily in the promise of artificial intelligence technology, investors are increasingly questioning how much it will pay off.\n\nThe Google parent reported sales and cloud revenue that beat expectations. At the same time, capital spending rose to $13.2 billion in the second quarter, exceeding Wall Street’s estimates.\n\n“It really feels like we are moving from a ‘tell me’ story on AI to a ‘show me’ story,” said Ohsung Kwon, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Corp. “We are basically at a point where we’re not seeing much evidence of AI monetization yet.”\n\nWith weeks still to go before major US retailers roll out their earnings, early reports have indicated consumers are continuing to feel the pinch of high interest rates and still elevated inflation, particularly in the low-income category. Second quarter EPS growth in both consumer staples and consumer discretionary sectors is sitting at the lowest level in two years.\n\nWhirlpool lowered its full-year earnings forecast, as consumers continued to shy away from big-ticket appliance purchases amid a weakening housing market. Shares of a frozen potato supplier Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. sank by the most on record on Wednesday as earnings and guidance missed analysts’ expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines Group Inc. and UPS trimmed earnings forecasts for the year. United Airlines Holdings Inc.’ EPS came ahead of consensus estimates, but the carrier said profit expectations for the third quarter would fall short of Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nMatt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. said the UPS and airline results raise “concerns about how strong the economy is.”\n\n“And if people are shipping less,” he said, “then it tells a lot about weakness in trade.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Miseducation of America’s Nurse Practitioners Joe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy’s New Kingmaker The $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Disney Bets on Deadpool, Wolverine and Dirty Jokes to Save Marvel The US Economy Is Slowing, Which Is Just Fine With the Fed\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG): Are Hedge Funds Bullish on This Edge Computing Stock Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Edge Computing Market Size and 7 Best Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other edge computing stocks.\n\nWhat is Edge Computing?\n\nThe information technology sector has consistently outperformed investor and analyst expectations in 2023, and this trend appears to be continuing into the current year. This impressive performance can largely be attributed to significant advancements such as the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI, which have driven tech stock prices to unprecedented highs. Of course, AI is not the only area that is revolutionizing the technology space. Edge Computing comes in as another compelling area of growth and investment. Also known as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) or Multi-Access Edge Computing, Edge Computing focuses on bringing computing power closer to where data is generated, rather than relying on a centralized cloud-based system. In layman's terms, Edge Computing involves relocating part of the storage and computing capabilities from a central data center to locations near the data sources.\n\nBy keeping computational capacity close to users, devices, or data sources, edge solutions offer benefits such as reduced latency, increased bandwidth, local device processing, and data offloading. For instance, smart speakers perform minimal computational work, sending requests to servers owned by the provider. With Edge Computing, smart speakers could process a user’s request entirely on the device itself. Gartner, in its March 2024 Market Guide for Edge Computing, states:\n\n“By placing data, data management capabilities and analytic workloads at optimal points, ranging all the way to endpoint devices, enterprises can enable more real-time use cases. In addition, the flexibility to move data management workloads up and down the continuum from centralized data centers or from the cloud-to-edge devices will enable greater optimization of resources.”\n\nEdge Computing with the Internet-of-Things & Artificial Intelligence\n\nThe automotive industry is a prime example of rapid advancements driven by edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI) integration in recent years. As vehicles evolve to incorporate self-driving capabilities, these technologies have become essential for effective decision-making and real-time responses. For instance, Tesla leverages extensive real-world driving data to refine its AI algorithms for autonomous driving. The rollout of EV maker's Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software to more drivers highlights its performance in real-world conditions, with the vast amount of visual data collected during these drives enhancing the company's AI learning process.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the advent and adoption of 5G, the fifth generation of cellular network technologies offering substantially greater bandwidth, is accelerating the growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and facilitating the widespread adoption of edge computing. With 5G networks enabling lightning-fast speeds and a greater number of connected devices, data volumes are expected to surge. Predictions state that by 2025, every connected person will interact with digital data at least once every 18 seconds, largely due to the billions of IoT devices projected to generate over 90 zettabytes of data by then.\n\nEdge Computing Market to Reach $217 Billion by 2032\n\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global edge computing market was valued at $15.96 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from $21.41 billion in 2024 to $216.76 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate of 33.6% over the forecast period. This growth is fueled by the increasing adoption of edge devices, ranging from IoT devices such as mobile point-of-sale kiosks and smart cameras to computational infrastructure that enables faster and real-time data analysis at the source. On the other hand, PwC projects that the global market for edge data centers will nearly triple, growing from $4 billion in 2017 to $13.5 billion this year. This expansion is driven by the potential of locally situated data centers to reduce latency, manage intermittent connections, and facilitate data storage and computation close to end-users.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best edge computing stocks to buy now.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best edge computing stocks, We began by sifting through ETFs' holdings and online rankings to gather a preliminary list of 15 stocks. We then scanned Insider Monkey’s first-quarter database which tracks 920 elite money managers and selected the top seven that were the most widely held by hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 166\n\nIn the realm of edge computing, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) Edge component is a secure, high-performance device managed by Google Cloud and designed for edge locations. It provides local storage, machine learning inference, data transformation, and export capabilities. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) targets this component at enterprises in industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, healthcare, and automotive, which require low-latency and high-throughput solutions. The company ranks as one of the best edge computing stocks in this regard.\n\nInsider Monkey’s first-quarter data shows that 165 hedge funds were bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), compared to 166 in the previous quarter. The largest stakeholder is Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management, holding 46.3 million shares valued at $6.99 billion.\n\nOn April 25, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s chief executive Sundar Pichai announced that YouTube and Google's cloud business are expected to achieve a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion by the end of 2024, highlighting significant revenue sources for the search giant. YouTube alone reported $8.1 billion in ad sales for the first quarter ending March 31, marking its highest Q1 revenue to date, up 21% year-over-year from $6.7 billion in Q1 2023.\n\nAdditionally, Bank of America's industry checks in the search engine market recently revealed that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) remains the market leader with a dominant 95% share, while Bing's search holds just 0.7%.\n\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its  2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of the best edge computing stocks to buy. You can visit Edge Computing Market Size and 7 Best Stocks To Buyto see the other edge computing stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Breaking Down Magnificent 7 Earnings",
        "content": "Market participants showed their disappointment with last Tuesday's results from two of ‘The Magnificent 7’ stocks: Google parent Alphabet GOOGL and Tesla TSLA.\n\nThe worrisome aspect of the market reaction to these two reports, particularly to the Alphabet release, is that this could be a precursor of what to expect this week from four other members of the group – Microsoft MSFT on Tuesday, July 30th, after the market’s close (AMC), Meta Platforms META on Wednesday AMC, July 31st, Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL on Thursday AMC, August 1st.\n\nIt is hard to say anything positive about the Tesla report, but the Alphabet report had a lot of positives. Unlike Tesla, which missed consensus estimates on the back to continued margin pressures, Alphabet beat estimates and had a number of other positives in its results, including search and cloud.\n\nInvestors instead zeroed in on the bigger-than-expected capital expenditure figure, which fed into creeping worries about ever-rising AI-centric capex without a timeline for when the spending will start to pay off. Alphabet management’s comment on the capex question that underinvesting represented a bigger risk than the alternative likely added to the market’s worries. A bigger jump in search growth that could be attributed to the company’s AI investments would have eased some of those worries, but that was not the case.\n\nThe capex will likely be front and center in this week’s Meta and Microsoft reports as well. Concerning Amazon, a leader in the cloud space through its Amazon Web Services business, there are questions about the business’ decelerating growth trend in recent quarters when Microsoft and Alphabet are showing accelerating growth trends.\n\nApple has started making some AI announcements lately, but many in the market appear skeptical of its efforts. The more significant near-term Apple questions are about the evolving iPhone trends in China.\n\nReturning to the Alphabet and Tesla results, Alphabet’s earnings were up +28.6% from the same period last year on +15% higher revenues. Tesla’s Q2 earnings were down -45.3% on +2.3% higher revenues.\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the ‘Mag 7’ stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +26.8% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.7% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group’s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +16.8% from the same period last year on +9.5% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the sector’s Q2 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming four periods.

Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks leading the rising estimates trend.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, July 26th, we have seen Q2 results from 207 S&P 500 members, or 41.4% of the index’s membership. Total earnings for these 207 index members are up +0.6% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues, with 79.7% beating EPS estimates and only 57.5% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nThe Q2 reporting cycle really ramps up this week, with more than 1000 companies on deck to report results, including 170 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 stocks, this week’s line-up includes a representative cross-section of reports from different sectors, including bellwethers like McDonald’s, Proctor & Gamble, Pfizer, Starbucks, Mastercard, Boeing, DuPont, Exxon, Chevron, and others.\n\nThe comparisons charts below put the earnings and revenue beats percentages for these companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low level of Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentage of 57.5% is a new low for this group of 207 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these 207 companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6.9% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the year-over-year earnings and revenue growth for 2024 Q2 in the context of what we saw in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the following three periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we have been flagging all along in this space, we experienced a notably favorable revisions trend ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season, with estimates for Q2 holding up far better than other recent periods. In the three-month period from the start of the quarter through June 30th, Q2 estimates for the S&P 500 index fell the least relative to the comparable periods of other recent quarters.\n\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.7% on +1.7% revenue growth.\n\nThe expected revenue growth pace improves to +4% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +8.4% on an ex-Finance basis.

        "title": "Time to Buy the Dip on Alphabet Following Earnings?",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) reported earnings Tuesday and beat analysts’ estimates on both the top and bottom line, yet the stock is rolling over. Is it time to get out of the stock? I think not, and rather it be a fantastic buying opportunity.\n\nThere are two primary reasons for Alphabet's sell-off following its recent earnings report, both of which I believe are temporary. First, the overall market weakness is weighing on the stock. Second, there are concerns about whether the significant capital expenditures on AI infrastructure will generate sufficient near-term profits.\n\nWhile the concerns are reasonable, Alphabet is such a sturdy asset, that I believe you can overlook any near-term concerns as the long-term still looks so fruitful for the company.\n\nBut what is especially compelling is that GOOGL is trading at a relatively discounted valuation, while business fundamentals are strong, and the company enters exciting new technological ventures.\n\nFor investors who are keen on buying leading technology stocks at a discount, Alphabet may be the next addition to your portfolio. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nEarnings Beat but the Alphabet Stock Falls\n\nAlphabet has reported a solid second quarter for 2024, showcasing strong performance across its key segments and continued innovation in artificial intelligence. The company's results underline its robust financial health and strategic investments in AI and cloud infrastructure.\n\nAlphabet delivered revenues of $85 billion, marking a 14% year-on-year increase. This growth was driven by strong performance in Search and Cloud services. The Cloud segment achieved quarterly revenues exceeding $10 billion for the first time, alongside a notable $1 billion in operating profit.\n\nSearch revenues reached $48.5 billion, growing 13.8% year-over-year while Cloud revenues saw a slight acceleration, growing 28.8% to $10.4 billion. AI is playing a pivotal role here, with the majority of Alphabet's top 100 customers utilizing AI-driven services.\n\nAdditionally, seeing a reacceleration of the core search business is a fantastic development as many investors had begun to doubt it.\n\nFurthermore, notes about the development at Waymo are very encouraging and has to potential to open another massive business opportunity for Alphabet.\n\nHuge Potential in Autonomous Driving\n\nAlphabet announced that they would be committing another $5 billion to expansion at Waymo, and I think investors are still underestimating the incredible potential here.\n\nWaymo has made significant strides, delivering over 50,000 paid rides per week across San Francisco and Phoenix. But most importantly, Waymo has focused on optimizing its service for profitability and scalability, making strategic decisions that enhance its configurability across various vehicle types and conditions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is a very different approach than Tesla (TSLA) is taking, as Alphabet believes providing the underlying technology will be a superior business model and is similar to the way GOOGL influences the mobile computing industry with Android. They make no devices but are the most widely used mobile software in the world.\n\nWaymo is also taking a bottom’s up approach, developing its own sensors so to control the whole tech stack. Alternatively, Tesla relies solely on camera-based vision and must manage all the additional logistics of producing a full vehicle. The longer it takes Tesla to get full self-driving to actually work, the more I am favoring Waymo in leading the industry.\n\nAlphabet Stock Trading at a Discount\n\nAs noted, Alphabet is trading at a valuation that I consider to be appealing for long-term investors. Today, GOOGL is trading at 22x forward earnings, which is below its 10-year median of 26.1x and below the market average.\n\nBecause I believe Alphabet is among the best companies in the world, I think it unreasonable that it trades in line with the average of the index. With continued strong performance across business segments, and some incredible growth catalysts, I think Alphabet is compelling at current levels. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nDespite Alphabet's recent post-earnings dip, this may be an opportune moment for investors to buy the stock.\n\nAlphabet's second-quarter earnings report showed strong performance across key segments, with impressive growth in Search and Cloud services. The company continues to lead in AI-driven innovations, reinforcing its competitive edge. Additionally, the significant investment in Waymo highlights Alphabet's potential in the autonomous driving market, offering another promising growth avenue.\n\nAt its current valuation, Alphabet presents an attractive opportunity for long-term investors. For investors seeking to capitalize on a leading technology stock at a discount, Alphabet is a compelling choice.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Amazon Tests AI Chips in Texas Lab, Aims to Cut Nvidia Costs\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is making significant strides in artificial intelligence with its homegrown AI chips.\n\nIn its Austin, Texas, chip lab, Amazon engineers are rigorously testing a new server design that features these AI chips, aiming to reduce reliance on Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) costly chips, Reuters reports.\n\nAmazon’s efforts align with similar initiatives by rivals Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nHere’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share. Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nRami Sinno, director of engineering for Amazon’s Annapurna Labs, highlighted the growing customer demand for more affordable alternatives to Nvidia. Annapurna Labs, acquired by Amazon in 2015, is integral to this development.\n\nTrending:Don’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\nAmazon has been developing its Graviton chips, which perform non-AI computing tasks, for nearly a decade. The latest AI chips, Trainium and Inferentia, offer significant cost savings.\n\n“The offering of up to 40%, 50% in some cases of improved price and performance means it should be half as expensive as running that same model with Nvidia,” said David Brown, Vice President of Compute and Networking at AWS, according to Reuters.\n\nSales at AWS, which accounts for almost 20% of Amazon’s total revenue, grew by 17% to $25 billion in the January-March quarter compared to the previous year. AWS holds approximately one-third of the cloud computing market, with Microsoft’s Azure at about 25%.\n\nSee Also: America's construction sites are desperate for Robots — here’s how to invest in a house-printing startup who’s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry.\n\nAnalysts view Nvidia as the primary beneficiary in the AI sector. Mizuho Securities reports that Nvidia controls 70% to 95% of the market share for artificial intelligence accelerators.\n\nThe Big Tech trio—Google, Microsoft, and Amazon—along with Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL)—contribute more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue.\n\nAmazon stock gained over 40% in the last 12 months, reaching a market cap of $1.87 trillion. Nvidia stock surged over 147% in the last 12 months and currently has a market cap of $2.76 trillion. Investors can gain exposure to the stocks through SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).\n\nPrice Action: AMZN shares traded higher by 1.47% at $182.50 premarket at the last check on Friday Morning.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\nWhen today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out.

        "title": "Google to blame for slower YouTube speeds in Russia, says senior lawmaker",
        "content": "(Reuters) - YouTube speeds in Russia are set to sharply decline on desktop computers due Google's failure to upgrade its equipment in Russia and its refusal to unblock channels of Russian media, a senior lawmaker close to the authorities said on Friday.\n\nRussia has criticised Alphabet's Google for taking down YouTube channels of Russian media and public figures and fined the U.S. company several times for failing to remove content Russia considers illegal or undesirable.\n\nAlexander Khinshtein, head of the lower house of parliament's information policy committee, on Thursday said slower speeds on the video hosting site was a forced step directed against YouTube for believing it could violate Russian law without punishment.\n\nWriting on Telegram on Friday, Khinshtein sought to clarify those comments, and his claim that YouTube download speeds in Russia were down 40% and set to drop next week by up to 70%.\n\n\"This is primarily due to the actions (or rather inaction) of YouTube itself,\" Khinshtein said.\n\nCommunications regulator Roskomnadzor said YouTube's quality was declining as Google had not upgraded its Google Global Cache servers in Russia.\n\nKhinshtein also said Google had not invested in Russian infrastructure and allowed its local subsidiary to go bankrupt, thereby preventing it from paying for local data centre services.\n\nGoogle did not respond to a request for comment on those accusations.\n\nYouTube blocked access around the world to channels associated with Russian state-funded media in March 2022, citing a policy barring content that denies, minimises or trivializes well-documented violent events. It said Russia's invasion of Ukraine fell under its violent events policy and violating material would be removed.\n\nGoogle's Russian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy later that year, saying that the seizure of its bank account by Russian authorities had made it untenable for its Russia office to function, including paying Russia-based employees, suppliers and vendors.\n\nRussia has blocked and slowed down other social media, restrictions that many Russians circumvent using virtual private networks (VPNs). Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov on Friday proposed blocking YouTube outright.\n\nMoscow's biggest gripe, Khinshtein said, was YouTube's \"openly anti-Russian policy\" and its refusal to unblock Russian channels, as demanded by Roskomnadzor.\n\n(Reporting by Alexander Marrow in London; Editing by David Evans)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why stocks could be nearing a 10% correction",
        "content": "They say what goes up must come down, but if you’re the current stock market, coming down has taken a wild turn that may be on the cusp of straightening out.\n\n“We think this is the time for consolidation of the gains,” Morgan Stanley's closely-watched chief investment officer Mike Wilson told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen here).\n\nWilson believes stocks are headed for a 10% correction in the third quarter, on the back of thin summer trading volume and yawning worries about the presidential election in November.\n\nBy and large, the market has side-stepped correction calls from Wall Street for much of the year.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up 14% year to date amid strong corporate earnings and anticipation of interest rate cuts this fall. The Nasdaq Composite is up 13% this year, powered by AI optimism. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average has clocked in with a respectable 6% advance.\n\nBut cracks are emerging in the bull thesis.\n\nThe Nasdaq has been hit by almost 3% in the last five trading sessions due to valuation concerns, mixed results from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and outright poor earnings figures from Tesla (TSLA).\n\nMarket darling Nvidia (NVDA) has dropped by more than 5% in the past five days, while rival AMD (AMD) has shed around 10%.\n\nOver the past 10 days, the S&P 500 is down about 3%, while the Nasdaq is down more than 6%.\n\nWilson fancies those cracks may spread and weigh further on stocks in the near-term.\n\nHe points to the ISM Manufacturing Index remaining “in contraction territory.” Manufacturing woes is lessening, but services, which is still 70% of the economy, is now weakening \"substantially.”\n\n“Where we are is a late [economic] cycle still,\" Wilson adds.\n\nWith economic growth deteriorating, Wilson notes, stock multiples go up “because of the hope for the Fed to ease policy.” That's an unwelcome backdrop for investors to wade into stocks, Wilson says.\n\nAnd so is the fact the government is spending “gobs of money on fiscal policy to keep things moving along.\"\n\nThe AI sell-off could also rage on, hurting broader market sentiment further.\n\n“We’re believers that AI will lead to productivity increases over time, but expectations got ahead of the timing of this development,” Wilson said.\n\nWilson isn't alone in bearish on the short-term.\n\nVeteran strategist Keith Lerner of Truist says the \"corrective period\" in tech has further to go. He downgraded his views on tech stocks in June.\n\nAdds Lerner, \"This choppier market action of late is consistent with our expectations, and is set to continue. Our base case is that the longer-term bull market remains intact, but it’s often two steps forward, one step back.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled, market-focused conversations and chats with the biggest names in business on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Meta's AI Revolution Begins",
        "content": "Meta Platforms Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) rapid expansion, the fastest since 2021, has been driven by aggressive monetization and deep artificial intelligence integration into its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram.\n\nIts AI-powered recommendations have significantly increased user engagement, with 30% of Facebook posts and 50% of Instagram stories utilizing these systems. This surge in AI use has also boosted ad revenue.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with META.\n\nDespite the premium valuation, the company's strong performance underscores its position as an AI leader, signaling additional upside for the stock.\n\nHow AI-driven monetization doubles Meta's profitability\n\nMeta, which owns some of the most popular social networking apps, recorded year-over-year top-line growth of 27% for the first quarter, coming in at $36.46 billion and topping the Street's estimates of $36.14 billion.\n\nThe company achieved its fastest period of expansion since 2021 on the back of aggressive monetization in its suite of applications and deep integration of AI features into its leading platforms. For example, Facebook reported that 30% of the posts used a certain kind of AI-powered recommendation system. Similarly, AI ensures it keeps 50% of stories on Instagram parallel to users' requirements, enhancing engagement and promoting more advertising campaigns.\n\nThe overall revenue increase was less spectacular. Still, Meta's bottom line effectively doubled, with net income hitting $12.37 billion, or $4.71 a share, versus $5.71 billion, or $2.20 a share, in the prior period. This leap was driven by a 16% reduction in sales and marketing costs, lower restructuring expenses and decreased professional services and marketing use.\n\nAlthough Meta does not report daily and monthly active users for its individual platforms, the company had more than 3.24 billion daily active people across its family of apps, creating strong momentum in which it offers one of the few brand-safe environments where advertisers can spend money to effectively reach this massive user base. Meta's AI Revolution Begins\n\nConsequently, the family average revenue per person declined by 9% quarter over quarter to $36.46 billion; still, the number suggests growth of 18% from the prior year. This describes how Meta monetizes its consumer base and generates revenue.\n\nAdditionally, the 20% increase in ad impressions was primarily driven by Asia-Pacific and the Rest of the World. However, most of this came from Asia-Pacific, where ad impressions grew 28% compared with 16% growth in North America and 20% growth globally. However, this marked a deceleration from the growth of 34% recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, the company witnessed a 6% rise in the average price of ads.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, major Chinese e-tailersfor example, Temu and Sheinimmensely helped to accelerate ad impression in the Asia-Pacific region on Facebook for selling inexpensive products to American and European clients, accounting for approximately 10% of the company's total profit.\n\nMeta Projects strong revenue amid rising costs and AI investments\n\nFor the second quarter, Meta expects revenue in the range of $36.50 billion to $39 billion, offset by a 1% currency headwind. The company expects expenses between $96 billion and $99 billion, up slightly from the impacts of infrastructure and higher legal charges vis-a-vis prior guidance. Operating losses by Reality Labs are expected to balloon because of investments in the development of products and their scale.\n\nThe full-year 2024 capital expenditures guidance has been raised to $35 billion to $40 billion.\n\nThe company also remains vigilant regarding regulatory headwinds in the European Union and the U.S. It was a solid start for the year, with momentum through the Family of Apps and significant progress on AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to change the way people interact for years to come.\n\nAdditionally, generative AI is an inherent part of Meta's investment to create value in the long run. At least one significant player includes Meta, which boasts a vast AI team and robust computing infrastructure. The company has introduced a new model of generative AI technologies called Llama 3, which makes it an active assistant to create means for building new models. Therefore, such integrations of AI enhance targeted advertising, Meta's primary revenue source. AI will make the Facebook, Instagram and Reels interface very engaging to the user by basing personal content around user preferences.\n\nAccording to AI and tech expert Puneet Gogia, AI chat tools for businesses on WhatsApp saw a 40% increase in paid messaging, with potential for ad integration. Enhanced tracking tools like Event Measurement improved ad performance, increasing sales by 9.50% and trackable sales by 20%. Lastly, efficient investments in AI systems, public code sharing and AI chip development strengthened the company's financial stability, positioning it as an AI leader.\n\nAd competition amid AI investments and economic risks\n\nCompetition in digital advertising has to be one of the most significant risks standing in the way of Meta Platforms achieving its desired growth rates. The company does not operate a monopoly in the lucrative field. Still, it faces stiff competition from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which invests heavily in artificial intelligence to strengthen targeted advertising on search and YouTube.\n\nAdditionally, deterioration in the growth prospects of the U.S. economy could also pose significant risks to Meta Platforms' lucrative advertising business. Given that the company generates 98% of its sales from advertising, any economic downturn could be followed by significant cuts in ad spending, which could spell trouble for the company's revenue base. Thus, the company has also warned that it continues to watch the EU and U.S. regulatory landscape, which could impact its business and financial results.\n\nAn over 41% rally year to date has left Meta Platforms trading at a forward price-earnings multiple of 25. Nevertheless, compared to its peers, the stock appears to be trading at a discount, going by the average price-earnings ratio of 31 for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100. Given the double-digit percentage growth in revenue and earnings, it is justifiable for the company to trade at a premium given the solid underlying fundamentals.\n\nThe company is also sitting on a boatload of cash. It ended the first quarter with $12.5 billion in free cash flow, allowing it to aggressively invest in high-growth initiatives, such as augmented and virtual reality devices, the metaverse and AI.\n\nBacked by a solid balance sheet, Meta Platforms has returned value to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. For starters, it repurchased $14.64 billion in shares in the first quarter, reducing its shares in circulation, which is expected to bolster earnings per share in the long run. The company also paid $1.27 billion in dividends for a dividend yield of 0.41%.\n\nBottom line\n\nMeta's direction has been explosive, rallying more than 58% over the past 12 months. The rally was backed by solid underlying fundamentals, including substantial user growth numbers in its family of apps, which drove revenue up 27% in the first quarter. The company is also seeing a better balance between ad impressions and price, which allows it to generate more revenue.\n\nThe company is becoming more efficient and attractive to advertisers by integrating AI tools to enhance advertising campaigns, which affirms its long-term growth prospects. Given the stock is trading at a discount, it remains a solid long-term play amid the AI frenzy, having reiterated its commitment to returning cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – July 26, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nBuy Big Tech/AI Stocks Ahead of Earnings, or Wait?\n\nToday's episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks dives into the wave of selling that sent the Nasdaq tumbling to start the heart of big tech earnings season on Wednesday. The episode then explores Meta Platforms and Amazon stock before their upcoming earnings releases to see if investors should buy the top tech stocks before earnings or wait for more selling.\n\nTechnology stocks and other first-half standouts tanked on Wednesday, sending the Nasdaq below its 50-day moving average for only the second time in 2024.\n\nThe selling came as the busy stretch of technology earnings kicked off after the closing bell on Tuesday, with Alphabet and Tesla.\n\nTech stocks and the market could experience more selling and volatility throughout earnings season, especially since big tech set the bar very high.\n\nThankfully, the tailwinds that sent the stock market soaring in the first half remain in place. Any near-term selling represents a healthy recalibration and an opportunity for investors to buy their favorite stocks at discounts.\n\nThe two stocks we explore today are tech giants and AI investments.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. – Q2 Earnings Wednesday, July 31\n\nMeta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, grew its daily active users by 7% in Q1 to 3.24 billion. Meta grew its ad impressions delivered across its family of apps by 20%.\n\nMeta stands to thrive in a world full of smartphone addicts. Meta is also investing heavily in its AI future. Mark Zuckerberg's goal is for Meta to win the AI race by rolling out open source artificial intelligence.\n\nMeta shares have soared roughly 400% off the market's 2022 lows to blow away Alphabet and plenty of tech giants. The stock has also climbed 520% in the past 10 years vs. the Zacks Tech sector's 310%.\n\nThis context helps Meta's valuation look all the more impressive, with Meta trading at a 63% discount to its highs and 20% below the Zacks Tech sector at 22.4X forward 12-month earnings.\n\nMeta stock has fallen 14% from its early July highs heading into its quarterly earnings release. Meta stock is trading below its 50-day and 21-week moving averages. Meta trades at roughly neutral RSI levels on a 10-year timeframe after hitting its most overbought levels of the last decade earlier this year.\n\nMeta's recent cooldown makes the stock a potentially more appealing long-term buy-and-hold candidate for investors who can weather near-term volatility. It is worth remembering that Meta has a robust balance sheet and began paying a dividend earlier this year as it focuses on efficiency and profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon – Q2 Earnings Thursday, August 1\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy took over roughly three years ago with a mission to boost the bottom line while honing in on expansion in key growth areas.\n\nAmazon remains the king of e-commerce and its advertising unit is booming. AMZN also runs the world's largest cloud-computing business, topping rivals Microsoft and Alphabet, helping it thrive throughout the AI supercycle.\n\nAmazon is also diving headfirst into its AI efforts, with plans to devote more capex on its cloud computing and AI infrastructure than e-commerce going forward.\n\nAmazon's steady cloud computing and AI growth, coupled with its focus on boosting earnings is a winning pitch to Wall Street. Amazon's earnings outlook has soared over the last year for FY24 and FY25 to help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nAmazon stock has skyrocketed 1,000% in the last 10 years vs. Tech's 300%, Apple's 800%, and Alphabet's 480%. Yet Amazon stock is down around 1% in the last three years compared to Tech's 25% run.\n\nAMZN failed to break out meaningfully above its 2021 highs. Amazon is currently trading 10% below its highs and 22% below its average Zacks price target.\n\nAmazon trades around its 21-week moving average and near neutral RSI levels on a 10-year timeframe. On the valuation front, Amazon trades 95% below its highs and at a 50% discount to its 10-year median at 35.1X forward 12-month earnings.\n\nOn top of that, Amazon trades near its lowest forward earnings multiple since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Second-Quarter Results Just Came Out: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting For This Year",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shareholders are probably feeling a little disappointed, since its shares fell 5.9% to US$167 in the week after its latest second-quarter results. Alphabet reported US$85b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.89 beat expectations, being 2.3% higher than what the analysts expected. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\n\nView our latest analysis for Alphabet  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nAfter the latest results, the 49 analysts covering Alphabet are now predicting revenues of US$345.7b in 2024. If met, this would reflect an okay 5.3% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to increase 7.2% to US$7.63. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$347.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$7.57 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.\n\nThe analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$204, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Alphabet analyst has a price target of US$230 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$151. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure.\n\nThese estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Alphabet's past performance and to peers in the same industry. We would highlight that Alphabet's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 11% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 16% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this to the 123 other companies in this industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenue at 10% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it looks like Alphabet is forecast to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$204, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Meta, Apple, Amazon and also UK interest rates",
        "content": "With earnings season in full swing, key companies worldwide will provide insights into sector performance. Investors will be particularly focused on updates from some of the 'Magnificent Seven', which will reveal whether the artificial intelligence (AI) trend continues.\n\nThe Mag 7 stocks have endured a challenging period, with the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) major players – Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Amazon (AMZN) – experiencing a dramatic decline in market capitalisations. Amid a tech rout, these tech giants have collectively shed $1.128tn in market value, marking the largest such loss since May 2022.\n\nWith Tesla failing to impress, will the next earnings reports show strong performance or a lack of momentum? Here’s what to watch for:\n\nMeta (META) – Reports second-quarter results on Wednesday 31 July\n\nMeta Platforms is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, with significant investor attention on advertising revenue performance and updates regarding its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives following the announcement of its latest AI model.\n\nThe parent company of Facebook and Instagram is expected to report revenue of $38.35bn, reflecting a 20% increase compared to the same period last year, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Net income is projected to reach $12.31bn, or $4.71 per share, marking a substantial 58% year-over-year rise.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnalyst estimates for Q2 2024:\n\nRevenue: $38.35bn (Q1 2024: $36.46bn, Q2 2023: $32bn) Diluted Earnings Per Share: $4.71 (Q1 2024: $4.71, Q2 2023: $2.98) Net Income: $12.31bn (Q1 2024: $12.37bn, Q2 2023: $7.79bn)\n\nMeta's second-quarter ad revenue is a critical metric, with Citi analysts predicting a 20.5% growth from the previous year, reaching $37.95bn. This growth is attributed to a stronger advertising environment, increased adoption of Instagram Reels, and new advertising products.\n\nStory continues\n\nA survey conducted by Wedbush analysts revealed that most advertisers plan to either increase or maintain their spending on Meta platforms. This trend is expected to contribute to robust second-quarter results and set a positive trajectory for the company in the latter half of the year.\n\nEarlier this month, Meta introduced its Llama 3.1 open-source AI model. JP Morgan analysts believe this launch could position Meta AI as the leading AI assistant by the end of the year. The upcoming earnings report will provide Meta an opportunity to reassure investors that its increased investments in AI are yielding significant growth opportunities.\n\n“Mark Zuckerberg’s commentary is just as important as the numbers themselves. In today's landscape, throwing cash at AI is the aim of the game, but Meta needs to convince investors there’ll be a worthy return at the end of the road,” Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\nApple (AAPL) — Reports third-quarter results on Thursday 1 August\n\nApple has seen adjustments in stock price targets from several firms ahead of its upcoming fiscal third-quarter earnings report.\n\nJPMorgan has raised its stock price target for Apple to $265 from $245, maintaining an overweight rating on the shares. The firm has set a new year-end 2025 price target, moving away from its prior December 2024 target, as it anticipates investors will begin focusing beyond 2024. JPMorgan expects Apple to instil higher confidence with its forthcoming earnings report.\n\nIts analysts believe that Apple will reassure investors about the upcoming AI replacement cycle, set to commence significantly in fiscal 2025 and intensify into fiscal 2026. They note that Apple is leveraging a stronger launchpad in fiscal 2024, bolstered by better-than-expected revenue drivers from the iPhone and the company as a whole.\n\nThe investment bank has placed Apple shares on \"positive catalyst watch\" ahead of the earnings report, with a favourable outlook on share price performance.\n\nBarclays has also revised its stock price target for Apple, increasing it to $187 from $164, while maintaining an underweight rating on the shares. The firm has raised its forecasts for the September quarter, citing better performance in iPhone, Mac and Services, a trend not seen in several quarters. Barclays now projects a 9% revenue growth for Apple in 2025, following two years of relatively flat performance.\n\nDespite the improved numbers and the potential positive impact of an artificial intelligence-enhanced iPhone on investor sentiment, Barclays remains cautious. The bank points out that Apple's stock is trading at a 30-times price-to-earnings multiple, indicating less upside potential compared to other firms' projections.\n\nApple's AI services will be available starting this fall, but only for the current iPhone 15 Pro model, fuelling hopes for a new iPhone upgrade cycle.\n\nApple is expected to return to top-line growth for the June-ended quarter. The FactSet consensus is for revenue of $84.2bn, up 3% vs. the year-ago quarter. Adjusted profit is expected to rise 6% to $1.34 a share.\n\n“A note of caution stems from competition in China after back-to-back quarters of revenue declines. Investors will be watching closely for how the demand picture is evolving. Despite an overall decline in sales in the region, the flagship iPhone saw growth last quarter. News that the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max were the best-selling smartphones in urban China suggests that Apple's allure remains intact,” Britzman said.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) — Reports second-quarter results on Thursday 1 August\n\nAmazon is under the spotlight as Morgan Stanley projects the e-commerce titan to deliver robust Q2 earnings and provide optimistic guidance for Q3. Analysts at Morgan Stanley forecast that Amazon will exceed consensus estimates for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by 17% for Q2 and 10% for Q3, driven by improved profitability in North American retail and accelerated growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"North America retail profitability and the accelerating growth of AWS are key factors behind our projections,\" Morgan Stanley analysts noted.\n\nAs Amazon leverages its strong retail operations and expands its dominance in cloud computing, investors are optimistic about its financial performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth has also highlighted Amazon as a top pick for both the near and long term. Anmuth forecasts a near-term acceleration in AWS, predicting 20% growth in Q4 2024. This growth is expected to be fuelled by easing optimisations, new workload migrations, and the ramping up of GenAI monetization.\n\nAnmuth also anticipates a 190 basis point expansion in Amazon's North America operating income (OI) margin in 2024, supported by improvements in shipping and inventory placement, increased automation, and stronger advertising revenue. Amazon's free cash flow is expected to reach $66bn in 2024 and $86bn in 2025.\n\nFor Q2, investors are eyeing net sales between $148bn and $150bn, with operating income ranging from $14bn to $15bn or more.\n\n\"There was also a strong showing from both the e-commerce and advertising segments over the first quarter, something investors will be keen to see continue. But markets were a little unhappy with the second quarter profit guidance of $10bn-14bn, anything toward the top end of that range will likely be met with a positive reaction,\" noted Britzman.\n\nBank of England’s interest rate decision – Thursday 1 August\n\nObviously not a stock but one of the biggest market moving decisions in the UK. Traders are increasingly betting on the Bank of England (BoE) cutting interest rates this summer, driven by optimism that the US Federal Reserve is set to reduce borrowing costs.\n\nMoney markets now indicate more than a 50% chance that Bank of England policymakers will lower rates next week, with a 92% likelihood of a cut by September.\n\n“While softer labour market data support the rates market pricing in 12.5 bp (50%) of a 25 bp rate hike at its meeting next week, sticky inflation suggests that rates need to stay higher for longer. However, the case for a rate cut is building and is expected to be a line-ball decision,” analysts at IG said.\n\nEconomists are also confident that the first interest rate cut in over four years will occur next week, according to a Reuters poll. The survey revealed that the vast majority of economists expect the BoE to reduce interest rates at their August meeting.\n\nIf the forecast is accurate, borrowing costs will decrease as the central bank-controlled interest rate drops to 5%. The current rate stands at a 16-year high of 5.25% after 14 consecutive hikes. The Reuters poll, conducted between July 18 and 24, showed that over 80% of economists (49 out of 60) anticipate the BoE will implement the rate cut.\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer Stock Is Plummeting This Week",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock is sinking in this week's trading. The high-performance server specialist's share price was down 12.7% from last week's close heading into this Friday's market opening, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nTech stocks continued to pull back this week as investors assessed risks related to geopolitical dynamics between the U.S., China, and Taiwan. Sell-offs intensified after Alphabet and Tesla published second-quarter reports that worried Wall Street. (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nWhile there wasn't any business-specific news dragging Supermicro lower, the company's valuation is getting hit in a pullback that's impacting the broader market and having a particularly pronounced impact on otherwise high-flying artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. The timing of the server specialist's addition to the Nasdaq-100 index also didn't help the stock this week.\n\nBearish ripple effects from earnings season hit Supermicro\n\nIn addition to geopolitical risk factors continuing to pressure growth stocks, earnings season has gotten off to a shaky start for the technology sector. Alphabet and Tesla reported Q2 earnings after the market closed on Tuesday, becoming the first of the highly influential \"Magnificent Seven\" companies to publish updated financial results. Unfortunately, Wall Street considered both reports to be duds -- and the disappointment created ripple effects that extended to Supermicro and other AI stocks.\n\nAlphabet posted per-share earnings of $1.89 on revenue of $84.74 billion, which actually came in better than the average Wall Street target's call for per-share earnings of $$1.85 on sales of $84.29 billion. But the company guided for higher costs and weaker operating income margins in Q3, and investors adopted a more bearish stance in response.\n\nTesla's quarterly report was significantly more concerning. While Q2 revenue of $25.5 billion topped the average analyst estimate by $760 million, non-GAAP (adjusted) per-share earnings of $0.52 fell short of the market's target by $0.10 per share. Comments from management about the business's near-term outlook and spending plans also worried investors.\n\nJoining the Nasdaq-100 index didn't boost Supermicro stock this week\n\nSuper Micro Computer was added to the Nasdaq-100 on July 22, and the timing of the addition may also be playing a role in this week's sell-offs. While being added to major indexes is often a bullish catalyst because it causes exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to buy the stock, it's actually a negative catalyst when the underlying index level and corresponding ETF prices are dropping. For reference, the Nasdaq-100 index has fallen roughly 4.5% over the last week of trading.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors who are eager for the next major, business-specific updates that could Supermicro's stock price won't have to wait long.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Open artificial intelligence models that allow developers to customize them with few restrictions are more likely to promote competition, Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan said, weighing in on a key debate within the industry.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Risks Losing Voters He Needs With Loaded Attacks on Harris Harris Just Showed Why Trump Is So Afraid of Her Stocks Caught in Tug of War Between Tech and Rest: Markets Wrap Markets Tear Up Popular Trades That Reached ‘Stupid Levels’ I Changed My Mind. The Fed Needs to Cut Rates Now.\n\n“There’s tremendous potential for open-weight models to promote competition,” Khan said Thursday in San Francisco at startup incubator Y Combinator. “Open-weight models can liberate startups from the arbitrary whims of closed developers and cloud gatekeepers.”\n\n“Open-weight” models disclose what an AI model picked up and was tweaked on during its training process. That allows developers to better customize them and makes them more accessible to smaller companies and researchers. But critics have warned that open models carry an increased risk of abuse and could potentially allow companies from geopolitical rivals like China to piggyback off the technology.\n\nKhan’s comments come as the Biden administration is considering guidance on the use and safety of open-weight models. In February, the Commerce Department sought public comments on the risks associated with that approach.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. and France’s Mistral AI have focused on releasing open-weight models, while other AI pioneers like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and OpenAI have closed models where the underlying source code and data aren’t public. The Facebook parent this week released a new model, called Llama 3.1, along with an open-access strategy that allows the technology to be used by the public for free, so long as they adhere to the company’s “acceptable use policy.”\n\nThe FTC, which enforces both antitrust and consumer protection laws, has a number of ongoing inquiries into AI, including an antitrust investigation into Microsoft Corp. over its relationship with OpenAI and its hiring of staff from Inflection AI. In March, the Redmond, Washington-based software giant agreed to pay the startup $650 million to license its AI software and hired much of Inflection’s staff.\n\nKhan didn’t comment on the probes but said that the agency has heard complaints about dominant companies “monopolizing access to great talent, to critical inputs and to valuable data.”\n\n“The FTC is doing our part to be vigilant and to open up the market,” she said.\n\nStory continues\n\n--With assistance from Rachel Metz.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Miseducation of America’s Nurse Practitioners The $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Joe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy’s New Kingmaker The US Economy Is Slowing, Which Is Just Fine With the Fed Elon Musk Goes All In for Trump\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "OpenAI’s new SearchGPT takes aim at Google, Perplexity in the battle for AI search dominance. But will it win the war?",
        "content": "OpenAI’s launch of an AI search engine on Thursday was a big warning shot in its war to challenge Google's dominance and drive out AI search upstarts like Perplexity.\n\nSearchGPT, as OpenAI's search engine is called, aims to provide “fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources,” featuring real-time, up-to-date responses, OpenAI said. While currently just a prototype that's available to 10,000 users, it’s clear the battle over AI search is on.\n\nSo far, at least, the quest for AI search dominance has been like trench warfare—slow and difficult to advance. Take Microsoft, for example: On February 7, 2023, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that the “race starts today” in search, with a reimagined Bing search engine powered OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT.\n\nGoogle, in response, quickly rolled out a competitor called Bard, later renamed Gemini, and then used Gemini's answers to supplement its traditional search links. But those so-called AI overviews ended up being so widely criticized for their \"hallucinations,\" or incorrect or bizarre answers, (including suggesting “putting glue on pizza\") that Google has reduced the frequency that they appear, from a high of 84% of queries down to less than 15% in June. And experts, including Abeba Birhane, senior advisor, AI accountability at Mozilla, have made clear that there may be no reliable way to get rid of AI \"hallucinations\" altogether.\n\nAlso scrambling for AI search market share are startups like Perplexity, which debuted in 2022 with a goal to unseat Google with what it claimed were highly-accurate results. But the company, which has raised $165 million in funding at an over $1 billion valuation, has hit serious turbulence. Last month, Forbes accused Perplexity of copyright infringement for scraping its online articles without permission to feed its AI, while magazine publisher Conde Nast followed with a cease and desist letter against Perplexity just a couple of days ago. Perplexity's CEO Arvind Srinivas responded to the Forbes accusation by saying the new product feature had \"rough edges, and we are improving it with more feedback.\"\n\nBut, as has been widely reported, for months OpenAI has been trying to play nice with certain media companies by licensing their content for search results and to feed their content into ChatGPT, instead of scraping it without permission. The partners include The Atlantic, Vox Media and News Corp.\n\nNicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic, is quoted in OpenAI’s blog post about SearchGPT's premiere on Thursday as praising the arrangement. “AI search is going to become one of the key ways that people navigate the internet, and it's crucial, in these early days, that the technology is built in a way that values, respects, and protects journalism and publishers,” he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a sign of the high stakes in the search wars, Google’s stock tumbled Thursday afternoon within minutes of OpenAI making its much-expected foray into search. Google's shares ended the day down 3% at $169.16.\n\nBut does Google's blip mean the AI search wars are already won—or lost, depending on the perspective? Not at all.\n\nAs of June, after more than a year and a half of assaults on its core search business, Google still enjoyed a global market share of over 90%, as if there is no war. Meanwhile, Microsoft's Bing has a woeful 3.7% and Perplexity's is too low to be measured.\n\nIf OpenAI wants to gain ground, it will need to slowly claw its way through the trenches. And as for its buzzy ChatGPT assistant—its traffic is reportedly down from its April 2024 peak of 1.8 billion visits.\n\nSo OpenAI may score points for its new approach to search, focusing on publisher partnerships that offer more friendly and real-time sourcing of information for its search. But it remains to be seen whether it will win the AI search war, which is just starting to ramp up and will likely rage for years.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Thursday as heavyweight technology stocks appeared to be easing from bruising losses in recent sessions, with focus turning to key upcoming inflation data.\n\nFutures rose after Wall Street endured another mostly negative session, following some disappointing major tech earnings earlier this week. But the pace of losses in tech stocks now appeared to be slowing.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.3% to 5,456.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 19,049.0 points by 20:16 ET (00:16 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 40,284.0 points.\n\nTech steadies in after-hours trade after bruising losses\n\nHeavyweight technology stocks steadied in after-hours trading after logging steep losses over the past week. Selling in tech intensified this week following underwhelming earnings from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), with the latter potentially setting a precedent for earnings from other internet giants.\n\nTesla, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) all moved in a tight range. But Alphabet saw extended losses after OpenAI unveiled an artificial intelligence search engine aimed to compete directly with Google.\n\nTech earnings are set to continue in the coming week, with Microsoft and Apple due on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. Prints from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) are also due next week.\n\nBut a sustained rout in tech saw the NASDAQ Composite close down 0.9% at 17,181.72 on Thursday- its weakest level since early-June. The S&P 500 fell 0.5% to an over one-month low of 5,399.22 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% to 39,935.07 points, benefiting from some defensive buying.\n\nPCE inflation data on tap\n\nSelling in tech was also driven by increased expectations for interest rate cuts, which saw investors lock profits in the sector and pivot into stocks with more exposure to an economic recovery.\n\nPCE price index data due later on Friday is set to provide more cues on the rates front. The reading is the preferred inflation of the Federal Reserve, and is likely to factor into the central bank’s stance on interest rates.\n\nThe reading comes just days before a Fed meeting next week. The central bank is widely expected to keep rates steady, while investors will be watching for any cues on when it plans to begin cutting rates.\n\nGeneral consensus is for a 25 basis point cut in September.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise as tech rout pauses; PCE data awaited\n\nStory continues\n\nJuniper Networks Falls on Earnings Miss, Q2 Revenue Down 17% YoY\n\nEarnings call: Ameriprise Financial boasts record revenues of $4.2 billion\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Kenrick Cai\n\nAlphabet's Google unveiled a pair of artificial intelligence systems on Thursday that demonstrated advances in solving complex mathematical problems, a key frontier of generative AI development.\n\nThe current class of AI models, which work by statistically predicting the next word, have struggled with abstract math, which requires greater reasoning capabilities resembling human intelligence.\n\nDeepMind, the company's AI unit, published results showing that its new AI models in development, called AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2, solved four out of six questions at the 2024 International Math Olympiad, a prominent competition for high school students.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGoogle said in a blog post that one question was solved within minutes, but others took up to three days, longer than the competition's time limit. Still, the results represent the best marks in the competition by an AI system to date.\n\nThe company said it created AlphaProof, a system focused on reasoning, by combining a version of Gemini, the language model behind its chatbot of the same name, with AlphaZero, another AI system which previously bested humans in board games such as chess and Go. AlphaProof solved three of the competition's problems, including the most difficult question, which was solved by just five out of more than 600 human contestants.\n\nAn additional math problem was solved by AlphaGeometry 2.\n\nReuters reported earlier in July that Microsoft-backed OpenAI was developing reasoning technology under the code name \"Strawberry.\" The project, formerly known as Q*, was considered so much of a breakthrough that several staff researchers wrote a letter to OpenAI's board of directors in November warning that it could threaten humanity, as Reuters first reported.\n\n(Reporting by Kenrick Cai; Editing by Daniel Wallis)",

        "title": "Universal Music Group stock plunges 20% after streaming, subscription revenue disappoints",
        "content": "Hollywood's top music label is struggling to grow in the ultra-competitive streaming market.\n\nShares of Netherlands-based Universal Music Group (UMG.AS), which represents A-list artists like Taylor Swift, Drake, Justin Bieber, and Adele, dropped 20% shortly after the opening bell on Thursday. The sharp decline came after the company unveiled sluggish results for its streaming and subscription businesses.\n\nThe stock is currently on track for its biggest one-day loss ever.\n\nThe company's second-quarter subscription revenue slowed to 6.9% growth year over year, excluding foreign exchange (FX). That's down from 12.5% in the first quarter—and a miss compared to Bloomberg consensus estimates of 11% growth.\n\nStreaming revenue, meanwhile, decreased 3.9% ex-FX in the second quarter, a significant reversal from the 10.3% growth it recorded in Q1. The company blamed the decrease on \"a deceleration in growth at key advertising-based platform partners as well as shortfalls on certain platforms related to the timing of deal renewals.\"\n\nDeals with social media platforms, a popular option for music distribution, have become more of a headache for the company in recent months.\n\nIn May, UMG ended its partnership with Meta Platforms (META), which was licensing premium music videos for Facebook. Management said that the product offering \"was less popular with Facebook's user base than other music products.\"\n\nUMG also revealed it lost a month's worth of revenue amid its high-profile battle with TikTok over a new licensing agreement, which the pair eventually resolved.\n\nCiti analyst Thomas Singlehurst, who downgraded shares to Neutral from Buy, said although the volatility \"may prove to be temporary,\" he expects \"disappointment to weigh on sentiment\" in the near term. Slow growth? Taylor Smith at the 2019 American Music Awards in Los Angeles. (Photo: REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nOn the earnings call, UMG vice president and CFO Boyd Muir said the year over year deceleration in subscription growth was \"partially due to the timing of price increases\" from its partners.\n\nUMG's partners include audio streaming giants like Spotify (SPOT), Amazon Music (AMZN) and Apple Music (AAPL) — all of which have raised prices in recent years, which has helped UMG bring in additional revenue for its subscription business.\n\n\"The other factor impacting our subscription revenue growth this quarter is the slowdown in subscriber growth at certain platforms, which is occurring while the overall subscription marketplace continues to experience significant growth in subscribers globally,\" Muir added.\"While Spotify, YouTube and many regional and local platforms have continued to exhibit healthy growth in subscribers, other large partners who have been less successful in driving global adoption have seen a slowdown in new subscriber additions.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe executive did not specifically call out which platforms were seeing a downtick in subscribers, but did say the company is \"engaged with all of our key partners\" in dialogue regarding product innovation.\n\nHe highlighted Spotify's comments from Tuesday around its yet-to-be announced \"super premium\" offering, which Spotify said \"consumers are really asking us to do.\"\n\nMuir backed Spotify's thesis, adding, \"Our research and analysis indicate that as many as 20% of the current subscriber base could upgrade to a super-premium tier at a meaningfully higher price point for a compelling product configuration, one which offers enhanced features and exclusive access to content.\"\n\nDespite the disappointments, the company still saw strong growth in divisions like merchandising revenue, which jumped 44% in Q2 thanks to artists like Taylor Swift. Other top sellers for the first half of 2024 included Morgan Wallen, Noah Kahan, Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande.\n\nTotal revenue rose for the twelfth consecutive quarter to 2.93 billion euros ($3.18 billion), representing roughly 9% year over year growth—and ahead of consensus estimates. Adjusted EBITDA increased more than 11% from the prior-year period (excluding foreign exchange) to 649 million euros, or $705 million.\n\nEarlier this year, UMG launched a restructuring plan in an effort to generate 250 million euros in annual savings by 2026, which included job cuts.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential",
        "content": "Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) still has some scenarios where an attractive upside is possible, even after its shares rose more than 160% year to date. However, this scenario is only possible if optimistic assumptions come true, since in more reasonable scenarios, it is possible to find a fair price close to the current one or even a downside.\n\nCombining the possibility of a more modest scenario materializing at some point in the future (even if the next few quarters remain strong and above expectations), with the fact earnings should be cyclical, I believe the stock currently has a narrow margin of safety.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nIf we consider the company will continue to benefit from this secular trend, there is an upside of just over 20% (bullish scenario). On the other hand, the downside could be of the same intensity (or even worse) if the growth discount rate is slightly reduced and the discount rate increases.\n\nNvidia has great prospects, but should be cyclical\n\nIt is very easy to find studies that show the bullish prospects for Nvidia. The company itself provides a vision of the $1 trillion long-term available market opportunity, divided between $300 billion in data center systems, $300 billion in autonomous machines and the remainder in other complementary lines such as omniverse, artificial intelligence enterprise and gaming. Just considering this total addressable market, where Nvidia is the leader and has competitive advantages and technological barriers, we would already have justification for drawing up a bullish scenario. Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential\n\nSource: Nvidia Investor Presentation\n\nBut we do not need to consider only this information. According to P&S Intelligence, the data center market size by 2030 should reach $622.40 billion, with a compound annual growth rate of 10.10%. Grand View Research believes the U.S. Data Center Market should reach a CAGR of 10.70%, while the global market size will grow at a rate of 10.90% per year over the same period. The Autonomous Robots Market, according to Fact.MR, should have a CAGR of 9.20% by 2033. An even more bullish view is that of Skyquestt, which projects the GPU Market size should reach a CAGR of 33% in the period from 2024 to 2031 due to its diverse application possibilities in a range of sectors, including automotive, aerospace and cryptocurrency, among others.\n\nIn short, the increased need for GPUs has become a secular trend. But at the same time, these massive purchases should be cyclical, and this needs to be reflected in the company's projections. In recent years, companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have substantially increased their capital expenditures. Because they are developing artificial intelligence technology and have relevant cloud infrastructure, they end up being a big part of Nvidia's revenue. In the earnings call, it was mentioned that \"public-cloud hyperscalers\" still represented close to 50% of all data center revenue.\n\nStory continues Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential\n\nSource: Koyfin\n\nTo illustrate this further, Meta continues to invest billions to buy Nvidia's GPUs and develop its generative AI initiatives. Even if this continues in the short and medium term, at some point the company will have had enough and will want to reduce this capex to increase its free cash flow. In my opinion, this is where Nvidia's main point of doubt lies: after the bulk of capex from the big companies, will occasional technology updates (during card swaps) and penetration into new industries be enough to sustain this level of multibillion-dollar revenue and sustainable growth?\n\nBullish scenario - 20% upside\n\nFor the bullish scenario, let's consider a high but still feasible growth rate for Nvidia. For example, in revenue for this year, there is similar growth to that seen in previous quarters, and that is indicated in next quarter's guidance. This higher pace starts in 2025 (calendar year) at 20% and gradually declines to 10% in 2030. We might think this revenue CAGR, although high, is achievable, but it would be necessary for the Data Center segment to remain strong for a few more years, capturing new industries and with Nvidia unlocking new revenue lines to sustain this growth.\n\nIn this scenario, we also consider margins to be high, with a slight normalization of the gross margin, which falls to 76%, a level that is still very robust. This correction in the gross margin is more than offset by possible (even greater) gains in scale and efficiency, with selling, general and administrative as well as research and development costs gradually reducing compared to revenue, so that the Ebitda margin continues to expand. With this, we have the following projected income statement for the coming years: Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential\n\nSource: Nvidia and Author's projections\n\nIn addition, the cash flow assumptions considered a capex of -2% of revenue, decreasing to -1.50% in 2027 and a variation in working capital that reduces cash generation by about $800 million per year. Assuming a growth rate of 5% in the terminal stage of this cash flow, we have a fair price of $156 for Nvidia. But note this fair price, in addition to all these optimistic assumptions, still depends on a discount rate of 8.41%, implying an equity risk premium of 2.50%. Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential\n\nSource: Nvidia and Author's projections\n\nBase scenario - 24% downside\n\nSlightly modifying the assumptions to make the scenario more reasonable, revenue growth from 2026 onwards was slightly reduced, with the company achieving 8% growth per year from 2030 onwards. The other margin assumptions with gradual progress were maintained. As a result, 2030 Ebitda falls from $184 billion to $168 billion. Based on this, we have the following projected income statement for the coming years: Nvidia Still Has Upside Potential\n\nSource: Nvidia and Author's projections\n\nMaintaining the other cash flow assumptions, but reducing terminal stage growth from 5% to 4.50% and increasing the equity risk premium from 2.50% to 3.50%, we have a discount rate of 9.40% and a fair price of $98 for Nvidia, which would imply a downside of 24%.\n\nIn my opinion, a 24% downside seems very pessimistic, but the assumptions that justify this fair price are not so bad since, in reality, a relevant growth in revenue has been maintained, the high margins have been maintained, a certain perpetuation of growth has been maintained and a discount rate consistent with the reality of the market has been applied.\n\nOf course, being a premium company and one that the market rewards a lot, a lower discount rate may make more sense given the possibility of positive surprises in conjunction with Nvidia's relevance to today's technology segment. But the opposite is also true since the current valuation leaves little room for negative surprises.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAs shown above, in a DCF model with optimistic assumptions, it is still possible to find an interesting upside for Nvidia. This, coupled with the quality and competitive advantages, can serve as a bullish argument to justify exposure to the stock.\n\nI believe the company deserves a premium valuation, rewarding not only its recent high growth and competitive advantages, but also its very interesting prospects, which are one of the most robust trends today.\n\nBut this also comes at a price: Nvidia should be able to continue surfing the growth of its markets, but this does not leave it immune from a cyclicality that may eventually arise, especially if the big tech and cloud companies reduce their capex without compensation from new industries.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia's shares are currently at a level where there is a strong dependence on this momentum continuing to justify the rich valuation since a good part of the thesis' value lies in the growth it will have over the years.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The recent tech sell-off, sparked by results from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), has caused significant anxiety on Wall Street. However, Wedbush analysts are confident this downturn will be brief and see it as the beginning of a significant tech bull run driven by a massive AI capital expenditure cycle.\n\nAccording to Wedbush, \"We believe this tech sell-off will be short-lived as the Street better digests results and commentary from the broader tech sector over the coming weeks during earnings season.\"\n\n\"This is the start....not the end of this tech bull run in our view fueled by this AI tidal wave of spending on the doorstep,\" they argue.\n\nThe firm highlights that the sell-off, although unsettling, confirms the robust cloud and AI build-outs fueling what they describe as the \"4th Industrial Revolution.\"\n\nWedbush estimates that over $1 trillion will be spent on AI capex in the coming years by companies, utilities, and governments, which will drive this AI Revolution.\n\nAlphabet's increased spending on AI, highlighted in their recent earnings, is seen as a precursor to similar announcements from other major tech players. This substantial investment wave is not viewed as a risk but as a necessary step in building the AI ecosystem globally.\n\nDespite investor concerns about the delayed materialization of top-line growth and margins from these investments, Wedbush strongly disagrees, asserting that this confirms the AI Revolution.\n\n\"This is not Meta/Zuckerberg head scratching spending on metaverse from 2 years ago, instead this is an AI arms race taking place in the US, China, and around the globe,\" the analysts emphasize.\n\nWedbush remains optimistic about a multi-year tech bull run, especially with a potential Fed rate cut creating a favorable risk-on environment.\n\nThey foresee tech stocks rising another 15%-20% this year, driven by strong 2Q earnings expected from companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), and Meta (NASDAQ:META), as well as key cybersecurity firms such as Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS), Palo Alto, CyberArk, Checkpoint, and Tenable.\n\nIn conclusion, Wedbush says that massive sell-offs like yesterday spark Street nervousness, but the pullbacks have previously \"created the golden opportunities time and time again to own Big Tech and the winners.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech sell-off to be short lived; this is start of tech bull run: Wedbush\n\nBofA payments app for businesses handled record $500 billion by mid-year\n\nFutures pare losses after GDP, durable goods data\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Bitcoin Price Dips to $64,000, $220M in Long Positions Liquidated\n\nBitcoin (BTC) experienced a sharp decline on Wednesday, as it fell over 3% to the $64,000 mark. Over the past 24 hours, long liquidations in the crypto market surged to $220.7 million, according to CoinGlass data. This steep drop coincided with broader market losses in the Nasdaq 100 index, which fell 3.65%, marking its sharpest decline since October 2022.\n\nAdditionally, $32 million in short positions were liquidated. The majority of these liquidations were concentrated in Ethereum, which accounted for $17.5 million, followed by Bitcoin with $14.8 million. Meanwhile Ethereum's price has dropped nearly 8.6% over the past 24 hours, after the spot Ethereum ETFs were launched on Tuesday. ETH is now trading at $3,159.\n\nAnalysts have linked Bitcoin’s performance to tech stocks, citing various factors, including a shifting political landscape in Washington, D.C., and optimistic bets on U.S. spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds.\n\nDespite the short-term losses that caught many traders by surprise, some analysts remain optimistic about the potential for upward momentum in the coming months. \"We maintain a positive Ethereum outlook,\" stated Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital in a note on Tuesday, just a day before Bitcoin's decline. \"Bitcoin's achievement of an all-time high two months post-ETF launch provides a compelling precedent. Anticipating sustained institutional interest, ETH’s price trajectory may gradually converge with its previous all-time high.\"\n\nThe recent selloff in tech stocks was reportedly triggered by earnings reports from major companies, including Google parent Alphabet Inc., which revealed higher-than-expected capital expenses. Alphabet’s stock consequently fell over 5%, its worst performance since January. Tesla also experienced a significant drop of more than 12%, while Nvidia, a leading figure in artificial intelligence, saw its stock shed 6.8%.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "You Could Have Turned $500 Into More Than $50,000 In One Day As Market Got Clobbered: Here's How\n\nWednesday was the worst day for the overall market in 2024, with the SPDR S&P 500 Index (NYSE:SPY) trading down more than 2% and the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NYSE:QQQ) trading down more than 3.5% late in the session.\r\n\r\nMany mega-cap tech names that have driven much of the last year's rally sold off significantly on the day, with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) each trading down more than 5%.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nHere’s how much you should have invested in Nvidia in 2022 to become a millionaire today. This platform is offering 8.1% APY on idle cash and up to 15 FREE Stocks with qualified deposits for a limited time.\n\nBut, even when the market gets hammered, there are ways to make money. Short-dated options contracts are a risky way to play the market, but when they go right, they can be a vehicle to make large gains very quickly.\n\nOn Tuesday, put contracts on the QQQs with a strike price of $469 that expired Wednesday afternoon closed at $.05 a contract, according to Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD). At the time, the QQQs were trading at more than $480 a share, making it very unlikely that the index would trade below the strike price.\n\nAt their highs on Wednesday, those same contracts that would have cost $5 on Tuesday, were worth more than $510 a pop. This means that 100 contracts of those specific puts could have been purchased for $500 on Tuesday, and sold for more than $50,000 on Wednesday, good for a gain of more than 9,900%.\n\nTrending:\n\nEnjoy freedom to trade from market hours with this revolutionary platform allowing 24-hour trading access. Tauted as being one of the most budget-friendly premium options tradings, it now offers zero contract fees on equity options and a bonus of 5 free stocks\n\nPut contracts give the buyer the right to sell the underlying equity (in this case 100 shares of the QQQs) at the predetermined strike price, regardless of where the stock is trading, up until the expiration date. With Wednesday's wicked red day, well outside the standard deviation move of the overall market, those put contracts exploded in price.\n\nTypically, the $SPY or $QQQs don't move more than 2% in a single day. But, because Tuesday afternoon featured earnings reports from two of the biggest holdings in each index (Tesla and Google) there was an extra catalyst, making the market prime for a larger-than-expected move.\n\nNot to mention the fact that the rapid rise of volatility on Wednesday also increased the value of the contracts. When the VIX (an indicator of market volatility) goes higher, so does the underlying value of options contracts. This is because the increased volatility makes it more likely that a stock could hit the strike price associated with the options contract.\r\n\r\nRead Next:\n\nStory continues\n\nHere’s how much you should have invested in Nvidia in 2022 to become a millionaire today.

        "content": "Investing.com -- The tech-led selloff looks set to continue Thursday, while Ford has also disappointed with a second-quarter profit miss. Biden points to a new generation after addressing the nation, while the European earnings season presses on.\n\n1. Biden points to a new generation\n\nPresident Joe Biden addressed the nation on Wednesday for the first time since dropping his reelection bid, explaining he was stepping aside to allow a new generation to take over after weeks of concerns about his age and health.\n\nBiden is the oldest president in U.S. history, at 81, and becomes the first incumbent president not to seek reelection since 1968 when Lyndon Johnson, under fire for his handling of the Vietnam War, pulled out of his campaign.\n\n“In recent weeks, it’s become clear to me that I need to unite my party,” Biden said. “I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nThe spotlight now falls on Vice President Kamala Harris, who is set to be formally nominated as the Democratic Party’s candidate as soon as next week, before the party's Aug. 19-22 convention in Chicago.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Tuesday showed Harris with a lead of two percentage points over Republican candidate Donald Trump, 44% to 42%. A CNN poll by SSRS showed Trump leading Harris, 49% to 46%. Both findings were within the polls' margins of error.\n\n2. Futures steady ahead of growth data\n\nU.S. stock futures traded in a mixed fashion Thursday, with the previous session’s sharp tech-driven selloff continuing ahead of the release of key growth data.\n\nBy 04:15 ET (08:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 20 points, or 0.1%, higher, while S&P 500 futures dropped 15 points, or 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 120 points, or 0.6%.\n\nThe major Wall Street indices slumped on Wednesday, driven by poorly received earnings from tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 500 points, or 1.3%, while the S&P 500 dropped 2.3% and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 3.6%, the worst session since 2022.\n\nThere will be more earnings to digest Thursday, from the likes of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) and Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS).\n\nMore than 25% of companies in the S&P 500 have reported their second-quarter earnings, according to FactSet data, and although some major tech stocks have disappointed, the overall nature of the earnings session has been generally positive.\n\nInvestors will also study the release of preliminary second-quarter GDP data before the market open, and is expected to show annualized growth of 2.0%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis would be above the 1.4% growth seen in the first quarter, but would remain considerably slower than the 4.2% pace seen in the second half of last year.\n\n3. Ford slumps after profit miss\n\nFord (NYSE:F) stock slumped premarket after the auto giant reported a significant profit miss for the second quarter as it continues to battle costly quality issues and an EV business that is weighing on its bottom line.\n\nFord stock fell over 11% after hours following the Detroit automaker posting an adjusted profit of 47 cents per share, significantly missing analysts' expectations of 68 cents, according to LSEG data.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley has made fixing the automaker's quality problems a priority since he took charge in October 2020, but warranty expenses went up $800 million in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter.\n\nLegacy automakers have tended to scale down their EV ambitions amid easing demand, a shift to hybrids and stiff competition.\n\n\"Overall, the EV journey has been humbling, but it has forced us to get even more fit as a company, including applying it to our (traditional gas-engine) business, and that will pay off in the long run,\" said Farley. \"The remaking of Ford is not without growing pains.\"\n\n4. European earnings roll in\n\nA number of important European companies have released their quarterly earnings Thursday for investors to digest.\n\nLuxury giant Kering (EPA:PRTP), best known for its Gucci brand, disappointed with its second-quarter results, as overall sales fell by 11% year-on-year on a constant currency basis, a steeper decline than expected.\n\nAnglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) raised its sales and profit forecast for 2024 and topped analyst expectations for second-quarter revenue, buoyed by demand for its therapies for cancer and rare diseases.\n\nSanofi (NASDAQ:SNY)'s second-quarter profit rose on strong demand for its blockbuster asthma drug Dupixent and better-than-expected sales of new launches.\n\nNestle (SIX:NESN) reported half-year sales growth below expectations and lowered its full-year organic sales growth outlook to at least 3% from about 4% previously, as the world's biggest packaged food company said prices had come down faster than expected.\n\nUnilever (LON:ULVR) reported weaker-than-expected underlying quarterly sales after the British consumer goods giant felt the backlash from higher prices, while French oil major TotalEnergies (EPA:TTEF) reported a 6% fall in second-quarter earnings.\n\n5. Crude falls amid demand concerns\n\nCrude prices retreated Thursday, as concerns about waning demand, especially from China, the world's largest crude importer, continued to weigh.\n\nBy 04:15 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) dropped 0.5% to $77.19 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.5% to $81.30 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks settled higher on Wednesday, snapping consecutive sessions of declines after the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories fell by 3.7 million barrels last week, more than expected.\n\nHowever, prices remained close to two-month lows as concerns over waning demand, coupled with forecasts of a potential oil market surplus in 2025 and talk of a ceasefire in the Middle East kept traders largely bearish towards crude.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBiden's speech, Ford's miss, European earnings - what's moving markets\n\nInvestors turn long on Singapore dollar after 7 months; bearish bets on Asian FX ease - Reuters poll\n\nSouth Korea seeks to cut inheritance tax in first revision since 2000\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet’s earnings set the stage for tech’s AI question",
        "content": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) kicked off Big Tech’s earnings season on Tuesday, giving Wall Street its first look at digital ad and cloud spending in the quarter. The company reported better than expected earnings and revenue, on the strength of Search ads and continued cloud growth, but fell short on YouTube ad sales.\n\nAlphabet also continues to spend billions building out its AI infrastructure. CFO Ruth Porat, who is transitioning to a new role as CIO, told analysts during the company’s earnings call that capital expenditures in the second quarter topped out at $13 billion, up from $12 billion in Q1. And the vast majority of that is going toward servers and data centers for AI capabilities.\n\nThe report sets the tone for the rest of the tech industry, as it prepares to provide Wall Street with the latest on not just AI spending, but also how much that spending is paying off in actual revenue.\n\nSo far, Alphabet says it’s seeing an uptick in cloud revenue with some of that coming from interest in AI products. But CEO Sundar Pichai sidestepped a more direct question about when analysts can expect to start seeing a return on capital investments related to AI, saying that the spending is necessary for a long-term bet like AI, adding that in situations like this it’s better to overinvest rather than underinvest and fall behind.\n\nUBS Global Research’s Stephen Ju wrote in an investor note following Google’s earnings call that it still isn’t entirely clear when Google will start to reap the benefits of its AI investments. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., May 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“The benefits [Google] is seeing in [Google Cloud Platform] on AI productization still seems difficult to discern, as is the full payoff that Google should see (we do not think potential revenue benefits will arrive until [the first half of 2025] at the earliest),” Ju wrote.\n\n“So as far as we are concerned, the [return on invested capital] debate remains only partially resolved, especially as we are now contemplating what is a higher [capital expenditure] estimate for 2025 and 2026,” he added.\n\nOther analysts were more upbeat on Google’s AI efforts, with William Blair’s Ralph Schackart pointing to Pichai’s comment that some 2 billion users are accessing its Gemini AI model and that the company is building the model into its own products.\n\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt, meanwhile, pointed to Google’s AI Overview for search helping to drive better customer engagement and creating more monetization opportunities as a positive in the company’s report.\n\nStill, the one thing missing from all of this is a definitive number pointing to how much Google’s AI investments are actually helping its bottom line. Pichai says investments will make a difference, but when exactly is still rather vague.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet is just the first of the Big Tech names set to report their earnings this quarter, and you can all but guarantee investors will be searching for clues as to how those other companies’ AI moves are paying off as well.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) are slapping AI features onto their various products and services. Now we just have to see if they’ll give any more insight than Alphabet had to offer. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Will Mag 7 Earnings Meet Expectations?",
        "content": "Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\n\nHere are the key points:\n\nFor the 134 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, or 26.8% of the index’s total membership, total earnings are up +7.6% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues, with 81.3% beating EPS estimates and 57.5% beating revenue estimates.\n\nExcept for the revenue beats percentage, which at 57.5% is the lowest for this group of 134 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period, all of the other performance metrics are tracking better relative to what we have seen in other recent periods.\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, total earnings for the index are expected to be up +9.6% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth pace since the +10% earnings growth in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nQ2 earnings for the ‘Magnificent 7’ companies are expected to be up +26.6% from the same period last year on +13.6% higher revenues. Excluding the ‘Mag 7’, Q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to +6.1% (from +9.6%).\n\nAlphabet GOOGL and Tesla TSLA kicked off the Q2 reporting cycle for the ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks, with the market unimpressed with either of the two reports. This contrasted with the companies’ Q1 releases when both Alphabet and Tesla were up big on the quarterly results.\n\nThere is no surprise in the Tesla sell-off, as the company not only missed estimates but also had nothing good to say about the near-term outlook. The EV maker has been suffering competitive challenges in its core market, prompting it to cut prices that are weighing on its margins. As a result, Tesla’s Q2 earnings were down -45.3% on +2.3% higher revenues. Given Tesla shares’ gain of more than +40% in the three-month period ahead of the quarterly release, the post-release sell-off makes perfect sense.\n\nThe sell-off in Alphabet shares is far harder to understand, as the search giant handily beat estimates and showed broadly positive trends in all of its businesses.\n\nThe issue in the Alphabet report appears to be the market’s disappointment with a bigger-than-expected capital spending level in the period of $13.2 billion relative to expectations of $12.2 billion. Management also indicated that they saw underspending as a bigger risk at this stage of the AI rollout than the alternative, which was interpreted as indicative of an elevated capex spend trend than what investors had been factoring in.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe don’t see elevated capex by Alphabet or any other Tech operator as a negative, but this appears to be the case with Tech investors at this stage. Perhaps the market would like to see a tangible path toward monetization for all the AI-centric investments in which Alphabet and its peers are currently engaged in. This also means that capex spending levels in the coming Meta and Microsoft reports will similarly receive close scrutiny.\n\nFor the Mag 7 group as a whole, Q2 earnings are expected to be up +26.6% on +13.6% higher revenues, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBeyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +16.3% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\n\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.2%, followed by another strong showing expected next year. The chart below shows how the aggregate earnings total for the Tech sector has evolved over the past year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nA big contributing factor to the Tech sector’s positive earnings outlook is the sector’s margins outlook, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year’s record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector’s productivity.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that this year’s +8.7% earnings growth on only +1.7% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +8.5%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +3.9%. In other words, about half of this year’s earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\n\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Asian stocks tumble as tech rout spills over; China shares test 5-mth lows",
        "content": "Investing.com-- Asian stocks fell sharply on Thursday, tracking an overnight rout on Wall Street as weak earnings from major technology companies drove outsized losses in the sector.\n\nWeak sentiment towards China also remained in play, with the country’s stock benchmarks testing their lowest levels since February.\n\nWall Street indexes tumbled in overnight trade, with the NASDAQ Composite plummeting over 3% as middling earnings from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) sparked an extended rout in tech.\n\nBut U.S. stock index futures rose marginally in Asian trade, suggesting that Wall Street may at least be stabilizing from recent losses. Focus was also on upcoming gross domestic product and PCE price index data due in the coming days.\n\nAsian tech tracks Wall St slide, strong earnings disregarded\n\nTech-heavy Asian bourses were by far the worst performers on Thursday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 losing 2.7%, while South Korea’s KOSPI slid 1.8%. The KOSPI was also dented by weaker-than-expected gross domestic product data for the second quarter.\n\nMemory chip making giant SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) tumbled nearly 9%, even as it clocked stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings on robust artificial intelligence demand.\n\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng index tumbled 1.8%, as Chinese internet giants tracked losses in their U.S. peers.\n\nAlphabet headlined these losses, even as the firm’s quarterly earnings beat consensus. But signs of slowing advertising revenue and increased costs, especially on AI, drove concerns over other tech earnings reflecting similar trends.\n\nThe tech sector was already nursing steep losses over the past week, as it was slammed by profit-taking after a major melt-up over the past year. Expectations of interest rate cuts, specifically in the U.S., also sparked a rotation into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nJapan, Australia and India see profit-taking from record highs\n\nBroader Asian markets also slid, as risk appetite was hammered by the tech rout. Australia’s ASX 200 index fell 1.2%, while Japan’s broader TOPIX index lost 2.2%. Both indexes had surged to record highs earlier in July.\n\nFutures for India’s Nifty 50 index fell 0.3%, pointing to a negative open as the index also grappled with a high degree of profit-taking in recent sessions. The Nifty and India’s BSE Sensex 30 had notched a series of record peaks in July, but were now set to pull back substantially from those levels.\n\nChinese stocks test five-month lows\n\nChina’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell relatively less than their Asian peers, owing to lower tech weightage in both indexes. But they were both down around 0.7%, and were also at their weakest levels since late-February.\n\nStory continues\n\nChinese markets were nursing steep losses as a swathe of weak economic readings battered sentiment towards the country. The Chinese economy grew less than expected in the second quarter.\n\nSurprise interest rate cuts in the country also did little to improve sentiment. Reports on Thursday showed that several state-owned Chinese banks had lowered borrowing costs following a surprise reduction in the loan prime rate earlier this week.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks tumble as tech rout spills over; China shares test 5-mth lows\n\nJapan's Honda to close China plant, halt production at another factory\n\nLogistics giant Lineage raises $4.44 billion in biggest IPO of 2024\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose slightly in evening deals on Wednesday, steadying after disappointing earnings from heavyweight technology stocks sparked deep losses on Wall Street.\n\nMajor technology stocks rose in aftermarket trade, seeing a measure of bargain buying after suffering steep losses over the past week. Positive earnings from South Korean memory chip maker SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) also offered some positive signals on artificial intelligence-fueled demand.\n\nBut sentiment remained largely fragile, with uncertainty over the presidential race and an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting also keeping investors cautious.\n\nFocus this week is also on second-quarter gross domestic product data, while the PCE price index- which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge- is due on Friday.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.2% to 5,483.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 19,261.75 points by 20:03 ET (00:03 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 40,188.0 points.\n\nWall St walloped by tech losses after Tesla, Alphabet earnings disappoint\n\nFutures rose marginally after Wall Street clocked deep losses on Wednesday, as underwhelming earnings from heavyweights Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) rattled markets.\n\nTesla steadied in aftermarket trade from a 12.3% slump during the session, as its second-quarter earnings missed estimates. The electric car maker offered middling cues on its plans for full self driving and robotaxis, while investors were unimpressed by CEO Elon Musk flagging progress in developing a humanoid robot, “Optimus.”\n\nAlphabet steadied from a 5% tumble, as signs of slowing advertising revenue and increased expenditure on AI largely offset an earnings beat.\n\nAnalysts were also concerned that the internet giant’s earnings could herald a similar trend in its peers, especially amid fears that the increased spending on AI now appeared to be providing slowing returns.\n\nLosses in the two had spilled over into their peers on Wednesday, dragging Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) down 3.6% and 2.9%, respectively. AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) slumped 6.8%, although all three stocks rose marginally in after-hours trading.\n\nTech was already nursing steep losses over the past weeks, as the sector saw heavy profit-taking after hype over AI drove a major melt-up in valuation over the past year. Expectations of lower interest rates- on which the Fed is set to provide more cues next week- also sparked a rotation into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nThe NASDAQ Composite slumped 3.6% to 17,345.84 points on Wednesday, largely leading losses among its peers. The S&P 500 fell 2.3% to 5,427.13 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3% to 39,853.87 points.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle, IBM advance on strong Q2; Ford slumps\n\nAmong major aftermarket movers, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) rose 3% after clocking stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter. The fast casual Mexican restaurant chain logged strong comparable restaurant sales in the quarter.\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) rose 2.4% after increased interest in AI helped the tech consulting firm log stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings.\n\nBut on the other hand, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) slumped over 12% after clocking disappointing earnings, as automobile sales slowed sharply amid decreased consumer spending.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures limp higher after tech rout batters Wall Street\n\nBattery firm LG Energy Solution Q2 profit plunges on weak EV demand\n\nBoeing finalizes 737 MAX guilty plea deal, US outlines reasons\n\nView comments()",

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL second-quarter 2024 earnings of $1.89 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.2%. The figure grew 31.3% year over year.\r\n\r\nRevenues of $84.74 billion increased 14% year over year (15% at constant currency).\r\n\r\nNet revenues, excluding total traffic acquisition costs (“TAC”) (the portion of revenues shared with Google’s partners, and the amount paid to distribution partners and others who direct traffic to Google’s website), were $71.35 billion, which surpassed the consensus mark by 1.1%. The figure rose 15% from the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nTAC of $13.4 billion rose 6.8% year over year.\r\n\r\nSolid momentum across Search and YouTube contributed well.

        "content": "Investing.com - According to an analyst note from UBS on Wednesday, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) could be working on a \"foldable\" iPhone that could be released as early as 2026. The Information's website suggests that Apple is developing a foldable iPhone that folds widthwise like a clamshell, similar to the Samsung (KS:005930) Galaxy Z Flip.\n\nHowever, consumer preference for a foldable device remains low as per UBS's analysis. In a smartphone survey powered by UBS Evidence Lab, involving approximately 7,500 respondents, it was found that a broken phone, battery wearing out, and a phone running slowly are the primary reasons driving an upgrade.\n\nNotably, a \"foldable\" smartphone was the only attribute that registered a negative net score (-22%). Approximately 83% of respondents cited \"battery life\" as the key driver, followed by price at 79% and network quality at 78%.\n\n⚠️Track your favorite companies with InvestingPro! Our Summer Sale is now on, use coupon code INVPRODEAL and save over 50%!⚠️\n\nTo date, foldable volumes are a tiny percentage of the smartphone market. On a trailing 12-month basis through the end of May, UBS estimates the global smartphone market was roughly 1.2 billion units.\n\nOver the same period, Samsung, the most aggressive vendor selling foldable/flip devices, sold just around 8 million \"foldable\" devices, largely driven by the Galaxy Z Flip 5.\n\nThis translates to less than 70 basis points of the total smartphone market, hardly an endorsement of the form factor in UBS's view.\n\nOther vendors like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with its Pixel Fold also witnessed limited success, selling only approximately 250,000 units on an LTM basis.\n\nAnalysts at UBS maintained their Neutral rating for Apple, with a price target of $190\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUBS: \"Foldable iPhones\" not likely to drive iPhone demand\n\nAmeriprise posts in-line Q2 earnings, revenue falls short\n\n'Fear gauge' hits three-month high as US stocks sell off\n\nView comments()",

        "title": "Why Alphabet Stock Is Sinking Today",
        "content": "Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) stock is losing ground Wednesday. The tech giant's share price was down 3.4% as of 10:30 a.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nAlphabet published second-quarter results after the market closed yesterday. Despite strong sales and earnings beats in the quarter, investors are selling out of the stock in response to the company's forward guidance.\n\nAlphabet's Q2 results were actually fantastic\n\nAlphabet posted earnings per share of $1.89 on revenue of $84.74 billion in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the average analyst estimate had called for the business to record per-share earnings of $1.85 on sales of $84.29 billion.\n\nEven though the company's share price is dipping today, the company's Q2 results were very strong -- and most key segments put up impressive performances. Overall revenue rose 15% year over year on a currency-adjusted basis, and the company's operating income margin hit 32% -- up from the 29% margin it posted in last year's quarter and exceeding the 31% margin predicted by Wall Street.\n\nAlphabet's \"Google search and other\" segment saw revenue increase roughly 14% year over year to hit $48.5 billion. The company's cloud business also delivered another quarter of strong growth, with revenue rising roughly 29% year over year to hit $10.35 billion. Along with strong sales momentum for most of its segments, efficiency initiatives at the company helped push diluted earnings per share up roughly 31% compared to last year's quarter.\n\nIs the bearish reaction to guidance creating a buying opportunity?\n\nWhile Alphabet's Q2 results were roundly better than Wall Street had anticipated, company management made comments on the quarterly earnings call that have triggered an uptick in bearish sentiment. Third-quarter operating margins will likely be pressured due to increases in depreciation and expenses related to the company's investment in artificial intelligence (AI) and other tech infrastructure.\n\nWhile margins could see some uneven movement in the near term, the long-term trajectory points to continued margin expansion for the company. Alphabet still expects that this year's operating margins will be up on an annual basis, and the software leader is likely still in the very early stages of benefiting from the AI revolution. GOOG PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWith Alphabet now trading at roughly 23 times this year's expected earnings, shares look attractively valued given the company's sales and earnings momentum. If you're a long-term investor interested in building a position in the tech giant's stock, today's pullback appears to present a worthwhile buying opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Baidu’s Robotaxi Ambition Draws Skeptics After Brief Stock Rally",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- China’s faster-than-expected adoption of autonomous driving is doing little to rev up optimism among analysts searching for Baidu Inc.’s next catalyst.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Initial Polling Data Show About the Trump-Harris Matchup A Six-Second Decision Shows How Harris Snapped Up Delegates Trump Floated Jamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary, Then Denies It Harris Has Enough Delegates to Clinch Nomination for President Wiz Rejects Google’s $23 Billion Offer, Seeks IPO Instead\n\nThe internet search leader’s shares have almost erased gains notched in Hong Kong this month after the company announced an expansion into ride hailing with a fleet of fully self-driving cars in the city of Wuhan. Now, Baidu’s stock may extend its year-to-date decline with analysts cutting its average 12-month target price to an all-time low.\n\n“The stock price has not priced in robotaxi potential. But to be honest, it shouldn’t right now either, because no one really knows how successful it will be, nor do they know about future government policy toward the technology,” said Kai Wang, a Morningstar analyst. “Mass commercialization is still like three to five years away.”\n\nOf concern is whether Baidu’s new growth plans will be able to offset its weak advertising revenues fast enough, particularly given a lack of certainty around pending regulations or consumer demand for such products. Market competition and a weak macro environment may also weigh on the stock.\n\nIt wasn’t supposed to be this way. Autonomous driving and machine learning have been core tenets in Baidu’s broader ambitions to expand within the artificial intelligence sector. Its autonomous ride-hailing arm “Apollo Go” launched a cheap robotaxi model in May and aims to be profitable by next year. Baidu is also expanding this service beyond Wuhan to more Chinese cities. The company in April signed an agreement with Tesla Inc. to embed its maps into the automaker’s self-driving systems.\n\nYet that hasn’t been enough to sway market watchers. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Lea wrote in a note last month that Baidu was likely to lose market share in AI due to a price war, and its earnings might “undergo a double-digit sequential decline this year with its AI ventures continuing to lose money.”\n\nOn robotaxis in particular, a case study of operations in Shanghai unveiled “discouragingly deep loss-making financials,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Alex Yao wrote in a report this month. Discounts offered by Baidu make the strategy commercially unviable, they added.\n\nStory continues\n\nThose concerns have forced at least seven brokers, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley, to slash their price targets over the past two weeks.\n\nThere may be other headaches too. Baidu’s operations in Wuhan are under increasing scrutiny, with local media citing concerns including the rising unemployment of taxi drivers and the safety of those cars in more complicated traffic situations.\n\nStill, given China’s driverless ride-hailing market potential, Baidu’s growth plans may still be a win in the long term. The country currently has about four to five million ride-railing cars in operation, according to Goldman Sachs. If 5% of those cars can switch into self driving vehicles and offer similar pricing to normal taxis, that translates into a $5 billion market, it says.\n\nAt least six cities or provinces recently announced trials to promote autonomous driving over the past month, which may help grow demand.\n\nTesla’s Profit Falls Short Again in a Weakened EV Market\n\nFor now, the next catalyst will likely come during the firm’s earnings next month. Baidu is expected to report 1.2% growth in revenue for the second quarter, similar to the pace in the March period which was the slowest since 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And after a short spike in demand for bullish option contracts when the company announced its expansion in Wuhan, trading volume has quickly come down.\n\n“Robotaxis are unlikely to generate any significant revenue or earnings for Baidu over the next few years,” BI’s Lea said, adding that its earnings might show a double-digit sequential decline this year. “The technology is high risk and remains at an immature stage, with developmental hurdles yet to overcome.”\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nIn recent months, Google showed interest in two companies, either of which would have been the biggest-ever purchase for the internet giant. And both times, the deals fell apart. On Monday, the chief executive of Wiz Inc. told staff that the cybersecurity startup would reject a $23 billion offer from Alphabet Inc.’s Google and instead pursue an initial public offering. That came just weeks after Google shelved plans to buy HubSpot Inc., a $25 billion software firm. Texas Instruments Inc. provided a sales outlook that signals an inventory glut is coming to an end, reassuring investors that a revival is underway in key markets for the company’s chips. Hackers have leaked internal documents stolen from Leidos Holdings Inc., one of the largest IT services providers to the US government, according to a person familiar with the matter. India’s video market is expected to reach $13 billion in revenue by 2028, boosted by the streaming industry, which has continued to invest billions of dollars in content development every year, according to a new report. Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. debuted a new and powerful AI model that Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg called “state of the art” and said will rival similar offerings from competitors like OpenAI and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Airbnb Hosts Want Guests to Come to Them Directly The Real Reason Erewhon Is a Cult Brand Why Is the US Deficit So Big?

        "title": "Asian stocks drop as tech tracks weak US earnings; China remains on backfoot",
        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell on Wednesday, weighed by renewed losses in the technology sector as key overnight earnings in the U.S. underwhelmed, while sentiment towards China also showed few signs of improving.\n\nRegional stocks took a weak lead-in from Wall Street, especially a fall in U.S. stock index futures following underwhelming earnings from heavyweights Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nThis sparked extended selling in technology stocks, which came as the sector nursed steep losses through the past week. Profit-taking and a rotation into more economically sensitive sectors battered global tech valuations over the past year.\n\nAsian tech lags after soft US earnings\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.5%, while South Korea’s KOSPI shed 0.1%, as losses in tech stocks weighed.\n\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng index was among the worst performers for the day, losing 0.6% as major electric vehicle stocks fell in tandem with Tesla.\n\nBYD (SZ:002594) Co Ltd (HK:1211), Li Auto Inc (HK:2015) and Xpeng Inc (HK:9868) slid between 2% and 4.3%, tracking a nearly 8% slide in Tesla after the firm’s second-quarter profit missed expectations.\n\nTesla was seen grappling with softening sales and mounting expenses as it diverted more resources towards artificial intelligence and self-driving technology.\n\nAlphabet’s earnings also provided weak cues to Asian markets. While the internet giant did beat expectations with its earnings, slower growth in ad revenue and increased expenditure on AI heralded a similar trend for regional tech giants, who are due to report in the coming weeks. Alphabet’s shares fell 2% in aftermarket trade.\n\nChinese stocks hit 2-week low on economic, political jitters\n\nChina’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively, hitting an over two-week low.\n\nChinese markets saw an extended rout in recent sessions as sentiment towards the country soured in the wake of disappointing economic readings, especially data that showed slower-than-expected growth in the second quarter.\n\nThis was coupled with an underwhelming interest rate cut by the People’s Bank, while the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party also yielded few cues on more stimulus measures.\n\nUncertainty over the U.S. presidential race also weighed on sentiment towards China, as investors speculated over just what a change in U.S. administration will entail for Washington’s stance towards the country.\n\nBroader Asian markets moved in a flat-to-low range. Australia’s ASX 200 fell slightly as purchasing managers index data showed manufacturing and services activity in the country likely slowed in July.\n\nStory continues\n\nJapan’s TOPIX index fell 0.4%, with losses limited by some signs of improvement in the Japanese economy. While PMI data showed a contraction in manufacturing activity, the services sector rebounded sharply into expansion in July, buoying overall business activity.\n\nFutures for India’s Nifty 50 index fell 0.1%, with the index facing some weakness as investors balked at the increased capital gains taxes outlined in the government’s 2024 budget.\n\nBut overall, the budget appeared to be more geared towards reducing India’s fiscal deficit and reigning in government spending.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks drop as tech tracks weak US earnings; China remains on backfoot\n\nElon Musk asks if Tesla should invest $5 bln in xAI\n\nMusk launches poll asking if Tesla should invest $5 billion in xAI\n\nView comments()",

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF.Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nOver the past few months the market has seen a massive influx of AI-related ETFs as investors look to ride the bandwagon of AI investing. A report from Wall Street Journal in June said that all ten AI ETFs tracked by website ETF.com saw inflows this year. One major AI ETF, launched by Roundhill, saw its assets grow to $35 million from under $1 million in just two weeks.\n\nAmid the craze of AI ETFs, does it make sense to start investing in every new ETF? Analysts offer some guidance. A Wall Street Journal report quoted Morningstar analyst Kenneth Lamont, who said that we should look for “thematic purity” while investing in AI ETFs. The ETF you choose, according to the analyst, must be investing in “bellwether” stocks positioned to benefit from the AI industry trends.\n\nThere is a new AI ETF in town. KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), launched earlier this month, tracks the Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index, which captures the performance of AI tech companies. The index seeks exposure to three main AI categories: hardware, infrastructure, and applications. The index picks companies by assigning  AI Exposure Score, which assesses each company’s relevance to AI tech. You can get exposure to AI companies focusing on data centers, LLMs, AI tech to reduce costs and improve customer experience.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the top 10 holdings of this new AI ETF and see whether they have the potential to rise in the coming months and weeks. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Best AI Stock to Buy Based on New AI ETF?\n\nGoogle\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the seventh biggest holding of KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX).\n\nDeepwater’s Gene Munster thinks that Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is going to win the “AI arms race.” While talking to CNBC, the analyst said that Google search business is “intact, no need to worry.” Munster’s thesis is based on his in-depth testing of several large language models and chatbots including Google’s Gemini. Munster also thinks other chatbots do not offer a strong imperative for users to switch from Google search as of yet.\n\nStory continues\n\nWedbush’s Dan Ives in a fresh note named Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) as one of the stocks that can benefit from the AI boom.\n\nAccording to a latest UBS report, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls in all three layers of the AI value chain – enabling, intelligence and application layer. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an AI enabling player because of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud Platform, while Gemini makes it a key player in the intelligence layer. On the application layer, UBS believes Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has an edge with its Duet AI assistant and advertising. All these catalysts make Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) a company that could benefit from the $1.2 trillion AI opportunity by 2027, UBS said.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the company is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note-taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrated with other Google apps. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) app urges users to sign up for ‘Google One AI Premium’ plan, which has a $19.99 price tag.  Google saw advertising revenue accelerate in Q1 2024, boosted by YouTube in particular growing by almost 21% last quarter. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The top absolute contributors were Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft, and Amazon. Turning briefly to positions we do own, Alphabet represented our top absolute contributor. The stock responded positively to attractive across-the-board results that beat expectations, with excitement around GenAI driving growth in its cloud business. Additionally, the company introduced a dividend and announced an additional $70B share buyback, beginning to show prudent capital allocation discipline in our view.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

This compares to earnings of $1.44 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.16%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.89, delivering a surprise of 26.85%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nAlphabet , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry, posted revenues of $71.36 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.07%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $62.07 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nAlphabet shares have added about 30.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 16.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Alphabet?\n\nWhile Alphabet has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Alphabet: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

        "content": "Broadcom To Challenge Nvidia Dominance? Analyst Says Jensen Huang-Led Chip Giant's Competitor Is 'Catching Up'\n\nIn a recent development, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is making significant strides in the AI stock market, posing a challenge to Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nWhat Happened: The report, based on recent interactions with investors in New York and Connecticut, indicates that Broadcom’s specialized AI business is gaining traction, Business Insider reported on Tuesday. The company has been assisting cloud giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in developing customized AI chips for internal use.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. America's construction sites are desperate for Robots — here’s how to invest in a house-printing startup who’s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry.\n\n“AVGO is catching up to NVDA as the top holding as AVGO has more AI customers joining (OpenAI and Bytedance) and accretion from VMware,” Citi noted. However, Broadcom’s stock still lags behind Nvidia’s, with a 79% gain in a year compared to Nvidia’s 177%.\n\nThe shift in investor sentiment towards Broadcom is significant, given Nvidia’s dominance in the AI stock market. Other semiconductor companies, including NXP Semiconductors and Advanced Analog Devices, are also seeing increased investor interest due to expected inventory replenishments.\n\nSee Also: General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50 per share.\n\nDespite a mixed sentiment, Citi maintains a positive outlook on the semiconductor sector, stating, “We remain wildly bullish on semis.”\n\nWhy It Matters: Broadcom is targeting a massive artificial intelligence (AI) silicon market opportunity, worth over $150 billion in the next five years. This positions the tech giant for significant growth, both in the near term and long term.\n\nBroadcom’s dominance in the $5-7 billion data center/AI Ethernet switching and routing chipset market, with a commanding 80% market share. This dominance is largely due to its relentless innovation.\n\nDespite Broadcom’s progress, Nvidia could achieve a market capitalization of nearly $50 trillion within the next decade, according to tech investor James Anderson.\n\nPrice Action: On Tuesday, Broadcom was trading 0.11% lower in the pre-market after closing at $161.06 on Monday, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next:\n\nRory McIlroy’s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 — here’s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100 Gen Z and Millennial millionaires couldn't care less for stocks and bonds — Here's what they're buying instead.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Broadcom To Challenge Nvidia Dominance?

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc. delivered another quarter of steady growth amid an AI-driven shift in the ubiquitous search engine that is the, foundation of its internet empire.\n\nThe second-quarter report released Tuesday indicated Google is still reeling in advertisers on the heels of the May introduction of an artificial intelligence feature that produces conversational responses to people’s search queries while downplaying its traditional display of related links to other websites.\n\nAlthough the change sparked fear and outrage among online publishers worried their traffic will plummet, Google is still thriving and propelling Alphabet’s success.\n\nAlphabet’s revenue for the April-June period climbed 14% from the same time last year to $84.74 billion. The Mountain View, California, earned $23.62 billion, or $1.89 per share, a 29% increase from the same time last year. It marked fourth-consecutive quarter that Alphabet’s year-over-year revenue growth has surpassed 10%, although the pace during the April-June period slowed slightly from the January-March span.\n\nThe performance for the most-recent quarter exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors, according to FactSet Research.\n\nAlphabet’s stock price rose slightly in extended trading after the report came out. The shares have surged by 30% so far this year, largely riding the excitement surrounding the money-making opportunities afforded by the rise of AI — a field that Google is trying to mine through its DeepMind division and Gemini technology.",

        "title": "2 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Ready for a Bull Run",
        "content": "It seems virtually impossible to talk about tech without artificial intelligence (AI) being one of the first subjects that pops up. It's not a new technology, but recent developments have shined unprecedented light on it and worked wonders for the stock prices of many companies even remotely dealing with AI.\n\nDespite the AI-fueled runs for many stocks, there are still chances for many companies to experience continued growth. The following two companies, in particular, are prime targets worth considering for your portfolio. Each has had an impressive year but more could be left in the tank.\n\n1. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) is known for the semiconductors and networking hardware it manufactures, so it may surprise some to see it placed in an article about AI. However, Broadcom plays an important role in the AI ecosystem, which has drawn investors to the stock and pushed it up an impressive amount in the past year.\n\nBroadcom's role in AI is best described by working backward, beginning with how AI models are trained. For AI to be effective, it needs to be trained using massive amounts of data that can't be stored by traditional means. Instead, this data must be kept and processed in data centers.\n\nInside these data centers are optical connections, networking chips, and accelerators that are responsible for transferring massive amounts of data quickly and reliably. And guess who manufactures many of those items? Broadcom.\n\nAI-related revenue is a small part of Broadcom's revenue -- $3.1 billion of the $12.5 billion it generated in the second quarter -- but this number will surely increase in the coming years. In 2021, AI revenue was less than 5% of Broadcom's semiconductor solutions revenue. It expects this number to jump to 25% by the end of this year. AVGO Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWhile Broadcom benefits from AI-fueled growth, it's not totally dependent on it, which is great news in the event of a downturn in the AI market.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) played an important role in bringing AI to what it is today. Google Brain was a deep learning research project that contributed to advancements in machine learning, and DeepMind (which Alphabet acquired in 2015) is known for its leading AI research.\n\nAfter a couple of initial blunders -- like its generative AI tool, Bard, returning inaccurate information in a promotional ad -- Alphabet took a lot of flack for lagging behind despite seemingly having a head start. It's since taken steps to address these concerns, such as rebranding Bard to Gemini, a more comprehensive and reliable generative AI tool.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle advertising is by far Alphabet's biggest revenue generator, accounting for $61.7 billion of the company's $80.5 billion in revenue in Q1. This could see a boost with the introduction of AI Overviews, which are responses that sometimes appear at the top of Google searches. It may take away from Alphabet's revenue from users clicking on search ads, but it opens additional revenue opportunities with the new format.\n\nAdvertising aside, Alphabet's cloud platform, Google Cloud, stands to gain a lot from recent developments. With an 11% market share, it lags behind Amazon Web Services (31%) and Microsoft Azure (25%), but it's picking up encouraging momentum in scale and profitability. In Q1, Google Cloud revenue grew 28% from a year ago to $9.6 billion, and its operating income increased by over 370% to $900 million. GOOGL Operating Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAlphabet is reportedly in talks to buy cybersecurity start-up Wiz for $23 billion, which would mark its biggest acquisition ever, beating out the $12.5 billion it paid for Motorola in 2012. Wiz uses AI to provide cybersecurity solutions, and this addition should surely boost Google Cloud's appeal to its enterprise customers.\n\nGoogle Cloud has a long way to go before its importance is anywhere near Alphabet's advertising business, but it should be a huge growth area for Alphabet going forward. Add in the company's relatively low valuation (compared to other Magnificent Seven stocks) and Alphabet seems like a bargain primed for a run in the near future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Buying Up This Winning Artificial Intelligence Stock Instead",
        "content": "You might be surprised to learn that Nvidia isn't the most widely owned megacap tech stock owned by the most prominent hedge fund billionaires. According to our research, that title belongs to Google parent company Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). The stock is owned by 11 of the top 16 billionaire-run hedge funds.\n\nIt isn't just the most notable hedge funds that are putting tons of capital into Alphabet. According to Whale Wisdom, which tracks the 13-F filings of thousands of hedge funds and institutional investors, 1,693 filers added shares of Nvidia during the first quarter, the latest for which complete data is available. That's a lot, but makes sense given the surge in AI hype. However, 1,993 of the tracked 13-F filers added shares of Alphabet during the same period. And those are just the stats for Alphabet's Class A shares.\n\nThere's a lot to like about Alphabet\n\nAlphabet derives virtually all of its revenue from its Google subsidiary, with the bulk coming from the Google Services segment. This consists of the massively dominant Google Search platform, as well as Gmail, YouTube, Chrome, Android, and a ton of adjacent apps and platforms. Google's platforms are a major part of the daily lives of billions of people around the world. In fact, I used no fewer than four separate Google-owned apps while researching and writing this article.\n\nDon't make the mistake of thinking these parts of Alphabet's business are maxed out. Even though businesses like Search and Android have dominant market shares, AI advancement could help make the company's advertising business more effective. In fact, YouTube ad revenue was one of the biggest growth drivers in the most recent quarter.\n\nThere's also the Google Cloud segment, its cloud services component, which is a direct competitor to Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure. It currently has the No. 3 market share, but it has been gaining on its larger rivals, plus the market opportunity itself is growing rapidly -- especially as AI technology evolves. In fact, the cloud computing market is expected to grow to $2.5 trillion by 2032, roughly five times its 2022 size. Even if Alphabet simply maintains its share of the market, that's a big tailwind.\n\nAlphabet is a cash-rich, high-margin business that continues to grow rapidly (and not just in the cloud business). It has about $108 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet and generated $74 billion in net income last year alone. It has produced a 26% net margin over the past four quarters. Its revenue grew by 15% year over year in the first quarter, with earnings soaring at an even faster rate, and there's a long history of steady growth, even in difficult environments. Last but certainly not least, Alphabet just announced its first-ever dividend and authorized a $70 billion share buyback.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to Google, Alphabet has its \"other bets\" segment that includes several earlier-stage start-ups. Self-driving technology company Waymo is the most notable, but there are others.\n\nAI potential with a down-to-Earth valuation\n\nEven though it's at its 52-week high, there's a solid case to be made that Alphabet is the most attractive of the Magnificent Seven stocks right now. With massive margins, tons of cash, an enormous opportunity to grow its cloud services business, and a reasonable P/E of below 30 despite growing earnings by 27% year over year in 2023, Alphabet could be a smart AI stock to consider right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Got $5,000? 2 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "The technology sector has helped lead the market higher not only this year but really for the past decade. This can be seen in the performance of an index such as the Dow Jones Technology Index, which is up over 27% year to date and has generated an average annual return of 20% over the past 10 years.\n\nAs such, the tech sector is certainly not only for traders, but also for long-term buy and hold investors. Let's look at two tech stocks that investors can buy and hold for the long term.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nOnce considered to be a stodgy, old-fashioned tech company, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has repositioned itself to become one of the top tech companies leading the charge in artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, the company's ability to be able to reinvent itself over the years is one reason why it is a great stock to buy and hold.\n\nMicrosoft's first big move showing its ability to adapt to the times was shifting from a one-time purchase model to a subscription model, with the introduction of Microsoft 365 starting back in 2013. The gradual nature with which the company did this proved to be a strong growth driver while not alienating its customer base.\n\nMore recently, Microsoft has shown itself to be at the forefront of AI, making an early investment in OpenAI and then later substantially increasing that investment and partnering with the company to incorporate its technology throughout its various product offers. Thus far, the company's Azure cloud computing segment has been a big beneficiary of this early move, as customers clamored to build out their AI applications with the help of Azure. Given Azure's consumption-based model, where customers pay for what they need, this has led to strong growth for Azure and the business taking share from competitors.\n\nMicrosoft has also shown a willingness to take big swings with acquisitions over the years, including with LinkedIn, GitHub, and Activision Blizzard. GitHub has been a strong performer for for the company, and it too has been a nice beneficiary of AI, with the introduction of GitHub AI assistant copilots to the developer platform helping drive 45% growth for the platform in the first quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhile not currently on many investors' radars when looking at Microsoft, it will be interesting to see what the company does with AI when it comes to Xbox and Activision Blizzard when it releases its next video gaming console in a few years. There could be a lot of growth in store in a few years, given the potential advancement AI will have in gaming.\n\nTrading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of under 33 times and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of under 0.9 times, the stock looks attractively priced, given its long-term growth potential and its monopoly-like dominance in the worker productivity (Word, Excel, etc.) and PC operating system (Windows) spaces.\n\nStory continues MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nSimilar to Microsoft, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a monopoly-like dominant market position, but instead of worker productivity tools, it is winning with Google search, which has an estimated over 90% global market share. Like Microsoft, Alphabet's cloud computing segment is nicely benefiting from the AI boom.\n\nThe similarities with Microsoft don't end there, as Alphabet has also made shrewd acquisitions. The best example of this is the company buying YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion. YouTube generated $8.1 billion in revenue just in the first quarter of 2024, so it's pretty safe to say it was a great acquisition.\n\nAlphabet is currently rumored to be close to acquiring Israeli cybersecurity company Wiz for around $23 billion. If consummated, the deal is expected to give Alphabet a needed security piece to help it win more cloud computing and AI deals.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's core search business has a lot of potential to profit from AI. The company is already experimenting with AI overlays to answer some search-related questions, as well as with ways to monetize this new feature. While it has run into some early AI hiccups, AI overlays still open up a potential avenue to serve ads to the large percentage of search results where it does not provide them. Traditionally, the company only serves ad results to about 20% of its search queries and is only paid when these links are clicked.\n\nTrading at 23.5 times forward earnings and a PEG ratio of less than 0.8 times, Alphabet's stock is cheap. Given the potential growth in front of it and its dominant market position in search, the stock looks like a great technology stock to buy and hold for the long term.

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Tom Westbrook\n\nMarkets mostly took Joe Biden's withdrawal from the U.S. presidential race in their stride, flicking the switch from politics back to focus on earnings and interest rates.\n\nIn the U.S., a September rate cut is all but locked in to prices, and in Europe a 25 basis-point cut is expected in October.\n\nEuro zone consumer confidence figures and U.S. existing home sales, both due on Tuesday, are unlikely to shift that outlook.\n\nRather, as stock markets stabilise following a sharp selloff in chipmaking companies' shares, traders are expected to take cues from earnings due after the market close for Tesla and Alphabet, the first of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks to report.\n\nTesla's profit margins are expected to have fallen while Alphabet is expected to report a fourth straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth on an uptick in the advertising market.\n\nGoogle on Monday scrapped plans to remove user-tracking cookies from its Chrome browser, under pressure from advertisers who use cookies' data to target advertisements.\n\nAlso reporting after market in the U.S. are Texas Instruments and Visa, while Coca-Cola, General Electric, General Motors and UPS report before trade begins.\n\nIn Europe, defence firm Thales reports in the Paris morning, while Louis Vuitton earnings due after the market will help investors to gauge the pulse of Chinese demand.\n\nLuxury stocks gained after surprise rate cuts in China on Monday but the sector has been suffering from a prolonged downturn in spending in the world's second-biggest economy.\n\nProfit warnings from Burberry and Hugo Boss, combined with a 27% drop in quarterly sales in greater China at Richemont last week, have dashed hopes for a better second half.\n\nAsian markets steadied in a quiet session, where chipmaker stocks tracked a rebound on Wall Street.\n\nKey developments that could influence markets on Tuesday:\n\nEconomics: Europe consumer confidence, U.S. existing home sales, Richmond Fed manufacturing index\n\nEarnings: LVMH, Thales, Coca-Cola, General Electric, General Motors, UPS, Tesla, Google\n\n(By Tom Westbrook; Editing by Edmund Klamann)",

        "title": "Time to Buy Alphabet or IBM Stock as Earnings Approach?",
        "content": "Two tech giants highlighting this week’s busy earnings lineup are Alphabet GOOGL and International Business Machines IBM which are set to report their Q2 results on Tuesday, July 24, and Wednesday, July 25 respectively.\n\nBelonging to the high-performing Magnificent Seven-themed stocks, GOOGL has soared +30% this year to edge the S&P 500 and Nasdaq while IBM’s +12% has slightly trailed the broader indexes. Still, both have outperformed the broader market over the last three years.\n\nThat said, let’s see if it’s time to buy Alphabet or IBM’s stock with each trading at just over $180 a share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlphabet Q2 Expectations\n\nMaking up the majority of its search engine revenue from Google, Alphabet’s Advertising segment sales are thought to have increased 10% during Q2 to $64.27 billion based on Zacks estimates. Another catalyst to Alphabet’s growth has been its Cloud segment revenue which is projected to soar 25% to $10.08 billion.\n\nOverall, Alphabet’s Q2 sales are expected to increase 13% to $70.55 billion versus $62.07 billion in the comparative quarter. Furthermore, earnings are projected to climb 28% to $1.84 per share compared to EPS of $1.44 in Q2 2023.\n\nNotably, Alphabet has surpassed earnings expectations for five consecutive quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 11.34% in its last four quarterly reports. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIBM Q2 Expectations\n\nWhile Alphabet has been one of the most innovative tech companies in the modern age, IBM has begun to evolve itself as a provider of cloud and data platforms.\n\nKnown for its hardware and integrated computer offerings, IBM’s Q2 sales are expected to be slightly up to $15.58 billion versus $15.48 billion in the prior-year quarter. However, Q2 EPS is projected to dip by roughly -1% to $2.16.\n\nIBM has also surpassed earnings expectations for five straight quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 5.2% in its last four quarterly reports. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nValuation Comparison\n\nWith their stocks edging toward $200 and trading at similar price tags, it’s noteworthy that IBM has an 18.5X forward earnings multiple which is a nice discount to the S&P 500’s 23.2X with GOOGL at 23.3X.\n\nIn terms of price to sales, IBM’s P/S ratio is also more reasonable at 2.7X which is beneath the benchmark’s 5.4X, and GOOGL at 7.5X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAhead of their Q2 reports, Alphabet and IBM’s stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While the anticipation of Alphabet’s quarterly growth certainly stands out, IBM’s valuation is very attractive with both companies being sound long-term investments in the tech sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks rose on Tuesday as heavyweight technology stocks rebounded from a recent rout, although Chinese markets lagged as sentiment towards the country showed little improvement.\n\nRegional markets tracked a strong overnight session on Wall Street, which was supported chiefly by a rebound in heavyweight tech shares. Focus was squarely on upcoming quarterly earnings from tech majors Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), due later in the day.\n\nU.S. stock index futures drifted lower in Asian trade, as sentiment still remained weak amid uncertainty over the U.S. presidential elections.\n\nTech supports Asian stocks, but barely\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 index rose 0.2%, while the broader TOPIX added 0.5% on strength in technology stocks. Regional chipmaking stocks in particular tracked a rebound in artificial intelligence major NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nTaiwan shares of TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM), the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, surged 2.7% after losing nearly 7% in the past five sessions. Shares of the firm had taken little support from positive second-quarter earnings.\n\nSouth Korea’s KOSPI added 0.3%. Producer price index inflation data showed factory inflation grew slightly in June.\n\nBut while tech-heavy indexes saw some relief on Tuesday, they were still nursing steep declines over the past week, as bets on interest rate cuts saw investors rotate into sectors more likely to benefit from an economic recovery.\n\nAsian stocks were also battered by weak risk appetite amid increased uncertainty over the U.S. presidential race, after President Joe Biden dropped out and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nRepublican nominee Donald Trump said Harris will be easier to defeat. He was also seen polling ahead of Biden and Harris according to CBS and HarrisX data, although this was prior to Biden’s pulling out.\n\nA rotation into economically sensitive sectors still remained in play on Tuesday. Australia’s ASX 200 added 0.7% on gains in heavyweight banks and mining stocks.\n\nFutures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a mildly positive open, as a weak rupee and optimism over the Indian economy kept the index and the BSE Sensex 30 near record highs.\n\nThe Indian government is also set to present its budget for 2024 later in the day, which may spark some volatility in local markets.\n\nChinese stocks lag as economic uncertainty, Trump fears persist\n\nChina’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Hang Seng index shed 0.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSentiment towards China showed little signs of improving despite a surprise interest rate cut by the People’s Bank of China on Monday, with analysts stating that the cut was too small to make too much difference.\n\nThe Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party largely underwhelmed investors, as Beijing unveiled few details on plans for more stimulus.\n\nBut a main point of weight on Chinese markets was speculation over a Trump presidency. Trump has maintained a largely hardline stance against China, and could impose more trade restrictions, drawing ire from Beijing.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks buoyed by tech rebound; China lags\n\nCybersecurity firm Wiz walks away from $23 billion deal with Google, memo says\n\nAnalysis-Drug giants eye China for deals despite growing Sino-US tensions",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Google (GOOG) is planning to keep third-party cookies in its Chrome browser, it said on Monday, after years of pledging to phase out the tiny packets of code meant to track users on the internet.\n\nThe major reversal follows concerns from advertisers - the company's biggest source of income - saying the loss of cookies in the world's most popular browser will limit their ability to collect information for personalizing ads, making them dependent on Google's user databases.\n\nThe UK's Competition and Markets Authority had also scrutinized Google's plan over concerns it would impede competition in digital advertising.\n\n\"Instead of deprecating third-party cookies, we would introduce a new experience in Chrome that lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, and they'd be able to adjust that choice at any time,\" Anthony Chavez, vice president of the Google-backed Privacy Sandbox initiative, said in a blog post.\n\nSince 2019, the Alphabet unit has been working on the Privacy Sandbox initiative aimed at enhancing online privacy while supporting digital businesses, with a key goal being the phase-out of third-party cookies.\n\nCookies are packets of information that allow websites and advertisers to identify individual web surfers and track their browsing habits, but they can also be used for unwanted surveillance.\n\nIn the European Union, the use of cookies is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which stipulates that publishers secure explicit consent from users to store their cookies. Major browsers also give the option to delete cookies on command.\n\nChavez said Google was working with regulators such as the UK's CMA and Information Commissioner's Office as well as publishers and privacy groups on the new approach, while continuing to invest in the Privacy Sandbox program.\n\nThe announcement drew mixed reactions.\n\n\"Advertising stakeholders will no longer have to prepare to quit third-party cookies cold turkey,\" eMarketer analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf said in a statement.\n\nLena Cohen, staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said cookies can lead to consumer harm, for instance predatory ads that target vulnerable groups. \"Google's decision to continue allowing third-party cookies, despite other major browsers blocking them for years, is a direct consequence of their advertising-driven business model,\" Cohen said in a statement.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik and Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Devika Syamnath)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google said it plans to give people who use its Chrome web browser the option to choose a more privacy-sensitive experience, rather than phasing out cookies, the software that lets marketers track users.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Risks Getting Tables Turned on Him With New 2024 Adversary Harris Has Enough Delegates to Clinch Nomination for President Harris Wins Soros Backing While Other Billionaire Donors Want an Open Contest A Brief History of Kamala Harris and Her Politics Joe Biden Bows to Democrats Who Wanted Him Out, Upending US Politics\n\nIn a blog post, the company said it had made the decision after considering the impact that eliminating cookies would have on publishers, advertisers and others involved in the sprawling digital ad business.\n\n“We are proposing an updated approach that elevates user choice,” Anthony Chavez, a vice president at Google, wrote Monday in the blog post. “Instead of deprecating third-party cookies, we would introduce a new experience in Chrome that lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, and they’d be able to adjust that choice at any time.”\n\nThe move marks a major shift for Google, which for years has worked to implement Privacy Sandbox, its plan to replace cookies with other tools for advertisers. The company said it will continue to offer those tools to developers.\n\nThe UK Competition and Markets Authority, which regulates the tech industry, said Monday that it will gather comments on Google’s new approach until Aug. 12. The agency said earlier this year that it was reviewing Google’s plans after fielding more concerns about it.\n\n“Google has confirmed a new approach to third-party cookies. Instead of removing them from Chrome, it will introduce a user-choice prompt,” the CMA wrote on social network X. “We’re considering the impact of this announcement and welcome views.”\n\nThe CMA has been in talks with Google for years over its planned phase-out of third-party cookies. The agency had earlier probed the company’s proposal to eliminate the cookies used by publishers and advertiser to track users and measure the success of advertising campaigns, saying it was concerned that the changes could “impede competition in digital advertising markets.”\n\nSome privacy advocates expressed disappointment with Google’s move.\n\n“Regulators, consumers and even brands have recognized the privacy issues associated with cookies and have been working toward more privacy-friendly solutions,” Adam Schenkel, an executive vice president at GumGum, an ad tech company that focuses on delivering ads without personal data, wrote in an email. “Google’s decision is shortsighted, especially as it relates to privacy.”\n\nStory continues\n\n--With assistance from Lynn Doan.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Airbnb Hosts Want Guests to Come to Them Directly The Zombie Mall King Doesn’t Want to Be a Bottom-Feeder Forever Five Questions With Apollo Global Co-Founder Josh Harris Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures fell slightly in evening deals on Monday, steadying after a sharp rebound on Wall Street as investors returned to technology stocks ahead of key earnings from the sector.\n\nWall Street indexes were still trading well below record highs hit last week, as a mix of profit-taking and rotation into more economically-sensitive sectors battered tech in recent sessions.\n\nThe second quarter earnings season is now widely expected to dictate tech’s trajectory in the coming weeks.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.1% to 5,605.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.2% to 19,955.75 points by 19:51 ET (23:51 GMT). Dow Jones Futures were flat at 40,680.0 points.\n\nAlphabet, Tesla set to report Q2 earnings\n\nFocus was now squarely on upcoming earnings prints from tech majors Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), due on Tuesday.\n\nAlphabet is set to offer more cues on how Wall Street’s internet giants are benefiting from artificial intelligence, as well as how much they are spending on developing the new technology.\n\nTesla’s earnings are set to show how the electric vehicle maker is navigating a sharp decrease in demand, while focus will also be on its promises of AI-driven autonomous driving and robotaxis.\n\nBeyond the two tech giants, a slew of other Wall Street majors are set to report on Tuesday, including Visa Inc (NYSE:V), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), United Parcel Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and Freeport-McMoran Copper&Gold Inc (NYSE:FCX).\n\nWall St benefits from tech rebound, but uncertainties persist\n\nA large rotation back into technology stocks saw Wall Street rebound on Monday, although benchmark indexes still remained well below recent peaks.\n\nThe S&P 500 jumped 1.1% to 5,564.41 points, while the NASDAQ Composite surged 1.6% to 18,007.57 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% to 40,415.44 points.\n\nGrowing optimism that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September saw investors pivot into sectors more likely to benefit from an economic recovery.\n\nBut uncertainty over the U.S. political outlook increased after President Joe Biden said he will not seek reelection, instead endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nRecent polls showed Republican nominee Donald Trump was polling ahead of Biden and Harris, although it was unclear whether Harris’ nomination will shift this trend.\n\nSpeculation over a Trump presidency also drove flows into economically sensitive sectors.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures dip after tech rebound; Alphabet, Tesla earnings loom\n\nUS congressional panel calls on CrowdStrike CEO to testify on outage\n\nPorsche lowers 2024 outlook, warns of impairments on alloy shortage",

        "content": "Three Ridiculously Overbought REITs: Buy Now Or Wait?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nOn July 11, the June Consumer Price Index (CPI) came below street expectations at 0.1%. Over the past six trading days, large institutions have been selling large, big-winner tech stocks such as NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and redistributing money into interest-sensitive defensive stocks such as real estate investment trusts (REITs).\n\nThis flow of new money has caused many REITs to soar in price, which has been a boon for long-suffering REIT investors. The Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VNQ), with nine REITs in its top ten holdings, has risen 5.42% since the CPI was released.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nThe CEOs of Uber and Salesforce are so impressed with this platform they put their own money behind it. Join them, invest in private credit, and earn 7-9% APY. Triple-net properties can put a check in your pocket every quarter—a can’t-miss opportunity for accredited investors.\n\nHowever, nothing goes straight up and many of these REITs are now in \"overbought\" territory, meaning they are temporarily overvalued. This can be seen by using technical analysis indicators such as the 14-period RSI and the Full Stochastic Oscillator. These are momentum indicators that analyze overbought or oversold conditions.\n\nA stock is considered overbought when the RSI moves over 70. The higher the number, the more overbought it is. When the Full Stochastic climbs above 80, it too signals an overbought stock.\n\nOverbought doesn't automatically mean the stock will crash tomorrow. It simply indicates that the stock has reached a level where the risk of correction now outweighs the potential for further appreciation. When stocks become overbought, many investors profit, causing share prices to decline.\n\nTake a look at three surging REITs whose technical numbers are now through the roof and could be ripe for pullbacks. Investors may want to wait for lower prices before making a purchase:\n\nFour Corners Property Trust\n\nFour Corners Property TrustInc. (NYSE:FCPT) is a diversified REIT based in Mill Valley, CA. Its focus is on owning net-leased restaurants, medical and dental services, automotive services, and other retail properties in the Sunbelt regions of the U.S.\n\nFour Corners was created in November 2015 with 418 restaurants spun out from Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI). As time has progressed, many of the Darden properties have been sold off, but Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants still make up about 47% of Four Corners' total rents. In 2023, Four Corners disposed of several underperforming Red Lobster properties.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the past seven years, Four Corners has steadily acquired more diversified properties. Its most recent total portfolio was 1,115 long-term leased properties with 149 brands across 47 states. Almost 20% of its properties are now comprised of medical, retail, and auto service tenants. It has continued acquiring restaurants outside of Darden brands, such as Chili's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cheddar's, KFC, Taco Bell, and Burger King.\n\nIts latest acquisition was on July 18, when Four Corners announced the acquisition of a Buffalo Wild Wings property in Texas for $2.5 million.\n\nAs of May 2024, Four Corners had a very strong occupancy rate of 99.6% with a weighted annual lease term (WALT) of 7.6 years. Its portfolio is mostly located in suburban, fast-growing areas. Less than 6.4% of its rental income matures before 2027.\n\nOn July 8, JMP Securities analyst Mitch Germain initiated coverage on Four Corners with a Market Perform rating. No price target was announced.\n\nFour Corners has gained 7.26% since the CPI was released. However, at its recent close at $27.05, the 14-period RSI was at 82.54 and the Full Stochastic was at 93.22.\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate.\n\nRealty Income Corp\n\nRealty Income Corp (NYSE:O) is a San Diego-based, triple-net lease REIT with over 15,450 properties worldwide. The \"Monthly Dividend Company,\" as it's widely known, is a member of the S&P 500 and an S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat.\n\nRealty Income remains one of the foremost REITs today and with good reason. Its total return since January 1995 is 1,246.32%. Its consistently increasing monthly dividend helps retirees and other income investors pay regular expenses.\n\nOn June 3, Realty Income announced it had revised its 2024 guidance for Normalized FFO from $4.17-$4.29 to $4.19-$4.28 per share. AFFO guidance was also increased from $4.13-$4.21 to $4.15-$4.21.\n\nOn July 18, UBS analyst Brent Dilts maintained Realty Income at Buy and raised the price target from $61 to $68.\n\nRealty Income has been a stalwart REIT for decades, and income investors enjoy its monthly dividend, which has increased for 107 consecutive quarters since the IPO in 1994. The forward annual dividend of $3.156 presently yields 5.47%.\n\nThe stock is up 7.75% since the CPI was released. However, at its recent close of $57.73, the 14-period RSI was recently at 78.30 and the Stochastic was 94.91.\n\nInvestors who wish to add shares might be wise to wait for a pullback in price.\n\nCheck Out One Of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\n\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\n\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over a 2-year period starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

All rights reserved.\n\nTerreno Realty Corp\n\nTerreno Realty Corp (NYSE:TRNO) is a San Francisco-based Industrial REIT that owns and operates 290 properties of 17.4 million square feet in six major coastal U.S. markets. Those areas are Miami, Northern New Jersey/New York City, Washington D.C., Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Terrene's occupancy as of March 31 was 98.1%.\n\nTerrene has a superior long-term growth record. Its 14-year total return is 325.09%, or 409.55% if dividends were reinvested.\n\nLike the aforementioned REITs, Terreno has performed quite well since the release of the CPI, having gained 6.98% from July 11-18. Because of that success, the 14-period RSI reached 78.62, and the Stochastic was 82.15.\n\nMany REITs have had similar gains lately, and a few others, such as Kimco Realty Corp (NYSE:KIM) and Service Properties Trust (NASDAQ:SVC), now have very high RSI and Full Stochastic numbers as well. Investors should always be cautious when technical indicators reach overbought levels. An important reminder is to let the market come to you rather than chasing runaway prices.\n\nCheck Out One Of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\n\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\n\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over a 2-year period starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

        "title": "Google parent Alphabet to report Q2 earnings Tuesday with AI, ad spending front and center",
        "content": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) will report its fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, giving Wall Street a closer look at the state of the digital advertising market and whether generative AI hype is translating to revenue growth. The tech giant is coming off of an impressive first quarter during which it announced it initiated its first dividend of $0.20 per share and authorized stock repurchases of $70 billion.\n\nAlphabet shares are up 30% year to date. Shares of rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are up 18% and 22% year to date, respectively. All three companies are pouring money into building out their generative AI capabilities, spending lavishly on data centers capable of powering the AI models they offer via their cloud service platforms.\n\nFor the quarter, analysts are anticipating earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue of $84.35 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would be a major jump from the same period last year when the company reported earnings per share of $1.44 on revenue of $74.6 billion.\n\nWall Street expects advertising revenue to top $64.5 billion, up from $58.1 billion last year. That includes year-over-year increases in Google Search & other, YouTube ads, and Google Network revenue, pointing to a positive advertising environment. A beat by Alphabet could also buoy shares of ad business rival Meta (META).\n\nIn an investor note, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said he expects advertising spending to be similar to or better than Q1, with Google paid search growth in the mid-teens.\n\n“Fundamentals remain healthy, with solid ad spend, potential benefits from Olympics and elections,” Thill wrote.\n\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt struck a similarly upbeat tone in his investor note. “We think the setup remains positive heading into 2Q results with our ad survey and agency commentary pointing to continued strength for Google Search,” he wrote.

(Photo by GLENN CHAPMAN/AFP via Getty Images) (GLENN CHAPMAN via Getty Images)\n\nOn the cloud front, Wall Street is anticipating Google Cloud revenue of $10.1 billion and operating income of $982.2 million. That would mark an increase from the $8 billion in revenue and $395 million in operating income the company reported in Q2 2023.\n\nGoogle still trails both Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud space, with its rivals capturing the number one and two spots, respectively. However, the segment continues to grow, and Alphabet is banking on its investments in generative AI to help power stronger revenue and customer acquisition in the future.\n\nBut when exactly AI starts to generate revenue for Google’s Cloud business, let alone its ad segment, is still up in the air.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It is still too early to count on AI benefits as most [companies] remain in pilot mode, and material AI [revenue] is more likely a 2025-26 event,” Thill wrote.\n\nAs for Google’s search business, Devitt says AI search overviews could create “incremental engagement and may become a tailwind for Search monetization over time.”\n\nGoogle is still trying to find its footing with AI Overview, the generative AI feature that shows up at the top of Google Search results pages. In May, the company rolled out the search function, only for users to quickly discover that its answers weren’t always accurate, with now famous responses telling users to put glue in their pizza or to eat a rock every day. Google responded by pulling back some of the gen AI features.\n\nWhile generative AI is sure to be a major theme this earnings season, it’s still unclear how much it will boost companies' bottom lines. But with Google the first among Big Tech companies to report earnings, it should give us some indication of whether the technology is generating meaningful revenue or not.

        "title": "Investors Rotate Out of Tech Just Ahead of Big Tech Earnings",
        "content": "What does the rotation out of tech mean for tech earnings?\n\nLast week began with investors continuing to rotate out of tech after a massive growth year thus far, and ended with a broader sell-off. With tech earnings on deck, that may change if results support the rich valuations for sported by many of those mega tech names. The Nasdaq fell 4% last week while the S&P 500 was down over 2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended just about flat after rallying more than 700 points on Tuesday, its best day in over a year.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with DIS.\n\nCurrently, S&P 500 Communication Services and Information Technology, two of the sectors taking the biggest hits last week (along with Consumer Discretionary), are expected to be the leaders of second-quarter earnings season. Investors may be waiting to see if earnings results will justify high price-earnings levels. With expectations so high, these names will likely have to put up healthy beats to impress shareholders.\n\nAccording to FactSet, the current consensus for S&P 500 earnings per share growth is for 9.70% year over year, an increase from 9.30% last week.[1] Thus far, 80% of companies that have reported have surpassed analyst profit estimates, while only 62% have beaten on revenue.[2]\n\nCEO uncertainty remains high\n\nAfter falling to its lowest level in its nine years in the first quarter of 2024, the Late Earnings Report Index, our proprietary measure of CEO uncertainty, is back up for the second quarter in a row for the third quarter.\n\nThe LERI tracks outlier earnings date changes among publicly traded companies with market capitalizations of $250 million and higher. The LERI has a baseline reading of 100, anything above that indicates companies are feeling uncertain about their current and short-term prospects. A LERI reading under 100 suggests companies feel they have a pretty good crystal ball for the near term.\n\nThe official pre-peak season LERI reading for the second quarter (data collected in the third quarter) stands at 161, well above the baseline reading, suggesting companies are feeling less certain about economic conditions than they were at the beginning of the year. Some of that uncertainty was evident in banking commentary made over the last couple of weeks. As of July 12, there were 66 late outliers and 37 early outliers. Investors Rotate Out of Tech Just Ahead of Big Tech Earnings\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nBig tech on deck\n\nThis week we start to get results from several Magnificent Seven and other big tech names including: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). This comes just as investor's start to rotate out of these mega-cap winners into smaller names that they believe will benefit more greatly from interest rate cuts potentially coming as soon as next month.\n\nStory continues Investors Rotate Out of Tech Just Ahead of Big Tech Earnings\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nLate earnings date confirmation\n\nWhen a company is late to confirm their quarterly earnings date, it could be valuable information for current or prospective inventors to know.\n\nReleased in 2022, Wall Street Horizon's Confirmation Timing uses historical data to project an expected confirmation date and the normal range that enables the identification of:\n\nCompanies that have not yet confirmed an earnings date and are materially late compared to their historical trends and behaviors. Announced earnings dates in which the Confirmation Timing is materially earlier or later than the company's historical average of the same quarter.\n\nCompanies that tend to stall on confirming their earnings dates also tend to set later-than-usual earnings dates, which academic research has shown highly correlates to bad news being shared on the call.[3]\n\n??The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)\n\nIn recent years, Disney has confirmed its second-quarter earnings date around July 5 with a standard deviation of +/- 3.70 days. The company ended up confirming its second-quarter earnings date, Aug. 7 BMO, on July 18, which was 14 days past the mean confirmation day. While the earnings date itself is within the historical range of expected earnings dates, the delay in confirming that date could point to a hesitant management team.\n\nEarlier in the year Disney was embroiled in a proxy battle which ended in April as the entertainment behemoth fended off activist investor Nelson Peltz (Trades, Portfolio), who attempted to secure board seats. Following a vote at its annual shareholder meeting, the company announced the current Disney board would remain as is.[4]\n\nSecond-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis season peak weeks will fall between July 22 and Aug. 16, with each week expected to see over 1,000 reports. Currently Aug. 8 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,445 companies anticipated to report. Thus far only 60% of companies have confirmed their earnings date (out of our universe of 11,000-plus global names), so this is subject to change. The remaining dates are estimated based on historical reporting data.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks That Could Be Worth More Than Nvidia 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Nvidia is significantly larger than almost every company in the world. However, that doesn't mean it will necessarily stay that way. A lot can happen over five years, and I think two companies will pass Nvidia in size over the next five years: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Both happen to be involved in artificial intelligence (AI) as well, and I think they make for better buys than Nvidia right now.\n\nNvidia's lead over these two isn't insurmountable\n\nFirst, let's figure out how much of a head start Nvidia has on these two companies. While Nvidia is third in the world's largest company race, Alphabet and Amazon are fourth and fifth, respectively. So, predicting these two will be larger than Nvidia isn't an outlandish bet. Alphabet's and Amazon's stocks would need to rise by 29% and 48%, respectively, to surpass Nvidia. Over five years, this isn't too much of a gap to close.\n\nBut what makes these two better picks than Nvidia? For the record, Nvidia is the best AI company right now. That doesn't mean it will stay in that position over the next five years. Any company involved in the AI arms race is currently loading up on graphics processing units (GPUs) made by Nvidia. This is to equip themselves with the most powerful computing devices available on the market so they can create accurate AI models quickly.\n\nEventually, this demand will be satisfied, and Nvidia's revenue may retract as fewer companies create new AI-dedicated servers and replace them when they are worn out. After this phase, much of the demand will center around who can provide AI models or infrastructure to run them on.\n\nAlphabet and Amazon are massive players in the cloud computing industry, so this sets them up well for the next phase of AI investing. Cloud computing is a vital platform in AI proliferation because it allows companies that don't have the means or the need for a supercomputer at all times to run heavy workloads like AI models. By outsourcing these workloads over the cloud to platforms like Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services (AWS), more companies have access to the computing power they need to run AI models.\n\nAdditionally, each has AI development tools and generative AI models that developers can access through these cloud platforms. Cloud computing will be the next primary beneficiary of the AI gold rush, and it's already seeing strong demand.\n\nCloud computing business had a strong Q1\n\nEven before AI became a huge draw to these platforms, cloud computing excelled. However, each company has been doing phenomenally recently. In the cloud computing world, three stand out: AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud (ranked in terms of market share).\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS has a massive market lead over its competitors due to its first-mover advantage, and the mature business unit produces some outstanding numbers. In the first quarter, AWS had sales of $25 billion, with an operating income of $9.4 billion. That equates to an outstanding 38% operating profit margin, which shows how profitable these platforms can get when they have reached a mature state.\n\nGoogle Cloud is much smaller. Its revenue was $9.6 billion in Q1, growing at a 28% pace, and its operating margin was 9%. This shows how much room Google Cloud has to expand its margins, so this could become a large profit driver over the next few years.\n\nCloud computing will be the next primary beneficiary of the AI movement. As a result, I think the big three in cloud computing will be worth more than Nvidia five years from now (even though Microsoft is already larger than Nvidia).\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 weekly preview: Spotlight on GDP, PCE data and earnings",
        "content": "U.S. stocks ended Friday trading in the red as Wall Street concluded a week characterized by a shift from this year’s megacap winners to smaller names.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell by 0.71%, closing at 5,505.00. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.81%, ending at 17,726.94. The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased by 377.49 points, or 0.93%, to 40,287.53.\n\nFriday’s declines were widespread, with the Russell 2000 also down by 0.63%. Despite this, the focus on stocks expected to benefit more from potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, such as small caps, remained prominent throughout the week.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced their largest weekly losses since April, falling by 1.97% and 3.65%, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also ended a six-week winning streak. On the other hand, the Dow gained 0.72%, and the small-cap index Russell 2000 rose by 1.68%.\n\nThe upcoming week promises to be eventful, with several key economic indicators set to be released. The main focus will likely be on the preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) data for the second quarter, scheduled for Thursday, with many economists expecting an uptick.\n\nFurthermore, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, one of the Fed’s preferred inflation gauges, will be released on Friday.\n\n“We expect a modest acceleration from the 1.5% growth pace in 1Q to 2.0% last quarter,” JPMorgan economists said in a note.\n\n“Friday’s June core PCE inflation report is expected to show a 0.2%m/m increase in prices last month, leaving the year-ago increase unchanged at 2.6%,” they added.\n\nApart from this, investors will closely monitor the presidential election, especially following Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race. His decision opens the possibility of an open convention, although the consensus is that U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is the frontrunner for the nomination.\n\nAlphabet and Tesla to report earnings this week\n\nAs earnings season begins, the tech-focused S&P 500 faces challenges not only from the rotation into small caps but also from potential selling pressure from trend followers.\n\nThis week, several big S&P 500 companies are set to unveil their latest quarterly performance, and with the current high expectations, any misses could prompt trend followers to sell off their stretched long positions accumulated over the past two months, and weigh further on the benchmark index.\n\nTech giants including Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) will both report on Tuesday, and will likely capture the majority of the spotlight. In addition, Visa (NYSE:V), Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), 3M, and chipmaker Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) will also report earnings in the coming days.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nJPMorgan: “Mag-7 EPS growth projections remain punchy, but are set to decelerate somewhat. SPX ex Mag-7 earnings are projected to be positive at +5% y/y, for the first time in 5 quarters. However, we note that the convergence in the earnings delivery was the expectation in each of the last 5 reporting seasons, but the end result was always a bigger positive surprise for Mag-7 than for the rest of the market. This could be the case in the current reporting season, yet again. Within Tech, we reiterate the call from last month to move away from hardware/semis, and into software, on lower yields, on geopolitical uncertainty and given strong past outperformance of Semis.\n\nUBS: “Our base case that the S&P 500 ends the year around 5,900, modestly higher than the current 5,505, would hold in most political scenarios— barring a Democratic sweep of power that leads to higher corporate taxes, or a scenario in which former President Trump imposes trade tariffs that are as high as proposed in his campaign speeches. We consider either outcome unlikely at present. In addition, we believe the positive outlook for top US tech companies is likely to more than offset political uncertainty.”\n\nWells Fargo: “President Biden has withdrawn from the presidential election following the continued erosion of his support and has endorsed VP Harris as the nominee. Could see modest give-back of \"Trump Trade\" but path likely becomes data-dependent from there.”\n\nLynx Equity Strategies: “We think the sell-off from last week is likely to reverse somewhat this week. The SOX (vs. SPX outperformance) has cut below a reliable level. The fate of the sector will of course be decided by the earnings reports, the bulk of which arrive only next week.”\n\n“Triggering FDPR is a major change in US trade policy towards nations allied with the US. We think it is unlikely the Biden administration makes major changes to trade policy through the remaining portion of its tenure. As such we think investor fears of draconian changes to US policy towards China exports by US and non-US based companies is likely to ebb. We would be buyers of semis/semicap names.”\n\nYardeni Research: “It's all quite confusing since investors have been rotating out of Tech and the Magnificent-7 since July 11 when June's lower-than-expect CPI convinced investors to load up on interest-rate sensitive stocks because the Fed is now widely expected to start lowering interest rates in September. We agree, but we also think that could be a one-and-done rate cut for 2024 because the economy remains resilient. For now, we believe that the stock market was overbought and is experiencing a minor selloff.”\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTSX opens higher after Biden opts out of election race\n\nWall St opens higher as investors assess U.S. election after Biden exit",

        "content": "The consensus call for narrowing the earnings gap between Magnificent 7 stocks and the rest of the S&P 500 may still be overly optimistic, JPMorgan strategists said in a Monday note.\n\nThe bank highlighted that this recurring expectation has not materialized in the last five reporting seasons, with the Mag-7 consistently delivering larger positive earnings per share (EPS) surprises compared to the broader market.\n\nIn the current quarter, consensus projections estimate that the Mag-7 will continue to post significant earnings growth, albeit at a decelerated rate of 29% year-over-year, down from 53% in the previous quarter. The rest of the S&P 500 is projected to see a positive earnings growth of 5% year-over-year for the first time in five quarters.\n\nJPMorgan points out that the Mag-7 stocks, which include tech giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), have been the primary contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth for several quarters. However, the market's high valuation and extreme concentration leave little room for any disappointments.\n\n“The consensus is yet again betting on the convergence in earnings between Mag-7 and the rest, but that was disappointed on each of the past 5 occasions,” the note states.\n\n“This could be the case in the current reporting season, yet again,” it added.\n\nMore broadly, the Q2 reporting season is gaining momentum, with sequential activity improvements pointing to better earnings delivery, JPMorgan strategists said.\n\nConsensus estimates for Q2 EPS have seen minimal cuts, just 1% compared to the usual 5% three months prior to results. Analysts forecast a 15% EPS acceleration for the S&P 500 from Q1 to Q4, significantly above historical norms.\n\nSpecifically, Q2 EPS is expected to grow 9% year-over-year. Meanwhile, recent weak consumer data, including a decline in consumer confidence and ongoing weakness in China, suggest mixed company guidance ahead.\n\n“There has been a raft of profit warnings in consumer space in the past weeks, with poor stock reaction, but also in other areas,” strategists wrote.\n\nThey also said defensive sectors are projected to outperform cyclicals in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., Q1 2024 marked the first quarter since Q4 2020 where cyclical EPS growth lagged behind defensives. That trend is expected to continue, supported by falling bond yields and improving relative EPS trends for defensives, which have driven lower-beta leadership in recent months.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJPM: Consensus call for EPS narrowing between Mag-7 and rest may be lacking\n\nStory continues\n\nKorean Air set to order about 20 Boeing 777X jets, sources say\n\nRepublican senator urges defense firm CEOs to safeguard Spirit work",

        "content": "Investing.com -- The volatile U.S. political situation took another turn, with President Joe Biden dropping out of race for re-election. China has attempted to boost its struggling economy but cutting interest rates, while Nvidia is developing an AI chip for the Chinese market.\n\n1. Biden bows out of presidential race; Harris to replace?\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday bowed to what seemed inevitable, and dropped out of the race for re-election amid concerns about his age and health.\n\nBiden backed his Vice President Kamala Harris for the job, putting her in pole position for the nomination which is officially scheduled for the Democratic convention on Aug. 19-22.\n\n\"My intention is to earn and win this nomination,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party — and unite our nation — to defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nThis talk of unity could see the party consider a virtual nomination ahead of the convention, and Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said the party would soon announce the next steps in its nomination process.\n\nGoldman Sachs in a note said they did not expect the Democrats' fiscal and trade policy agenda to shift meaningfully in the event that Harris is the nominee.\n\nHarris could consolidate Black support and bring into sharper focus the differences between the two sides on abortion rights, an issue that has proved significant in other polls.\n\nBut she also faces the full weight of history as she would become the first female and only the second black President, after Barack Obama.\n\n2. Futures edge higher, with tech earnings to the fore\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Monday, bouncing after hefty losses as investors rotated out of the major technology stocks.\n\nBy 04:15 ET (08:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 60 points, or 0.2%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 23 points, or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 125 points, or 0.6%.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell nearly 2% and 3.7%, respectively, marking their biggest weekly losses since April. On the other hand, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.7%.\n\nThe evolving political situation will remain in focus Monday, but there are more important earnings to digest, as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) feature in a busy week for earnings, kicking off results from the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacap group of stocks that have propelled markets since early 2023.\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM), Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are among some of the other big-name companies set to report during the coming week, while Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is set to report later Monday.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Nvidia developing AI chip for Chinese market - Reuters\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is developing a version of its flagship artificial intelligence chips for Chinese markets that will fall in line with U.S. export restrictions, according to a report by Reuters.\n\nThe world’s most valuable chipmaker will work with Inspur, one of its biggest distributors in China, on a chip tentatively called the “B20,” the news agency said.\n\nNvidia’s current AI offerings are geared specifically towards falling in line with U.S. export restrictions on China. But recent reports suggested that its offerings in the country, such as the H20, were seeing weak demand amid heavy competition from local chipmakers, specifically Huawei.\n\nIncreased interest in AI development has sparked a revenue bonanza for Nvidia, boosting the company’s valuation to make it among the most valuable companies on Wall Street.\n\n4. PBOC cuts rates to boost the Chinese economy\n\nThe People’s Bank of China unexpectedly cut its benchmark loan prime rates further into record-low territory on Monday, in an attempt to support the country’s flagging economy.\n\nThe PBOC cut its one-year loan prime rate to 3.35% from 3.45%, while the five-year LPR, which is used to determine mortgage prices, was cut to 3.85% from 3.95%.\n\nThe cuts come just a week after softer-than-expected gross domestic product data for the second quarter ramped up concerns over slowing economic growth, increasing doubts that the central bank’s full-year GDP growth target will be met.\n\nChinese officials had promised more stimulus during the Chinese Communist Party’s Third Plenum last week.\n\nSentiment surrounding Chinese markets remains weak though, amid speculation that Donald Trump will win a second term as U.S. president.\n\nTrump has maintained a largely negative stance towards China. His administration had imposed steep tariffs on China, sparking a trade war with Beijing in the late-2010s.\n\nA second term for Trump could entail a similar scenario, which bodes poorly for the world’s second-largest economy.\n\n5. Crude market to return to surplus next year - Morgan Stanley\n\nCrude prices rose Monday, boosted by a surprise Chinese interest rate cut [see above], which is aimed at boosting the second largest economy in the world.\n\nBy 04:15 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.2% to $78.78 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $82.88 a barrel.\n\nConcerns over sluggish demand in China, the world’s biggest oil importer, have weighed on the market, especially following softer-than-expected growth figures for the second quarter.\n\nThese gains may not last too long though, as although the crude market is currently tight, next year it will likely be in surplus, with Brent prices declining into the mid-to-high $70s range, Morgan Stanley said.\n\nThe tightness will hold for most of the third quarter, the bank said in a note dated on Friday, but equilibrium will return by the fourth quarter, \"when seasonal demand tailwinds abate and both OPEC and non-OPEC supply return to growth.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley said it expects OPEC and non-OPEC supply to grow by about 2.5 million barrels per day in 2025, well ahead of demand growth.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBiden/Harris, Nvidia's chips, Chinese rate cut - what's moving markets\n\nTaiwan June export orders miss forecast, China demand weakens\n\nChina to extend tariff exemptions for some US imports until 2025",

        "title": "MSFT, AMZN, or GOOGL: Which Cloud Computing Player is the Best AI Stock?",
        "content": "The generative artificial intelligence (AI) wave has boosted the prospects for various categories of companies within the tech sector, including semiconductor makers, cloud computing providers, and cybersecurity players. In particular, cloud computing companies are witnessing solid demand for their services that are required to support enterprises and developers in building their generative AI models.\n\nBearing this favorable backdrop in mind, we used TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool to place Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) against each other to find the cloud computing company that is the best AI stock and could offer the highest returns from the current level, as per Wall Street analysts.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nWhile Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the market leader in the cloud infrastructure market, rival Microsoft Azure is catching up rapidly. In the March quarter (Q3 FY24 for MSFT), revenue from Azure and other cloud services increased 31% compared to AWS’ sales growth of 17% in the comparable quarter.\n\nDuring the Q3 FY24 earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that Azure is grabbing market share, with customers using the company’s platforms to build AI solutions. The CEO added that the company provides a diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the most recent offerings of Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and MSFT’s own AI chip.\n\nMicrosoft claims that over 65% of the Fortune 500 companies are using Azure OpenAI service, thanks to continued AI innovation that is backed by the company’s strategic partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Overall, Microsoft’s cloud business is seen as one of its key growth drivers.\n\nIs Microsoft a Buy or Sell?\n\nMicrosoft is scheduled to announce its Q4 FY24 results on July 30. Analysts expect the company’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to rise 9% year-over-year to $2.93.\n\nAhead of the results, TD Cowen analyst Derrick Wood reaffirmed a Buy rating on MSFT stock and boosted the price target to $495 from $470. The analyst expects the company to deliver another upbeat quarter of growth and margins. He is optimistic about Azure’s potential, with data points indicating continued growth acceleration trends. Overall, MSFT remains “best-positioned for AI monetization,” according to Wood.\n\nWith 34 Buys versus one Hold recommendation, Microsoft stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average MSFT stock price target of $504.12 implies 15.3% upside potential from current levels. Shares have advanced more than 16% so far this year.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nDespite rising competition, Amazon’s AWS unit continues to maintain a dominant position in the cloud computing market. According to Synergy Research Group, AWS commanded a 31% market share of the cloud infrastructure services market in Q1 2024, while Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud had market shares of 25% and 11%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, AWS’ sales grew 17% year-over-year to $25 billion. This growth rate marked an acceleration compared to the 13% increase experienced in Q4 2023. It is worth noting that AWS is a vital growth engine for Amazon and is highly profitable. In Q1 2024, AWS accounted for 17.5% of the overall sales but contributed more than 61% of the company’s operating income.\n\nAmazon is optimistic about the robust potential of its AWS business. CEO Andy Jassy stated during the Q1 2024 earnings call that the company is seeing notable momentum on the AI front, which is accumulating a “multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already.”\n\nWhat is the Target Price for Amazon Stock?\n\nAhead of Amazon’s Q2 results scheduled to be announced on August 1, analysts at Morgan Stanley reaffirmed a Buy rating on the stock, with a positive near-term outlook. Morgan Stanley expects AMZN to report a notable EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) beat in the second quarter and issue favorable guidance for the third quarter.\n\nIn particular, Morgan Stanley’s EBIT estimate is 17% higher than the Street’s consensus for Q2 and 10% more than the Q3 forecast. The optimistic outlook is based on AMZN’s North America Retail profitability and accelerating AWS growth.  Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Amazon’s EPS to increase to $1.02 from $0.65 in the prior-year quarter.\n\nAmazon stock earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 44 unanimous Buys. At $223.05, the average AZMN stock price target implies about 22% upside potential. Shares have risen 21% year-to-date.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nTech giant Alphabet is well known for its Google search engine. That said, the company’s Google Cloud business is grabbing Wall Street’s attention with its rapid growth. Alphabet impressed investors with its solid first-quarter results, which were driven by a major jump in Google Cloud’s profitability.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Google Cloud’s revenue increased 28.4% year-over-year to $9.57 billion, while its operating income surged to $900 million from $191 million in the prior-year quarter. The results reflected Alphabet’s increased investments in the Cloud business. Interestingly, during the Q1 2024 earnings call, management highlighted that the company introduced over 1,000 new products and features in its Cloud business over the past eight months.\n\nThe company believes that one of the aspects that differentiates its Cloud business from rivals is its AI Hypercomputer, which offers cost-effective and efficient infrastructure to train and support AI models.\n\nIs it a Good Time to Buy GOOGL?\n\nOn July 18, analysts at Jefferies reaffirmed a Buy rating on GOOGL stock with a price target of $220. They expect Alphabet to report strong Q2 results, supported by resilient customer spending and consistent Cloud business. However, Jefferies cautioned investors about slightly tougher comparisons in Q2, mainly in the ad business.\n\nAfter a solid year-to-date rally in GOOGL stock (up 27.2%), Jefferies expects continued rise but at a gradual pace due to high expectations following robust Q1 performance and above historical average valuation levels.\n\nAlphabet will announce its Q2 2024 results on July 23. Wall Street expects Alphabet’s Q2 EPS to rise 27% to $1.83.\n\nWall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on GOOGL stock based on 33 Buys and six Holds. The average GOOGL stock price target of $202.89 indicates 14.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion\n\nWall Street is bullish on the long-term growth potential of the top three cloud computing players, driven by the continued transition of enterprises to the cloud and AI-related tailwinds. Currently, they see slightly higher upside potential in Amazon stock than in Microsoft and Alphabet shares. Aside from the attractive growth potential of the AWS business, analysts’ optimism about Amazon is also backed by the company’s leadership in e-commerce and its growing advertising business.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Joe Biden dropout fallout, inflation data, and the start of tech earnings: What to know this week",
        "content": "Stocks pulled back from record highs amid pressure across the technology sector after a global tech outage sent shockwaves throughout the market on Friday.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the week down nearly 2% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped more than 3.5% on the week. Both indexes had their worst weekly performance since April. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 0.7%.\n\nThis week, critical readings on economic growth and inflation, as well as the start of Big Tech earnings, will determine if the malaise continues.\n\nInvestors will also be digesting the news that President Joe Biden will no longer be seeking reelection. Biden announced he‘s dropping out of the presidental race in a post on X Sunday.\n\nOn the economic data side, the advanced reading of second quarter economic growth is slated for Thursday, followed by the June reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, on Friday.\n\nIn corporate news, a slew of S&P 500 companies are expected to report quarterly results in a week headlined by Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Tesla (TSLA), and Chipotle (CMG).\n\nInflation outlook\n\nLast week, new data showing a slowdown in inflation prompted markets to put the chances that the Federal Reserve cuts rates by the end of its September meeting at 100%.\n\nThe week ahead will bring another look at inflation, this time with the Fed's preferred gauge: The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index.\n\nDue out on Friday, economists expect \"core\" PCE increased 2.5% in June from the previous year, down from May's 2.6% annual gain. Over the prior month, economists expect \"core\" PCE rose 0.2%, slightly above May's 0.1% increase.\n\nThe release comes less than a week before the Fed's next monetary policy decision on July 31. Markets are widely expecting the central bank to hold interest rates steady. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies during the House Financial Services Committee hearing titled \"Federal Reserve's Semi-Annual Monetary Policy Report\" in Rayburn building on Wednesday, July 10, 2024. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)\n\nGrowth check\n\nOne key question on investors' minds is whether the economy can remain resilient with rates still at their most restrictive levels in more than two decades.\n\nThursday will bring the first reading of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the second quarter. Economists expect the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 1.9% in the second quarter, up from the 1.4% growth rate seen in the first quarter.\n\nBank of America Securities head of economics Michael Gapen summed up expectations for the upcoming week's data release in a weekly note, writing,\" The data should show healthy activity, and that inflation is moving in the right direction.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSigns of a rotation\n\nSince investors have become more optimistic about the likelihood of multiple interest rate cuts this year, a shift has been underway within the stock market.\n\nIn the past 10 days, Real Estate (XLRE) and Financials (XLF) have led individual sector action. Meanwhile the market's biggest winners of the past year, Technology (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) , have recently been the worst-performing sectors in the S&P 500.\n\nAnd the rotation has finally trickled down in cap size too, with small caps joining the 2024 stock market rally.\n\nThe small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) is up about 8% over the past month, while the S&P 500 is up less than 1% in the same time period, sparking debate over whether this bout of small-cap outperformance can continue.\n\n\"We think there is room for the rotation into low quality to persist if rate cuts remain priced and the Trump 2.0 trade carries on ahead of US elections,\" UBS Investment Bank US equity derivatives strategist Maxwell Grinacoff wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.\n\nBig Tech earnings on tap\n\nWith Big Tech stumbling amid the market rotation, the fundamental story for some of the stock market's largest names will be in focus in the week ahead.\n\nTesla and Alphabet are slated to report earnings after the bell on Tuesday. Second quarter results from the two Magnificent Seven members will provide an early read on investor appetite for the most popular trade of 2023. Both stocks are up double digits over the past six months despite the recent sell-off.\n\nThe question is whether the AI-fueled trajectory upward can continue.\n\n\"The biggest risk heading into the next six to eight weeks is, are we setting ourselves up for this AI disappointment [in earnings]?\" Ryan Grabinski, Strategas Research Partners managing director of investment strategy, told Yahoo Finance. \"Do all of the trades that were associated with AI ultimately begin to unwind themselves?\"\n\nHow Big Tech companies perform will likely determine the trajectory of earnings growth for the broader S&P 500. Four companies — Alphabet, Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) — are expected to grow earnings by 56.4% compared to the same period a year prior, according to FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters. The other 496 are expected to grow earnings by just 5.7%.\n\nWhen combining the two groups, the S&P is currently on pace to produce year-over-year earnings growth of 9.7%. This would mark the best quarter for earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed Nat Activity Index, June (-0.06 expected, +0.18 prior)\n\nEarnings: Cleveland Cliffs (CLF), Nucor (NUE), SAP (SAP), Truist (TFC), Verizon (VZ), Zions Bancorporation (ZION)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, July (-7 expected, -10 prior); Existing home sales month-over-month, June (-2.7% expected, -0.7% previously)\n\nEarnings: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Cal-Maine Foods (CALM), Capital One (COF), Comcast (CMCSA), Enphase (ENPH), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), GE Aerospace (GE), General Motors (GM), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Phillip Morris International (PM), Spotify (SPOT), Tesla (TSLA), UPS (UPS), Texas Instruments (TXN), Visa (V)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending July 19 (+3.9% prior); S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, July, preliminary (51.4 expected, 51.6 previously); S&P Global US services PMI, July, preliminary (55 expected, 55.3 previously); S&P Global US composite PMI, July, preliminary (54.8 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, June (+3.8% expected, -11.3% previously)\n\nEarnings:  AT&T (T), Chipotle (CMG), Ford (F), IBM (IBM), General Dynamics (GD), Lamb Weston (LW), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), ServiceNow (NOW), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX), Waste Management (WM), Whirlpool (WHR)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Second quarter GDP, advance estimate (+1.9% annualized rate expected, +1.4% previously); First quarter personal consumption, advance estimate (+1.7% expected, 1.5% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ended, July 20 (243,000 previously); Durable goods, June preliminary (+0.5% expected, +0.1% previously)\n\nEarnings: American Airlines (AAL), AstraZeneca (AZN), Boston Beer (SAM), Deckers (DECK), Hasbro (HAS), Honeywell (HON), Juniper Networks (JNPR), Keurig Dr. Pepper (KDP), New York Community Bancorp (NYCB), RTX (RTX), Skechers (SKX), Southwest (LUV), Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), Valero (VLO)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic data: Personal income, month-over-month, June (+0.4% expected, +0.5% previously); Personal spending, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.2% previously); PCE inflation, month-over-month, June (+0.1% expected, 0% previously); PCE inflation, year-over-year, June (+2.5% expected, +2.6% previously); \"Core\" PCE, month-over-month, June (+0.2% expected, +0.1% previously); \"Core\" PCE, year-over-year, June (+2.5% expected; +2.6% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, July, final reading (66.3 expected, 66 previously)\n\nEarnings: 3M (MMM), Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), Colgate-Palmolive (CL), Charter Communications (CHTR)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nLoop Capital upgrades Apple, issues Street high price target\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares climbed higher on Monday after analysts at Loop Capital upgraded the stock to Buy and set a new price target of $300, the highest on Wall Street.\n\nAnalysts expressed confidence in Apple’s potential to become the leading platform for next-generation AI, akin to its historical success with the iPhone and iPod.\n\n\"Our $300 PT is 33x our $9.00 CY2026 EPS (what the stock will be valuing in 12 months). 33x P/E is the higher-end of AAPL’s 20x – 35x post-Covid P/E range,\" Loop Capital explained in their note to clients.\n\nThe latest upgrade is based on the latest findings that suggest a significant increase in iPhone 16 production driven by the excitement surrounding AI.\n\n\"AAPL has an opportunity the next few years to solidify itself as consumer’s Gen AI 'base camp' of choice, just as it did for social media 15 years ago (with iPhone) and digital content consumption 20 years ago (with iPod),” analysts wrote.\n\nWolfe Research starts Google stock coverage\n\nSell-side research firm Wolfe Research on Monday initiated coverage on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock, assigning it an Outperform rating and a price target of $240.00.\n\nThe analysts said the bullish rating is based on a long-term perspective that Alphabet's scale, investments in AI, leadership position in the market, and product innovations will enable the company to outpace the digital advertising market, gain share in Cloud computing, develop new revenue streams, and maintain a strong position in the Gen AI race.\n\nMoreover, the current valuation is seen as “reasonable on a growth-adjusted basis.” Wolfe said its $240 price target is derived from a 25x FY25E price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\n\n\"This multiple is above similar digital ads comp group median multiples but below Mega cap comp group median multiples and reasonable in our view, given GOOGL’s ability to outgrow the digital advertising market and expand margins in the process,\" analysts noted.\n\nHSBC cuts Qualcomm to Hold on ‘less bullish AI PC narrative’\n\nLater in the week, HSBC downgraded Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock to Hold on Wednesday, citing a lack of catalysts and \"a less bullish AI PC narrative.\" Despite raising the target price slightly to $200 from $190, analysts remain cautious about Qualcomm's near-term performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn their note, HSBC forecasts Qualcomm's Q3 FY24 results to align with consensus, projecting revenue of $9.3 billion, close to the consensus estimate of $9.2 billion. The gross margin (GM) for Q3 FY24 is expected to be 55.9%, slightly below the consensus of 56.1%.\n\nHowever, concerns arise for Q4 FY24, as HSBC predicts flat quarter-over-quarter revenue at $9.3 billion, missing the consensus estimate of $9.8 billion due to lower handset revenue projections. The gross margin for Q4 is also expected to decline to 55.6% from the consensus of 55.9%.\n\nHSBC pointed out the ongoing uncertainties in the smartphone market, particularly with China’s Android handset market anticipated to decline by 15% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nAs for the AI PC narrative, HSBC has adjusted its expectations downward following mixed reviews post-Computex. Initially optimistic about QCOM’s early mover advantage with its Snapdragon X Elite/X Plus processors, HSBC now expects Qualcomm to ship only 600,000 AI CPUs in FY24, significantly lower than earlier market expectations of 1-1.5 million. This revision resulted in a substantial reduction in projected AI CPU revenue.\n\nAccenture upgraded to Buy at UBS on GenAI-driven growth expectations\n\nMeanwhile, UBS has raised its rating on Accenture (NYSE:ACN) stock to Buy from Neutral, citing the potential for a multiple expansion as the market anticipates accelerated revenue growth amid AI optionality.\n\n\"While we appreciate concerns about the pace of IT spending, we believe the change in business mix [towards cloud, digital transformation, cybersecurity, and now Gen AI should drive higher and more durable growth,\" UBS analysts stated.\n\nFurther, UBS's analysis of the revenue from Accenture's top 10 alliance partners relative to Accenture's own revenue suggests a top-line acceleration over the next 12 months. As such, UBS believes the stock is not currently pricing in the full extent of GenAI potential.\n\nThe bank’s analysts also expect Gen AI adoption to accelerate as clients begin to realize value at scale from their experiments, potentially scaling even faster than Accenture's cloud business, which grew from $1 billion in FY12 to $32 billion in FY23, representing approximately 50% of total revenue.\n\nTD Cowen ups Fortinet to Buy\n\nDuring the week, cybersecurity firm Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) received an upgrade from TD Cowen analysts, who now hold a Buy rating on the stock.\n\nThe investment bank cited several factors behind the move, including solid channel checks indicating a bottoming cycle for security appliances, expectations of an improved outlook for the second half of 2024 due to easier year-over-year comparisons, an operational technology (OT) upgrade cycle, and increased SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) adoption.\n\nIn addition, analysts view Fortinet “as a beneficiary of on-premise Gen-AI ramp-up.”\n\nTD Cowen also said the valuation of Fortinet at 27x its projected fiscal year 2025 free cash flow (FY25E FCF) is viewed as offering potential upside to the newly established $75 price target.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Apple upgraded, QCOM cut to Hold amid lack of catalysts\n\nIs the bull market broadening or rotating?

        "title": "Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?",
        "content": "Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 15% over the last three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Alphabet's  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is:\n\n28% = US$82b ÷ US$293b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.28.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nAlphabet's Earnings Growth And 28% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Alphabet has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 7.4% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, Alphabet was able to see a decent net income growth of 18% over the last five years.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Alphabet's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 6.0%. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is GOOGL fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nIs Alphabet Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Alphabet's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "title": "Big Tech Stock Slump Amps Up Pressure to Deliver on Earnings",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The stakes were already elevated for technology giants heading into this earnings season. They just got a lot higher after the worst week for the Nasdaq 100 Index in three months.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nZuckerberg Calls Trump’s Response to Shooting ‘Badass’ From ATMs to Flights, Epic IT Crash Leaves Trail of Chaos CrowdStrike’s Global Outage Doesn’t Have to Be a Recurring Nightmare Travel Chaos Mounts as Airlines Resume Flights After Outage How a Routine CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s Computers\n\nAfter driving the rally in US stocks for most of the year, Big Tech slammed into a wall this week. Investors rotated from high-flying megacap shares to riskier, lagging parts of the market, spurred by bets on Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, the threat of more trade restrictions on chipmakers and concern that the hype around artificial intelligence may be overblown. AI darling Nvidia Corp. sank 8.8% this week, while Amazon.com Inc. dropped 5.8%.\n\nWith Wall Street projecting that the tech behemoths’ profit growth is poised to slow, traders are plowing this year’s winnings into cheaper areas — like small-capitalization stocks caps that stand to benefit from lower borrowing costs, and sectors like health care, where earnings are expected to perk up. It’s all heightening the focus on next week, when major tech companies start reporting quarterly results.\n\n“There are plenty of reasons to think tech will be less friendly over the coming year,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “At these levels, everything has to go right.”\n\nHeading into the key stretch of announcements, the Nasdaq 100 is up 16% this year after this week’s 4% tumble, its steepest since April. The S&P 500 Index is up about 15% in 2024, with much of the advance generated by the largest tech stocks.\n\nAlphabet Inc. kicks off earnings for the cohort Tuesday, along with Tesla Inc. Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. Amazon and Meta Platforms Inc. are due the following week. The entire group has benefited from AI-fueled optimism and investors will want some reassurance that the technology will move the needle for profit and revenue gains.\n\nAn “epic” reversal from Big Tech will continue unless the companies can convince analysts to raise their sales estimates for the second half of the year and 2025, Goldman Sachs strategists including David Kostin wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\n“If these companies can’t generate meaningful profits and revenue from AI, and you remove the impact of that idea, then the stocks go back to where they were a year ago,” said Samana at Wells Fargo.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe five biggest US technology companies — Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet and Amazon — are facing tough comparisons with the stellar earnings cycles of the past year. Profits for the group are projected to rise 29% in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show.\n\nWhile still strong, that’s down from the past three quarters, when growth for the group ranged from 44% to 49%. The overall message from Wall Street: Expect results to show the companies are still booming, but not to the extent seen last year.\n\nGoogle, Tesla\n\nThere are other themes investors will be drilling down into starting next week.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet, for example, will give a glimpse into the health of the digital advertising market. The search giant is projected to deliver profit of around $23 billion on revenue of $70.7 billion in the second quarter, up 25% and 14%, respectively, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAnd with electric-vehicle demand mired in a slump, money managers will be keenly interested in Tesla’s announcement. The carmaker’s profit is projected to shrink 37% in the second quarter to $1.7 billion, while sales are expected to decline 1% to $24.6 billion.\n\nThat hasn’t dampened the mood for the stock, which is up almost 70% from an April low. Tesla investors are pinning their hopes on Elon Musk’s promised robotaxi service. After the company postponed an event initially scheduled for next month, investors will be looking for details on Tesla’s earnings call about progress on the self-driving car initiative.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings Inc., the cybersecurity company responsible for a global IT outage on Friday, isn’t expected to report earnings until late next month.\n\nWay Up\n\nDespite the latest declines, stocks like Nvidia and Meta Platforms are still sitting on big gains. Nvidia, which is expected to report late next month, has more than doubled this year while Facebook’s owner has advanced more than a third. As a result, valuations for many remain stretched. Nvidia is priced at 37 times projected profits for the next 12 months, while Microsoft and Apple both trade at more than 31 times.\n\nThe average valuation for the S&P 500 is 21 times. The benchmark for small-cap shares, the Russell 2000 Index, trades at about 26 times estimated profits.\n\nThe tech sector is the only segment where valuations are above historical averages and analysts have still been revising estimates higher, according to Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. That’s created a situation where misses are likely to be punished, she said.\n\n“A miss in tech is to be classified as an unforgivable sin in the market right now because expectations are so high,” she said.\n\n--With assistance from Ryan Vlastelica.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Zombie Mall King Doesn’t Want to Be a Bottom-Feeder Forever Five Questions With Apollo Global Co-Founder Josh Harris Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail How Trader Joe’s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit Top Takeaways From Businessweek’s Donald Trump Interview\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Earnings season is in full swing, with a notably stacked reporting docket for the week. The expectation is for another period of positive growth, underpinned by strength within tech.\n\nAnd concerning the notable releases next week, two Mag 7 members, Alphabet GOOGL and Tesla TSLA are on the reporting docket. But how do expectations stack up heading into each respective release? Let’s take a closer look at estimates and a few key metrics.\n\nCan Alphabet Shares Soar Again?\n\nMega-cap titan Alphabet will reveal its quarterly results next Tuesday on July 23rd after the market’s close. Recent quarterly prints have been favorable for the company, with it exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by an average of 11% across its last four releases.\n\nShares enjoying bullish activity following its latest print, sparking a rally. The company has enjoyed a nice growth phase, with earnings and revenue from the release climbing 61% and 15% year-over-year, respectively.\n\nAnalysts have taken a favorable stance on the company’s outlook for the quarter to be reported, with the $1.85 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up nearly 6% since mid-April. The value reflects a 28% change from the year-ago period, continuing its recent growth trajectory. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCloud and AI optimism fueled shares following its latest release, with investors likely to be laser-focused on the same topics again. The company’s Cloud results have recently exceeded our expectations in back-to-back releases, easing prior fears of an overall slowdown in the space. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares aren’t expensive heading into the release despite the strong share performance, with the current 21.8X forward 12-month earnings multiple sitting beneath the 22.4X five-year median. And the current PEG ratio works out to be 1.2X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth.\n\nThe stock sports a Style Score of ‘C’ for Value.\n\nTesla Margins are Key\n\nShares popped following the release of Tesla’s delivery/production data. The EV leader's Q2 deliveries reached 444k, and EVs produced totaled 411k. The results pleased investors, though it’s worth noting that deliveries were down a modest 4.1% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nMargins will undoubtedly be in focus for the company’s quarterly release, which is expected on next Tuesday, July 23rd. Recent margin pressures have been a focus among investors, helping explain the stock’s slow start to 2024.\n\nPlease note that the chart below is on a trailing twelve-month basis.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings expectations are overall down since the end of April, but positive revisions did hit the tape just recently near the beginning of July, a favorable development leading into the release. The $0.62 per share expected suggests a 14% climb from the year-ago period, getting the EV titan back into positive territory. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDespite a slow start to the year, Tesla shares have gained a remarkable 70% just over the last three months, showing notable outperformance and bullish sentiment. A favorable quarterly release could easily keep shares melting higher, particularly if the company speaks favorably about margins.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season kicks into a much higher gear this week, with many notable companies scheduled to report, including the two Mag 7 members Alphabet GOOGL and Tesla TSLA.\n\nConcerning Alphabet, investors will be looking for further color on the cloud computing / AI environment, whereas Tesla investors will be zeroed in on margins and future plans surrounding autonomous driving.\n\nBoth companies report after the market’s close on July 23rd.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Many in the market are looking to the two members of ‘the Magnificent 7’ who report quarterly results this week to help reverse the stock market’s recent weakness.\n\nThe immediate catalyst for the stock market pullback appears to be renewed uncertainty about regulatory and trade policies following the November elections, particularly with respect to export restrictions on semiconductor players. That said, we are in a seasonally soft time of the year and should perhaps resist the temptation to read too much into the recent weakness of the Mag 7 stocks, particularly given these stocks’ impressive runs already.\n\nThe chart below shows the performance of the Mag 7 stocks since the start of July relative to the S&P 500 index. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see in the above chart, Tesla TSLA is in a league of its own (up +21.3% since July 1st), while Microsoft MSFT (down -2.3%) and Alphabet GOOGL (down -2.2%) are roughly tracking each other.\n\nThis pecking order, with Tesla at the top and Amazon AMZN, Meta META, and Nvidia NVDA at the bottom, is completely reversed when the starting point is changed to the start of 2024 instead of the start of 2024 Q3, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWe have Tesla and Alphabet on deck to report Q2 results this week, both reporting after the market’s close on Tuesday, July 23rd.\n\nThe current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS for Alphabet of $1.85 has remained unchanged over the last two months, as has Tesla’s Q2 EPS estimate of $0.62.\n\nFor Alphabet, the Q2 estimates of $1.85 per share on $70.6 billion in revenues represent year-over-year changes of +13.7% and +28.5%, respectively. Tesla’s Q2 EPS estimate is -31.9% below the year-earlier period on +0.8% higher revenues.\n\nBoth stocks move big on the earnings release, but the EPS surprise isn’t always the most important factor behind the stock’s post-release reaction. Alphabet shares were up following the last quarterly release on April 25th, with the market appreciating the company’s cloud results and AI outlook.\n\nTesla missed on the top and bottom-lines in the April 23rd quarterly release, but the stock was up following the numbers as the market liked the company’s performance on the deliveries front. In fact, Tesla shares have been on a steady uptrend since the April 23rd release, reversing the persistent underperformance of the preceding period.\n\nThe other Mag 7 players will report the following week, with Nvidia being the last one to release quarterly results on August 28th.\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the ‘Mag 7’ stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +25.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.3% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group’s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group’s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. The group returned to the ‘regular/normal’ growth model last year, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +15.5% from the same period last year on +9.3% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the sector’s Q2 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming four periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs with the ‘Mag 7’, the Tech sector dealt with the pulled-forward revenues but is expected to remain firmly in growth mode, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks leading the rising estimates trend. The current +17.2% earnings growth expected for the group is up from +14.2% three months ago. Estimates for next year have also gone up.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, July 19th, we have seen Q2 results from 71 S&P 500 members, or 14.2% of the index’s membership. Total earnings for these 71 index members are up +8.7% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 83.1% beating EPS estimates and only 53.5% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nThe Q2 reporting cycle really ramps up this week, with more than 500 companies on deck to report results, including 135 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Alphabet and Tesla, this week’s line-up includes a representative cross-section of reports from different sectors, including bellwethers like Verizon and AT&T, UPS, Coke, GM and Ford, Spotify, IBM, Chipotle, and others.\n\nThe comparisons charts below put the earnings and revenue beats percentages for these companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, 53.5% is a new low for this group of 71 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these 71 companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues. This will be the highest quarterly growth pace since the +10% earnings growth rate in the 2022 Q1 period.\n\nThe chart below that shows the year-over-year earnings and revenue growth for 2024 Q2 in the context of what we saw in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the following three periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we have been flagging all along in this space, we experienced a notably favorable revisions trend ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season, with estimates for Q2 holding up far better than other recent periods. In the three-month period from the start of the quarter through June 30th, Q2 estimates for the S&P 500 index fell the least relative to the comparable periods of other recent quarters.\n\nNot only is the Q2 earnings growth the highest since the first quarter of 2022, but the absolute level of aggregate earnings for the period is also on track to be a new all-time quarterly record.\n\nYou can see in the chart below that the $515.5 billion in aggregate S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are above the $512.3 billion earned by the index in 2023 Q3. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.8% on +1.6% revenue growth.\n\nThe expected revenue growth pace improves to +3.9% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +8.7% on an ex-Finance basis.

        "title": "Explainer: How CrowdStrike knocked the world offline",
        "content": "Computers around the world failed on Friday, crippling businesses and shutting down everything from airlines and television networks to emergency and hospital services.\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike (CRWD) said an error in one of its software updates for Microsoft’s (MSFT) Windows knocked systems offline.\n\nThe incident sent companies and government agencies across the globe into chaos, as they were unable to access the computer programs necessary for continued operations.\n\nNew York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center announced it was pausing the start of any new procedures that required anesthesia while airlines, including Delta (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL), were forced to ground flights. The UK’s Sky News network couldn’t broadcast live news, bankers at JPMorgan couldn’t log into their systems, and 911 services in Alaska went offline.\n\nThe cascade of failures at such a wide array of organizations left some questioning how a single update could topple so many businesses and agencies in such a short amount of time.\n\nThe problem, however, is a direct result of the way our current internet infrastructure operates. Travelers wait during an outage at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday, July 19, 2024, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Jason Dearen) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe web is powered by a handful of major players including Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL). But beyond those are smaller but no less important companies that plug their software into those tech giants' platforms. CrowdStrike offers, among other things, cybersecurity programs for Windows that companies access via the cloud.\n\nBecause so many organizations rely on Windows — and because CrowdStrike has become such a mega player in the cybersecurity space — a massive number of key businesses, government organizations, and financial institutions use both companies' software platforms.\n\nWhen CrowdStrike released an update for its software, companies using Windows systems began experiencing errors, leading to the outage.\n\n“Updates happen an amazing amount of times each day,” explained Gregory Falco, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and systems engineering at the Sibley School Program at Cornell University. “Most of them you don't notice. Some of them are annoying, when things get slower or you have to restart your computer.\n\n“But then,” he added, “sometimes these updates do not play as expected.”\n\nCybersecurity is an integral part of any company that does business over the internet. Hackers are constantly looking for flaws in systems, and cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike continuously release updates to address any potential cracks those hackers can slip through.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompanies, meanwhile, will apply updates as soon as possible to ensure their systems are as safe as possible from potential attacks. And because CrowdStrike’s update went out so quickly, every organization that uses its software was hit by the same error at once. A digital board is down due to the global communications outage caused by CrowdStrike. (Photo by Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images) (Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nSaid Benjamin Lee, a professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania: “Any computer system that does not install the update will be at risk of attack with a known vulnerability. This is why so many businesses, financial firms, and other organizations have — at the exact same time — installed this CrowdStrike software update and suffered the consequences.”\n\nIt’s that combination of a small number of companies running the internet and businesses needing to keep their cybersecurity software updated at all times that pushed millions of computers to their breaking points on Friday.\n\nCrowdStrike has released a fix for its software and is actively pushing it out to customers. But that doesn’t mean every company will get back online right away.\n\n“Because of the way in which the update has been deployed, recovery options for affected machines are manual and thus limited,” explained Forrester principal analyst Andras Cser. “Administrators must attach a physical keyboard to each affected system, boot into Safe Mode, remove the compromised CrowdStrike update, and then reboot.”\n\nIn other words, it could be some time before the entire outage is fully resolved.\n\nFor now, IT administrators around the world will be working around the clock to get their systems back up and running. As for the average person, there’s nothing to do but sit back and wait. And unless internet companies dramatically change how they operate, something like this will inevitably happen again.

        "content": "What's Going On With Arm Stock On Friday?\n\nARM Holdings Plc (NASDAQ:ARM) shares are trading higher after Morgan Stanley analyst Lee Simpson upgraded the stock from Equal-Weight to Overweight and raised its price target from $107 to $190.\n\nThe upgrade comes as the broader semiconductor sector has seen a selloff this week following Donald Trump’s verbal attack against contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) and the U.S.’s plans to intensify advanced semiconductor sanctions against China.\n\nAI chip stocks led by Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) lost 9% and 18% this week.\n\nAt the Computex forum in Taipei, Arm CEO Rene Haas said he expects 100 billion Arm devices worldwide to be AI-ready by the end of 2025.\n\nArm Holdings plans to showcase its AI chip in 2025 and launch it commercially by fall 2025. Parent company Softbank Group Corp (OTC:SFTBF) (OTC:SFTBY) aims to invest significantly in data centers using its AI chips and renewable energy.\n\nAMD CFO Jean Hu recently suggested a potential entry into next-generation AI PCs.\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic about Arm Holdings, citing strong licensing interest and royalty potential as essential growth factors. They also highlight Arm’s opportunities in the AI and data center sectors.\n\nArm Holdings stock rose by 158% over the past 12 months as AI integrated into smartphones. The ARM (Acorn RISC Machine) architecture powers 99% of the world’s smartphone CPU cores. Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of Arm’s major customers.\n\nArm’s clients choose the company over Intel Corp’s (NASDAQ:INTC) x86 technology primarily for its efficiency and widespread adoption. Arm’s architecture enables chips to consume less power compared to x86, making it ideal for mobile devices and other power-sensitive applications, CNBC reported in 2023.\n\nKey clients like Apple, Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, MicrosoftCorp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NvidiaCorp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and QualcommInc (NASDAQ:QCOM) leverage Arm’s technology to build custom silicon tailored to their specific needs.\n\nARM Holdings has a consensus price target of $112.17 based on the ratings of 25 analysts.\n\nARM Price Action: Arm shares traded higher by 3.47% at $163.83 at the last check on Friday.\n\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article What's Going On With Arm Stock On Friday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL second-quarter 2024 results, scheduled to be released on Jul 23, are likely to reflect gains from its strengthening cloud service offerings.\r\n\r\nThe company’s cloud services arm — Google Cloud — has become the key catalyst behind its business growth.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s cloud offerings include Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, which have been continuously gaining momentum in the booming cloud computing market. Google’s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and generative AI have been major positives.\r\n\r\nThe Google Cloud segment, which derives revenues from fees collected for Google Cloud Platform services and Google Workspace collaboration tools, has constantly been driving substantial revenue growth for Alphabet.\r\n\r\nIn first-quarter 2024, Google Cloud revenues rose 28.4% year over year to $9.6 billion, accounting for 11.9% of the quarter’s total revenues.\r\n\r\nFor second-quarter 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Cloud revenues is pegged at $10.08 billion, suggesting growth of 25.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nClick here to know how the company’s overall second-quarter results are likely to be.\n\nAlphabet Inc.

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon",
        "content": "As the second-quarter earnings season approaches, key companies worldwide will provide insights into sector performance. Investors will be particularly focused on updates from some of the 'Magnificent Seven', which will reveal whether the artificial intelligence (AI) trend continues.\n\nThe Mag 7 stocks have endured a challenging period, with the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) major players—Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and AmazonAJa (AMZN)—experiencing a dramatic decline in market capitalisation. Over recent sessions, these tech giants have collectively shed $1.128tn in market value, marking the largest such loss since May 2022.\n\nWill the upcoming earnings reports show strong performance or a lack of momentum? Here’s what to watch for:\n\nTesla (TSLA) — Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nTesla shares have experienced a dramatic surge this month, with the company's stock price surging by 33%. This increase has propelled Tesla's market valuation by $209bn in the first eight trading days of the month alone, surpassing the combined market value of European automotive giants Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Stellantis, which stands at $198bn.\n\nThis surge cannot be attributed to Tesla’s first-quarter financial results, which revealed the lowest quarterly profits since Q2 2021, diminishing cash flow, and rising inventory levels. The second-quarter production and delivery figures, released earlier this month, indicated a 14% year-on-year decline in vehicle production and a 5% drop in unit sales, although this may have contributed to reducing some of the inventory backlog.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“Quite what inspired this romp is hard to divine, barring ongoing investor enthusiasm for companies that are perceived as AI (and autonomous driving) plays, Elon Musk’s courtroom victories at Tesla and X and ongoing hopes surrounding the Cybertruck, the supercharger network and the ride-hailing app,” Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: How to invest in AI as the rally continues\n\nFor the third quarter, the current consensus is sales of $25.7bn and that would signify a return to growth in the top line of some 10% year-on-year.\n\nAnalysts and investors are also paying close attention to Tesla’s revenue composition. In the first quarter of 2024, energy storage, energy generation, and other business lines contributed 19% to total revenues, up from 10% in the same period in 2022.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) fell to $0.37 in Q1, but analysts expect a rebound to $0.62 in Q2, though this still marks a one-third decrease compared to the same period last year. The consensus EPS forecast for Q3 stands at $0.63.\n\nAJ Bell also highlighted Tesla's strong financial position, with a net cash reserve of $21.5bn. Although a few quarters of weak cash flow are not overly concerning, shareholders will be looking for improvements in this area as an indicator of higher profitability and a more streamlined balance sheet through inventory reduction.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) — Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July*\n\nMicrosoft Corp is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, July 30, with analysts from Bank of America (BofA) forecasting potential revenue upside for the period.\n\nWall Street's consensus projects Microsoft to announce revenue of $64.2bn and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.90 for Q4. However, BofA analysts anticipate a 1% increase from their estimate of $64bn, indicating a 14% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by the robust performance of Azure, a premium mix in Office E3/E5, Copilot’s initial success, and a stabilising PC/Windows market.\n\nAzure’s growth is expected to remain balanced across sustained AI and core workloads, translating into a projected growth rate of 31.5%, slightly above the base expectation of 30.5%. The early traction of Copilot is also anticipated to bolster Office growth, maintaining its current valuation multiple.\n\nIn the more personal computing (MPC) segment, analysts foresee a $50m increase over the $15.5bn estimate, attributed to stronger-than-expected PC shipments.\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, BofA analysts predict continued double-digit revenue growth fuelled by ongoing strength in Azure and Office. However, they anticipate a 100 basis point decrease in margins due to increased capital expenditures driving higher cost of sales.\n\n“In an upside scenario, we believe the Office business could achieve 20% growth by Q1 fiscal 2026,” the analysts noted.\n\nBofA has reiterated its ‘buy’ rating for Microsoft and raised the price target to $510 from $480, citing the potential for higher Office growth in fiscal 2025. They acknowledge that the current share price reflects a considerable amount of near-term upside.\n\n\"Microsoft is set to deliver fourth quarter results at some point next week. Investors will be hoping to see another strong showing from the cloud business, Azure. Analysts are looking for top line growth of 19.5% from Azure, which looks very achievable. Back in April, management said cloud-AI demand was outstripping supply. Despite a mammoth effort to build out compute, that supply/demand imbalance is likely to help underpin Azure growth for some time yet,\" Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\n*Date not confirmed\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) — Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nThe parent company of Google (GOOGL), is set to announce its second-quarter earnings, with analysts predicting robust performance driven by its Android platform and continued momentum in its search and cloud businesses. The company's expanding generative AI capabilities are also anticipated to have significantly contributed to its positive results.\n\nFor Q2, the Zacks Consensus Estimate places Alphabet's revenues at $70.55bn, reflecting a 13.7% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at $1.85 per share, marking a 28.5% rise from the previous year's reported figures. This estimate has seen a slight upward revision of 0.5% over the past week.\n\nHowever, rising litigation issues and associated expenses remain areas of concern for the tech giant.\n\nOne key risk is the US Department of Justice's so-called adtech trial, in which the government charges that Google monopolises key digital advertising technologies, collectively referred to as the adtech stack. Website publishers depend on that stack to sell ads and advertisers rely on it to buy ads.\n\n\"As Alphabet’s second quarter earnings approach, the M&A rumour mill is swirling. If reports are true and Alphabet is in talks to buy cybersecurity firm Wizz for $23bn, it would mark a major move to beef up its security offering. Wizz has successfully taken on the likes of Microsoft and Palo Alto in the cyber space, taking market share over the past couple of years. Perhaps the biggest hurdle could be a regulator that’s been a blocker for many large-scale deals – though a new team in the White House later this year could help things in that regard,\" Britzman said.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\nBank of America Securities analyst Justin Post remains bullish on the integration of Google’s AI chatbot.\n\n“We remain positive on growing Gemini integration across [the] Google ecosystem and think [the] broader rollout of AI overviews will likely help drive higher usage, while AI integration can increase monetisation across Google,” Post said. “Moreover, with a focus on expense management, we think year-over-year margin growth in 2024 will be a bright spot and potential EPS upside driver.”\n\nPost affirmed a buy rating and $200 price target for Alphabet.\n\nBMO Capital Markets raised its their price target from $215 to $222, driven by potential gains in YouTube revenue.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) — Reports second-quarter results on Thursday 25 July*\n\nAmazon is in the spotlight with a \"positive\" near-term view, as Morgan Stanley anticipates the e-commerce giant to significantly outperform in its Q2 earnings and provide optimistic guidance for Q3.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts project that Amazon will exceed consensus estimates for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by 17% for Q2 and 10% for Q3. This optimistic forecast is driven by enhanced profitability in North America tetail and accelerating growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"North America retail profitability and the accelerating growth of AWS are key factors behind our projections,\" the analysts noted.\n\nAs Amazon continues to leverage its robust retail operations and expand its cloud computing dominance, investors are looking forward to a strong financial performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIt is also a top pick for JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth both in the near and long term.\n\nHe anticipates a near-term acceleration in AWS, forecasting a 20% growth in Q4 2024. This growth is expected to be driven by easing optimisations, new workload migrations, and the ramping up of GenAI monetisation.\n\nRead more: UK to lose half a million millionaires by 2028\n\nAnmuth also projects a 190 basis point expansion in Amazon's North America operating income (OI) margin in 2024, supported by enhancements in shipping and inventory placement, increased automation, and stronger advertising revenue. Amazon's free cash flow is expected to reach $66bn in 2024 and $86bn in 2025.\n\nFor Q2, investors are looking for net sales to fall between $148bn and $150bn, with operating income ranging from $14bn to $15bn or more.\n\n\"There was also a strong showing from both the e-commerce and advertising segments over the first quarter, something investors will be keen to see continue. But markets were a little unhappy with the second quarter profit guidance of $10-14bn, anything toward the top end of that range will likely be met with a positive reaction,\" Britzman said.\n\n* Date not confirmed as the company might decide to announce results on 1 August.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 22 July\n\nMONY (MONY.L)\n\nAscential (ASCL.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nNXP Semiconductor (NXPI)\n\nTuesday 23 July\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nCompass (CPG.L)\n\nMitie (MTO.L)\n\nSK Hynix (HY9H.MU)\n\nLVMH (MC.PA)\n\nASM International (ASM.AS)\n\nThales (HO.PA)\n\nLindt (LISN.SW)\n\nAlfa Laval (ALFA.L)\n\nLogitech (LOGNE.SW)\n\nNorsk Hydro (NHY.OL)\n\nAkzo Nobel (AKZOY)\n\nRandstad (RSH.DU)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nCoca-Cola (KO)\n\nSpotify (SPOT)\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\n\nGE Aerospace (GE)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nMondelez (MDLZ)\n\n3M (MMM)\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\nMattel (MAT)\n\nWednesday 24 July\n\nReckitt Benckiser (RKT.L)\n\nUNITE (UTG.L)\n\nRHI Magnesita (RHIM.L)\n\nBreedon (BREE.L)\n\nAston Martin Lagonda (AML.L)\n\nPrimary Health Properties (PHP.L)\n\nFresnillo (FRES.L)\n\nEasyJet (EZJ.L)\n\nOxford Nanopore (ONT.L)\n\nIberdrola (IBE.MC)\n\nBNP Paribas (BNP.PA)\n\nEquinor (EQNR)\n\nBanco Santander (BNC.L)\n\nUniCredit (UCG.MI)\n\nKering (KER.PA)\n\nDeutsche Boerse (DB1.DE)\n\nOrange (ORA.PA)\n\nMichelin (ML.PA)\n\nRepsol (REP.MC)\n\nMoncler (MOV.F)\n\nJerónimo Martins (JMT.LS)\n\nCarrefour (CA.PA)\n\nSSAB (SSAB-A.ST)\n\nKindred (UNBA.MU)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nFord (F)\n\nNewmont (NEM)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nInternational Paper (IP)\n\nThursday 25 July\n\nRELX (REL.L)\n\nLloyds (LLOY.L)\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nRentokil Initial (RTO.L)\n\nInforma (INF.L)\n\nCentrica (CNA.L)\n\nCentamin (CEY.L)\n\nHowden Joinery (HWDN.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nITV (ITV.L)\n\nHammerson (HMSO.L)\n\nVodafone (VOD.L)\n\nBT (BT-A.L)\n\nBritvic (BVIC.L)\n\nWorkspace (WKP.L)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nNestlé (NESNE.SW)\n\nHermès (RMS.PA)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nChristian Dior (CDI.PA)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nEssilorLuxxotica (EL.PA)\n\nStellantis (STLA)\n\nENI (ENI.F)\n\nSt. Gobain (GOB.MU)\n\nRenault (RNO.PA)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nLinde (LIN)\n\nHoneywell (HON)\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC)\n\nKeurig-Dr Pepper (KDP)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV)\n\nBaxter (BAX)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nLiberty Global (LBTYK)\n\nHarley-Davidson (HOG)\n\nFriday 26 July\n\nSEGRO (SGRO.L)\n\nIMI (IMI.L)\n\nRightmove (RMV.L)\n\nDrax (DRX.L)\n\nNEC (6701.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nAir Liquide (AI.PA)\n\nMercedes Benz (MBG.HA)\n\nHolcim (HOLN.SW)\n\nBASF (BASA.BE)\n\nCapGemini (CGM.HM)\n\nAlstom (ALO.PA)\n\nVallourec (VK.PA)\n\nKone Cranes (KNCRY)\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nBristol Meyers Squibb (BMY)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this internet search leader have returned +0.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.61 points to a change of +31.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.61 indicates a change of +13.1% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GOOGL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $70.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.7%. The $291.18 billion and $324.85 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.5% and +11.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Alphabet (GOOGL) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.87 a share four days away from its upcoming earnings release on July 23, 2024.\n\nAlphabet's Earnings ESP sits at 1.11%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.87 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85.\n\nGOOGL is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. Axcelis Technologies (ACLS) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nAxcelis Technologies, which is readying to report earnings on July 31, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.39 a share, and ACLS is 12 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Axcelis Technologies is $1.35, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 2.97%.\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, GOOGL and ACLS could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

U.S. stock benchmarks tumbled from record highs over the past three sessions.\n\nU.S. stock index futures rose mildly in Asian trade, as a rout on Wall Street appeared to be somewhat easing. Focus also turned to a slew of key U.S. earnings due in the coming days, with majors including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) set to report.\n\nChinese stocks down on US trade jitters; stimulus hopes dampen losses\n\nChina’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell slightly on Friday, although they were trading above intraday lows.\n\nMedia reports this week suggested that the U.S. was considering stricter trade restrictions against China, especially the country’s technology and chipmaking sectors.\n\nThe reports ramped up concerns over a renewed trade war between Beijing and Washington, given that trade relations between the two are already strained.\n\nSpeculation over a second Donald Trump presidency also dented Chinese stocks, given that Trump has maintained a largely negative rhetoric against Beijing.\n\nStill, losses in Chinese stocks were dampened by promises of more supportive policy from the Chinese government, as the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party carried on.\n\nTech rout persists, TSMC offers little support to chipmakers\n\nTechnology-heavy indexes were the worst performers in Asia, as the sector continued to grapple with profit-taking and as expectations of interest rate cuts sparked a broad pivot into economically sensitive sectors.\n\nLosses in tech dragged Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.4%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slid over 2%.\n\nSouth Korea’s KOSPI shed 1.5% on losses in chipmaking stocks.\n\nChipmaking stocks slid even as industry major TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM) clocked stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter, and upgraded its outlook on the prospect of strong demand from artificial intelligence.\n\nThe firm’s Taipei shares fell 2%, as sentiment towards Taiwan was also rattled by comments from U.S. Republican presidential candidate Trump, who said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense supplies.\n\nBroader Asian stocks fell as sentiment remained dour. Concerns over China saw Australia’s ASX 200 index slide 1.1%, with local stocks also seeing profit-taking after racing to record highs earlier in the week.\n\nStory continues\n\nJapan’s TOPIX fell 0.6%, as softer-than-expected consumer price index data raised questions over whether the Bank of Japan will hike interest rates soon.\n\nFutures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a positive open, as the index neared a record-high 25,000 points.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks fall as US-China jitters persist; TSMC sparks little cheer\n\nTSMC shares fall nearly 2% even after raising 2024 revenue forecast\n\nUS stock futures rise as tech rout pauses; major earnings awaited",

Majors such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose slightly in evening trade.\n\nA mix of profit-taking and a rotation into sectors more primed to benefit from an economic recovery had battered major technology stocks over the past two sessions.\n\nNetflix fell slightly in aftermarket trade after its second quarter earnings missed expectations.\n\nHeavyweight chipmaking stocks were also rattled by the prospect of more U.S. sanctions on China, especially on the country’s chipmaking sector.\n\nLosses in tech sparked deep losses on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 down 0.8% at 5,544.59 points on Thursday.

Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)are all set to report on Tuesday, with the two internet giants set to offer more cues on artificial intelligence after a massive valuation spike over the past year.\n\nTesla will be watched for how the electric car maker is navigating a steep decline in sales this year.\n\nPositive earnings from chipmaking bellwethers ASML (AS:ASML) Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) and TSMC (NYSE:TSM) aided chipmaking stocks on Thursday. TSMC rose slightly after it clocked stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings, with the world’s biggest contract chipmaker also hiking its outlook on strong AI-fueled demand.\n\nPolitical wrangling in focus as calls grow for Biden to exit race\n\nThe 2024 presidential race was also a point of focus for Wall Street, amid growing calls from members of the Democratic party for Biden to not seek re-election.\n\nReports on Thursday said former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi had told House democrats that Biden could be persuaded to exit the race.\n\nStory continues\n\nConcerns over Biden’s health, coupled with the increasing popularity of Republican nominee Donald Trump, have sparked doubts over whether Biden will be able to clinch a second term.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise as tech rout pauses; major earnings awaited\n\nEmbraer deliveries rise 88% in second quarter, order backlog at 7-year high\n\nFired Citigroup banker says COO intended to deceive regulator on bank's metrics\n\nView comments",

        "title": "DeepL, long a leader in translation tech, finally embraces LLMs",
        "content": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI.\n\nDeepL, the Germany-based startup that’s been leading the way on AI translation technology, yesterday released its next-generation model. The company was valued at $2 billion in a recent funding round and has made quite a splash in the translation subset of the AI boom, stating that its technology is already used by over 100,000 businesses, governments, and other organizations. But believe it or not, this is DeepL’s first model to be based on the large language model technology that’s underlined the AI hype and just about every AI product out there.\n\n“We’ve been working with similar neural networks since DeepL was conceived in 2017, but there's been obviously an evolution in how this architectures works, and for the first time, we've moved that toward LLM technology,” CEO Jarek Kutylowski told Eye on AI, adding that “LLMs are going to be taking over translation.”\n\nThe model is not a general LLM, such as GPT-4 or Llama 3. It was built entirely by DeepL in-house, on its own infrastructure, and is tailored specifically for translation. The unnamed model —”We’re not doing names,” Kutylowski said—is meant to do everything the company’s previous model was doing, only better, plus hopefully even more down the road. The company hopes the new LLM architecture will pave the way for new capabilities such as multimodal translation and the ability to translate text into multiple languages simultaneously in real-time as the user types.\n\nAnyone can use DeepL’s translation model via its website and various browser extensions and software integrations, but the company is specifically targeting global companies that want to translate everything from Slack messages to sensitive legal documents. Many translation tools only offer the ability to write in your own language and then prompt the model to translate your text in its entirety, but DeepL’s model also includes interactive writing features, suggesting different options for how you might want to phrase something so you can ensure it will be linguistically correct in the other language while still making it your own.\n\n“You want to make sure that this is your text and that even if translated, this is something that you've written,” Kutylowski said. “Kind of fine-tuning it, making it yours, is an important thing that our users value.”\n\nAs with all AI software, data is key. And it is clear that DeepL views its access to top-class translation data, as well as the humans it has in the loop of its training process, as key differentiators. DeepL uses a combination of publicly available data (which expert linguists assess for quality so only the “right” data is actually fed into the model), as well as licensed datasets and synthetic data. Human experts provide feedback on the model outputs in order to improve its performance, a process referred to as reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF). According to Kutylowski, the jump in quality from the human feedback is “quite significant” and DeepL wouldn’t be where it is without it.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, the company has significant competition from Big Tech, with all the regular players including Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, and Meta investing in similar technologies. As the Semafor Technology newsletter has written, “companies like Google can snap their fingers and get the ability to translate more than 100 languages and offer that technology for free.” In total, DeepL supports 32 languages with its previous generation software (only English, Japanese, German, and Simplified Chinese so far with the next generation), while Google’s recent additions bring Google Translate to a whopping 243 languages.\n\nLeading AI companies such as OpenAI are getting in on the race, too. Earlier this week, Cohere also announced a “significant investment” and strategic partnership with Japanese tech giant Fujitsu to build LLMs with Japanese language capabilities for global enterprises.\n\nStill, DeepL believes its models provide the best quality translations. The company said that in blind tests, language experts preferred its next-generation model 1.3 times more often than Google Translate, 1.7 times more often than ChatGPT-4, and 2.3 times more often than Microsoft. DeepL, however, has not published this research and declined to offer specifics on the methodology such as how many language experts were involved in the tests. In 2021, an independent evaluation found DeepL to be the highest-performing machine translation model across 13 language pairs, outperforming Google and 16 others.\n\nWhile many use cases for AI are still being debated, the benefits of using AI for translation are easy to see. Businesses are becoming more global by the day. It’s also an area where there’s a lot to gain with little to lose. Few professionals had access to human translators to begin with, but now everyone—from growing companies to vacation travelers—has a translator in their pocket that can open up entirely new opportunities.\n\n“From my perspective, it's really incredibly exciting. And it was not clear for quite some time if LLMs were going to be the way forward technologically when it comes to translation,” Kutylowski said. “I think right now in this step, it really shows that they are capable of outperforming other models, but also, what I’m really excited about is the additional capabilities we will be able to infuse into those models in addition to the normal translation that you know nowadays, just because [LLMs] are not only capable of translation but can do more.”\n\nAnd with that, here’s more AI news.\n\nSage Lazzaro\r\nsage.lazzaro@consultant.fortune.com\r\nsagelazzaro.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "What's Going On With Google's Parent Alphabet Stock On Thursday?\n\nGoogle's Parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is trading lower today. The Italian Competition Authority has launched an investigation into Google and its parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), regarding their methods for obtaining user consent for linking data across various services.\n\nThe probe focuses on how Google requests consent from users to link data across its services, such as Google Search, YouTube, Chrome, and Maps.\n\nThe Italian regulator suspects that Google may provide inadequate or misleading information about the effects of this consent.\n\nThe Authority alleges that Google's consent requests might lack transparency about the scope and implications of combining user data across multiple services. This could lead users to unknowingly consent to broader data use than intended.\n\nThe investigation also examines whether Google employs techniques that could influence consumer decisions.\n\nThe Authority is concerned that these methods might pressure users into consenting to data practices they might otherwise reject.\n\nIn response to the investigation, a Google spokesperson stated, \"We will analyze the details of this case and will work cooperatively with the Authority,\" TechCrunch reports.\n\nAlso Read: Google And Microsoft Provide Nvidia Chip Access To Chinese Firms Despite U.S. Restrictions: Report\n\nGoogle has been subject to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) since early March, which mandates that companies obtain explicit consent before processing users' personal data for advertising or combining data from different services.\n\nThe DMA, which includes regulations that align with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), requires consent to be \"freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.\"\n\nThis investigation could have significant implications for how Google manages user data within the European Union.\n\nHowever, Google has announced some of the changes including a new search page layout for European users, with dedicated aggregator units with links to aggregator sites from across the web to comply with the DMA.\n\nItaly's investigation also touches on the broader issue of \"dark patterns\" in online consent flows, where design techniques can manipulate users into making choices they might not otherwise make.\n\nThe EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) bans such deceptive designs, aiming to protect users' ability to make free and informed decisions.\n\nAlphabet stock has gained about 43% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC) and Vanguard Communication Services ETF (NYSE:VOX).\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Action: GOOGL shares are trading lower by 1.62% at $179.65 at the last check on Thursday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nGoogle Parent Alphabet's Q2 Expected To Shine With AI, YouTube Shorts, Cloud Strength: Analyst\n\nPhoto by Pawel Czerwinski on Unsplash.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nALPHABET (GOOGL): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article What's Going On With Google's Parent Alphabet Stock On Thursday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Want Better Returns? Don't Ignore These 2 Computer and Technology Stocks Set to Beat Earnings",
        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.68 a share, just 12 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 30, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $0.68 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.67 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Advanced Micro Devices has an Earnings ESP of 2.21%.\n\nAMD is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. Alphabet (GOOGL) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nAlphabet, which is readying to report earnings on July 23, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.87 a share, and GOOGL is five days out from its next earnings report.\n\nAlphabet's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.11% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85.\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, AMD and GOOGL could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "Is Alphabet (GOOG) the Best Undervalued AI Stock in 2024?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nKing Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management’s chief strategist, recently talked to CNBC about the latest decline in tech stocks and market rotation. Lip said that he’s still bullish on tech stocks and a single event does not show a trend. However, the cause of decline in tech stocks last week was the lower-than-expected CPI data which caused investors to do some “profit taking” and invest in names that can benefit “more” from lower interest rates, according to the analyst. Lip noted that small-cap stocks, real estate stocks, among others, gained ground on the back of this trend.\n\nHowever, Lip has high expectations from the upcoming earnings reports from tech companies. He also said that July has been one of the strongest months for tech stocks. Lip, however, said that major tech companies cannot go on to post record gains and their returns are expected to “fall in line with historical returns.”\n\nLip thinks the economy is entering a “Goldilocks scenario” where growth is steady but not “hot enough” to cause inflation. He reiterated his view that he expects strong earnings growth this year and in 2025, which could be a tailwind for stocks.\n\nAsked what would cause earnings growth of tech companies, Lip said a lot of that comes down to efficient management and strong cash piles these companies have. He also said “slightly” lower interest rates could also be a tailwind for the economy.\n\nSince Lip is bullish on tech stocks and believes major AI companies still have upside potential, we decided to take a look at the top names in his portfolio. These are the top holdings of King Lip, according to CNBC. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Analyst Says Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Has More Upside Potential?\n\nGoogle\n\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nAlphabet is among the top AI stocks in King Lip’s portfolio.\n\nWedbush’s Dan Ives in a fresh note named Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) as one of the stocks that can benefit from the AI boom.\n\nAccording to a latest UBS report, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls in all three layers of the AI value chain – enabling, intelligence and application layer. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an AI enabling player because of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud Platform, while Gemini makes it a key player in the intelligence layer. On the application layer, UBS believes Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has an edge with its Duet AI assistant and advertising. All these catalysts make Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) a company that could benefit from the $1.2 trillion AI opportunity by 2027, UBS said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)bulls believe the company is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note-taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrate with other Google apps. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) app is to urge users to sign up for ‘Google One AI Premium’ plan, which has a $19.99 price tag.  Google saw advertising revenue accelerate in Q1 2024, boosted by YouTube in particular growing by almost 21% last quarter. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\n\nClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Communication services gains in the S&P 500 were driven mainly by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (aka Google). The company has a dominant position in internet search and video advertising, and a solid cloud services business. Alphabet’s initiation of a dividend in the quarter enabled us to take a small position. We see further meaningful revenue opportunities from AI innovations across its segments and may look to increase our holdings over time. Alphabet’s exceptional balance sheet and improving cost efficiencies further solidify its strong position and growth prospects, and we expect its dividend will grow sharply over time.\n\nThe recent addition of Alphabet and Meta reflect the benefits of our flexible dividend approach. Our active (as opposed to formulaic) approach to dividends enabled us to move quickly and buy the shares soon after each announced its dividend. Over the years, our nimble approach to dividend investing has frequently enabled us to profit from long-term investments in high-growth technology companies that many passive or formulaic dividend investors likely missed (e.g., American Tower, Mastercard, Meta, Visa).”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Goldman’s Top Stock Analyst Is Waiting for AI Bubble to Burst",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Over three decades on Wall Street, Jim Covello has learned how painful it can be to bet against an inflating tech stock bubble. The market has a way of minting riches, month after month, even after it’s clear the latest breakthroughs aren’t playing out quite as expected.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCanada’s Immigration Minister Has a Message for Foreign Students: You Can’t All Stay US Floats Tougher Trade Rules to Rein In China Chip Industry Brookfield Lines Up a 36-Year-Old Rising Star as Next Billionaire CEO High-Flying Chipmakers See Worst Plunge Since 2020: Markets Wrap Biden Faces Intensified Calls to Step Aside While Ill With Covid\n\nIt happened with dot-com companies in the late 1990s and more recently with cryptocurrencies. And Covello, the head of equity research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., says it’ll likely happen with artificial intelligence, too, making it dangerous, if not outright foolish, to start wagering against the likes of Nvidia Corp.\n\nAnd yet, he has no doubt that the reckoning is coming. It might not be this year or even next year, for that matter, but at some point, he says, it’s happening. As he sees it, the hundreds of billions of dollars companies are plowing into AI won’t set off the next economic revolution — or even rival the benefits of the smartphone and the Internet. And when that becomes clear, all the stocks that have surged on the back of its promise will come sliding down, too.\n\n“Most technology transitions in history, particularly the ones that have been transformational, have seen us replace very expensive solutions with very cheap solutions,” said Covello, who first made a name for himself at Goldman as a tech stock analyst. “Potentially replacing jobs with tremendously costly technology is basically the polar opposite.”\n\nCovello is emerging as a leader of a small but growing cohort of market watchers who are casting doubt on a crucial tenet of the rally that’s added nearly $16 trillion to the S&P 500 since late 2022: The idea that the dazzling power of large-language models will usher in the next great stage of capitalism, one where corporate profits will boom as more and more work is handed over to intelligent machines, boosting efficiencies and accelerating growth.\n\nThere are plenty of believers. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s chief executive officer, has said he’s convinced that AI will unleash extraordinary changes, potentially as transformative as those brought by the printing press, the steam engine and electricity. State Street Corp.’s chief investment strategist, Michael Arone, said it’s bringing a “prolonged and unprecedented productivity miracle.” Even inside Covello’s own firm, senior global economist Joseph Briggs estimates AI will ultimately automate a quarter of all work tasks and provide a boost to the pace of economic growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch speculation, in turn, has set off a very concrete boom as the world’s biggest tech companies invest heavily in a bid to extend their dominance to the newest sphere. That’s been a bounty for companies like Nvidia, Broadcom Inc. and Super Micro Computer Inc. that provide the hardware needed to power AI models. Even utilities have seen sales jump amid soaring demand from electricity thirsty data centers.\n\nThe problem though, the skeptics say, is that the commercial hopes for the technology may be significantly overblown, creating the risk of a stock-market correction if the tech Goliaths rethink their massive investments.\n\n‘The Last Sucker’\n\nDavid Bahnsen, founder and chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group, has been preparing for that scenario. He has avoided Nvidia and other large tech stocks, anticipating what he sees as a potential “disaster.”\n\n“The way we make money is to not be holding the bag when the last sucker places that trade on Cisco in March of 2000,” he said, referring to the precipitous drop that the hardware company’s shares suffered after the dot-com bubble burst. “A lot of people are going to lose money if they don’t trade out.”\n\nSo far, there’s been few signs of that. While tech stocks tumbled Wednesday on worries chipmakers will be pulled more deeply into a US-China trade war, they are still holding near record highs. Nearly half of the S&P 500’s advance since it bottomed out in October 2022 have been concentrated in just six stocks: Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia, Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms.\n\nNvidia, which alone has added nearly $2 trillion in market value this year, remains one of the most popular stocks on Wall Street: Sixty four of the analysts who follow the chipmaker are still advising clients to buy it — even after a nearly 140% jump this year. Only one says to sell.\n\nThe payoff from all that AI investment so far, though, has been relatively modest.\n\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta have collectively pumped more than $150 billion into capital expenditures in the last four quarters, with much of that for computing capacity to train their own large-language models and run workloads for customers.\n\nMicrosoft, which has been infusing OpenAI’s technology across its product line, said in April that AI services contributed 7 percentage points to the 31% expansion of sales from Azure and other cloud services in its fiscal third quarter, without giving the dollar amount.\n\nAmazon, with projected sales of more than $600 billion this year, has said only that its AI business has a “multi-billion dollar revenue run rate.” On Alphabet’s first quarter earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat acknowledged “an increasing contribution from AI” to Google Cloud revenue.\n\nTo bulls like Adam Gold, whose largest position is Nvidia shares, the focus on some of those numbers is premature. The Katam Hill chief investment officer notes that companies like Meta — which doesn’t charge users — are already seeing sales growth by using AI to improve algorithms for ad placement and engagement.\n\n“These are the smartest, best capital allocators in the world,” he said. “They’re building these data centers to drive profitability in out years.”\n\nFor some of the customers of the cloud-computing giants, the gains have been less evident. In May, Salesforce Inc. shares tumbled after the software company projected the slowest quarterly sales growth in its history despite long touting the potential for AI to boost sales. According to a survey conducted by San Francisco-based Lucidworks, fewer than half of companies investing in AI have yet to see a significant return.\n\n‘Bubbles Take Time’\n\nCovello is doubtful that most ever will. He has followed the tech industry’s ups and downs since joining Goldman in 2000 after stints with SG Cowen and Smith Barney. He specialized in semiconductor-equipment companies, wracking up awards year after year as the sector’s top analyst, before being promoted in 2015 to the firm’s director of Americas equity research.\n\nTo get an adequate return on the approximately $1 trillion of AI infrastructure investment he expects to see over the next several years, companies would need to be able to use it to solve increasingly complex tasks.\n\nAs he sees it, AI has shown the promise of making some jobs like coding more efficient, but not by nearly enough to justify the expense.\n\nIf significant uses don’t start to become apparent in the next year and a half, Covello says, the stock-market tide will turn. Yet he doesn’t think it’s nearing that stage yet, with the continued buildout likely to keep driving investors into stocks like Nvidia.\n\n“One of the most important lessons I’ve learned over the past three decades,” he said, “is that bubbles can take a long time to burst.”\n\n--With assistance from Alexandra Semenova.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek’s Donald Trump Interview Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail How Trader Joe’s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit Interviewing Trump on His Plans for the US Economy What Americans Invest In Now\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "How Apple and Samsung are selling gen AI is wildly different",
        "content": "The world’s two biggest smartphone makers, Samsung and Apple (AAPL), are going all in on generative AI. Take a look at Samsung’s latest Galaxy Unpacked event in Paris, where the company debuted its latest foldable smartphones and espoused the benefits of its Galaxy AI platform.\n\nApple, meanwhile, spent the majority of its WWDC event in June focusing on how its Apple Intelligence generative AI software will power new features on its iPhones. But the companies that, according to IDC, made up a combined 36.6% of the global smartphone market as of the second quarter of 2024, are taking decidedly different approaches to bringing generative AI to their users.\n\nSamsung is angling to quickly build a large user base for its generative AI services, thus incentivizing developers to build apps for its Galaxy AI platform. And as those apps prove to be more capable and useful, Samsung will draw in more users.\n\nSamsung’s Galaxy AI features are available on this year’s Galaxy S24, last year’s S23, and 2022’s Galaxy S22, not to mention three generations of its foldable phones. Overall, Samsung says it expects to put Galaxy AI on some 200 million devices by the end of the year. Apple, however, says only people who own its most powerful iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and later iterations of the ubiquitous smartphone will get Apple Intelligence features. Samsung president Roh Tae-moon speaks during the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event. (Emmanuel Dunand/AFP via Getty Images) (EMMANUEL DUNAND via Getty Images)\n\nApple is banking on boosting iPhone sales in the near to medium term by getting users who are interested in generative AI apps to upgrade to the next generation of devices, rather than holding on to their current iPhones for years to come.\n\nDespite the difference in approaches, both companies still need to prove to consumers that generative AI apps are worth the hype. And that will take time.\n\n“Through 2025, if not a little bit longer, most of the purchasing would be purchasing that would have happened anyway as opposed to [people] running out because they need [AI] features,” explained Ryan Reith, program vice president for IDC's Mobile Device Tracker suite.\n\nSamsung vs. Apple\n\nSamsung got the jump on Apple in the AI race, debuting its Galaxy AI platform, complete with a handful of Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) AI apps, alongside its Galaxy S24 line in January. Since then, the company says 77% of S24 users have used its AI capabilities at least once per week. So far, Samsung says Google’s Circle to Search feature, which lets you snap photos of objects and text and circle them to identify or translate them, is among users’ favorite AI options. Apple CEO Tim Cook delivers remarks at the start of the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10, 2024, in Cupertino, Calif. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nIn addition to Google’s Circle to Search, Samsung offers AI-powered translation, transcription, text composition, and photo editing apps. Of those, I find transcription to be the most useful. Photo editing, which lets you manipulate photos using generative AI, feels like more of a party trick than a must-have feature that people will use on a regular basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, those options are a start. And getting them into the hands of users and developers will inevitably help Samsung create more interesting and, importantly, useful AI offerings moving forward.\n\n“I think Samsung is recognizing that they want to get [Galaxy AI] out there to as many people as they can,” explained TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell.\n\n“They want to get developers excited to create things for their platforms. And so, this is a way to do that, because all of a sudden, you've got a significantly larger install base with Samsung incorporating a few previous generations, whereas, obviously with Apple, it's going be a significantly smaller install base,” he added.\n\nSamsung’s approach should incentivize developers eager to reach a large user base to begin building apps for its platform. And if those developers build engaging apps, users will inevitably opt for Samsung’s devices to gain access to those apps. The approach isn’t going to move smartphone units in the immediate future, but if customers like using apps built for Samsung’s AI services, they’ll be far more likely to purchase the company’s devices when they’re shopping for a new phone in the future. Samsung's Annika Bizon speaks during the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked in Paris on July 10, 2024. (Emmanuel Dunand /AFP via Getty Images) (EMMANUEL DUNAND via Getty Images)\n\nApple, however, isn’t interested in waiting for phone sales to trickle in over time. The company clearly wants users to go buy its next-generation iPhone the moment it hits the market, likely this September. It makes sense for Apple. The iPhone is its most important product, and after sales declines in 2023 and a mixed start to 2024, getting new devices into consumers' hands sooner rather than later is a must.\n\nWall Street is hoping the company’s Apple Intelligence platform helps power a new sales cycle in the year ahead. Tying the software to the latest and greatest iPhones gives Apple a better chance of pulling that off.\n\nBut it also means it’ll have a smaller install base of users for its generative AI products than Samsung. And that could hurt AI developers building on Apple’s software, at least in the near term.\n\nDo consumers really want generative AI?\n\nAll of this generative AI talk, though, won’t be worth a thing if consumers don’t actually understand it. While Samsung’s early usage numbers are impressive, they only account for users who access its AI software once per week. Considering we pick up our phones dozens of times each day, that’s not exactly a ringing endorsement just yet.\n\nAnecdotally, my family and friends are still largely confused by what adding generative AI to their smartphones means for them. While Samsung and Apple have made splashy announcements, the average consumer, at least in so far as my own circle goes, doesn’t quite get the whole concept quite yet.\n\nFor now, we’ll have to see how Apple pitches its Apple Intelligence during its expected iPhone event in September and how Samsung and Google continue to evolve their own messaging and offerings in the months ahead.

        "content": "A jet and its entrails. Google and partners are talking with Cirium on how to measure flight emissions. Jordanlye / Getty Images\n\nGoogle, a key partner in the Prince Harry-founded Travalyst coalition, has been a leading authority on measuring airline emissions.\n\nGoogle’s Travel Impact Model, published in 2022 and developed in partnership with the International Council on Clean Transportation, has enabled Travalyst partners ranging from Booking.com to Expedia and Skyscanner to publish flight emissions estimates. Google Flights, as well as Amadeus, Sabre, Travelport, and Trip.com Group, all Travalyst partners, also use it.\n\nBut two months ago, Cirium, an aviation analytics company, launched a new system that seemingly fills gaps in measuring airline emissions and fuel burn. Its Emerald Sky methodology, geared for business travel firms, airlines, and aircraft financing companies, is said to measure emissions and fuel burn down to the seat level, according to a recent Skift story.\n\nCirium subsequently told Skift that it and Google/Travalyst have not been working together. “Cirium and Travalyst are fundamentally different organizations,” although “highly complementary,” it said.\n\nBut a few days later, Dan Rutherford, aviation program director at the International Council on Clean Transportation, told Skift that the two groups were in talks.\n\n“We’re in discussions now with Cirium about their model,” Rutherford said. “Their model looks robust, with their methodology accounting for two factors that lead most emissions models to underestimate fuel burn: variations in aircraft empty weights, and degradation over time. Since the TIM Advisory Committee has agreed to investigate both in its second year, we look forward to learning more about how Emerald Sky takes these into account.”\n\nThe International Council on Clean Transportation heads the advisory committee for Google’s Travel Impact Model, and members include representatives from American Airlines, easyJet, Lufthansa Group, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, the FAA, Travalyst, and academic institutions such as MIT and the Imperial College of London.\n\nTravel Impact Model and Emerald Skies\n\nUsing the Google-developed Travel Impact Model, online travel brands such as Google Flights can help travelers assess the emissions impact before they book. For example, a listing could show that selecting a JetBlue Heathrow-JFK flight on August 21 generates emissions 13% higher than the average on that route, and that opting for a Lufthansa/Condor flight comes with emissions 9% lower than the average.\n\n“Clear and credible sustainability information is essential for informed decision-making,” said Sally Davey, Travalyst CEO. “Consistency builds trust, which is why we have scaled the TIM across the Travalyst coalition. Now, anyone booking travel on platforms including Amadeus, Booking.com, Expedia.com, Google, Sabre, Skyscanner, Travelport, and Trip.biz has access to the same flight emissions estimates.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCirium CEO Jeremy Bowen said in the earlier Skift story that the company doesn’t measure emissions based on averages or a generic A320, but on the actual aircraft as configured by the airline.\n\nThe company told me a week ago that while Cirium is an aviation analytics firm, Travalyst isn’t. “It is a consortium of companies dedicated dedicated to promoting sustainable tourism. Their goal is to facilitate sustainable best practices and provide travelers with sustainability information to facilitate eco-friendly travel choices during booking.”\n\nDespite what Cirium sees as the disparate tacks of Cirium versus Travalyst, Cirium said “should the right project arise, we would welcome the opportunity to collaborate.”\n\nBeyond Travalyst\n\nMany travel industry entities working on sustainability don’t work with Travalyst.\n\nFor example, HRS uses World Sustainable Hospitality Alliance methodologies, and is a member of the Climate Pledge, but does not actively work with Travalyst on sustainability in hospitality, said HRS Chief Product Officer Michael Biermann.\n\n“We’re not involved in these programs,” said Biermann, referring to Travalyst and the Travel Impact Model. “We’re not involved in flights or the air segment at all. We really focus on hotels and how hotels can provide the necessary data to report.”\n\nThe HRS Green Stay Initiative enables corporations and hotels to measure carbon footprint data at the property level. It is geared to help with reporting requirements, and gives companies the data they require to carry out a sustainable procurement strategy in hotel selections, according to HRS.\n\nBiermann said, however, that HRS talks to Travalyst “continually,” and through a technology vendor it supplies data to Travalyst on hotel certifications.\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n\nView comments",

But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at GitLab, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For GitLab, the 200-day moving average sits at $55.6, according to Benzinga Pro, which is above the current price of $54.96.

        "title": "Alphabet (GOOGL) Stock: Buy, Sell or Hold Before Q2 Earnings?",
        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL is scheduled to report second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 23. \r\n\r\nThe search giant’s upcoming results are expected to reflect strength in Android, and solid momentum in search and cloud businesses. Expanding generative AI capabilities are likely to have been major positives.\r\n\r\nHowever, increasing litigation issues and expenses are likely to have been concerning.\r\n\r\nFor the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $70.55 billion, indicating growth of 13.7% from the year-ago quarter’s actual.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.85 per share, which implies a rise of 28.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. The estimate has been revised upward by 0.5% in the past seven days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlphabet has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 11.34%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alphabet this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nGOOGL has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nKey Factors to Influence Alphabet’s Q2 Results\n\nStrong Generative AI Capabilities\n\nAlphabet has been cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. This is likely to have benefited the quarterly performance significantly. \r\n\r\nGrowing momentum in Google’s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is anticipated to have been a positive. \r\n\r\nGoogle’s introduction of various open-source tools to support generative AI projects and infrastructure is another plus. The company’s launch of an enterprise-focused AI code completion and assistance tool called Gemini Code Assist is noteworthy. These tools are likely to have contributed well to top-line growth by delivering enhanced user experience.\n\nStrength in Search, YouTube & Ad\n\nAlphabet division Google’s continued efforts toward innovation in AI techniques for the advancement of its search segment, which accounts for a major portion of its total revenues, are expected to have driven traffic on its platform in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe integration of generative AI technology into the search engine is expected to have continued to benefit Google Search. With the large language models (LLM), GOOGL is likely to have driven its search momentum in the second quarter. LLMs, coupled with multi-search and visual exploration features, are expected to have continued improving the search results.\r\n\r\nThe Search Generative Experience (“SGE”), which leverages generative AI technology to make search results more natural and intuitive, is likely to have contributed well.\r\n\r\nThe company’s strength in the mobile search category on the back of mobile-friendly algorithms, robust product listings and flight search capabilities is a plus. It is likely to have boosted the search traffic on the Chrome browser in the second quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Search & Other revenues is pegged at $47.46 billion, indicating an increase of 11.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nComing to the advertisement business, Alphabet’s growing efforts to deliver better performance and profitability to advertisers on the back of foundational research models and LLMs are expected to have contributed well.\r\n\r\nSGE is expected to have aided the advertisement business as it can create relevant, customized and high-quality ads. The strength in the conversational experience of Google Ads and Performance Max is likely to have driven the company’s momentum among advertisers in the second quarter. The improving performance of YouTube ads is anticipated to have been another positive.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for Google advertising is pegged at $64.28 billion, implying growth of 10.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nComing to non-advertisement revenues of YouTube, strengthening user momentum in YouTube Shorts is likely to have been a tailwind. Google’s growing efforts to bolster relationships with content creators are likely to have acted as a positive.\r\n\r\nThe growing momentum across Android and Pixel devices is expected to have benefited Alphabet’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned factors are anticipated to have benefited Google’s Services segment’s performance in the second quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Services revenues is pegged at $73.43 billion, indicating growth of 10.8% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowing Cloud & Other Bets Businesses\n\nAlphabet has been rapidly growing in the booming cloud-computing market. Google Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon’s AMZN AWS and Microsoft’s MSFT Azure, which hold the first and second positions, respectively.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud has turned out to be the key growth driver for Alphabet, owing to strengthening cloud service offerings. The solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace is expected to have driven growth in the Google Cloud segment.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI are expected to have been major positives.\r\n\r\nIts strengthening generative AI-backed cloud offerings are expected to have driven Google’s momentum among cloud customers in the quarter-to-be-reported.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Cloud revenues is pegged at $10.08 billion, suggesting growth of 25.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s strengthening efforts to bolster its healthcare technology portfolio are expected to have driven growth in its Other Bets segment in the second quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Other Bets revenues is pegged at $414.82 million, suggesting growth of 45.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nAlphabet’s shares have appreciated 31.5% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry, S&P 500 index and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s rally of 28.8%, 17% and 25.6%, respectively.\r\n\r\nAlphabet has also outperformed its cloud peers Amazon and Microsoft’s growth of 27.1% and 19.6% year to date, respectively.\n\nYear-to-Date Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNow, let us look at the value GOOGL offers investors at current levels.\n\nCurrently, GOOGL is trading at a discount, with a forward 12-month P/E of 22.56X compared with the industry’s 23.68X, indicating a good entry point for investors.\n\nGOOGL's P/E F12M Graph Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nAlphabet faces significant litigation across various regions, especially the United States and the European Union. Regulatory scrutiny continues to worsen, with the competition commission issuing several statements of objections. Stiff competition in various fields, such as cloud computing and generative AI space, does not bode well for its market position.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is hard to ignore Alphabet’s growing efforts to bolster its generative AI capabilities. Its leading position in the search engine space, strengthening cloud footprint, solid momentum in YouTube and Android, and growing traction in the autonomous driving space should aid Alphabet’s prospects.\n\nFinal Take\n\nAlthough Alphabet presents a compelling investment opportunity, owing to its fundamental strength, investors should take a nuanced approach as both opportunities and challenges warrant careful consideration. Investors should not rush in to buy the stock. Those who already have the GOOGL stock in their portfolio can hold on to it because the search giant is less likely to disappoint.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors alike.\n\nMany investors also have a go-to methodology that helps guide their buy and sell decisions. One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.\n\nIs This 1 Momentum Stock a Screaming Buy Right Now?\n\nDifferent than value or growth investors, momentum-oriented investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly with more than 94% of the online search volume and market. Over the years, the company has witnessed increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements in ad formats.\n\nGOOGL sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), holds a Momentum Style Score of A, and has a VGM Score of A. The stock is down 2.7% and up 5% over the past one-week and four-week period, respectively, and Alphabet has gained 48.6% in the last one-year period as well. Additionally, an average of 19,406,366 shares were traded over the last 20 trading sessions.\n\nA company's earnings performance is important for momentum investors as well. For fiscal 2024, one analyst revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for GOOGL, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0 to $7.61 per share. GOOGL also boasts an average earnings surprise of 11.3%.\n\nInvestors should take the time to consider GOOGL for their portfolios due to its solid Zacks Ranks, notable earnings metrics, and impressive Momentum and VGM Style Scores.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) biggest-ever acquisition could face US pushback no matter who wins the White House this November.\n\nThe reported $23 billion bid to buy fast-growing cloud cybersecurity firm Wiz is the kind that is almost sure to attract scrutiny from Washington competition watchdogs, along with inevitable delays.\n\nA US regulatory review could stall a tie-up into next year, making it possible that a new administration could be tasked with evaluating its competitive risks.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean Alphabet, which is already fighting antitrust challenges on other fronts, would be free of yet another legal fight.\n\n\"The current administration looks at vertical issues more heavily than has historically been the case,\" Colin Kass, a partner with Proskauer and co-chair of the firm’s antitrust group, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"But even the prior administration, under Trump, did look at vertical issues even more so than earlier administrations.\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe Biden administration has tried to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries, from healthcare to groceries to tech.\n\nBut a second Trump administration may not be much friendlier, especially with the giants of Silicon Valley.\n\nWhen Trump was president last decade, his administration launched antitrust investigations into Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Alphabet's Google. His administration also filed a lawsuit against Google, targeting its dominance as a search engine.\n\nThat search engine case, which the Biden administration decided to continue, wrapped up earlier this year, and a decision from a judge is expected soon.\n\nTrump suggested in an interview with Bloomberg Tuesday that major tech companies do need some reining in to limit hazards to children, though he added that he didn't want to go after them violently because the approach could destroy them.\n\nAnd Trump’s new vice-presidential candidate, Sen. J.D. Vance, has called for the breakup of Google while also expressing admiration for Lina Khan, the Federal Trade Commission boss who has led the scrutiny of a number of merger attempts in the tech world.\n\n\"I guess I look at Lina Khan as one of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is doing a pretty good job,\" Vance said in February.\n\nA former FTC official who spoke with Yahoo Finance and asked to remain anonymous agreed an Alphabet-Wiz deal would spark a review, no matter who is in the White House. Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, attends a campaign rally in Ohio. (AP Photo/Jeff Dean) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut a Trump-led DOJ or FTC, the former official said, would more likely favor concessions from Alphabet over litigation if a review raised competition concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegulators could even probe for evidence to learn if Google is already engaged in the cloud cybersecurity market in hopes of challenging the company on grounds that the deal poses a potential, rather than existing, competition threat.\n\nThe former FTC official said that evidence might not support the theory, but such an investigation could be worthwhile for regulators to explore because they are interested in further developing the law on potential threats.\n\nThat, too, could take up substantial time.\n\nIf a deal to buy Wiz does in fact move forward, either the DOJ or FTC would lead any ensuing investigation.\n\nAt preliminary stages, merger and acquisition reviews typically span 30 days, with room for extensions. If officials decide to move beyond preliminary review to what’s known as a second request, the additional investigation can take six to 18 months. Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) (Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images)\n\nOnly then, once a second request is completed, could a legal challenge to the transaction happen.\n\n\"So we're talking at a minimum of probably eight months before there's an actual challenge and, more likely, a year or more before there's an actual challenge,\" Kass said.\n\nThe antitrust experts said competition concerns could include fears that an acquisition would give Alphabet’s Google an opportunity to disadvantage rivals or diminish competition in a downstream market.\n\nNew York University professor Lawrence White said an Alphabet-Wiz deal could also receive scrutiny from regulators abroad.\n\nThat would pose additional complications for the companies since the EU keeps turning up the heat on US tech giants.\n\nJust last month European regulators hit Microsoft (MSFT) with an antitrust charge one day after the same regulatory body charged Apple with violating European Union competition law.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

It also highlights the military's role in developing one of Israel's most successful sectors.\n\nAlong with universities, Israel's military intelligence and technology units, such as 8200, have provided the leaders for hundreds of tech start ups, helping to turn Israel into what is widely considered the No. 2 tech centre globally after Silicon Valley.\n\nCheck Point Software Technologies, Nice, Palo Alto Networks, CyberArk, Wix and Waze - bought by Google for $1 billion - are a handful of companies whose founders have military roots.\n\nRappaport credits the Israeli military for his success, once calling the 8200 unit \"the best school of entrepreneurship.\"\n\nHe served there with his \"army buddies\" Yinon Costica, Roy Reznik and Ami Luttwak, with whom he co-founded his previous cloud security company Adallom in 2012, which they sold to Microsoft three years later for $320 million.\n\nIn 2020, at the outset of the COVID pandemic, the four started cloud cyber security company Wiz, rapidly building it into a company that was given a $12 billion valuation after a $1 billion funding round in May this year.\n\n\"In a way it's like raising tigers and then releasing them to the wild,\" Gili Raanan, founder of Venture capital firm Cyberstarts and general partner at Sequoia Capital said of the intelligence units.\n\n8200 GRADUATES DOMINATE\n\nHe said being from an elite intelligence unit is not a requirement for him when investing, however, \"90% to 95% of the teams I see are made up made up of 8200 graduates.\"\n\n\"So whether I look into that or not, that's the talent pool I am looking at.\"\n\nPart of the reason is the free wheeling, meritocratic nature of the units, which allow their graduates to move smoothly into the startup world after their service ends, said Raanan, who was an initial investor in both Adallom and Wiz - now headquartered in New York with R&D in Tel Aviv.\n\nStory continues\n\nRappaport did not initially want to accept money from Sequoia for Adallom in 2012 and declined a number of meeting requests from Raanan.\n\nRaanan insisted and he eventually agreed to meet at a gas station about 40 minutes north of Tel Aviv. \"Essentially we signed the terms on a napkin in a gas station.\"\n\nWhile Israel has mandatory post-high school military service, the intelligence units have the right of first refusal so they \"can screen for the best people,\" said Dror Bin, chief executive of the Israel Innovation Authority.\n\n8200 is the army's main information gathering unit, where 18-21-year old soldiers develop and use tools to gather information, which they pass on to senior officials. It's Israel's version of the U.S. National Security Agency.\n\nLess known is 81, the Intelligence Corp’s Technological Unit that supplies cutting-edge technologies to Israeli combat soldiers.\n\nRappaport also served in this unit, which has been the launchpad for many cyber, AI and fintech firms once soldiers return to civilian life.\n\nSTART-UP STRENGTH\n\nDespite the cloud cast over the economy by the Gaza war, Israeli companies have been among the major beneficiaries of the boom in demand for cloud security and have benefited from a number of strong financing rounds.\n\nIndustry group Startup Nation Central on Wednesday said in a report that private funding in Israeli startups rose 31% to $5.1 billion in the first half of 2024 from the second half of 2023, with cybersecurity contributing 52% of the funding.\n\n\"One might expect the 'Israeli factor' to have a stronger impact on the Israeli tech activity, but the data suggests otherwise,\" Avi Hasson, Startup Nation Central chief executive, said.\n\nIf the Wiz acquisition goes ahead, it would eclipse a $15.3 billion purchase of Mobileye by Intel in 2017 and provide at least $1 billion of tax income into Israeli coffers.\n\n\"Even if it doesn't happen, it's a sign of confidence in the Israeli tech sector,\" said Bin.\n\n\"Deciding to make such a big investment in an Israeli based company during time of war means that it's really a good deal,\" he said adding he expected to see more.\n\n\"There are many good targets in Israel today for such acquisitions. And maybe even this potential decision of Google will accelerate investment decisions of others.\"\n\nAmiram Shachar, CEO and co-founder of Israeli cloud security firm Upwind Security said Google potentially buying Wiz is the \"best thing\" that could have happened for both the cybersecurity and cloud industries and Israel's ecosystem will benefit.\n\n\"It confirms that the cloud is the future,\" he said, \"and underscores the need to build comprehensive platforms, not just feature-specific companies, to protect it.\"\n\n(Reporting by Steven Scheer; Editing by Sharon Singleton)\n\nView comments",

The infrastructure business is at a nearly $40 billion revenue per year run-rate; however, we think it underearns compared to its peers as the Company has priced its services to take share from its two larger peers, AWS and Azure. Despite of this competitive stance, Alphabet has a differentiated service offering that it has have developed over the years, particularly related to AI, that should yield better returns as customers look to allocate more of their IT budgets to generative AI.\"\n\nPhoto by Firmbee.com on Unsplash\n\nAlphabet Inc.

        "title": "1 Unstoppable Stock Set to Join Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft in the $3 Trillion Club",
        "content": "The U.S. economy has a centurylong history of producing the world's most valuable companies:\n\nUnited States Steel became the world's first $1 billion company in 1901. General Motors rode the automotive manufacturing boom to become the first $10 billion company in 1955. General Electric built a conglomerate selling a wide range of products from plane engines to household appliances, and it became the world's first $100 billion enterprise in 1995. Apple achieved a $1 trillion valuation in 2018 following the incredible success of devices like the iPhone.\n\nMicrosoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) have since joined Apple in the trillion-dollar club.\n\nIn fact, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have each graduated to the ultra-exclusive $3 trillion level, but I think one more company is set to join them.\n\nAlphabet is the tech conglomerate behind Google, YouTube, Waymo, DeepMind, and a host of other subsidiaries. It's a recognized leader in the fast-growing artificial intelligence (AI) space, which could be its ticket to a $3 trillion valuation by the end of 2025.\n\nAlphabet is currently valued at $2.3 trillion, so investors who buy the stock today could earn a gain of 32% if it does join the likes of Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Image source: Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet is transforming is legacy business with AI\n\nAlphabet is at a crossroads. The company generates more than half of its revenue from Google Search, which has a 91% market share in the internet search industry. However, AI chatbots like ChatGPT offer a more convenient way to directly access information, and they can produce it instantly. Microsoft even struck a deal with OpenAI last year to use ChatGPT in its Bing search engine in an attempt to disrupt Google.\n\nBut Google Search has been the window to the internet for decades, so Alphabet arguably has more valuable data with which to build AI models than any other tech giant. It launched its own chatbot called Bard last year, which evolved to become a family of multimodal models called Gemini. They can interpret and produce text, images, videos, and even computer code.\n\nPlus, Alphabet just introduced AI Overviews to the traditional Google Search experience. They are text-based responses that appear at the top of the search results, saving users from sifting through web pages to find answers to their queries. Alphabet says the reference links included in AI Overviews receive more clicks than those that appear in traditional search results, which could drive more advertising revenue and ease concerns over Google losing its dominance.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlus, the Gemini models are creating several other opportunities to generate AI revenue. Google Workspace users can now add Gemini for an additional monthly subscription fee, which will help boost their productivity in applications like Google Docs, Sheets, and Gmail.\n\nAdditionally, the Gemini models are now available on Google Cloud, so developers can use them (along with more than 130 others from third parties) to build their own AI applications. This is a big cost saver for businesses compared to creating a large language model (LLM) from scratch, which takes time, truckloads of data, and substantial financial resources.\n\nSolid financial growth\n\nIn the five years between 2019 and 2023, Alphabet revenue grew at a compound annual rate of 13.7%, bringing in a record $307.4 billion last year alone: A chart of Alphabet's annual revenue between 2019 and 2023.\n\nThe company kicked off 2024 with an above-trend revenue jump of 15% in the first quarter (year over year). It included a 14.3% increase in Google Search revenue alone, which was the fastest pace in almost two years. YouTube's revenue expansion accelerated to 20.8%, and Google Cloud remained the fastest-growing part of the business, with sales soaring by 28.4%.\n\nImproved market conditions were a big help, following a painful slump in the advertising industry throughout 2022 and 2023 due to uncertain economic conditions. But Alphabet could experience even faster growth in the second half of this year, because the U.S. Federal Reserve is forecast to cut interest rates three times in the coming months. It could prompt businesses to spend more money on marketing as they try to reach a consumer with more dollars in their pocket.\n\nAlphabet's (mathematical) path to the $3 trillion club\n\nAlphabet generated $6.52 in earnings per share over the last four quarters, and based on its current stock price of $185.01, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.3.\n\nThat's cheaper than the 32.7 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index, so Alphabet is technically undervalued relative to its peers in the tech sector.\n\nIt also makes Alphabet much cheaper than all three members of the $3 trillion club, which trade at an average P/E ratio of 50.2 (which is heavily skewed by Nvidia's lofty valuation): NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nI don't think it would be appropriate for Alphabet's P/E to rise to 50.2, but if it did, that would value the company at over $4 trillion. But it could rise to the average P/E ratio of Apple and Microsoft (37.6), which would be enough to place Alphabet in the $3 trillion club.\n\nBut even if Alphabet doesn't experience any multiple expansion (a rise in its P/E ratio), it could join the $3 trillion club within the next 18 months solely based on the growth of its business.\n\nHow? Wall Street expects the company to deliver $8.61 in earnings per share in 2025, placing Alphabet stock at a forward P/E ratio of 21.5. That means its shares will have to rise 32% between now and then just to maintain their current P/E ratio of 28.3. That gain will be enough to value the company at $3 trillion.\n\nI'm not the only one who thinks Alphabet is a great value at the current price. The company expanded its share repurchase program by a whopping $70 billion earlier this year, which means it will periodically buy chunks of its own stock to return money to shareholders.\n\nIn summary, Alphabet has more than one path into the exclusive $3 trillion club, and investors who buy the stock today could earn a nice gain along the way.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL shares have rallied 33.7% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 29.1%. It is benefiting from strength in the Google Services segment, which is mainly driven by Search, YouTube and Android.\r\n\r\nThe company is continuously expanding YouTube’s capabilities to strengthen Google Services segment..\r\n\r\nPer a 9to5Google report, Alphabet recently added a “Mark as played” feature to YouTube Music, allowing podcasters to mark an episode as played or unplayed, with confirmation messages appearing in the overflow menu.\r\n\r\nGoogle also added an official sound search feature to YouTube Music, allowing users to query over 100 million official songs by sound while also testing AI-generated conversational radio for U.S. Premium subscribers.\r\n\r\nAlphabet partnered with Garmin GRMN in a bid to boost YouTube Music’s adoption rate by expanding its reach to more platforms.\r\n\r\nThe YouTube Music app is now available on Garmin IQ Connect smartwatches. The app experience is similar to Wear OS watches, with users able to search their library for music and podcasts and a slick playing page with physical buttons for play, pause, and skip.\r\n\r\nGrowing YouTube Music efforts will enable Alphabet to capitalize on the solid growth opportunity present in the music streaming market, which, per a Grand View Research report, is expected to witness a CAGR of 14.4% between 2023 and 2030.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it would also aid Alphabet in narrowing down its gap from Spotify SPOT and Amazon AMZN. \r\n\r\nPer a Statista report, Spotify maintained its dominant position in the music streaming space in 2023 with a market share of 32%.\r\n\r\nAmazon, on the other hand, is making continuous efforts to strengthen its foothold in the music streaming market with Amazon Music. It recently introduced Maestro, an AI playlist generator, in Amazon Music, enabling users to create any and all playlists, with the feature currently in beta for select U.S. customers.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nExpanding Google Services Aids Prospects\n\nGoogle rolled-out an updated version of YouTube’s \"Erase Song\" tool which allows content creators to remove copyrighted songs from videos without affecting other audio.\r\n\r\nThe company also introduced new features like Jump Ahead and Shorts Picture-in-Picture for YouTube Premium subscribers. \r\n\r\nIn addition to YouTube, Alphabet is making concerted efforts to enhance its search and Android capabilities in a bid to further boost the Google Services segment.\r\n\r\nAlphabet bolstered its search capabilities with the addition of a “Listen to this page” text-to-speech feature on Google Chrome, enabling users to hear texts on web pages. This new feature will support several languages including Arabic, Bengali, English, French, Chinese, German, Hindi and Portuguese, to name a few.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s launch of Circle to Search allows users to now circle what they see on their Android screens, ask a question about an image or object in a video, and get an AI overview with Lens.\r\n\r\nIt also strengthened Android features with its latest user interface (UI) redesign for one of its Android apps, Google Messages. \r\n\r\nThe company announced a feature on Google Maps that shows entrances for buildings to some select users, addressing the issue of navigating to specific building portions on the map.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nAlphabet’s strength in the Google Services segment is expected to drive its overall financial performance. Its robust cloud division and growing momentum across autonomous driving space, and deepening focus on the wearables category, are other positives. Generative AI strength is expected to boost the company’s long-term prospects. \r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $291.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.6%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.61 per share, indicating a 31.2% rise from the year-ago figure. The figure has been revised upward by 0.1% in the past 7 days.\r\n\r\nAlphabet currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "content": "According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Google’s parent company Alphabet GOOGL is reportedly in talks to acquire cyber security startup Wiz for $23 billion. This potential acquisition would be Google's largest ever and significantly boost its cloud computing capabilities. \r\n\r\nThe potential deal has put ETFs with a substantial allocation to Alphabet in focus. These include Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund XLC, Vanguard Communication Services ETF VOX, Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF FCOM, iShares Global Comm Services ETF IXP and MicroSectors FANG+ ETN FNGS. \r\n\r\nWiz, an Israeli startup founded in 2020, is one of the fastest-growing start-ups in the cloud security arena and has been positioning itself as a platform provider versus leaders Palo Alto Networks PANW, Zscaler ZS and others (read: Tech Sector Dominates First-Half Rally: 5 Best ETFs).\r\n\r\nThe potential deal highlights Alphabet's strategic focus on enhancing its cybersecurity portfolio amid increasing competition in the tech industry. It would boost Google's cloud-computing business, which lags behind Amazon.com (AMZN) unit Amazon Web Services as well as Microsoft (MSFT). Offering an all-in-one approach to cloud security, Wiz relies on ingesting data from various cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, and then scanning it all for security risk factors.\r\n\r\nAlphabet executives see the deal as a way to fortify Google’s cloud business, which grew 28% to $9.57 billion in the first quarter of this year. However, an agreement hasn’t been reached yet, and talks may fall apart.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nLet’s delve into each ETF below:\r\n\r\nCommunication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC) \r\n\r\nCommunication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund offers exposure to companies from telecommunication services, media, entertainment and interactive media & services and has accumulated $19.6 billion in its asset base.

        "content": "C3.ai AI recently announced the launch of C3 Generative AI for Government Programs, an advanced AI application designed to help federal, state and local governments efficiently deliver accurate information to the public about various government programs.\r\n\r\nRunning on Alphabet’s GOOGL cloud business, Google Cloud, this application empowers citizens to easily navigate complex government programs such as healthcare, employment and financial assistance through an intuitive natural language search and chat interface.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging Alphabet’s Google Cloud’s robust infrastructure and advanced language models, C3 Generative AI ensures that users receive trustworthy answers with full source traceability, significantly improving the citizen experience and reducing the burden on government support centers.\n\nExpanding Portfolio and Strong Partner Base Drives AI’s Clientele\n\nThe latest move is in sync with AI’s commitment to enhancing public service efficiency and citizen engagement through advanced generative AI applications tailored for government programs.\n\nC3.ai, Inc. Price and Consensus C3.ai, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nC3.ai, Inc. price-consensus-chart | C3.ai, Inc. Quote\n\nC3.ai is benefiting from an expanding clientele and growing adoption of its Enterprise AI software. In the fiscal 2024, 88% of bookings were driven by AI application sales and 12% were driven by the C3 AI platform.\r\n\r\nThe increasing diversity in bookings has been noteworthy. Federal, Defense and Aerospace, Oil and Gas, State and Local Government, Manufacturing and Energy and Utilities accounted for 49.5%, 15.2%, 10.8%, 6.7% and 6% of fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 bookings, respectively.\r\n\r\nFederal revenues doubled year over year in the fiscal 2024.

        "title": "Alphabet (GOOGL) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth",
        "content": "The market expects Alphabet (GOOGL) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 23, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis internet search leader is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.85 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +28.5%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $70.55 billion, up 13.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alphabet?\n\nFor Alphabet, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Alphabet will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Alphabet would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.89, delivering a surprise of +26.85%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nAlphabet doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors.\n\nAchieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.\n\nWhy This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nDifferent than value or momentum investors, growth-oriented investors are concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, they'll want to focus on the Growth Style Score, which analyzes characteristics like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly with more than 94% of the online search volume and market. Over the years, the company has witnessed increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements in ad formats.\n\nGOOGL is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, with a Growth Style Score of A and VGM Score of A. Earnings are expected to grow 31.2% year-over-year for the current fiscal year, with sales growth of 13.6%.\n\nOne analyst revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0 to $7.61 per share for 2024. GOOGL boasts an average earnings surprise of 11.3%.\n\nAlphabet is also cash rich. The company has generated cash flow growth of 15.1%, and is expected to report cash flow expansion of 16.7% in 2024.\n\nGOOGL should be on investors' short lists because of its impressive growth fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and strong Growth and VGM Style Scores.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "A small group of Dublin residents standing up to their $2.3 trillion neighbors after writing to protest Google’s plans to build a pub on its infamous campus in the city center, increasing tensions as the tech giant’s lofty new development encroaches on their homes.\n\nGoogle Ireland filed an application with Dublin City Council last month to convert a ground floor and lower ground floor unit at its major new development from a “Retail/Café/Restaurant/ Marketplace” to a “Public House.”\n\nIt’s part of a more comprehensive development of Bolands Mills, a patch of land a few hundred meters away from Google’s main office block.\n\nThe former flour mill is expected to become a new retail and hospitality hub for Dubliners, with Google CEO Sundar Pichai promising in 2022 to keep business rates at an affordable level to attract local entrepreneurs.\n\nHowever, seven residents on the adjacent Barrow Street have written to the council to oppose those plans.\n\nLocals raised fears about increased anti-social behavior from people drinking nearby, which it said posed a risk to the safety of the children who lived in the area.\n\nThe letter’s signatories added that there were no public toilets in the local area, specifically between the site of the proposed pub and the local DART rail station.\n\n“Residents already suffer from members of the public urinating on Barrow Street outside of their homes late at night,” opponents concluded.\n\nA representative for Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGoogle’s Dublin conundrum\n\nSince opening its first site in Dublin in 2003, Google has formed an uneasy relationship with the city’s residents.\n\nThe tech giant has given high-income jobs to several Irish natives and is regularly ranked as the country’s most attractive employer.\n\nHowever, that investment is part of the reason behind a major housing crisis in Ireland’s capital, which has come alongside population growth and stalled house-building.\n\nIn November 2020, at the height of the COVID–19 pandemic, Google said it would offer 46 Bolands Mills apartments to front-line workers at reduced rent. Google was one of several companies, including Ryanair and Killarney Hotels Collection, that offered subsidized housing in the capital.\n\nEarlier this year, Google said it planned to hand over those 46 apartments to a social housing trust by the end of 2024.\n\n‘Living on Google’s campus’\n\nResidents on Barrow Street have had a front-row seat to Google’s expansion over the last couple of decades. However, they appear to have reached a breaking point from “effectively living on Google’s campus.”\n\nStory continues\n\nA slightly ironic look at Google Maps would explain why.\n\nOpponents of the pub live in a block of two-story terraced homes just down the road from 47,000 square-meter European headquarters, where the company employs around 5,500 people.\n\nBut across the road is the more pressing matter of Bolands Mills, the new development that towers over the residents’ comparably tiny homes.\n\nThe site draws parallels with the opening scene of Pixar’s Up, where cantankerous widow Carl Fredricksen resists planners’ attempts to construct a major development on top of his quaint home.\n\nThe outcome of residents’ latest David vs Goliath tussle with a wealthy tech giant is unclear, but after Dublin locals recently defeated UFC fighter Conor McGregor’s plans for his own rowdy pub, they might feel more confident than usual.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google deal for 'hot market' cyber firm Wiz would bolster cloud security",
        "content": "By Zeba Siddiqui\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - If Alphabet's Google is successful in its effort to buy cloud security company Wiz, it would bolster its cloud security offerings for large organisations, a hotspot for hackers, and help it take on cloud rivals Amazon.com and Microsoft, experts said.\n\nAlphabet is in advanced talks to acquire Wiz, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday, in an up to $23 billion deal that would be Google's most expensive acquisition and provide it with cybersecurity products that defend against ransomware gangs wreaking havoc on large enterprises.\n\n\"There is a hot market for cloud security,\" said Jerome Seguera, a senior intelligence analyst at the cybersecurity firm MalwareBytes, adding that Wiz gives customers \"great visibility into their assets in a straightforward way.\"\n\nWiz offers tools that allow organisations to scan their entire infrastructure and specific software for threats.\n\nGoogle has been steadily expanding its cybersecurity offerings in recent years. Two years ago it bought the popular cyber firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion.\n\n\"I think they are trying to compete with Microsoft and to a smaller extent AWS (Amazon Web Services),\" said Marc Bleicher, chief technology officer of the security firm Surefire Cyber.\n\n\"Wiz is one of only a few who address a big chunk of the cloud security market in one platform,\" Bleicher said.\n\nWiz was founded in 2020 at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, primed to benefit from the move towards remote work and the shift by organisations to cloud environments from desktops. Most large organisations have also shifted to storing their data on the cloud over the years, but that has come with security risks - especially as companies expand and become more complex.\n\nIts founders, former Israeli army intelligence members, earlier founded another cloud security firm named Adallom that Microsoft bought for $320 million in 2015.\n\nHeadquartered in New York, the company has grown rapidly since then. Only two months ago, at the RSA cybersecurity conference in San Francsico, Wiz said it was valued at $12 billion. It now expects annual organic revenue of $1 billion in 2025 and has raised nearly $2 billion in venture capital investment in total, said a person familiar with the Google deal talks, declining to be named.\n\nThe Wiz buyout talks come as the pace of global dealmaking in cybersecurity has significantly picked up in 2024. There were 120 global cybersecurity deals announced in the first half of this year, accounting for $12.4 billion in deal value, compared to 137 such deals last year, or $4.8 billion in deal value, according to data from the financial information firm Dealogic.\n\nStory continues\n\nDave Dewalt, founder of the cyber-focused venture capital firm NightDragon, said Wiz's growth is the result of strong marketing and being \"at the right place, at the right time, with the right product.\"\n\nDeWalt, former chief executive of cybersecurity firm FireEye, said cloud security is the most important and fastest-growing part of cybersecurity, driven by increasing attacks on large organisations.\n\n\"The stakes are exponentially higher in the cloud. So therefore, the security needs to be exponentially stronger, and (there's) more revenue from it,\" he said, adding that Palo Alto Networks and Crowdstrike had also beefed up their cloud security offerings in recent years.\n\n(Reporting by Zeba Siddiqui in San Francisco, James Pearson in London, Milana Vinn in NEW YORK, and Krystal Hu in San Francisco; Editing by Chris Sanders and Stephen Coates)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in July",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is a term that describes seven of the world's largest tech companies, many of which have been among the best-performing stocks over the past few years. The companies are Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla.\n\nEach Magnificent Seven company is an industry leader in its own right and at the forefront of many innovations. However, the following three companies stand as particularly good buys in July and going forward. If you're looking for tech stocks with appealing growth opportunities to add to your portfolio, they're well worth considering.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nNvidia's stock surge over the past two years has gotten a lot of attention (rightfully so), but Microsoft has also experienced significant growth. It's the second-best performing Magnificent Seven stock over the past three years and up over 22% in 2024 (as of July 12).\n\nA lot has been said about the rising valuations of big tech companies, and many of them are warranted. With a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 39, Microsoft is expensive by virtually all standards, leaving it susceptible to a market correction. MSFT PE Ratio Chart\n\nThankfully, the one thing Microsoft has going for it that other Magnificent Seven stocks don't is the vast ecosystem it has developed through the years. And it's not just the ecosystem, it's the customers that Microsoft serves in this ecosystem: other businesses.\n\nCountless businesses globally count on Microsoft's products and services to run their businesses. Between PCs, Office software, cloud service Azure, and recruiting hub LinkedIn, Microsoft has its hand in multiple crucial enterprise-focused industries.\n\nThis helps shield it a bit against downturns because it's not as easy for businesses to abandon Microsoft's services or products as it is for consumers of other tech companies. By no means does it make Microsoft a foolproof investment, but you can almost be certain of its long-term stability and growth trajectory. If its valuation worries you, I'd recommend dollar-cost averaging your way into a stake.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nDespite surging over 34% this year, Alphabet still seems like a bargain compared to other Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nWhen it comes to market dominance, there may not be a more clear example than Google's search business. Google search has around a 90% market share globally, and it's maintained this dominance for quite some time. And although you never want to make assumptions, it's safe to assume it'll continue this dominance for the foreseeable future.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts leadership position in search has led to a bustling advertising business. In the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, Google advertising generated $61.7 billion in revenue, with Google search specifically bringing in $46.2 billion. Google advertising accounted for over 78% of Alphabet's revenue in Q1 and was up 13% year over year. GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAdvertising will continue to keep Alphabet's lights on, but the growth of its cloud platform, Google Cloud, shouldn't be overlooked. Google Cloud has turned the corner on profitability, and in Q1, its operating income (profit from its core operations) grew 371% to $900 million.\n\nWith a dominant search business, a fast-growing cloud business, and a newly announced dividend ($0.20 quarterly), Alphabet is in a great position for sustained long-term growth.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon became the company it is today because of its e-commerce business, but it has done a great job at branching out and ensuring its business isn't too dependent on just that segment.\n\nHaving the foresight to see the role cloud services would eventually play has worked wonders for Amazon and its bottom line. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the global leader in cloud computing, with a lead it should manage to hold on to for a while, barring a major competitive disruption.\n\nIn Q1, AWS generated just over 17% of Amazon's revenue but over 61% of its operating income. Cloud computing is a much higher-margin business than e-commerce, so its growth will continue to boost Amazon's profitability. Add in the emerging AI innovations, and AWS is becoming a one-stop shop for cloud and AI solutions.\n\nAmazon has spent billions building out its e-commerce and cloud infrastructure, and it's now at the point where it can leverage these investments to generate new revenue streams. Take Supply Chain by Amazon, for example, an end-to-end set of supply chain services that allows sellers to take advantage of Amazon's logistics network.\n\nAmazon is a company built for sustained growth, and investors can feel confident holding on to it for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Better Cloud Computing Stock: Alphabet vs. Super Micro Computer",
        "content": "The arrival of artificial intelligence into the mainstream is a boon for the cloud computing industry. AI needs enormous amounts of data and computing power to execute tasks, both of which are readily available in a cloud environment.\n\nTwo prominent businesses benefiting from AI and its impact on the cloud computing market are Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), commonly known as Supermicro.\n\nHere's how these two tech companies are reaping the rewards from the AI-driven cloud computing boom, and if you had to choose just one to invest in, which might prove the better long-term investment.\n\nAlphabet's multifaceted cloud business\n\nAlphabet is perhaps best known for its ubiquitous Google search engine. But it also has a thriving cloud computing business called Google Cloud.\n\nThis division is experiencing rapid growth. In the first quarter, Google Cloud generated $9.6 billion, which is a 28% increase from 2023's $7.5 billion. It is now the third-largest cloud vendor in the world.\n\nGoogle Cloud offers several benefits to its business clients. Like all cloud offerings, customers can use it to augment or replace existing IT infrastructure, such as servers.\n\nMoreover, Alphabet makes its proprietary AI platform available to clients through Google Cloud, so they can create their own AI systems and apps. Instacart uses this feature to improve its customer service workflows.\n\nIn addition, according to CEO Sundar Pichai, \"Our Cloud business is now widely seen as the leader in cybersecurity.\" Its AI-powered cybersecurity features are why Pfizer adopted Google Cloud.\n\nSuper Micro Computer's focused approach to cloud computing\n\nSupermicro provides computer servers and storage solutions, the exact components critical to cloud computing. It focuses on high-performance computing products to cater to the needs of AI-optimized clouds in particular.\n\nSupermicro offers customers an array of options using a modular approach the company calls its \"Building Block Architecture.\" This approach allows it to quickly customize products to meet the technical requirements of its clientele.\n\nThe sudden AI-spurred demand for Supermicro's offerings led to massive sales growth for the company. In its fiscal Q3, ended March 31, Supermicro achieved revenue of $3.9 billion, a 200% increase year over year.\n\nThe company expects its outsized sales to continue. Supermicro is forecasting revenue of at least $5.1 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter. That's more than double the $2.2 billion in Q4 sales generated in the previous fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro added to its ability to grow revenue through an expanded product line. Its offerings now encompass additional IT infrastructure needs, such as power and liquid cooling systems.\n\nDeciding between Alphabet and Super Micro Computer\n\nThe cloud computing market is expected to see multiyear growth thanks to AI, rising from $588 billion last year to $2.3 trillion by 2032. This growth makes both Alphabet and Supermicro compelling investments for the long term.\n\nHowever, deciding which stock is the better buy can be challenging. In this duel of cloud companies, several factors favor Alphabet.\n\nThe Google parent offers a more diversified business. It has a thriving digital advertising operation, where it's a market leader. Ad sales comprised $61.7 billion of the company's $80.5 billion in Q1 revenue.\n\nAlphabet is also a market leader in online search. Thanks to Google's popularity, Alphabet has a trove of data to feed into and strengthen its AI platform.\n\nAlso, Supermicro battles in a competitive space with rivals including Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\n\nCompetition has led to pricing pressure, causing a decline in Supermicro's gross margin to 15.6% in fiscal Q3 from 17.7% in the prior year. Supermicro expects its gross margin to decline further in fiscal Q4.\n\nAnother factor to consider is valuation. Using the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), a widely used metric to assess a stock's value, Alphabet is the winner. This chart shows that Supermicro's valuation has soared in 2024. SMCI PE Ratio Chart\n\nWhile Supermicro's P/E ratio has come down in recent months, shares remain pricier than Alphabet's.\n\nIn addition, Supermicro is not cash-flow positive. It spent $2.7 billion over the past three quarters building up its product inventory. This resulted in negative free cash flow (FCF) of $1.6 billion in fiscal Q3.\n\nAlphabet isn't burdened with maintaining an inventory of goods to sell, helping it to generate prodigious FCF of $16.8 billion in Q1. Over the trailing 12 months, the company's FCF was $69.1 billion.\n\nIts tremendous FCF allows Alphabet to comfortably afford a dividend. Supermicro doesn't offer a dividend.\n\nWhile both companies are enjoying rising revenue thanks to growth in the cloud computing sector, given Alphabet's market-leading products, strong FCF, more diversified business, and better stock valuation, Alphabet is the superior investment at this time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $791,929!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "The ‘Magnificent Seven’ stocks grew 46% in the last 5 years. How much longer does the term have to run?",
        "content": "Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett popularized the “Magnificent Seven” as a stock term just over a year ago. The movie-inspired moniker refers to Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, which accounted for half of the S&P 500’s total gains last year, according to a report from Morgan Stanley. Like the acronym FAANG before it, the \"Magnificent Seven\" has served as a strategy for some investors—raising the question of how much longer this particular basket of stocks will have an outsize influence.\n\nWhether the term—a reference to an acclaimed 1960 western that Hartnett used in a May 2023 note to investors—has outgrown its relevance is up for debate. What’s not is that shareholders have been rewarded with a combined annualized return of over 46% in the last five years, compared to just over 13% for the S&P.\n\nAngelo Zino of CFRA Research said he expects the earnings trajectory of these seven names to continue to outperform the market over the next decade.\n\n“They're what we view as growth at a reasonable price,” Zino said.\n\nThose high-quality earnings, Zino said, have been especially attractive in a high-interest rate environment, even before the artificial intelligence boom captivated markets.\n\nThe struggles of some members of the Magnificent Seven (particularly Tesla) early in 2024, fears of overconcentration risk, and the emergence of other players in the AI race, however, have analysts like Baird’s Ted Mortonson questioning whether the phrase should remain in fashion.\n\n“Talking about just the Magnificent Seven, you're missing a large swath of other names that could compound returns pretty aggressively in the next two to three years,” he said.\n\nMagnificent Seven present both AI opportunity and defensive play\n\nThe importance of large-cap stocks to the market is not a new phenomenon. A January report from Vanguard found that out of thousands of stocks, only 72 had accounted for half of the market’s total returns since 1926. The trend held even when excluding the explosion of mega-cap tech growth that has inspired several acronyms over the last decade.\n\nCNBC’s Jim Cramer popularized the term FANG (for Facebook parent Meta, Amazon, Netflix, and Google parent Alphabet) in 2013. Eventually, a second A was included to include Apple.\n\nThat term would eventually give way to the Magnificent Seven, a gorup of companies who boast a combined market capitalization of over $16 trillion and loom large in not just the markets but daily life. All seven companies, Zino said, have massive ecosystems that will presumably become only easier to monetize in the age of AI.\n\nStory continues\n\n“These are names that each one of us use to some capacity every single day of our lives,” he said.\n\nThis visibility helps makes these stocks a relative safety net for investors, Zino said. In a market plagued by election fears and geopolitical risks, Mortonson explained, institutional investors demand names sporting massive free cash flows.\n\n“They're almost becoming somewhat defensive plays in a down market just because they are so profitable and dominant,” Mortonson said.\n\nTech behemoths maintain long-term relevance\n\nThe struggles of Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet early in 2024 led some analysts to start dubbing the other four big tech stocks the “Fab Four,” though shares of Apple and Alphabet recovered to outpace the S&P, while a recent Tesla rally virtually erased its year-to-date losses. Bank of America analysts expect growth to broaden out as second-quarter earnings get underway.\n\nIn the near term, Zino believes the sharp outperformance of the Magnificent Seven could cool down as some fund managers reallocate their positions to more value-oriented areas that have underperformed. That doesn’t mean he thinks these companies are going anywhere, particularly in the age of AI.\n\n“We're hard pressed to think that these [Magnificent Seven] names aren't going to be among the biggest winners out there,” he said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2024 Is Halfway Over. Here Are My Top 5 Stock Picks to End the Year",
        "content": "With 2024 halfway done, many investors are assessing their portfolios to see how their picks have performed. While a six-month time span isn't enough to define success or failure in investing, it is a good chance for investors to examine their holdings to see if anything needs to be added.\n\nSo, if you're looking to deploy some cash to increase your exposure in the market, starting with these five is a great idea.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has had a strong year, up 35%. This rise is thanks to its strong advertising performance and the company finally getting its artificial intelligence (AI) product launches right. Alphabet has some serious momentum heading into the second half of the year, yet it doesn't carry a premium price tag.\n\nUnlike other big tech companies that trade for more than 30 times forward earnings, Alphabet commands a 25 times forward earnings premium. While that may not be historically cheap, it is inexpensive in today's market.\n\nWith Alphabet's success and reasonable price tag, I'm confident Alphabet will continue to excel throughout the latter half of 2024.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nSimilarly to Alphabet, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has had tremendous success with its advertising business. Meta is the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, and Messenger, and thrives on advertising.\n\nWhile 2023 wasn't a great year for advertising, 2024 has been phenomenal. In the first quarter, Meta's ad revenue was $35.6 billion, up 27% year over year. That strength is expected to continue throughout this year and bodes well for a company many wrote off a few years ago for shrinking profit margins. META Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nLike Alphabet, Meta isn't historically cheap, but it is less expensive than its peers at 26 times forward earnings. Even though Meta has also had a successful 2024 so far, I think it's poised for more upside to end the year.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is a backdoor way to play AI investing. TSMC is behind many of the chips powering the AI technological wave. It's also a major supplier for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which may see a boost thanks to its new AI technology requiring new-generation phones.\n\nAdditionally, Taiwan Semi's 3 nanometer chip production is ramping up, which will drive increased revenue for the business. Next-generation 2nm chips are slated to start production sometime in 2025, and the hype leading up to the launch could drive TSMC's stock higher.\n\nAlthough the stock is a bit pricey at 29 times forward earnings, I think it could go higher as the demand for AI-related chips picks up.\n\nStory continues\n\n4. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is often called the Amazon of Latin America due to its e-commerce business and logistics network. However, it also has a thriving fintech wing. MercadoLibre's business has been on fire lately, with its Q1 results delivering 94% year-over-year revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis.\n\nMercadoLibre's profit margins have also been ticking up. In Q1 2023, it was 6.3%. In 2024, that figure rose to 7.9%. As MercadoLibre's margins continue to rise, its valuation will start to normalize, but until then, using a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is smarter. MELI PS Ratio Chart\n\nAt 5.5 times sales, MercadoLibre is still well below where it has traded for most of the past decade. If the market wakes up and realizes this, MercadoLibre stock could easily rocket higher to end the year.\n\n5. Salesforce\n\nLastly is Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). Salesforce is the leader in the customer relationship management software space but hit a bump with its earnings report for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2025 (ended April 30). Although it kept its full-year revenue guidance at the same level (8% to 9% growth), its Q2 growth is only expected to be between 7% and 8%.\n\nThat's slower than investors want to see, and the stock got shelled because of it, losing about 20% of its value the following trading day. That's a massive overreaction, considering that the full-year guidance stayed the same. While the stock has partially recovered since that tumble, Salesforce still looks attractive because its profit margins have room for expansion.\n\nThis is reflected in Salesforce's guidance for operating cash flow growth of 21% to 24% for the full year. Although it's not as cheap as it once was, Salesforce still makes for an excellent buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Stocks That Could Join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia in the $3 Trillion Club",
        "content": "The U.S. Senate is sometimes called \"the most exclusive club.\" However, I can think of a club that's much more exclusive than the legislative body, which has 100 members. It's the $3 trillion club.\n\nOnly three companies in the world boast market caps of $3 trillion or more: Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. But this club might be a little less exclusive in the not-too-distant future. Here are three unstoppable stocks that could join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia in the $3 trillion club.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is in the driver's seat to become the next $3 trillion company. The Google parent's market cap currently stands at around $2.3 trillion. At the rate the stock is climbing, it's not out of the question that Alphabet could join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia by early 2025.\n\nMost of Alphabet's revenue and profits continue to be generated by its Google Search business. While some have predicted the rise of generative AI presents an existential threat to search engines, Google has thrived. CEO Sundar Pichai noted in Alphabet's first-quarter earnings call that Google's new AI overviews have increased search usage and user satisfaction with search results.\n\nGoogle Cloud should enjoy a strong tailwind from AI for years to come. The unit's sales jumped 28% year over year in Q1 with operating income soaring 371%. Google Cloud is especially popular with generative AI start-ups, with more than 60% using its cloud service.\n\nYouTube is another key growth driver for the company. It's the leader in U.S. streaming with viewers watching over 1 billion hours of content daily. YouTube now has over 100 million music and premium service subscribers, while YouTube TV claims over 8 million paid subscribers.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't too far behind Alphabet, with a market cap hovering around $2 trillion. I fully expect the e-commerce and cloud services giant will also take a spot in the $3 trillion club within the next two or three years.\n\nLike Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS) should deliver strong growth in the years ahead thanks to the demand for building and deploying AI models. AWS is the leader in the cloud services market. I suspect it will stay on top because of the appeal of new products such as AI-powered software development assistant Q.\n\nAmazon dominates the e-commerce market. Cost improvements in the company's e-commerce platform and distribution network have helped to boost profitability. As Amazon increases delivery speed further, its e-commerce revenue and profits should grow as customers shop online more frequently.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvertising is also an important growth engine for Amazon. In Q1, advertising sales soared 24% year over year on a constant-currency basis. This growth could increase in the future as advertising on Prime Video gains momentum.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has a steeper hill to climb to join the $3 trillion club. The social media leader's market cap of $1.3 trillion is well below the market caps of Alphabet and Amazon. However, I think it's only a matter of time before Meta reaches the $3 trillion threshold.\n\nThe company is an advertising juggernaut. Its apps, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, reach more than 3.2 billion people across the world every day. Advertisers can' ignore such a massive audience.\n\nMeta's efforts to more efficiently monetize its products, especially Reels, are paying off handsomely. Profits more than doubled year over year in Q1. The company continues to get better and better at showing ads to the right person at the right time.\n\nAI presents a major growth opportunity for Meta. In particular, CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that AI-powered business messaging will be the \"next major pillar\" of the company's business.\n\nShould you buy these future members of the $3 trillion club?\n\nYou might think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are no-brainer stocks to buy if they're truly on track to join the $3 trillion club. And you'd be right, in my view.\n\nAll three stocks have tremendous growth prospects. The growth drivers already mentioned don't even tell the full story. For example, robotaxis could be huge opportunities for Alphabet's Waymo and Amazon's Zoox units. Meta could be a bigger winner in virtual reality and the metaverse. I think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are great stocks to buy and hold.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,904!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $43,562!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $349,245!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of July 8, 2024\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 3 Years From Now",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) recently became the world's most valuable company again with a market cap of $3.57 billion. Its stock rallied more than 60% over the past three years, even as iPhone sales cooled off amid tougher macro and competitive headwinds.\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 (ended last September) to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Apple's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% as its earnings per share (EPS) rises at a CAGR of 10%. That growth will likely be driven by a cyclical recovery in iPhone sales, an expansion into higher-growth markets like India, and the evolution of Apple's subscription ecosystem that hosts over a billion subscribers. Apple will also likely repurchase tens of billions of dollars in shares every year to boost its EPS. Image source: Apple.\n\nThose growth rates make Apple a stable long-term investment, but they're a bit weak for a stock that trades at 35 times forward earnings and 9 times this year's sales. Therefore, Apple's valuations might have been inflated by the recent hype regarding its generative AI plans for its first-party apps. Assuming Apple meets Wall Street's estimates and still trades at the same price-to-sales ratio by fiscal 2026, its market cap could grow about 12% to $4.01 billion by the final year.\n\nThat market cap would still make Apple one of the world's most valuable companies, but I believe three of its trillion-dollar peers -- Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) -- could eclipse its valuation over the next three years.\n\nThe key differences between these tech titans\n\nApple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet operate different business models. Apple generates more than half of its revenue from the iPhone, but it relies on its services business to drive most of its growth. Nvidia generates most of its revenue by selling high-end data centers for processing AI tasks.\n\nMicrosoft generates over half of its revenue from its cloud businesses, which include its Azure cloud infrastructure platform, Office 365 productivity services, and Dynamics customer relationship management (CRM) services. Alphabet generates most of its revenue from Google's advertising business, which includes its search and display ads, its advertising network, and YouTube. However, its smaller Google Cloud business is growing at a much faster clip than its core advertising business.\n\nAll four companies have been expanding their generative AI ecosystems. Apple recently integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT into its own apps and announced new generative AI features for creating images and writing text. Microsoft, which is OpenAI's top investor, integrates the start-up's generative AI tools into its own cloud-based services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet has been upgrading its Gemini generative AI platform to keep up with OpenAI, and it's been rolling out those tools across its entire ecosystem. Nvidia profits from that secular trend by selling the best \"picks and shovels\" for the AI gold rush.\n\nAll three tech giants are growing faster than Apple\n\nBut out of these four companies, only Apple generates most of its sales from a slower-growth and cyclical consumer electronics business. Nvidia is a high-growth chipmaker, Microsoft is a cloud and AI play, and Alphabet is a digital advertising company. That's why analysts expect all three companies to grow faster than Apple over the next three years.\n\nCompany Estimated Revenue CAGR (Next 3 Fiscal Years) Estimated EPS CAGR (Next 3 Fiscal Years) Current Market Capitalization Price-to-Sales Ratio (Forward) Apple 5% 10% $3.57 billion 9 Nvidia 46% 53% $3.26 billion 28 Microsoft 15% 17% $3.47 billion 14 Alphabet 11% 20% $2.37 billion 7\n\nData source: MarketScreener.\n\nAssuming they match those estimates and their price-to-sales ratios hold steady, Nvidia could be worth $5.3 trillion by fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027), Microsoft would be worth $4.5 trillion by fiscal 2026 (which ends in June 2026), and Alphabet's market cap could reach $3 trillion. But with the same price-to-sales ratio as Microsoft, Alphabet's market cap could nearly reach $6 trillion. Therefore, all three tech giants have a shot at eclipsing Apple's market cap over the next three years.\n\nBut look beyond the market caps\n\nIt's interesting to track the market caps of the world's largest companies, but it's a superficial approach that glosses over their core strengths and weaknesses.\n\nAll four of these \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks will likely keep growing. Apple is a rock-solid investment in the mobile computing market, Microsoft and Google are evolving into cloud and AI companies, and Nvidia is still arguably the best pure play on the AI accelerator chip market. So instead of wondering which tech giant will be the most valuable in three years, investors should simply focus on their ability to expand their ecosystems, widen their moats, and generate consistent growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) the Best AI Value Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Best AI Value Stocks That are ‘Money Machines’ According to NYU’s Aswath Damodaran. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nAswath Damodaran is a Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. His thoughts on economy and stock valuations are given a lot of weight by analysts. Damodaran in his recent interview with CNBC said that Magnificent Seven stocks have become the “value stocks for investors who care about earnings and cash flows.”\n\n“We look at the last year and a half, they’ve added $8.8 trillion in market cap… just these seven companies. Just to give you perspective, the second-largest market in the world, China, has a market cap of $12.1 trillion. These seven stocks alone have added more in market cap than the entire German market, the French market, the Swiss market.”\n\nDamodaran’s comments are important because he’s been repeatedly saying in the past that major technology companies are fully or overvalued. In September, he said on CNBC that if you go through the list of top tech stocks, “you are more likely to be overvalued than undervalued.”\n\nBut in his latest interview, Damodaran said that before we “dismiss” Mag. 7 stocks as “risky tech companies,” we should keep in mind that “these are the money machines in this market.”\n\nHowever, when asked whether he believes we are not in any kind of “danger zone,” the professor said we are in the danger zone not just in terms of these seven stocks, but the market overall.\n\nIn this article we take a look at the Mag 7. stocks and their AI-related growth catalysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Best AI Value Stock That is ‘Money Machine’ According to NYU’s Aswath Damodaran?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nAlphabet is a key part of the Mag. 7 group of stocks which Aswath Damodaran believes are money machine value stocks.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the company is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrate with other Google apps. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) app is to urge users to sign up for ‘Google One AI Premium’ plan, which has a $19.99 price tag.  Google saw advertising revenue accelerate in Q1 2024, boosted by YouTube in particular growing by almost 21% last quarter. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nOakmark Global Select Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was the top contributor during the quarter. The stock price rose after the U.S.-based communication services company reported first-quarter operating income growth of 31% versus the prior year. We believe management’s cost reduction initiatives will improve operating efficiency and lead to faster earnings growth. In addition, we expect the company’s new AI-powered features showcased at the recent Google I/O conference will increase the value of its products to users. At the current share price, we continue to see upside to our estimate of Alphabet’s intrinsic value.”\n\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer’s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Alphabet in Talks to Buy Wiz in $23 Billion Cyber Deal",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google parent Alphabet Inc. is in talks to acquire cybersecurity startup Wiz Inc., according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Shooting Changes Biden’s Plan to Revive 2024 Campaign Trump Emerges Defiant From Rally Attack Set to Shake Up ’24 Race BlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm’s Ad I Was at the Trump Rally Where He Was Shot. Here Is What I Saw Trump’s Bloodied, Defiant Image After Shooting Pumps Up His Base\n\nThe transaction could total as much as $23 billion, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information. That would make it the tech giant’s largest acquisition to date.\n\nAn agreement hasn’t been reached and talks could still end without one, the person said.\n\nA representative for Alphabet didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Wiz declined to comment. The talks were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe talks come on the heels of Alphabet shelving efforts to acquire customer relationship management company HubSpot Inc., which Bloomberg News reported last week. As was the case with the HubSpot deal, a potential acquisition as large as that of Wiz is unusual for a big tech company like Alphabet, given the heightened scrutiny that the company faces by antitrust regulators.\n\nGoogle already faces several antitrust challenges, including a lawsuit by the US Justice Department accusing it of abusing its dominant position in online search and another one regarding its digital advertising tools.\n\nAlphabet has been ramping up its investment in its cloud customer business, including offering more generative artificial intelligence tools for clients. Though Google still lags behind Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. in the market for cloud computing, the company reported that its cloud unit has been profitable in consecutive quarters, after years of the unit being a money-losing operation.\n\nAn acquisition of Wiz, a cloud and cybersecurity company, could help Google catch up to Microsoft and Amazon in an increasingly competitive cloud market.\n\nAs more startups are moving their apps and data to the cloud, the opportunity in the sector is growing, particularly as generative AI apps and tools continue to gain traction. Such tools often require enormous data sets to be uploaded to the cloud that AI models can train on, in order for them to be able to generate output like images, marketing campaigns or software code, based on what users prompt the generative AI software with.\n\nNew York-based Wiz connects to cloud storage providers such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure and identifies and scans data stored in the cloud, looking for and removing security risks. The company, founded in 2020, was valued at $12 billion during a May funding round that drew investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Thrive Capital.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn Alphabet deal for Wiz would follow its $5.4 billion purchase of cybersecurity firm Mandiant Inc. in 2022. That was the company’s second-largest acquisition, topped only by its deal for Motorola Mobility Holdings LLC completed in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n--With assistance from Liana Baker and Ryan Gould.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs French Elections Result Is Least Worst Outcome for Business Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, is in advanced talks to acquire cybersecurity startup Wiz for about $23 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. If the deal is finalized, it will be the company’s largest ever acquisition.\n\nThe news comes days after reports surfaced that Alphabet has decided not to pursue an acquisition of HubSpot (NYSE: NYSE:HUBS), a company with a market cap of over $24 billion. Antitrust scrutiny was said to have played a part in the company’s decision not to acquire HubSpot.\n\nWiz posted annual recurring revenue of $350 million in 2023, up from $100 million in its first 18 months after its founding in 2020 by CEO Assaf Rappaport.\n\nThe company raised $1 billion earlier this year at a valuation of $12 billion, suggesting the takeover is nearly double from those levels. Wiz is backed by venture capitalists, including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures, and Lightspeed Venture Partners.\n\nWiz was one of the rare startups outside of AI to raise capital at a higher valuation in 2024. Many startups are suffering from a tech boom hangover fueled by the low-interest rate environment.\n\nIf a deal is completed, it would be nearly double the value of Google’s largest deal to date, a $12.5 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility in 2012. Meanwhile, its second-largest acquisition to date was a $5.4 billion purchase of another security company, Mandiant.\n\nCommenting on the possible deal, Wedbush analysts said this would be a \"shot across the bow at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\"\n\n\"For Google this would be a shot across the bow at Microsoft and Amazon making a major bet on the cyber security space to complement its flagship GCP offering in the cloud,\" the Wedbush analyst stated. \"This would give Google an edge on a number of cloud deployments and further monetize the cyber security cloud space with still less than 50% of the workloads not on the cloud globally.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoogle near deal to acquire cybersecurity startup Wiz for $23 billion - WSJ\n\nTSMC second-quarter profit seen jumping 30% on surging AI chip demand\n\nPro Research: Wall Street dives into Regeneron's robust prospects\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Want to Get Richer? 2 Best Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Hold Forever.",
        "content": "We're over six months into 2024, an excellent time to reassess your portfolio and consider what moves might be best for the year's second half and beyond. The stock market has seemed to be in a frenzy recently, with the S&P 500 briefly c\n\nrossing the 5,600 mark for the first time. The index was boosted by growth from countless tech stocks that have risen alongside the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and the prospect that a reduction in interest rates could be just around the corner.\n\nDuring the rally, two stocks stood out as exciting investment opportunities: Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Over the last month, Intel's stock is up 13%, while Alphabet jumped 10%, both beating the S&P 500's increase of 5%.\n\nYet, despite recent growth, Intel and Alphabet are potentially some of the biggest bargains in tech. Data in the chart shows these companies have lower price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) than some of the most prominent names in the industry. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nP/E is a helpful valuation metric calculated by dividing a company's stock by its earnings per share. The lower the P/E, the better the value.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel and Alphabet have exciting prospects that could see them keep beating the market over the next decade. Intel has made a crucial shift in its business model that will see it prioritize expanding its role in the foundry market. Meanwhile, Alphabet is leveraging the popularity of its services to make headway in AI.\n\nSo want to get richer? Here are the two best stocks to buy in 2024 and hold forever.\n\n1. Intel\n\nA rally for Intel over the last month is a welcome change from the declines its stock has endured in recent years. Wall Street appears to be increasingly convinced of the company's plan to turn things around with new chip releases and its manufacturing expansion.\n\nToward the end of June, news broke that Intel has plans to launch a new graphics processing unit (GPU), its Battlemage \"Xe2\" Arc GPU. The new chip is expected to be 50% more powerful than its predecessor, equipped with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's 4nm node platform. The upcoming GPU will launch in 2025 and be geared toward the gaming community.\n\nIntel's Battlemage GPU is just the latest in a line of new chip launches, many of which have been centered around AI. Earlier this year, the company unveiled Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 AI accelerators, which are meant to go head-to-head with similar offerings from Nvidia. Intel has priced these chips significantly lower than its competitors, hoping to gain market traction.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the biggest news from Intel's camp has been its restructured focus on manufacturing. The company is building chip fabs throughout the U.S. and abroad as it works to steal market share from companies like TSMC and Samsung, just as chip demand is rising across tech.\n\nIntel cut spending in different areas of its business to fund the costly venture that could significantly pay off in the coming years. Intel has said it expects the shift to manufacturing to save it between $8 billion to $10 billion by 2025 and see it \"achieve non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) gross margins of 60%.\" INTC PS Ratio Chart\n\nMoreover, Intel is one of the best-valued chip stocks. with a lower price-to-sales ratio (P/S) than Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. And while its rival's P/S ratios have seen erratic changes over the last five years, Intel's more steady movement suggests it could be the more reliable investment in 2024.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet has been a stock to watch this year after a glowing earnings release and heavy investment in AI. Initially, the company appeared behind in the sector with the third-largest market share in the AI-driven cloud industry (after Amazon and Microsoft). However, recent earnings show Alphabet is on track to catch up to its AI rivals. It has the brand power and financial resources to continue delivering significant gains.\n\nIn the first quarter, Alphabet's revenue increased by 15% from a year ago. The company profited from a 14% rise in its Google Services segment, which includes income from ad sales. However, its most impressive growth came from Google Cloud, where revenue spiked 28% and operating income nearly quadrupled. The cloud platform beat Microsoft Azure's revenue growth of 21% and Amazon Web Services' 17% increase in the same quarter.\n\nIn-house brands like Google, Android, and YouTube made Alphabet a tech behemoth. These platforms draw billions of users, which the company leveraged to become a leader in digital advertising. However, the company now has the chance to employ a similar method to get its AI technology into consumers' hands by integrating generative features across its product lineup.\n\nAlphabet hit $69 billion in free cash flow this year, indicating it has the financial ability to keep investing in its business and retain its potent position in tech. In addition to a lower P/E than many of its peers, Alphabet's stock is one you can buy now and hold indefinitely.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "These 3 Blue Chip Dividend Stocks Make Up 24% of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Here's My Top Pick.",
        "content": "Created in 1896, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of the best-known U.S. indexes. It is price-weighted, meaning its 30 components are weighted based on their stock prices rather than their market caps. This means that stock splits can have a major impact on the Dow.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), UnitedHealth Group(NYSE: UNH), and Goldman Sachs Group(NYSE: GS) are the three largest Dow components and all trade at over $460 a share. Together, they make up roughly 24% of the Dow, whereas the average component holds a mere 3.3% weighting.\n\nAll three companies operate in vastly different industries but pay stable and growing dividends. Here's why Microsoft is my favorite pick out of the three. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIts broad-based exposure to growth\n\nThe simplest reason to buy and hold Microsoft is its exposure to trends and its leadership across industries. The company is a top player in cloud infrastructure, software and hardware for commercial customers and individual consumers, developer tools, enterprise software, and more.\n\nMicrosoft has done a masterful job monetizing artificial intelligence (AI) across its business. The company's generative AI tool, Copilot, probably has been the biggest update in the history of its Office 365 suite of software. Azure AI helps developers build intelligent cloud-native applications on the Azure platform.\n\nWhile other companies believe AI will help them accelerate growth in the future, Microsoft is already seeing significant profitability improvements across its business. It is a proven winner in AI, which is why it deserves a higher valuation than its historical average. MSFT Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nSince operating income is growing even faster than revenue, Microsoft's margins are hovering around 10-year highs, while sales have roughly doubled in the last five years. If it sustains impressive growth, it could help the company reach a $10 trillion market cap by 2035.\n\nMaintaining industry leadership\n\nIndustry-leading companies that can continue to grow can be great investments. But the tech sector is chock-full of great businesses that either no longer exist, were bought out on the cheap, or are a shell of what they used to be. That's why companies must invest in research and development and continue innovating.\n\nWhen I look at the mega-cap tech companies, Microsoft stands out as offering the best balance between stability and innovation.\n\nFor example, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) is a significantly less expensive stock than Microsoft, but its business model is more fragile. Google Cloud is a distant third behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. YouTube is a powerhouse, but ChatGPT, TikTok, and Meta Platforms' Instagram are challenging Google's impenetrable moat in search. So while Alphabet is cheaper today, slower earnings growth could make it more expensive than Microsoft in the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn sum, being more cautious when calling a company a surefire bet in tech is important. For stodgy companies like Coca-Cola or PepsiCo, the name of the game is to sustain quality brands, develop a pipeline of new products, and make savvy acquisitions.\n\nBut tech companies have to manage capital well and innovate. BlackBerry lost to Apple because it failed to pivot away from buttons to the touch screen. AOL faded into history when broadband replaced dial-up internet. The list goes on and on.\n\nMicrosoft not only has the diversification needed to take a market share hit in one of its business units, but it is also a proven innovator and excellent capital allocator that has been on the right side of the AI-led movement in tech.\n\nIts massive capital return program\n\nMicrosoft has raised its dividend every year since fiscal 2011. At the time, it paid a $0.16 per share quarterly dividend. Today, the dividend is $0.75 per share -- a nearly fivefold increase in just 14 years.\n\nMicrosoft's decision to consistently raise its dividend is a testament to its confidence that it can continue to grow earnings. With over $21 billion in trailing-12-month dividend expenses, it pays more dividends than any other U.S.-based company (by far).\n\nAnd that's not all: Microsoft also buys back a ton of its own stock. Over the last 12 months, it has repurchased $16.8 billion of its stock compared to $10.5 billion in stock-based compensation.\n\nDue to its size and the tech industry's habit of rewarding employees with stock, Microsoft has to buy back at least as much stock as it pays in stock-based compensation to avoid diluting existing shareholders. It has been no easy challenge, as the company's stock-based compensation expense has doubled over the last five years. MSFT Stock Buybacks (TTM) Chart\n\nOverall, Microsoft has committed to its capital return program by making annual (and significant) dividend raises while avoiding increasing its share count. The payout only yields 0.6%, but that's because the stock has posted massive outsize gains. The dividend is up 477% over the last 15 years, but the stock is up 1,870%.\n\nFor the dividend yield to increase, the dividend has to grow faster than the stock price. Microsoft's last five dividend raises were all around 10%. So if the stock cools off, we could see the yield increase.\n\nEither way, Microsoft is an underrated dividend stock heavily committed to returning capital to shareholders.\n\nIt deserves a premium valuation\n\nMicrosoft is arguably the best company in the world due to its current position, high-margin growth trajectory, and ability to fund a sizable dividend and stock-buyback programs with cash.\n\nThe most glaring issue with the stock is its 40.3 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to a 10-year median P/E of 30.6. However, Microsoft is a much better business now than in the past, especially given the growth of cloud infrastructure and the AI improvements across proven products.\n\nIn this regard, Microsoft's valuation is more reasonable than it appears at first glance. The company will have to maintain an impressive growth rate to keep this high multiple, but it has what it takes. Investors interested in quality companies, even at a premium price, should consider Microsoft now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Nvidia has been the artificial intelligence (AI) stock to own over the past year and a half. However, the expectations built into the stock are mind-boggling and could spell disaster in the future.\n\nYet AI is here to stay, and if you're looking to invest in this sector, I'd consider these stocks before considering Nvidia.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) makes many of the chips that go inside all the devices that power the incredible AI technology being used today. With Nvidia's GPUs being packed full of TSMC products, it's also benefiting from its performance.\n\nAnother huge customer is Apple, which recently announced its AI offering was only available on the latest generation of phones. This could ignite a large refresh wave, benefiting Taiwan Semi immensely.\n\nRegardless, management projects AI-related revenue to grow at a 50% compound annual rate for the next five years, when it expects this segment to make up more than 20% of overall sales. Over the long term, management expects overall revenue growth of 15% to 20%, which would result in massive market outperformance.\n\nAlthough Taiwan Semi's stock has had an excellent run this year (it's up over 75%), I believe that run can continue for years to come as its products are integrated into a world that has barely scratched the surface of AI capabilities.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the parent company of Google, which has long been a proponent of AI. While it appeared caught off guard by the surge in generative AI popularity in late 2022, its recent launches corrected that blunder and its Gemini model emerged as a top pick.\n\nAlphabet has also integrated AI into various advertising products, allowing advertisers to create effective campaigns and ensuring that its internal models match the proper ad with viewers. While these releases haven't directly translated into a massive revenue increase, they solidified Alphabet's top place among the locations that advertisers must spend with.\n\nWhile Alphabet won't be as flashy an investment as Nvidia, it will steadily outperform the market by a couple of percentage points each year thanks to its dividend, aggressive share repurchase plan, and steady growth.\n\nThe stock trades for around 25 times forward earnings, so it's not historically cheap, but it is substantially less pricey than many of its peers.\n\nSalesforce\n\nSalesforce (NYSE: CRM) is a bit of a backdoor pick, as it's a customer relationship management software company. However, it is heavily pushing its AI model to its customers as a way to improve their businesses. It can be integrated internally to equip employees with the best information possible when completing a sale, thanks to heavy reliance on internal customer data. It can also create AI chatbots that provide better customer service interaction than has historically been available.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith Salesforce's market position, getting this AI offering right is key to maintaining its market dominance. It also provides another growth lever for the company, as its maturity is starting to show, with revenue only growing in the high single digits.\n\nHowever, it has recently initiated a dividend and still has a ways to go before achieving peak software company profit margins (the gold standard is Adobe's 30% margin). CRM Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis all adds up to plenty of growth ahead for the stock and it could be a long-term market beater.\n\nAll three companies are more steady than Nvidia, which has displayed a cyclical nature throughout its existence. Choosing Alphabet, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Salesforce is a smart idea if you're looking for more reasonably priced stocks with strong growth potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Future-Proof Your Portfolio: 3 Low-Cost AI Stocks to Buy in July",
        "content": "Investors need to keep a close eye on technology trends and business ideas in the burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) market. In this brief review of three stellar AI investment ideas, a panel of Fool.com contributors will focus on tech giants with proven prospects in this arena.\n\nThese stocks are also relatively affordable. The companies under the lens today are at the forefront of AI innovation while offering fantastic investment opportunities.\n\nThis lumbering Nvidia customer is up over 50% in a year and could have more to give\n\nNicholas Rossolillo (Amazon): E-commerce and cloud infrastructure provider Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) rallied over 50% in the last year. Finally, after the stock was clobbered by the bear market, it reached fresh all-time highs recently. Yet in spite of all its economic might, Amazon's market cap is a lowly $2 trillion, currently in fifth place among the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks behind Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nThough it lags behind in total size, Amazon actually rakes in the most sales of any of its tech peers by far. Amazon is homing in on $600 billion in annual revenue. Apple is a distant second place at about $380 billion in trailing 12-month sales. MSFT Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nWhy the disconnect in Amazon's valuation despite swimming in revenue? The reason is simple: The bulk of that revenue is derived from extremely low-margin e-commerce sales. GAAP operating income for the two e-commerce segments North America and International was just 5.8% and 2.8%, respectively, in Q1 2024.\n\nBut in this new AI era, Amazon is looking to change that. It has billions of dollars worth in new AI data centers in the works, with plans to fill them up with lots of Nvidia accelerated computing systems. The promise of such actions? Amazon will gradually convert more of those sales into actual earnings for its shareholders, using the power of AI.\n\nThe company is in a tremendous position of strength, and it's an advantage I believe can help the company generate outsized profit gains for years to come. The initial fruits of this labor are already being realized.\n\nAmazon's operating income increased nearly 170% in the last reported 12-month stretch to over $47 billion. This explains why the stock has rallied as of late. But if the company's AI plans pan out, there could be much more left to gain.\n\nAmazon stock trades for 46 times trailing 12-month free cash flow. I'm more than happy to continue holding my position.\n\nThe one AI stock down big in 2024 is due for a turnaround\n\nBilly Duberstein(Intel): Contrary to most other AI stocks that surged this year, Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) still finds itself down 33% on the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's struggles are well-known. Intel lost the chipmaking process technology lead about a decade ago and has been losing market share to rivals ever since. In addition, new CEO Pat Gelsinger is trying to engineer an expensive turnaround, even as Intel's core PC and data center chip businesses have gone into a downturn.\n\nHowever, the second half of 2024 could mark a turning point in which virtually all of these headwinds turn into tailwinds. Enterprises are lapping the huge 2020-2021 PC cycle, and the Windows 10 operating system will no longer be supported next year. And with the advent of the \"AI PC,\" it's pretty likely these factors will all buoy a PC industry recovery starting in the second half.\n\nAdditionally, the downturn in non-AI servers appears to be bottoming and turning up, according to a few bullish reports last month from Taiwanese server makers. That should also help Intel's data center business.\n\nAlso set for the back half, Intel forecast about $500 million in revenue for its Gaudi accelerator, its AI training chip, for the back half of the year. That would be the first meaningful Gaudi revenue for Intel.\n\nBut the most important thing is for the company to continue executing on its \"five nodes in four years\" turnaround plan, whereby Intel aims to regain process leadership by next year while also attracting third-party foundry customers.\n\nNews on that front has been promising. In June, Intel announced it was now in mass production on Intel 3, its third node of the five nodes in its four-year plan, right on schedule. Intel 3 is an important milestone, with process technology aimed at data center applications.\n\nThe next two nodes will be Intel 20A and 18A. Both of these will incorporate the dual innovations of gate-all-around transistors and backside power whereby the power inputs and outputs are put on the back of the chip, leaving more room on the front for computing power. This is where the rubber will meet the road and where Intel plans to catch Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing in process technology.\n\nIntel trades at one-seventh the market cap of Taiwan Semiconductor. Should Intel successfully execute and reach its 18A goal on time late in 2024 or early in 2025, its stock likely has further upside in a \"catch-up\" trade to other AI winners.\n\nAlphabet: The low-priced AI leader that's built to last\n\nAnders Bylund (Alphabet): Today's stock market is full of potential AI winners -- but I'd rather own a top-quality stock with tremendous long-term prospects that just happens to be an established leader in AI technology, too. That's what Google parent Alphabet brings to the table.\n\nIn my opinion, Alphabet is the best AI stock to own, even after the stock's impressive 58% price surge over the past year. This tech giant is built to last.\n\nThe company's AI capabilities, managed in the Google DeepMind group, keep pushing the boundaries of innovation. DeepMind was there to rewrite the rules of chess engines in 2017 and didn't stop there. Their latest rollout of Google AI features shows a relentless drive to stay ahead of the game. The Gemini large language model (LLM) is getting faster and better, while the Veo generative video creator and Imagen 3 image generator set new standards in AI-based media quality.\n\nI don't see AI as an effective competitor to Alphabet's traditional core business. Despite all the buzz around generative AI as an alternative to traditional search engines, Google Search remains the undisputed leader, grabbing 91.1% of the global market and boosting profits by nearly 60% in the first quarter. And I'm convinced that Google Search users walk away happier, avoiding the possibility of \"hallucination\" results from an overly creative AI system.\n\nWhat really sweetens the deal is Alphabet's valuation. With a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 28.5, a price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 7.2, and price to free cash flow of 33.2, it's a steal compared to Nvidia's sky-high valuations. Alphabet isn't just another player in the AI game -- it started shaping the future of AI long before ChatGPT was a thing and still leads the race.\n\nFrom cutting-edge AI research to practical applications in search, cloud, and even drug discovery, Alphabet is a smart, sustainable pick for the long haul. It's a stock that never looks expensive, and its diverse revenue streams ensure it's here to stay for decades. I'm not worried about missing Alphabet's AI train pulling out of the station.\n\nThis stock is a long-term buy at nearly any price, and those multicolored shares don't even look expensive today. They even come with a modest dividend nowadays, sweetening the pot for value and income investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia? Billionaires Are Buying These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "The surge in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks has not escaped the attention of billionaires. As opportunities emerge, investing disclosure requirements show they have deployed significant amounts of capital into AI stocks like Nvidia.\n\nThis is important because some investors follow the lead of these top-tier investors and mimic their transactions hoping for similar results. While these billionaires buy stocks for many reasons that have little to do with the investing goals of their followers, fortunately, their positions do occasionally benefit average investors, especially if they happen to pick some solid stocks to get behind.\n\nLet's take a look at three billionaires and explore why they took positions in Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The exercise might lead to some insight that can be useful to your investing journey.\n\n1. Alibaba\n\nAt first glance, investors may find it puzzling that Appaloosa Management, the fund run by billionaire David Tepper, took a position in Alibaba. In 2022, the stock faced a delisting threat when the Chinese company resisted allowing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to see its internal financial audits because of its association with the Chinese Communist Party. Although the U.S. and China eventually resolved that issue, the tenuous relationship between the countries put tremendous pressure on the stock.\n\nAs a result of the turmoil, Alibaba's stock price fell to almost 20% less than its initial public offering (IPO) price from 10 years ago. This drop comes despite Alibaba's net income more than tripling over that time. That caused its P/E ratio to fall briefly into the single digits, and its current earnings multiple of 18 is far below any comparable conglomerate.\n\nWith the stock trading at a heavily discounted price, Tepper increased the size of his Alibaba position by more than 11,000% over the last year. The markets may vindicate this move over time. The stock price has remained steady so far this year, though it is down about 75% from its 2020 high.\n\nStill, if Alibaba can find a way to ease investor concerns, Tepper's fund and those who invest along with him could experience a significant payday as the stock finally prices in its growing profits.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet has been a top AI innovator since it introduced the technology to its Google Search platform in 2001. Nonetheless, AI investors soured on the stock when OpenAI introduced a vastly improved version of ChatGPT in early 2023, creating the impression that the Google parent was behind the curve.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillionaire investors like Bill Ackman saw this as a buying opportunity, so much so that 13% of his Pershing Square portfolio is tied up in this stock. As late as the fourth quarter of 2022, Pershing Square did not own any Alphabet stock.\n\nBuying at the time Pershing Square did may have been the right move. More recently, Alphabet has responded with its own generative AI product, Google Gemini. It has also combined its AI research under the Google DeepMind umbrella. Considering its $108 billion in liquidity, it will likely buy any AI innovation it cannot invent in-house.\n\nAdditionally, despite perceptions, the stock has risen by around 60% over the last year, and its 29 P/E ratio makes it the most inexpensive company with a market cap above $2 trillion. That positions Alphabet to offer both safety and a higher likelihood of further gains.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nThe opportunity in Microsoft was of particular interest to Stanley Druckenmiller, the manager of the Duquesne Family Office fund. He saw that Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, had returned the tech giant to prominence as a leader in cloud computing.\n\nSucceeding in the cloud today means leading in AI. Druckenmiller began buying shares at the low point of the 2022 bear market and increased the purchases as Microsoft's partnership with generative AI specialist OpenAI came to light. Now, it makes up around 11% of the Duquesne fund.\n\nThe company built on that deal, integrating search engine Bing with ChatGPT to better enable it to compete with Google Search. Additionally, it launched Copilot, an AI-powered chatbot that combines the ChatGPT large language model and Microsoft's tools to create deliverables on command through one's natural language.\n\nAmid its innovations, it holds around $80 billion in liquidity, giving it tremendous optionality. Indeed, optimism around AI has helped Microsoft stock rise by nearly 40% over the last year.\n\nAt a P/E ratio of about 39, Microsoft has become a moderately valued AI stock, but given its resources and leadership in AI, the stock should continue to rise over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alibaba Group wasn’t one of them.

Despite its outsized gains, I remain bullish on Amazon due to its expanding addressable market, expanding profit margins, and growing advertising business.\n\nAn Overview of Amazon\n\nToday, Amazon is a household name and has a presence in most global markets. It sells consumer products, online ads, and subscription services through online and physical stores. In the last 12 months, Amazon reported revenue of $590.74 billion, up from $280.52 billion in 2019.\n\nAmazon Is Firing on All Cylinders\n\nAmazon has a sizeable presence in several growth markets that include e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and online streaming. In Q1 of 2024, its Online Store segment increased its revenue by 7% year-over-year to $54.7 billion, accounting for 38% of sales.\n\nAccording to a report from Research and Markets, the global e-commerce market is forecast to expand from $18.98 trillion in 2022 to $47.73 trillion in 2030, indicating an annual growth rate of over 12%.\n\nIts Amazon Web Services business accounts for 17% of sales, and this segment grew by 17% year-over-year in the March quarter. A Statista report forecasts the public cloud market to expand from $631.8 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2029, indicating an annual growth rate of 18.5%.\n\nIn recent years, Amazon’s Advertising Services business has gained significant traction. While it accounts for just 8% of total sales, sales from the segment rose by 24% year-over-year in Q1. A Precedence Research report expects global digital ad spending to rise from $550 billion in 2023 to $1.367 trillion in 2033, indicating annual growth rates of 9.6%.\n\nWe can see that each of Amazon’s business segments is positioned to grow at a steady pace in the upcoming decade, making the tech giant an enticing investment option right now.\n\nAmazon’s Expanding Margins\n\nSimilar to most other companies, Amazon has focused on lowering its cost base to tide over an uncertain and soft macro environment. Since Q4 of 2022, it has eliminated more than 27,000 jobs, allowing it to improve profit margins significantly. In the last 18 months, Amazon has lowered its technology and infrastructure costs as well as sales and marketing expenses, shoring up its bottom line.\n\nIn the last 12 months, Amazon reported free cash flow of $50.15 billion compared to a free cash outflow of $3.31 billion in the year-ago period. Further, it expects profit margins to improve in Q2 of 2024, although at a far more measured pace.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon expects operating income to range between $10 billion and $14 billion in Q2 compared to the year-ago figure of $7.7 billion. Comparatively, it expects revenue between $144 billion and $149 billion, indicating year-over-year growth between 7% and 11%.\n\nHistorically, Amazon has sacrificed profitability for growth. In fact, it reported several quarters of operating losses before reporting consistent profits in the last decade. Currently, Amazon is experiencing strong growth in sales and earnings due to economies of scale, a competitive moat, and its leadership position.\n\nAd Sales Will be a Key Driver\n\nAmazon owns and operates the third-largest digital ad business after Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Due to higher customer purchase intent, Amazon’s ad business should attract a higher share of corporate marketing spend amid sluggish consumer demand.\n\nAmazon attributed its strong digital ad performance to sponsored products, which benefited from improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. It expects sponsored products to drive demand going forward while growing new verticals such as Prime Video ads.\n\nIn the last three years, Amazon’s ad business has grown from $6.4 billion in Q1 of 2021 to $11.8 billion in Q1 of 2024. Its ad business grew at a much higher pace compared to peers Alphabet and Meta. Moreover, this segment is a high-margin one and should be a key driver of revenue and profitability through 2030.\n\nIs Amazon Stock Undervalued?\n\nWall Street expects Amazon to report an adjusted earnings per share of $4.54 in 2024, up from $2.90 per share in 2023. So, AMZN stock is priced at 44x forward earnings, which is steep, given that the sector median multiple is far lower at 15x. Alternatively, Amazon is growing at a far higher pace, so a premium multiple is justified.\n\nIs Amazon Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nEach of the 42 analysts covering Amazon stock has a Buy rating, indicating a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average AMZN stock price target is $222.45, indicating upside potential of 11.5% from current levels.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nTwo years ago, Amazon stock was pummelled due to its slowing growth and unattractive profit margins. Today, it is one of the fastest-growing mega-cap stocks on the planet, driving its share price toward all-time highs. In my view, its expanding addressable market and improving bottom line make it a top investment choice for investors in July 2024.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon’s AMZN shares have rallied 28.5% year to date, outperforming the industry growth of 18.8%. The company is riding on its robust cloud computing arm — Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). The solid customer momentum of AWS is driving the company’s top line. \r\n\r\nThis is evident from the latest collaboration of Exscientia EXAI with AWS. The former strives to power its platform for end-to-end drug discovery and automation with the help of AWS.\r\n\r\nThis deal highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS's innovative cloud products and services.\r\n\r\nPer the terms, Exscientia is expanding the use of AWS’s artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) services to accelerate early drug development at a lower cost. It is leveraging generative AI models of AWS to design drug candidates efficiently. It has deployed generative AI in its DesignStudio. The company draws on large language models via Amazon Bedrock.\r\n\r\nExscientia also plans to include robotic automation in its lab works on the back of its collaboration with AWS.\n\nCustomer Base Expansion Aids Growth\n\nThe latest move of Exscientia has added strength to AWS’s customer base.\n\nAWS’s portfolio strength is driving its customer momentum.\r\n\r\nRecently, Smartsheet implemented AWS’s Amazon Q Business to introduce a generative AI-powered assistant for its employees.\r\n\r\nFormula 1 (F1) teamed up with AWS to introduce a generative AI-designed F1 trophy for the Canadian Grand Prix with the support of AWS. \r\n\r\nFWD Group Holdings Limited recently selected AWS as its strategic cloud provider.\r\n\r\nSAP joined forces with AWS to embed generative AI solutions across its enterprise resource planning applications. SAP will integrate generative AI models from Amazon Bedrock, such as the Anthropic Claude 3 model family and Amazon Titan, into its generative AI hub in SAP AI Core. \r\n\r\nNinjaTech AI partnered with AWS to launch its next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using the latter’s ML chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike extended its strategic partnership with AWS to accelerate cloud security and AI innovation. \r\n\r\nBrightcove started using Amazon’s generative AI assistant called Amazon Q Business on AWS internally for real-world use cases applicable to the enterprise, media and entertainment technology sectors.\r\n\r\nZilch extended its collaboration with AWS to expand the use of the latter’s AI and ML services in order to accelerate sales in the next two years, and improve customer service and lending decisions.\r\n\r\nAWS’s expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In first-quarter 2024, AWS generated revenues of $25.04 billion (18% of the total sales), which grew 17% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 AWS revenues is pegged at $106.5 billion, indicating a growth of 17.3% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening performance of AWS, which has become the key catalyst of Amazon, will benefit the overall financial performance of the company.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $638.24 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 11%. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 0.9% to $4.58 per share over the past 60 days. The figure indicates year-over-year growth of 57.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nWe believe that AWS’s growing clientele, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is continuously riding on strong momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business, driven by the solid adoption of Azure. Strength in Azure AI remains a positive. The company’s strong efforts to power its cloud capabilities with generative AI are noteworthy. Also, growth in AI Copilot is contributing well to Microsoft’s cloud business.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud, which has turned out to be the key catalyst for Alphabet’s growth, is gaining from the growing generative AI capabilities, increasing data centers, availability zones and cloud regions. The solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace is a major positive.\n\nConclusion\n\nAWS’s expanding clientele, deepening focus on generative AI and strong competitive position are expected to benefit Amazon’s prospects. In addition to the cloud, strong capabilities, especially in grocery and pharmacy retail, coupled with ultrafast delivery services, are boosting its e-commerce prospects. The growing footprint in the video streaming space with Prime Video is another positive.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Exclusive-India antitrust probe finds Apple abused position in apps market",
        "content": "By Aditya Kalra\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - An investigation by India's antitrust body has found that Apple exploited its dominant position in the market for app stores on its iOS operating system, engaging \"in abusive conduct and practices\", a confidential report seen by Reuters showed.\n\nThe Competition Commission of India (CCI) has been investigating Apple Inc since 2021 for possibly abusing its dominant position in the apps market by forcing developers to use its proprietary in-app purchase system.\n\nApple has denied wrongdoing saying it was a small player in India where phones that use Google's Android system are dominant.\n\nThe CCI's investigations unit, in its 142-page report which is not public but was seen by Reuters, said Apple wields \"significant influence\" over how digital products and services reach consumers, especially through its iOS platform and App Store.\n\n\"Apple App Store is an unavoidable trading partner for app developers, and resultantly, app developers have no choice but to adhere to Apple's unfair terms, including the mandatory use of Apple's proprietary billing and payment system,\" the CCI unit said in the June 24 report.\n\n\"From the perspective of app developers, Apple iOS ecosystem is indispensable.\"\n\nApple and the CCI did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Indian investigation report comes as Apple faces increased antitrust scrutiny in other regions.\n\nIn June, European Union antitrust regulators said Apple breached the bloc's tech rules, which could result in a hefty fine for the iPhone maker. The company also faces an investigation into new fees imposed on app developers.\n\nIn January, in response to a new EU law called the Digital Markets Act, Apple outlined plans to allow software developers to distribute their apps to users in the European Union outside of Apple's own App Store.\n\nThe CCI report is the most critical stage of the Indian investigation and it will now be reviewed by the watchdog's senior officials.\n\nApple and other parties will be allowed to respond before a final decision is reached, which could include monetary fines as well as directives to change business practices.\n\nAPPLE VS GOOGLE IN INDIA\n\nThe Indian case was first filed by a little-known, non-profit group called \"Together We Fight Society\" which argued Apple's in-app fee of up to 30% hurts competition by raising costs for app developers and customers.\n\nLater, a group of Indian startups, Alliance of Digital India Foundation, and Tinder-owner Match filed similar cases at the CCI against Apple, which were all heard together.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe CCI investigation team said in its report that no third-party payment processor was being permitted by Apple to provide the services for in-app purchases.\n\nIt added that in most cases the apps are also not being allowed to include any external links that direct customers to other purchasing mechanisms, violating Indian competition laws.\n\nApple's iOS powered about 3.5% of 690 million smartphones in India as of mid-2024, with the rest using Android, according to Counterpoint Research, though it adds Apple's smartphone base in the country has become five times larger in the last five years.\n\nIn its submissions to the CCI, Apple argued its market share in India is an \"insignificant\" 0-5%, while Google commands 90-100%. The company also argued that the in-app payment system allowed it to maintain and develop the safety of its App Store.\n\nBut the CCI said, \"App stores are OS (operating system) specific and Apple's App store is the sole App store available for reaching iOS users.\"\n\n\"The payment policy of Apple adversely affects the app developers, users and other payment processors,\" it said.\n\nThe CCI report showed it considered comments from many companies including Microsoft, Uber and Amazon during its Apple investigation.\n\nGoogle too has faced CCI's heat for its in-app payments mechanism.\n\nIn October 2022, the CCI imposed a $113 million fine on Google and said it must allow the use of third-party billing and stop forcing developers to use its in-app payment system. Google has challenged the decision.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Hugh Lawson)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Shares of HubSpot Inc. HUBS declined more than 12% yesterday as various media reports revealed that Alphabet Inc. GOOGL has shelved plans to acquire this customer relationship management (“CRM”) firm. Although spokespersons of both companies have refused to comment on the market speculation, sources familiar with the proceedings have confirmed the same.\r\n\r\nHubSpot, headquartered in Cambridge, MA, specializes in providing sales and marketing software to small and midsize businesses, leveraging digital channels such as blogs, search engines and social media. Its diversified offerings include CRM and payment services, making it an attractive asset for Alphabet. The potential deal, reported earlier in April, would have been GOOGL’s largest-ever acquisition, with HubSpot reportedly valuing about $35 billion at that time.\r\n\r\nFrom Alphabet's perspective, acquiring HubSpot would not only have bolstered its presence in the burgeoning CRM software market but also provided a significant boost to its cloud computing business, intensifying competition with industry giants like Microsoft and Amazon. Additionally, the acquisition could have enhanced competition in the marketing and sales software sector, countering the dominance of players like Salesforce and Microsoft.\r\n\r\nFor HubSpot, an acquisition by Alphabet could have offered access to greater resources and technological capabilities, enabling it to further innovate and expand its market reach. However, with the news of the deal falling flat, HUBS’ shares have taken quite a beating. The stock has lost 8.8% over the past year against the industry’s growth of 29.6%.

Viewed just a few months ago as a vulnerable incumbent facing stiff competition from OpenAI and others, sentiment around Alphabet’s competitiveness in GenAI has turned more positive. Previously, some worried that Large Language Models (LLMs) could bypass traditional search results, potentially impacting ad revenue from third-party publishers. However, Alphabet has started incorporating “AI Overviews” in searches featuring responses from its LLM and Gemini. It reports improved user satisfaction and click-through rates exceeding those of traditional web listings. Alphabet believes AI will expand its search monetization and is exploring new features like short product videos, virtual try on options, and 3D product views within shopping ads. It has also rolled out AI tools for advertisers, such as enhanced image creation and improved measurement, to refine the advertising experience further. Alphabet benefits from a strong competitive moat due to its vast infrastructure, including data centers, custom chips, and leading LLMs like Gemini. This infrastructure allows them to seamlessly integrate AI across their products, reaching billions of users. However, their projected capital expenditure of $50 billion this year, primarily for tech infrastructure, is worth monitoring. While financially manageable, it signifies a shift from Alphabet's capital-light past to a more capital-intensive approach in the AI era.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be the Top Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to End 2024",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is a group of companies that led the market since 2023:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nOther than Tesla, which is basically flat year to date, this group is having a fairly strong 2024. MSFT data by YCharts.\n\nNvidia outshines them all, continuing its unbelievable run after a phenomenal 2023. But investors who didn't buy in earlier can't do anything about that now; they can only look forward. So which Magnificent Seven stock looks likeliest to be the biggest winner for the rest of the year?\n\nMany of the Magnificent Seven trade at sky-high valuations\n\nLet's start with the stocks that likely won't have the best performances in the second half. While Tesla shares underperformed for most of the year, there were good reasons for that. Demand for its electric vehicles declined and its margins have shrunk due to its price cuts. There are no signs those trends will turn around before 2024 is over.\n\nNext, let's consider valuations: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all trade at expensive levels of 34 times forward earnings or more, which is quite a premium over the benchmark S&P 500 index, which currently averages 22.7 times forward earnings. Those premiums will likely inhibit their performance from here.\n\nThat leaves just Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Of the two, I think Alphabet is primed for the best second half of 2024.\n\nAlphabet's investments are starting to pay off\n\nAlphabet has long been a force in artificial intelligence (AI). However, it appeared caught off guard when the generative AI craze took off in late 2022. As a result, it had to scramble to launch competing products that weren't great initially. However, it has largely cleaned up their problems.\n\nNow, Alphabet's generative AI model, Gemini, is recognized as one of the top options available, and has already been integrated into several of its products to perform tasks such as summarizing Google search results.\n\nFurthermore, Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum. Because most companies can't afford to spend millions of dollars to build and operate their own supercomputers to train AI models, renting that processing power from a cloud computing provider is far more economical. Each cloud infrastructure provider has its specialties, and AI appears to be one of Google Cloud's. With 60% of funded generative AI start-ups and 90% of generative AI unicorns (private companies worth at least $1 billion) using its services, it has a strong foothold in this emerging market.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Alphabet's advertising business should continue to perform well this year -- and while AI may be flashy, advertising is what keeps the company's lights on. In Q1, more than three-fourths of its revenue came from advertising-related sources, and that revenue was up 13% year over year. While that's not blazing-fast growth, it is impressive for a fairly mature business. With upcoming catalysts like election-related advertising, we can expect a strong end to 2024 for Alphabet.\n\nAs for its valuation, Alphabet is actually the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven cohort, trading at 25 times forward earnings. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile that's not cheap relative to the broader market, it is when compared to its peers.\n\nBased on the combination of its relatively cheap valuation and its strong business momentum, I have confidence that Alphabet will have a strong close to 2024. Whether it will outperform the rest of the Magnificent Seven is still up in the air -- especially with a wild card like Nvidia in the mix -- but I'm confident that Alphabet will beat the market in the second half.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Should You Be Adding Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) To Your Watchlist Today?",
        "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Alphabet with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nAlphabet's Earnings Per Share Are Growing\n\nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. It certainly is nice to see that Alphabet has managed to grow EPS by 21% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.\n\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that Alphabet is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 5.1 percentage points to 30%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this freereport showing analyst forecasts for Alphabet's future profits.\n\nAre Alphabet Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince Alphabet has a market capitalisation of US$2.3t, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$242b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Alphabet, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$14m.\n\nAlphabet's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$8.8m in the year leading up to December 2023. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.\n\nDoes Alphabet Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?\n\nYou can't deny that Alphabet has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If you still have your doubts, remember too that company insiders have a considerable investment aligning themselves with the shareholders and CEO pay is quite modest compared to similarly sized companiess. The overarching message here is that Alphabet has underlying strengths that make it worth a look at. Once you've identified a business you like, the next step is to consider what you think it's worth. And right now is your chance to view our exclusive discounted cashflow valuation of Alphabet. You might benefit from giving it a glance today.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors are growing increasingly concerned that US technology megacaps are spending too much on artificial intelligence, according Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat Archegos’ Bill Hwang Convicted of Fraud, Market Manipulation Biden Aides to Meet Senators After Pelosi Remarks Deal Blow NATO Singles Out China Over Its Support for Russia in Ukraine Kevin Costner, Warner Bros. Cancel ‘Horizon: Chapter 2’ Release\n\nCompanies that the strategists refer to as “hyperscalers” — including Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. — have utilized about $357 billion for capital expenditure as well as research and development in the past year, the team led by Ryan Hammond said.\n\nA “significant portion” of this spending was on AI and represents nearly a quarter of the S&P 500’s total for capex and R&D, the strategists said.\n\n“Today’s hyperscalers will eventually be required to prove that revenues and earnings will be generated from their investments,” Hammond wrote in a note. “Early signs that may not be generated, could lead to valuation de-rating.”\n\nAmazon is expected to utilize $63 billion for capex this year, an increase from $53 billion in 2023, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meta and Google-owner Alphabet will spend record amounts in 2024.\n\nThe buzz around AI has powered US stocks to record highs this year, with Nvidia Corp. among the biggest beneficiaries of the trade. Investors broadly expect the frenzy to remain a key feature of a rally in the second half, although some are betting on sectors such infrastructure providers and utilities to lead gains for the remainder of 2024.\n\nEven so, the strategists said that current AI spending “still pales in comparison” to capex levels seen during the dot-com crash.\n\nAt the height of the tech bubble at the turn of the millennium, the group of tech, media and telecom stocks was spending more than 100% of cash flows from operations on capex and R&D, Hammond said. Today, the total bill stands at 72%.\n\nStill, expenses associated with depreciation could represent a risk to profitability, the strategist said.\n\n“As demonstrated in the tech bubble, sales revisions will be a key indicator for investors to assess the durability of the AI trade,” Hammond said.\n\n--With assistance from Farah Elbahrawy and Michael Msika.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLooser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom At SpaceX, Elon Musk’s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs How Digital Money Really Works Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia—With a Catch\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AI has destroyed Google’s promise of carbon neutrality, with emissions rising 50% over the last five years",
        "content": "After 17 years, Google has dropped its carbon-neutral promise due to the spike in emissions from its pursuit of AI, according to the tech giant’s latest environmental report.\n\nSince 2007, Google has claimed to purchase enough clean-energy supply to match the bulk of the emissions it generates through its data centers and buildings. However, since 2023, Google has no longer “maintained operational carbon neutrality,” according to the report.\n\nThat’s because Google’s greenhouse gas emissions have risen nearly 50% since 2019, the company said. It blamed the spike on “increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute,” along with the emissions associated with broader infrastructure investment that AI requires.\n\nOver the next few years, Google will invest nearly $100 billion in AI, Demis Hassabis, chief executive of Google DeepMind—the company’s AI development lab—has said. So far, the most visible results of that investment are the company’s AI overviews in Search, and Google’s Gemini, which is a large language model that can be used to power various AI tools, designed to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nThat investment, however, comes with a cost, which the environment bears the brunt of, Nathan Truitt, executive vice president of climate funding at the nonprofit American Forest Foundation, told Fortune.\n\n“On an individual level, AI is definitely going to create a rapid increase in emissions for the companies that are heavily invested in it,” Truitt said. “And it's going to lead to the sort of announcement that Google has made where they're having to recalibrate their climate goals.”\n\nNet-zero versus carbon neutral\n\nThe announcement does not mean Google has completely foregone reducing its emissions. Rather, the company, in the report, set its visions on another goal: reaching net-zero emissions by 2030.\n\nThere is a key distinction between a carbon-neutral goal and a goal of net-zero emissions. Carbon neutral refers to offsetting or neutralizing emissions through carbon-removal activities like planting trees or purchasing carbon credits, without necessarily reducing emissions at the source. Truitt used the metaphor of someone trying to burn off excess calories solely through exercise without changing their diet.\n\n“In theory, that would be fine, but in practice, it's very unlikely to work,” Truitt said.\n\nNet zero, on the other hand, involves first reducing emissions as much as possible at the source (the \"diet\" part), and then offsetting any remaining emissions through carbon removal activities (the \"exercise\" part).\n\nStory continues\n\nTruitt noted this combination is “much much more effective,” and also extremely ambitious.\n\n“It's going to require them to have to solve multiple, really thorny technical, logistical, economic, and financial challenges, all at once, in a very short period of time,” Truitt said.\n\nBy focusing on both offsetting carbon emissions and reducing greenhouse gasses, Google hopes to have a more “certain” and “scalable” environmental impact, according to the report.\n\nThe goal of net-zero emissions may also help Google evade criticism some experts have launched at claims of carbon-neutrality. Critics have questioned whether cheap investments–such as paying villages to protect their forests, or planting a few thousand trees–can truly “offset” carbon emissions.\n\nDespite the critiques, Truitt doesn’t want organizations or advocacy groups to be too harsh on corporations that claim carbon-neutrality. It’s harder, and riskier, to attempt to do something about the environment, rather than to do nothing; we shouldn’t punish companies that try to do something, he argued.\n\n“Companies should be rewarded and be able to make claims about the use of carbon offsets to address their emissions,” Truitt said.\n\nHowever, he added he would hope that corporations stop viewing climate policy as transactional, and take on more of a leadership role.\n\n“If a company is doing everything right, in terms of its specific carbon accounting policies, but isn't using that platform to figure out how to be part of the solution in terms of the systemic reform, ultimately, I think we have to judge their climate policies as a  failure,” Truitt said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

A HubSpot spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nAny deal for HubSpot, with a market value of $27 billion, would have been one of the biggest this year for a tech company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, putting it in the same league as the pending $33 billion acquisition of Ansys Inc. by Synopsys Inc.\n\nBuying Cambridge, Massachusetts-based HubSpot, a customer relationship management company that focuses on small to midsize enterprises, would have helped Alphabet compete with other players in that market such as Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp. and Salesforce Inc.\n\nA transaction also would have likely gotten bogged down in reviews by US antitrust regulators. Under the Biden Administration, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been aggressively signaling their opposition to big-ticket M&A, forcing sizable tech companies to rethink their plans to grow through acquisitions.\n\nHubSpot shares peaked in April at about $682 apiece.

        "title": "Samsung Hikes Prices, Bets on AI to Reclaim Foldables Lead",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. sees the addition of AI features as the key to reclaiming its title as the world’s leading maker of foldables, mobile chief TM Roh said on the eve of unveiling its latest models.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat The End of the Cheap Money Era Catches Up to Chelsea FC’s Owner Hurricane Beryl Makes a Mockery of Texas Climate Deniers NYC Penthouse Sells for $135 Million in Priciest Deal Since 2022 Microsoft, Apple Drop OpenAI Board Plans as Scrutiny Grows\n\nThe company that pioneered the foldables segment in 2019 staged a gala event in Paris on Wednesday to unveil its new products, the $1,100 Galaxy Z Flip 6 and $1,900 Galaxy Z Fold 6. Both are the slimmest and lightest iterations of their respective lines and both come with a price tag that’s $100 higher.\n\nSamsung’s new phones add a bevy of new artificial intelligence features that Roh said would help differentiate the company’s products and fire up sales. Among them is an automatic interpreter that now works with calls in social apps like WhatsApp or WeChat to allow people to converse in different languages, extending the function first introduced with regular phone calls with the Galaxy S24. Samsung’s Galaxy AI suite also benefits from Google’s AI tools, which the Alphabet Inc. unit is propagating across Android.\n\n“We continue to work closely with Google on our Galaxy devices because they are our strongest partner ever,” 55-year-old Roh said in an interview in Paris. But Samsung is working with other partners, like Microsoft Corp. and its Copilot+ Windows software, and is open to collaborating with AI startups to meet the evolving consumer demands from this rapidly developing field of technology, he added.\n\nRoh has sought to position Samsung as the purveyor of open standards and ecosystems, in contrast to Apple Inc.’s proprietary tech, and the new foldable Galaxy handsets come only weeks ahead of the debut of iPhones with Apple’s new AI services on board. More challenging in the foldable segment, perhaps, will be competition from Chinese Android device makers, which have accounted for much of the growth in the category over the past year.\n\n“China’s local service content ecosystem is very strong, and we have been working very closely with the big service content companies to optimize for the Chinese market,” Roh said. The executive had put a priority on breaking through in China — the world’s biggest smartphone market, where Samsung commands only a small fraction of sales — and is now pursuing that goal by targeting the premium tier with products better customized for the local consumer. “For the Chinese Galaxy AI, we’re going to have strategic cooperation with big Chinese IT companies.”\n\nStory continues\n\nSamsung adopted Baidu Inc.’s AI tools for its Galaxy S24 release in China earlier this year, substituting Google, whose software is not available in China. Roh declined to specify what additional partners Samsung may be working with or consider, but nodded that the Baidu linkup will continue.\n\nThe new handsets’ improvements come largely on the software side. The updated Samsung Keyboard will generate text based on keywords, reflecting the user’s usual tone by analyzing their previous social media posts. Samsung’s S Pen stylus on the Fold can also be used to sketch an idea or draw on top of photos, which the device will then convert into a generated image.\n\nThe new foldables come as part of a wave of new devices introduced by Samsung in Paris. The company’s effort to build out an ecosystem of products leans heavily into health and wellness as well as the premium segments of each category, with the highlight debuts being the new $400 Galaxy Ring and $650 Galaxy Watch Ultra. Samsung also introduced refreshed models of its Galaxy Buds earphones, starting at $180, and a $300 Galaxy Watch 7. The company is opening pre-orders immediately.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk’s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia—With a Catch How to Invest During a High Interest Rate Era Family Offices of the Ultra-Rich Shed Privacy With Activist Bets\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

They cited potential antitrust scrutiny as a significant deterrent for Google to pursue an acquisition.\n\nAnalysts believe that HubSpot has a brighter future as an independent company. They highlighted the company's successful move upmarket, its multi-product adoption, and the accelerating momentum of its Service Hub.\n\nThey also projected that HubSpot could achieve margins exceeding 30% in the medium term and stand to benefit significantly from the GenAI trend in the near and medium term. As such, they believe that HubSpot remaining independent is the best possible outcome.\n\nIn light of the recent drop in HubSpot's shares, now trading below 10x EV/CY24E (Enterprise Value to Calendar Year 2024 Estimated) revenue, RBC analysts recommend seizing this opportunity and buying shares for duration on the weakness.\n\nRBC maintained an outperform rating for HubSpot, with a price target of $700.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nRBC - HubSpot's buying potential surges as Google shelves acquisition plan\n\nAckman says his firm will put $500 million into Pershing Square USA\n\nAfter-hours movers: Costco, Citi, Alcoa, WD-40 Co., and more\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Samsung took the wraps off of a litany of new devices on Wednesday during its Unpacked event in Paris, France. Not only did the company show off its latest foldable smartphones, the Android-powered (GOOG, GOOGL) Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6, and its next-generation smartwatches, the Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Watch Ultra, it also launched its highly anticipated Galaxy Ring.\n\nBut the star of the show was the company’s Galaxy AI platform. A suite of software products the company initially launched with its Galaxy S24 line of smartphones earlier this year, Galaxy AI includes a number of generative AI capabilities that touch on everything from Samsung’s health and fitness apps to its photo, productivity, and web browser offerings.\n\nThe strategy is clear: Samsung is banking on its AI efforts, which include some of Google’s AI magic, to help power its device sales going forward. But the company’s longtime nemesis, Apple (AAPL), is just months away from launching its own AI software, which could sway Samsung users to the iPhone’s side.\n\nThe AI era\n\nSamsung’s latest devices are certainly impressive. I’m a fan of both of its foldable, and its smart watches are some of the most capable around. Adding in its Galaxy Ring could give Samsung a nice foothold in a still relatively small market. But the company is clearly focused on ensuring that its AI capabilities are front and center alongside each of its new products. Samsung is entering the smart ring market with its new AI-enabled Galaxy Ring. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nSamsung has demonstrated how Galaxy AI fits into the Galaxy Ring, Watch 7, and Watch Ultra thanks to the addition of the company’s new Energy Score feature. The company says the software uses Galaxy AI to help calculate how you’ve slept, how much exercise you’ve gotten recently, and more to provide you with a numerical representation of your overall fitness level that you can use to better understand why you might be more tired or energetic on certain days.\n\nIt’s also shown off its conversation mode feature, which lets you have a conversation with someone speaking a different language by turning the Fold's and Flip’s covers and main screens into digital whiteboards that display what you and the person you’re chatting with are saying in your own languages. The app also reads the translated text out loud.\n\nSamsung has similarly brought generative AI features to its photos app, allowing you to do things like draw sunglasses on a person in an image and automatically generate and place realistic-looking glasses on the subject’s face. Samsung also uses some of Google’s AI capabilities, adding the company’s Gemini software and assistant to its devices.\n\nStory continues Samsung's various Galaxy AI features. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nAn incentive to stay and upgrade\n\nLike Apple, which debuted its Apple Intelligence generative AI initiative at its WWDC event in June, Samsung is using AI as a means of differentiating its latest hardware offerings from its older devices in the hopes that Galaxy AI and its features will get customers who have been holding onto their phones for two years or longer to pony up for newer, pricier options.\n\nUnlike Apple, which is only making its AI options available on its iPhone 15 Pro and future phones, Samsung is rolling out its Galaxy AI software to a handful of prior-generation products including the S22 and Z Fold and Flip 4 series from 2022 and S23 and Z Fold and Z Flip 5 series from 2023.\n\nWith consumers holding onto their smartphones for between two and three years, that makes sense. It gives users a taste of Galaxy AI at a time when they’re just about ready to upgrade, adding an incentive to stick with Samsung and continue taking advantage of its generative AI features. Samsung's latest Galaxy Z Flip 6 gets minor physical enhancements, but brings along the company's Galaxy AI generative AI platform. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nThe Korean tech giant says customers are already using its AI software at a decent clip, with the company reporting that 77% of S24 owners access AI features every week. And with Samsung raising the prospect of charging a fee for its AI services in the future, its Galaxy AI offerings could not only get customers to stick with the company and upgrade to its latest phones but open up a new revenue stream as well.\n\nOf course, that could also depend on what Apple ultimately decides to do with its Apple Intelligence services. If Samsung charges for its AI software and Apple doesn’t, it could incentivize customers to switch to the iPhone.\n\nEither way, both companies are entering into a new race to see which can outdo the other in terms of the generative AI know-how. And while Samsung has a sizable lead in getting its software to market, Apple is just a few months away from launching its own AI platform. Time will tell if either AI service is capable enough to drive increased sales or not. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "YouTube Is a $455 Billion Media Giant Hiding in Plain Sight",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors attach a $2.3 trillion valuation to Alphabet Inc. for its status as an internet search behemoth and AI innovator. Yet even that massive figure underplays YouTube’s true worth, according to analysts at Needham & Co.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat The End of the Cheap Money Era Catches Up to Chelsea FC’s Owner Hurricane Beryl Makes a Mockery of Texas Climate Deniers NYC Penthouse Sells for $135 Million in Priciest Deal Since 2022 Microsoft, Apple Drop OpenAI Board Plans as Scrutiny Grows\n\nThe streaming unit is one of the world’s most valuable media companies and worth at least $455 billion on its own, Needham’s Laura Martin and Dan Medina wrote in a July 3 note. That’s more than 50% above Netflix Inc.’s market cap.\n\nAlphabet’s structure means it doesn’t get enough credit for its disparate businesses — especially YouTube, the analysts argue. They have a buy rating on the stock and a price target of $210, some 10% above July 5’s record close.\n\n“There is this hidden value in YouTube that people can’t separately trade, and so it’s trapped in Google in a conglomerate that has a lot of other risks,” Martin said separately in an interview. Those include worries that artificial intelligence might displace search, a threat that has “nothing to do with YouTube,” she said.\n\nShares of Alphabet rose 0.7% in early trading on Wednesday.\n\nA potential separation would benefit those keen to invest in YouTube for its dominance in streaming, but also those who admire Alphabet more for its role in the explosive growth of AI. If even just 5% of YouTube was separately tradable, this would add $15 per share to Alphabet stock, Needham says.\n\n“Conglomerates knock buyers out of the market because investors are like, ‘well, I like these three pieces but I don’t like this one, so I’m just not going to buy it,’” said Martin.\n\nOf course, the Needham analysts aren’t the first to notice this. Alphabet’s sprawling structure has long been criticized for obscuring the true value of its different businesses. Regulatory threats to break up the company over the years have been cheered by many investors, rather than viewed as a threat.\n\nThere are also few signs that Alphabet or its megacap tech peers are contemplating obliging investors with any separations in the near term, according to Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial.\n\n“Many companies when they mature, they start getting hedge funds or activists coming in and demanding that you spin off a company,” she said. “We’re not there with megacap tech yet.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet has outperformed most of those Big Tech peers this year, outpacing Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Nvidia Corp. has run ahead of the pack, soaring 165% thanks to the insatiable demand for its so-called AI chips.\n\nMobile Phones\n\nAs for YouTube, it has a dominant and growing share in streaming, as consumers shift to such platforms and away from broadcast and cable TV. Ad revenue from the platform is expected to grow by nearly 17% to $37 billion in 2024 and by another 14% to $42 billion in 2025, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAlphabet’s revenue from subscriptions, platforms and devices, which includes YouTube subscriptions, is also poised to expand in the coming years. At Netflix, revenue is expected to be about $38.7 billion in 2024, with almost all of that derived from streaming, while YouTube accounts for about 10% of its parent’s total sales.\n\nA recent survey of streaming platforms by TD Cowen showed that while Netflix still dominates in most TV categories, YouTube is often not far behind. And, it’s the top choice for watching content on a mobile phone.\n\n“YouTube is really vying for positioning against Netflix in a big way,” said Robert Conzo, chief executive at The Wealth Alliance. “They’re going to be a force to be reckoned with in the future when it comes to content and playing in that space that Netflix has dominated so strongly.”\n\nWhile AI has been a major force lifting Alphabet shares to recent record highs, the subscriptions, platforms and devices segment that holds YouTube is a key growth driver and an increasing portion of gross revenues, Goldman Sachs analysts led by Eric Sheridan wrote in a July 8 note.\n\nGoldman reiterated its buy rating on Alphabet and boosted the price target to $211 from $195, partly due to higher medium-to-long-term YouTube ad revenue growth assumptions.\n\nAnd there are other good reasons for Alphabet to keep YouTube under its umbrella. The platform is “a key pillar of Alphabet’s Gen AI strategy,” according to Divyaunsh Divatia, research analyst at Janus Henderson Investors.\n\n“YouTube remains a beneficiary from being in the Google Web services ecosystem, but continued additional disclosure should help the street to more thoughtfully model the topline growth & cost drivers and value this business,” Divatia said.\n\nBeyond YouTube, Needham’s Martin also sees value in breaking off other pieces of Alphabet’s business — such as its ad tech segment, currently part of a lawsuit with the US Department of Justice.\n\n“Alphabet is worth more in pieces than it is together,” Martin said.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nMicrosoft Corp. and Apple Inc. have relinquished the chance to be observers on OpenAI’s board, a surprise decision that underscores growing scrutiny from antitrust regulators on Big Tech’s influence over artificial intelligence. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s second-quarter sales grew at their fastest pace since 2022, buoyed by the AI boom that’s fueling data center investment worldwide. Samsung Electronics Co.’s largest labor union of more than 30,000 workers declared an indefinite strike, a surprise move that raises the risk of production disruptions at the world’s largest memory chipmaker. Baidu’s shares jumped by the most in more than a year and bullish options bets surged to a record on signs of growing popularity for its Apollo Go robotaxi in China.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPostmarket\n\nE2open\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Adds stock move after market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk’s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia—With a Catch How to Invest During a High Interest Rate Era Family Offices of the Ultra-Rich Shed Privacy With Activist Bets\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Samsung debuts Galaxy Flip 6 and Fold 6 smartphones in generative AI push",
        "content": "Samsung on Wednesday took the wraps off of its latest foldable smartphones during its Unpacked event in Paris, France. The Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Android-powered phones, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6, are a key differentiator for Samsung in its long-running battle with Apple (AAPL) for global smartphone supremacy.\n\nSamsung, like Apple, is making its generative AI offerings a major selling point for both of the phones. Starting at $1,099 for the Z Flip 6 and $1,899 for the Z Fold 6, both phones are $100 more expensive than their predecessors, putting them squarely in the premium smartphone category. To put that into perspective, Apple’s iPhone 15 Pro starts at $999, while its larger Pro Max starts at $1,199. Samsung’s own S24 and S24+ start at $799 and $999, respectively. Its high-end S24 Ultra costs $1,299.\n\nSamsung is marketing its Flip 6 and Fold 6 as more than just foldable phones. It’s positioning them as powerful generative AI-capable devices thanks to its Galaxy AI platform. The software, which Samsung debuted alongside its S24 lineup earlier this year, provides a host of generative AI features ranging from real-time translation and conversation capabilities to photo editing tools and productivity options. Samsung's latest Galaxy Z Flip 6 gets minor physical enhancements, but brings along the company's Galaxy AI generative AI platform. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nAccording to the company, artificial intelligence is proving rather popular among Samsung customers. The tech giant says 77% of S24 users access its AI features every week, with Google’s Circle to Search and Samsung’s Edit Suggestions among the most popular. Circle to Search allows you to capture a photo of an object or text and then search for it via the web or translate it. Edit Suggestions, as the name implies, provides generative AI text suggestions while writing text messages and emails.\n\nSamsung says the Fold 6 and Flip 6’s unique designs make them especially helpful when using Galaxy AI features. A new conversation feature in the Interpreter app allows you to chat with another person in different languages by automatically listening to and displaying your words on the phones’ cover screens and main screens. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 can be folded like a mini laptop or book depending on how you position it. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nSay you’re chatting with someone who only speaks French, and you only speak English. You can fold the Fold 6 so that it’s resting on the table like a mini laptop or fold the Flip 6 as if it were a makeup compact. The conversation feature will then display what your friend says on the main screen and what you say on the outside screen. The idea is to allow you to have a seamless conversation in real time. Google has a similar feature on its Pixel Fold foldable smartphone.\n\nBoth phones also come loaded with Google’s Gemini app, which is powered by the search company’s own AI models. You can call up Gemini by swiping on the corner of the screen or saying, “Hey, Google.” Gemini provides a host of options including getting help brainstorming ideas for things like work projects, trip itineraries, finding location information in Google Maps and more.\n\nStory continues Samsung's various Galaxy AI features. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nAs for productivity, in addition to Edit Suggestions, Galaxy AI now includes a new PDF translation feature for the Samsung Notes app that will, true to its name, translate your PDFs on your phone while retaining the document’s layout. Chances are you’ve tried to access a PDF and translate it in the past only to have the formatting go out the window, making it difficult to read. PDF translations should help eliminate that.\n\nFrom a design perspective, the Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 are largely unchanged from last year’s Z Flip 5 and Z Fold 5, save for a few nips and tucks. The Z Fold 6, for instance, gets a slightly larger 6.3-inch cover screen to make it feel more like a standard rectangular smartphone when closed. Considering that was one of my gripes with the phone, the larger display real estate should prove to be a welcome change, even if it’s just a 0.1-inch increase. Both the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 include Google's popular Circle to Search feature. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nThe Z Flip gets the same main camera as the company’s flagship S24 and a new ultra-wide-angle camera. The phone’s battery is also the same size as the one found in the S24, which according to Samsung, means users will no longer have to sacrifice overall capabilities when choosing the Flip over its mainline flagship.\n\nThe Fold, meanwhile, gets a 50-megapixel main camera, a new 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera, and a 12MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom and up to 30x digitally enhanced zoom.\n\nBoth the Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6 come equipped with Qualcomm’s (QCOM) Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip and 12GB of memory. The Flip also gets 256GB and 512GB of storage, while the Fold gets 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB of storage.\n\nSamsung’s foldables aren’t the only ones on the market. Chinese smartphone makers like Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as Motorola, also offer their own foldable devices. Still, Samsung’s Galaxy AI platform could help ensure it remains top of mind among consumers looking for foldables. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe S&P 500 is up 17% so far this year.\n\nBut as investors have heard time and again, this performance can be largely attributed to just a handful of stocks tracking one theme — the Magnificent Seven and AI. As of late June, for instance, Nvidia (NVDA) alone had accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500's gains this year.\n\nFor the other 493 stocks in the benchmark index, both earnings growth and shareholder returns have been more measured. In fact, as the team at Bank of America pointed out in a note on Tuesday, these remaining members of the S&P 500 have been in an earnings recession since the beginning of last year.\n\nAccording to data from BofA's US equity strategy team, earnings for the S&P 493 haven't registered year-over-year growth since the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nAfter an annual drop of 2% in the first quarter of '23 and a 7% annual decline in the second quarter of last year, earnings growth has been flat for this group in each of the last three quarters, the firm's work shows.\n\nThe upcoming second quarter earnings period, however, should mark the end of what's been a stealth earnings recession for the vast majority of companies in the S&P 500. For the 493 non-Mag 7 stocks, earnings growth is forecast to clock in at 6%, 7%, and 13% annually over the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2024.\n\nNow, this growth is still expected to lag the index's overall earnings growth, as the lion's share of this profit growth will be generated by the Technology (XLK) and Communications Services (XLC) sectors, which house AI beneficiaries like Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG). (Health Care, notably, is also set to see earnings rise by double digits in each of the next three quarters, though BofA cautions these are driven by one-time items rolling off the books for Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK).) Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang delivers his keystone speech ahead of Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 2, 2024. (SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images) (SAM YEH via Getty Images)\n\nSome on Wall Street have grown dismayed by the bifurcated performance between the haves (AI names) and have-nots (everyone else) in the S&P 500. But we think these numbers help us understand how we got here and where we're headed.\n\nWhen 2024 began, one of the consensus views on Wall Street was that the market rally would broaden out after a 2023 surge defined by the AI theme. To date, this trade has not been a feature of this market. The fundamentals — i.e., earnings growth — help explain why.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn each of the last two quarters, the aforementioned Technology sector has seen earnings growth of 25% and 27%, respectively; for Communications Services, earnings growth has been even more gaudy at 53% and 43% over those periods.\n\nIt's little wonder, then, why these sectors — and the most influential components within them — have been at the center of both the market conversation and most of the returns.\n\nAnd some strategists choosing to move away from talking about the so-called benchmark index as a useful benchmark for most investors is also more than sensible in this environment.\n\nAs Piper Sandler's Michael Kantrowitz told Yahoo Finance on Monday, the correlation between the S&P 500 index and its constituents has moved toward a 25-year low. And if the S&P 500 is to be a stand-in for \"the market\" and most stocks aren't trading in line with this market, then what are we really talking about?\n\nYet, as often happens in the investing world, this peak of frustration with a market environment that has come to resemble celebrity culture, in which just a few stars draw the headlines, appears set to crescendo. At which point stocks that comprise \"anything else\" will meet an investor community eager to think about just that.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia Recently Completed a 10-for-1 Stock Split, and These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Members Look Ready to Follow in Its Footsteps",
        "content": "Although most investors are captivated by the long-term potential of artificial intelligence (AI), companies enacting stock splits are an equally hot trend on Wall Street.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows publicly traded companies an opportunity to cosmetically alter their share price and outstanding share count. It's superficial in the sense that stock splits don't affect a company's market valuation or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe two variations of stock splits are forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are purposely reducing their nominal share price to make it more affordable for everyday investors and/or their employees. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split is aimed at increasing a company's share price, often with the goal of meeting continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.\n\nAlthough some reverse-stock splits can be long-term winners, most investors tend to focus their attention on public companies conducting forward splits. High-flying stocks in need of a forward split are usually out-executing and out-innovating their competition.\n\nSince 2024 began, in the neighborhood of a dozen high-profile companies have announced and/or completed a stock split -- but none have garnered more attention than AI titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia was the most-anticipated stock split of 2024 on Wall Street\n\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) in January 1999, Nvidia has completed six forward splits. The latest was announced by the company's board on May 22 -- a 10-for-1 stock split -- with an effective date of June 7. At the snap of a finger, Nvidia's share price of more than $1,200 was adjusted to a little north of $120.\n\nThe reason Nvidia required its largest stock split since going public has everything to do with its AI dominance.\n\nSince the start of 2023, Nvidia's AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the undisputed standard in high-compute data centers. By some estimates, the company holds a virtual monopoly on the AI-GPUs that were shipped for use in enterprise data centers last year.\n\nOn top of being the preferred hardware provider for AI-accelerated data centers, demand for the company's H100 GPU has overwhelmed supply. Even with world-leading foundry services company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rapidly upping its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity for high-bandwidth memory packaging, Nvidia is nowhere close to meeting enterprise demand for its chips. As a result, it's been able to meaningfully increase the selling price of its GPUs, which has provided a hearty boost to its adjusted gross margin.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has plans to retain its first-mover advantages, as well. While most external competitors are playing catch-up to the H100, Nvidia is expected to release its next-generation AI-GPU architecture, known as Blackwell, later this year. Blackwell offers computational improvements in six areas, including quantum computing, generative AI solutions, and engineering simulation, to name a few. In June, CEO Jensen Huang teased the eventual rollout of its Rubin GPU architecture by 2026.\n\nNvidia's 10-for-1 stock split has laid a path for other fast-growing, market-leading businesses to follow. Interestingly enough, two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" might be next to answer the call. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTwo Magnificent Seven components appear ready to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks\n\nAs a quick refresher, the Magnificent Seven account for seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in America. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia have market valuations in excess of $3 trillion; Alphabet and Amazon are valued at north of $2 trillion; Meta is worth close to $1.4 trillion; and while Tesla is currently below $1 trillion, it's previously topped this psychological level.\n\nAmong Nvidia's six peers in the Magnificent Seven, two are primed to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven component that's long overdue for a stock split is the only member that's yet to ever complete one. I'm talking about social media colossus Meta Platforms. Shares of the company have risen by more than 1,300% since its debut in 2012, with the company's stock tipping the scales at roughly $540, as of the closing bell on July 5.\n\nThough Meta is among the basket of companies undeniably benefiting from the AI revolution, it would be well-insulated if the AI bubble were to burst at some point in the future. That's because nearly 98% of Meta's sales can be traced to advertising on its social media platforms.\n\nMeta is the parent company behind Facebook, the most-visited social platform globally, as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads. These are some of the world's most-downloaded social apps, and they collectively helped to attract 3.24 billion daily active users during the March-ended quarter. Businesses are well aware that no other social media company offers access to more eyeballs than Meta, which is what affords the company such exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nSomething else working in Meta's favor is its treasure trove of cash. As of March 31, Meta was sitting on more than $58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. To boot, it's also generated north of $76 billion in cash from its operations over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has the luxury of betting big on AI data centers, the metaverse, and augmented/virtual reality devices thanks to his company's immense cash-flow generation.\n\nWith Meta's stock well over $500 and the company's long-term growth prospects improving, its very first stock split would seem to be in the cards.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven member that looks ready to follow in Nvidia's footsteps and become Wall Street's newest stock-split stock is software and cloud juggernaut Microsoft.\n\nSince its March 1986 IPO, Microsoft has conducted nine forward splits. However, the last stock split it completed was back in February 2003! With the world's largest company by market cap closing the July 5 session at $467.56 per share, the ingredients are on the table for Microsoft to announce a stock split.\n\nThe beauty of Microsoft's operating model is that it relies on sizable margins from its legacy operations to fund its high-growth initiatives. Although iconic software segments like Windows and Office aren't growing like they once were, the exceptional moats and margins associated with these divisions provide Microsoft with plenty of cash to reinvest in the cloud and AI, or perhaps deploy when making acquisitions.\n\nThe bread-and-butter to Microsoft's future looks to be cloud infrastructure service platform Azure. While Microsoft has AI and cloud ties in other operating segments, Azure is consistently its fastest-growing segment -- 31% constant-currency sales growth in the fiscal third quarter (ended March 31). Azure ranks second to Amazon Web Services in global cloud infrastructure service market share.\n\nSimilar to Meta Platforms, Microsoft's balance sheet and cash-flow generation afford it the ability to take risks that few other companies can match. It closed out the fiscal third quarter with $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and has generated $110 billion in operating cash flow over the TTM period. This is what allowed Microsoft to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard last year for $68.7 billion in an all-cash deal.\n\nWhat better way for the world's largest public company to excite Wall Street and its shareholders than by being the next Magnificent Seven component to announce a stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon launches its fourth-generation Graviton4 chip as competition intensifies",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) Web Services (AWS) is launching its fourth-generation Graviton processor, the Graviton4 chip, the company shared exclusively with Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe new chip promises to deliver substantial improvements in performance and efficiency, including three times the compute power and memory of its predecessor, 75% more memory bandwidth, and 30% better performance, according to Rahul Kulkarni, Amazon’s lead product manager for artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\n“Collectively it's delivering more price performance, which means for every dollar spent, you get a lot more performance,” Kulkarni shared with Yahoo Finance at Amazon’s chips lab in Austin, Texas.\n\nDemand for chips is growing as semiconductors continue to play a vital role in the global economy, powering nearly everything we use. The industry is currently valued at $544 billion and is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2033, driven by increasing demand for AI.\n\nAs a result, hyperscalers such as Amazon, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) are creating custom chips to meet their specific needs, cut costs, and offer customers more affordable options.\n\n\"All of these companies are spending a lot of money on developing chips,\" said Patrick Moorhead, who spent over a decade as a vice president at AMD. \"They won't talk about how much they're investing, but they have these giant R&D budgets.\"\n\nNvidia (NVDA) remains the dominant player in the AI chips market, with more than 80% share of the market for graphics processing units (GPUs). But there is enough demand to support multiple competitors, according to Moorhead, who currently serves as CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.\n\nAlthough the Graviton4 chip is not an AI chip, it supports AWS's Inferentia and Trainium chips, which are focused on the technology. Trainium competes directly with Nvidia's AI chips, which are considered the fastest and most powerful in the market.\n\nHowever, AWS's goal is not to unseat Nvidia, Kulkarni emphasized. Instead, the cloud service provider hopes to offer a viable alternative for customers focused on price performance, which they hope will allow them to take a profitable slice of the rapidly expanding AI-driven chips market.\n\n\"Right now, if a customer is more focused on time to market, Nvidia-based products that we offer are a great option,\" Kulkarni said. \"There are customers for whom cost becomes a very prohibitive aspect of running their business. If they want to do more cost-optimized AI workloads like training or inference, then our Inferentia and Trainium products become a great alternative.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHow Amazon keeps development costs down\n\nIn addition to buying chips from makers like Nvidia, AMD (AMD), and Intel (INTC), Amazon also designs its own chips in-house. AWS currently offers two main types of chips: those designed for AI and those made for general purposes, like the Graviton4.\n\nIn a rare look at AWS's lab, Yahoo Finance saw AWS engineers solder and test chip designs, using software to look for performance issues and fix them on site.\n\nIt's one way the company says it drives down development costs.\n\n“We can tune the product, tune this silicon, to just focus on things that really matter for customer workloads,” said Kulkarni. Inside Amazon Web Services' chip-testing lab. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAWS has not disclosed specific pricing details for the Graviton4, but the processors are rented at $0.02845 per second of compute power. This price-performance ratio is crucial for AWS, as it uses its proprietary chips to power its cloud infrastructure and servers.\n\n\"AWS customers can use Graviton4 to cut their bill for IT in half,\" said Moorhead, who currently serves as CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.\n\nIt’s not just about providing chips to customers — AWS's chips strategy is also about using all of its chip offerings to power its own efforts, including a new large language model, a potential rival to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nMoorhead noted that while the development of chips is expensive, it can lead to substantial savings in the long run.\n\n\"Let's say you can save $200 a chip, and you're buying a million of them a year,\" Moorhead said. \"That adds up, and that's a lot of money that you can pour in to do that.\" Attendees walk through an expo hall at AWS re:Invent 2023, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, on Wednesday, Nov. 29, 2023, in Las Vegas. (Noah Berger/Amazon Web Services via AP Images) (AWS)\n\nFor investors, earnings expectations from chip development may impact company profits more than actual chip production. As AWS looks to carve out its niche by designing, testing, and validating its chips, analysts have noticed the company's growing influence in the semiconductor space.\n\nAnalyst earnings expectations are higher for Amazon than for Microsoft or Alphabet, and the profit margins for AWS alone reached 38% in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n\"AWS has a lot of credibility in the semiconductor space,\" Moorhead said. \"Ten years ago, I had questions about how a company like this could do chips when you have companies investing multiple billions of dollars to do that. But they are very good at it.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon’s AMZN shares have gained 31.2% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the Zacks Internet Commerce industry’s return of 22.4%. The e-commerce giant is riding on the solid momentum in its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).\r\n\r\nAWS is benefiting from the growing customer momentum across the world on the back of its strong cloud computing capabilities. Its strengthening cloud infrastructure in various emerging and developed nations is a major positive.\r\n\r\nThe company recently joined forces with the Australia government to build ‘Top Secret’ AWS Cloud (TS Cloud) for Australia’s defense and intelligence agencies. This initiative will allow agencies to host sensitive information securely, which, in turn, will help Australia improve the nation’s cyber capabilities and deepen security cooperation with the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Australia government plans to invest AU$2 billion ($1.3 billion) over the next decade in the new cloud system. Under the agreement, Amazon will construct three facilities in the country.\r\n\r\nTS Cloud will make the sharing of classified data between Australia’s National Intelligence Community and the Australian Defence Force seamless. It will also power the nation’s security with AI and machine learning.\r\n\r\nThe latest deal underscores AWS's global experience, security, performance and ability to dedicate thousands of engineers to a project.\r\n\r\nMoreover, AWS’s commitment to driving innovation, economic growth and digital transformation across Australia reaches a new height with this deal. Last year, it launched its second infrastructure region in Melbourne, Australia. Through the AWS Asia Pacific (Melbourne) region, AWS strives to invest $4.5 billion by 2037 and support 2,500 full-time jobs annually.\n\nYear-to-Date Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExpanding Asia Pacific (APAC) Presence Aids Prospects\n\nAWS has strengthened its footprint in the APAC region on the back of the latest deal.\r\n\r\nPer a Research and Markets report, the cloud market in the APAC region is expected to witness a CAGR of 15.1% between 2023 and 2030. Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service and Software-as-a-Service are gaining strong momentum in APAC.\r\n\r\nAmazon is well-poised to capitalize on this growth opportunity on the back of its expanding APAC footprint.\r\n\r\nAWS recently announced plans to launch an AWS infrastructure region in Taiwan by early 2025. The region will be known as the AWS Asia Pacific (Taipei) Region.\r\n\r\nThe cloud giant is also gearing up to launch an infrastructure region in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2026.\r\n\r\nAWS plans to launch an infrastructure region in Malaysia, in which it strives to invest $6 billion by 2037 and support job creation in the country.\r\n\r\nIt intends to pump in 2.26 trillion yen ($15.24 billion) in Japan by 2027. With this investment, AWS strives to boost its cloud infrastructure across the country, especially in Tokyo and Osaka.\r\n\r\nAWS plans to open a region in Bangkok, Thailand, and set up an infrastructure region in Auckland, New Zealand, comprising three availability zones.\r\n\r\nThe launch of an infrastructure region in Israel, located in Tel Aviv, namely, AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region, is another positive.\r\n\r\nExpanding presence in the promising APAC region is expected to aid the performance of AWS, which, in turn, will drive Amazon’s overall performance in the long run.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $638.24 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 11%. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 0.9% to $4.58 per share over the past 60 days. The figure indicates year-over-year growth of 57.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAggressive Efforts Aid Competitive Prowess\n\nAmazon, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is expected to remain at the top of the competition graph on the back of aggressive expansion efforts in APAC. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s peers like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Alibaba BABA are also leaving no stone unturned to expand their presence, given the booming scenario in APAC.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s Azure is gearing up for the opening of five data centers in APAC, namely South-Central India, Indonesia Central, Malaysia West, New Zealand North and Taiwan North, which will be located in Hyderabad, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Auckland and Taipei, respectively.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Azure also plans to launch a Saudi Arabia Central region.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Alphabet’s Google launched a data center in Japan in 2023, marking its third such establishment in Asia. The facility is located in Inzai, Chiba. Google’s opening of a data center in Singapore is also noteworthy.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s opening of cloud regions in India’s New Delhi and Australia’s Melbourne last year is an uptrend. The search giant’s opening of cloud regions located in Doha, Qatar, and Dammam, Saudi Arabia, is another positive.\r\n\r\nAlibaba is hugely investing in expanding its presence in the cloud market of the underlined region. In regard to APAC, the company has data centers located in Singapore, Australia, Philippines, India, Thailand, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and Indonesia.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmazon’s strength in AWS, which is riding on expanding clientele, strong partner base and growing global presence, is expected to boost its long-term prospects. Its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives.\r\n\r\nAmazon currently has a Value Score of B, which makes it an attractive pick for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Markets might feel unstoppable, but it's important not to get complacent.\n\n\"There's definitely some level of froth [in markets],\" Fed Watch Advisors founder Ben Emons told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen here). \"There's a lot of liquidity in the market. You see speculation through these meme stocks — so that's happening.\"\n\nEmons suggests investors use this moment to reduce concentration risk in your portfolio, or take some profits in a stock that has surged this year and as a result is weighted too heavily.\n\nThe S&P 500 hit 35 record closing highs on Monday. From a trailing price-to-earnings (PE) ratio perspective, the S&P 500 is trading at 28 times compared to a historical mean of about 15 times.\n\nThe “Buffett Indicator” as it’s called in Wall Street circles — which takes the Wilshire 5000 Index (viewed as the total stock market) and divides it by the annual U.S. GDP — is now at a record high.\n\nWarren Buffett's favorite indicator stands at about 196.2% — up sharply from 137% or so from September 2022 lows.\n\nThe figure is well above the 159.2% seen just before the dot-com bubble.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of Apple (AAPL) have gained a cool 30% since April, allowing it to take back the mantle as world's most valuable company ($3.55 trillion market cap) from chip beast Nvidia (NVDA) ($3.15 trillion market cap).\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT), Apple, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are all trading at record high valuations. The top 10 companies in the S&P 500 make up 35% of the market cap but only 23% of earnings, according to data from Apollo (the parent company of Yahoo Finance) chief economist Torsten Slok.\n\nSeemingly everywhere one looks, the market is beginning to feel too hot, given the near-term risks such as a contentious presidential election cycle. The outlook for interest rate policy from the Fed also remains uncertain, and corporate earnings are only seen rising by a single-digit percentage in the second quarter.\n\nPros are beginning to line up on the other side of the trade amid those risks, and are calling for a swift and steep pullback.\n\nMorgan Stanley's top strategist Mike Wilson warned this week of a 10% pullback in stocks ahead of the election. Wilson is among the experts on the worried about current stock valuations.\n\nAnd Nvidia's stock caught a rare downgrade to neutral by New Street Research on valuation concerns.\n\nWhile there is no proverbial crystal ball on markets or individual stocks, Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods said on Opening Bid that 10% pullbacks happen once a year on average.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We had a 14% pullback last year,” reminded Woods.\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled, market-focused conversations and chats with the biggest names in business on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) an Overbought AI Stock in 2024?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of the Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe second half of 2024 is here and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve remain elusive, with warnings about valuations and AI-led market hype growing louder. A number of notable Wall Street analysts have recently warned that the markets remains more concentrated than ever where just a few stocks account for most of the gains, thanks to their dominance in the AI industry. Many also believe the market is up for a correction as it has entered the overbought territory. Financial services company BTIG recently said in a report that the world’s fifth-largest exchange-traded fund by assets under management (AUM), QQQ Trust Series 1, now trades “well into” overbought territory based on its Relative Strength Index technical indicator.  QQQ tracks  the Nasdaq-100 Index and it’s not surprising to see the ETF showing signs of being overbought as more and more investors pile into mega-cap tech stocks in order to ride the AI bandwagon.\n\nFor this article we scanned the holdings of the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF and picked top technology holdings of the fund with higher Relative Strength Index (RSI) values. Usually, an RSI value of 60 and above shows a stock is overbought. We have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors with these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) an Overbought AI Stock in 2024?\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)  is one of the top holdings of the QQQ which has entered the overbought territory according to financial services firm BTIG. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)  has a 14-day RSI value of 62, worse than 89.85% of the 600 companies in the interactive media industry, according to data from GuruFocus. However, many believe Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)  is one of the most undervalued AI stocks right now based on its growth catalysts.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the company is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrate with other Google apps. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) app is to urge users to sign up for ‘Google One AI Premium’ plan, which has a $19.99 price tag.  Google saw advertising revenue accelerate in Q1 2024, boosted by YouTube in particular growing by almost 21% last quarter. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nWeitz Investment Large Cap Equity Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Mega-cap titans Meta Platforms, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon generated outsized gains and were the Fund’s top relative contributors for the past 12 months. Following our valuation discipline, we continued to methodically rotate from more fully priced stocks to those trading at healthier discounts to our value estimates. We trimmed more tech-adjacent winners during the quarter, including Alphabet\n\nAlphabet has been the most notable trim over the past two quarters. In effect, we removed the heavy overweight layer of the position size, which had been in the 6% to 8% range for most of the last five years. Part of the decision simply reflected valuation prudence after an exceptional period where the stock price ran well ahead of our estimate of business value growth. Some of it was a reality check that Google’s core search business may be less clearly unassailable than it appeared to be five to seven years ago. Our team also has adopted a healthy “prove it” approach to management/culture, capital allocation and future returns on a robust investment cycle. While Alphabet may no longer warrant standout overweight status, the stock remains one of the Fund’s largest holdings.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc.

        "title": "35% of the S&amp;P 500 Is Concentrated in the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Here's What That Means for Your Portfolio.",
        "content": "Mega-cap growth stocks continue to dominate the broader market and contribute the bulk of gains in the major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. But the sheer value of some of the largest companies might surprise you.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a term coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe seven industry-leading tech-focused companies: Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nThese seven companies are now so valuable that they make up a combined 35.5% of the S&P 500. Here's what these changing market dynamics mean for the stock market and how to position your portfolio in a way that matches your risk tolerance and helps you achieve your investment objectives. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA double-edged sword\n\nThe S&P 500 is up over 44% since the end of 2022. The primary reason is that the sectors containing Magnificent Seven stocks are outperforming the S&P 500 as a whole, while the other eight sectors are underperforming. ^IXT Chart\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia are in the tech sector. Alphabet and Meta Platforms lead the communications sector. And Amazon and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector.\n\nLarge stocks can move the market when they put up monster gains, especially if you factor in sizable companies that fall outside the Magnificent Seven -- such as Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), which is now valued at more than $800 billion  and is up more than threefold since the end of 2022. MSFT Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are so valuable that they can single-handedly spark a so-called correction in the S&P 500. A correction is a fall of 10% to 20% in a major market index, so an average decline of 28% in the Magnificent Seven would put the S&P 500 in correction territory. That math doesn't even factor in sizable stocks like Broadcom that would likely fall in lockstep with a major sell-off in Nvidia and other tech stocks.\n\nIn this vein, the Magnificent Seven's influence extends beyond their weight in the S&P 500. The group has been driving monster gains in the index during the past 18 months or so, but the larger it becomes, the more vulnerable the market will be to a growth-driven sell-off.\n\nExpectations are high\n\nNo matter your investment time horizon or risk tolerance, it's important to be aware of the S&P 500's composition, especially when it undergoes a significant makeover. The index changes based on the economy's evolution and investor sentiment. In other words, it's a moving target, or benchmark, driven by different themes at different times.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome investors might be nervous about the market's relatively expensive price tag, with the S&P 500's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sitting at almost 29. Even if the market rally is overextended, putting new capital to work -- even at record highs -- has historically been a winning strategy for investors.\n\nThere's also a case to be made that the market deserves to be more expensive. If the S&P 500 grows earnings faster because the weighting of growth stocks increases, then it would stand to reason the P/E ratio should be higher as well.\n\nInvesting is more about where a company is headed than where it is today. And so far, mega-cap growth stocks have mostly delivered on earnings growth. For example, Amazon is still not terribly overvalued despite seeing its stock price more than double during the past 18 months.\n\nA high P/E basically means that investors are willing to pay a higher price for a company relative to its earnings today because they expect earnings to be higher in the future. However, if growth slows and expectations come down, it can lead to a sizable sell-off.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the S&P 500's valuation has become based increasingly on future potential earnings, whereas a few decades ago, the most valuable companies -- consumer staples giants, banks, and oil and gas businesses -- were valued more on their past earnings. Outsize gains could continue if companies deliver the growth that investors expect, but there could also be higher volatility in the market.\n\nBuild a portfolio that's right for you\n\nGiven the expensive valuation of the S&P 500 and its puny 1.3% dividend yield, value- and income-focused investors could consider integrating quality dividend stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into a diversified portfolio.\n\nAs a starting point, Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) trade at discounts to the S&P 500, are both Dividend Kings (with over 50 consecutive years of dividend increases), and both have dividend yields of more than 3%.\n\nThe SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF(NYSEMKT: DIA) mirrors the performance of that index and has a 1.8% yield and a 23.3 P/E -- making it a good option for folks looking to stick with blue chip stocks but through a value lens.\n\nThere are plenty of low-cost Vanguard ETFs that can provide a lifetime of passive income, such as the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF(NYSEMKT: VYM), Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF(NYSEMKT: VDC), and the Vanguard Utilities ETF(NYSEMKT: VPU). Targeting lower-growth, higher-yield sectors can be an effective way to balance a portfolio that is heavily allocated in growth stocks.\n\nAdjusting with the times\n\nAt first glance, the market might look overvalued because the S&P 500 has an inflated P/E ratio. But that's mostly because it is now heavily weighted in surging mega-cap growth stocks.\n\nPlenty of pockets of the market are teeming with quality value and income stocks. Now is the perfect time for investors to conduct a portfolio review and update their watch lists to ensure they hit their passive-income goals while aligning their investments with their risk tolerance.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Nvidia has been on an impressive tear lately, but many investors are concerned about the longevity of Nvidia's current position. It's known to be a cyclical company, so a demand reduction in its GPUs (graphics processing units) is coming, although no one knows when.\n\nWith Nvidia trading on much of its future prospects, there isn't much room for error. However, there are two companies that aren't as high-flying as Nvidia and could be worth more than it five years from now.\n\nThe two companies? Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which are the fourth- and fifth-largest companies in the world, respectively.\n\nAlphabet\n\nWhen discussing which company is larger, I'm talking about market capitalization. Market cap is how much a company is worth and can be calculated by multiplying the shares outstanding by the stock price. Nvidia currently holds around a $3 trillion market cap, while Alphabet and Amazon are valued at around $2.3 trillion and $2.1 trillion, respectively. So, if Nvidia stays stagnant, these two would have to grow by 31% (Alphabet) and 45% (Amazon) to catch Nvidia.\n\nOver a five-year span, those aren't unrealistic outperformance rates, so the odds of either company surpassing Nvidia aren't that low.\n\nAlphabet has a strong case of being worth more than Nvidia solely on a valuation basis. I could talk about how Google Gemini is a fantastic generative AI model that is starting to pick up momentum after stumbling out of the gate or how Google Cloud is vital in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. But the argument is far simpler than that.\n\nCurrently, Alphabet trades at 24.5 times forward earnings. While this is still more expensive than the broader market's 22.3 times forward earnings (measured by the S&P 500 index), it's still far cheaper than the three larger companies in front of it. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWith Microsoft and Apple trading at 34 and 33 times forward earnings, respectively, they garner a much higher premium than Alphabet.\n\nWhile some may argue that this premium is warranted due to recent execution, I'd argue that Alphabet is just as deserving over the long term. If you gave Alphabet a 33 times forward earnings multiple, the company would be valued at $3.08 trillion -- essentially the same size as Nvidia.\n\nAlphabet doesn't get nearly the respect that some other companies do in today's market. As a result, I think it has a strong case to be worth more than Nvidia in the future, as it isn't trading with lofty expectations built into the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon's case isn't as straightforward as Alphabet's. The stock trades at 44 times forward earnings, nearly identical to Nvidia's 45 times forward earnings valuation.\n\nHowever, I believe Amazon's high valuation is a byproduct of its focus on efficiency. CEO Andy Jassy has been pushing for better operating efficiency since he was promoted to CEO. So far, Amazon excelled in this pursuit.\n\nSegment Revenue YOY Revenue Growth Operating Income YOY Operating Income Growth North American $86.3 billion 12% $5 billion 455% International $31.9 billion 10% $903 million N/A AWS $25 billion 17% $9.4 billion 84%\n\nData source: Amazon. YOY = Year over year. Note: International was unprofitable last year.\n\nWith the impressive improvements in all divisions in a year, his plan is clearly working. However, Jassy isn't done yet. Although these profit levels are the highest they've been since the peak of COVID, Jassy believes there are more gains to be had.\n\nThis combination of revenue growth (Amazon grew its revenue by 13% in the first quarter) with margin improvement causes earnings to rise rapidly, making the stock appear cheaper if the stock price doesn't rise by the exact same amount.\n\nAmazon is a solid business with serious staying power. Because of its track record of execution and solid growth, I think it will be worth more than Nvidia in five years. Nvidia's business comes in waves, and although that's great for peaks, it can hurt it when times aren't so good.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Leader's Top Billionaire Seller Is Buying These 4 Supercharged Growth Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Since the internet first began to proliferate three decades ago, Wall Street and investors have been waiting for the next big innovation that can alter the growth trajectory of corporate America. The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution appears to be answering the call for game-changing growth.\n\nWith AI, software and systems are used in place of humans to oversee or undertake tasks. What gives this technology such broad-reaching utility is the potential for software and systems to learn and evolve without human oversight.\n\nAlthough growth estimates are all over the map when it comes to AI, the analysts at PwC released a report last year that estimated the technology would add $15.7 trillion to the global economy come 2030. With an addressable market this large, there are bound to be multiple big-time winners, which is why we've witnessed investors pile into AI stocks.\n\nHowever, optimism surrounding AI stocks isn't universal among Wall Street's brightest and richest investors. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's top billionaire seller dumped over 29 million (split-adjusted) shares in the first quarter\n\nBased on Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission -- 13Fs provide a snapshot of what Wall Street's most-successful money managers were buying and selling in the latest quarter -- over a half-dozen billionaire money managers dumped shares of AI leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) during the first quarter. But no billionaire seemingly mashed the sell button harder than Coatue Management's Philippe Laffont.\n\nFactoring in that Nvidia has since completed a 10-for-1 forward-stock split, Laffont's fund sold the equivalent of 29,370,600 shares of Nvidia, or roughly 68% of Coatue's prior stake in the company.\n\nDespite Nvidia having a veritable monopoly on AI-powered graphics processing units (GPUs) in high-compute data centers, and enjoying otherworldly pricing power due to demand for AI-GPUs overwhelming supply, Laffont likely had a number of viable reasons to run for the exit.\n\nTo state the obvious, he and his team may have simply been locking in some of their gains. Nvidia's stock has gained nearly $3 trillion in market value since the start of 2023, which is a level of scaling we've simply never witnessed before.\n\nA more prevailing concern for Nvidia and Laffont might be history. There hasn't been a new innovation or technology in 30 years (including the advent of the internet) that's avoided an early stage bubble. Investor euphoria for new innovations consistently ignores that all new innovations need time to mature. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to break this trend, which would eventually expose Nvidia to some serious downside.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is also contending with its first real semblance of competition in AI-accelerated data centers. In addition to external competitors rolling out their AI-GPUs, Nvidia's top customers are also developing AI-GPUs for their data centers. This all translates to reduced AI-GPU scarcity and waning pricing power for AI leader Nvidia.\n\nBut while Philippe Laffont and his team were busy dumping shares of Nvidia in the March-ended quarter, they couldn't stop buying shares of four other supercharged growth stocks. TSM Chart\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nOne of the most interesting moves made by billionaire Philippe Laffont and his investment team during the first quarter was buying more than 10 million shares (10,027,552, to be precise) of world-leading chip fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM).\n\nTaiwan Semi, which is now Coatue's fifth-largest position by market value (as of March 31), provides its services to most of the top tech companies and semiconductor titans, including Nvidia. With demand for AI-GPUs swamping supply, chip-fab companies like Taiwan Semiconductor, which are responsible for packaging the high-bandwidth memory that make high-compute data centers tick, should enjoy an extensive backlog of orders.\n\nFurthermore, Taiwan Semi is steadily reducing the geopolitical risk that had previously weighed down its valuation. The foundry giant opened its first Japan-based plant earlier this year, and expects to begin production at a new facility in Arizona by sometime in 2025. This means geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan won't be as potentially damning to its future capacity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSalesforce\n\nA second supercharged growth stock that Laffont and his investment team were buying instead of Nvidia during the March-ended quarter is cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software solutions provider Salesforce(NYSE: CRM). Laffont more-than-doubled Coatue Management's stake in Salesforce by picking up 2,556,774 shares in the first three months of the year.\n\nThe primary reason Salesforce has worked its way to Coatue's fourth-largest holding probably has to do with the company's seemingly impenetrable moat in cloud-based CRM software. A recent report from IDC notes that Salesforce has been the global No. 1 in CRM software sales for 12 consecutive years. Further, its 21.7% worldwide CRM market share is over three times greater than its next-closest competitor (Microsoft at 5.9%).\n\nOn top of a sustained double-digit growth runway for cloud-based CRM software, CEO and co-founder Marc Benioff has orchestrated a number of earnings-accretive acquisitions, including MuleSoft, Tableau Software, and Slack Technologies. Bolt-on acquisitions expand the company's services ecosystem and provide abundant cross-selling opportunities.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe third high-octane growth stock Laffont was busy buying while sending shares of AI kingpin Nvidia to the chopping block is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, autonomous driving company Waymo, and cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud. Coatue's first-quarter 13F shows the fund's position in Alphabet's Class A shares (GOOGL) grew by 138%, or 2,597,338 shares.\n\nSimilar to Taiwan Semi and Salesforce, the lure of Alphabet might be as simple as its impenetrable moat in internet search. For more than nine years, Google has accounted for at least a 90% monthly share of worldwide internet search. More often than not, this affords the company exceptional ad-pricing power, which leads to an abundance of operating cash flow.\n\nIn the second half of this decade, Google Cloud is liable to be Alphabet's fastest-growing segment. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its relatively early stages of ramping up, and Google Cloud made the shift to recurring profits last year. Since cloud-service margins are noticeably higher than advertising margins, this segment should provide a nice lift to Alphabet's cash flow in the years to come.\n\nPayPal\n\nThe fourth supercharged growth stock Nvidia's top billionaire seller was a big-time buyer of during the March-ended quarter is financial technology (\"fintech\") juggernaut PayPal Holdings(NASDAQ: PYPL). Laffont oversaw the addition of 8,014,159 shares of PayPal, making it Coatue's 16th-largest holding by market value, as of March 31.\n\nIn spite of increasing competition in the digital payment space, many of PayPal's key performance metrics are moving in the right direction. Specifically, payment transactions grew by 11% from the previous year to 6.5 billion, total payment volume increased by 14% on a constant-currency basis to almost $404 billion, and engagement among active accounts continues to climb. Over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period, ended March 31, the average active account completed 60 payments, which is up from an average of 40.9 payments over the TTM for active accounts, as of the end of 2020.\n\nFurthermore, new CEO Alex Chriss has a good understanding of what small businesses need to succeed. He's overseeing the introduction of a new advertising platform for PayPal and has been mindfully monitoring spending to boost margins.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: These Will Be 2 of the Most Valuable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks by 2034",
        "content": "Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia are the world's three most-valuable companies, and they are the only ones in history to surpass $3 trillion in market capitalization. They will probably continue to grow long into the future, especially if artificial intelligence (AI) lives up to expectations.\n\nThe global economy generated $105 trillion in output last year, but Wall Street thinks AI could significantly boost that figure:\n\nGoldman Sachs believes AI will create $7 trillion worth of economic activity within the next decade. PwC thinks AI will add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, with almost half of those gains coming from its ability to improve existing products. Ark Investment Management is the most bullish on AI, predicting software like OpenAI's ChatGPT could drive a productivity explosion worth $200 trillion to the world economy.\n\nIf those forecasts prove to be accurate -- even at the lower end -- I think Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) will grow to become two of the world's most valuable companies over the next 10 years. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Oracle: Industry-leading AI infrastructure\n\nNvidia is the quintessential AI play right now, because its graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers are essential to building AI models. CEO Jensen Huang says data center operators could generate $5 in revenue (over four years) for every $1 they invest in his company's chips, because demand for computing power is so high among AI developers.\n\nThat brings me to Oracle, which offers some of the best AI data center infrastructure in the world. It developed unique RDMA (random direct memory access) networking technology, which moves data from one point to another significantly faster than competing Ethernet networks, translating to faster AI development at a lower cost.\n\nPlus, Oracle's SuperCluster technology will soon allow developers to scale their computing capacity up to 65,536 Nvidia GPUs. By comparison, the best infrastructure at Amazon Web Services currently offers clusters of up to 20,000 GPUs, so Oracle could become the go-to destination for developers building the largest, most complex AI models.\n\nSpeaking of which, Oracle's remaining performance obligations (RPOs) soared 44% year over year to a record $98 billion during the recent fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended May 31), which included $12.5 billion worth of new AI deals. Leading AI start-ups like OpenAI and Elon Musk's xAI are just a couple of the developers waiting in line for more computing capacity from Oracle.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company reports data center revenue under its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) segment. It brought in just $2 billion during the quarter (up 42%), which puts the enormous backlog into perspective. The company is building new data centers to meet demand, which will convert its RPOs into more OCI revenue. Management expects gross profit margins to expand as it opens more locations thanks to their highly automated nature.\n\nOracle is valued at $399 billion as of this writing, but its stock trades at a heavy discount to the AI leaders. Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia trade at an average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 49.7, whereas Oracle's P/E is just 26. I'm not suggesting this will happen, but in theory, its stock will have to rise 91% just to catch up. That would catapult its valuation to $762 billion.\n\nOracle has grown its earnings at a compound annual rate of 8.9% over the last 10 years. But the sheer growth in the company's RPOs could drive an above-trend earnings expansion for years to come, especially since margins are expected to improve with scale.\n\nIf, for example, earnings grow by 15% annually over the next 10 years and its P/E trades in line with other AI giants, its market cap could top $3 trillion. Wall Street already forecasts 15% earnings growth in fiscal 2026.\n\nSeveral assumptions need to become reality for the above scenario to play out, but joining the trillion-dollar club in general would make Oracle one of the world's largest AI companies.\n\n2. Alphabet: A world-class AI software company\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of tech titans like Google, YouTube, Waymo, and DeepMind. The conglomerate is already valued at $2.3 trillion, so it doesn't have to create quite as much value as Oracle to be one of the world's largest companies in 2034. However, it does have to overcome AI-related disruptions to its core business.\n\nGoogle Search is responsible for more than half of Alphabet's total revenue. It's an attractive destination for advertisers because of its dominant 91% market share in the internet search industry.\n\nBut AI chatbots like ChatGPT pose a threat because they offer a faster, more direct, and more convenient way to get information. Microsoft integrated ChatGPT into its Bing search engine for that specific reason.\n\nAlphabet has launched a series of its own AI chatbots over the past year, culminating in the Gemini family of models, which are its most advanced to date. Plus, generative AI is handling a growing number of queries on Google Search by producing text-based responses at the top of the page to save users from sifting through web pages for answers.\n\nEarly signs suggest this is protecting Google's dominance, because its advertising revenue jumped 14.3% year over year during the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), which was the fastest growth in almost two years.\n\nOutside of search, Gemini is opening the door to several new opportunities. For example, Google Workspace is a popular productivity platform featuring Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more.\n\nBusinesses pay $12 per user, per month for the Workspace standard plan, but they can now add Gemini for another $20 per user, per month. It serves as an AI assistant capable of rapidly creating text content and images, which can boost productivity within any organization.\n\nMore than 9 million businesses pay for Workspace (with several individual users within each one), so Gemini could become a substantial financial opportunity for Alphabet.\n\nLike Oracle, Google Cloud also offers powerful AI data center infrastructure to the developer community. Plus, its platform features more than 130 ready-made large language models (LLMs), including Gemini, which developers can use to create their own AI applications.\n\nAlphabet says more than 60% of generative AI start-ups are Google Cloud customers, and it's looking to grow that number by offering Nvidia's latest GPUs in addition to chips Alphabet designed in-house.\n\nThe stock trades at a P/E of 29.4, so it's cheaper than the AI leaders on average. The company grew its earnings by 27% in 2023, and Wall Street expects growth to remain above 20% in 2024.\n\nAt that pace, Alphabet will likely be one of the largest AI companies in 10 years' time. Even if the company's earnings growth averages 10% over the next decade, it would amass a market cap of $6.5 trillion as long as its current P/E remains constant.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "TRMB, CYBR, HUBS: Which “Strong Buy” Tech Stock Is Best?",
        "content": "The technology companies flying just outside of our radar may be the ones that have the most room to run this year. Undoubtedly, there’s more to investing than just buying the largest seven companies in the stock market. Bigger has been better, at least in the past year. But what has worked best in the recent past may not continue to work so well in the future. Right now, investors may wish to check out some Strong-Buy-rated stocks for a shot at making the most of the tech-driven rally while potentially steering clear of the biggest potholes in the road.\n\nTherefore, let’s use TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to compare and contrast three impressive tech stocks — TRMB, CYBR, and HUBS — that have what it takes to outrun the market’s current heavyweights.\n\nTrimble (NASDAQ:TRMB)\n\nShares of geospatial tech firm Trimble have been struggling to hang onto the big surge they enjoyed since bottoming in November 2023. The tech firm, which serves a wide range of industries, now finds itself in a correction, down close to 15% from 52-week highs. Despite the share slip, which came weeks after the company reported a strong first quarter (earnings per share of $0.64 vs. $0.62 expected), I’m inclined to stay bullish as Trimble looks to launch new products that may emerge as meaningful long-term growth drivers.\n\nLooking ahead, new scanning systems such as the X9 3D laser scanner, which it showed off in Geo Week 2024 earlier this year, may be a timely catalyst that helps TRMB stock out of its rut. It’s more than just a faster and more accurate 3D screener, though; its auto-calibration capabilities could help users save time and take a bit of human error out of the equation.\n\nIndeed, such new tech makes Trimble a niche technological innovator and one that Cathie Wood may have been wrong to trim. At writing, the stock trades at 20.2 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), considerably below the Scientific and Technical Instruments industry average of 19.9 times.\n\nWhat’s the Price Target for TRMB Stock?\n\nTRMB stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with four Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average TRMB stock price target of $68.75 implies 22.1% upside potential.\n\nCyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR)\n\nFrom geospatial tech to cybersecurity, we have CyberArk Software. It’s a smaller ($11.8 billion market cap) Israeli firm that deserves to be mentioned whenever the cohort is discussed on television after a major breach reignites interest in cybersecurity names. With various cybersecurity players in the market, each boasting unique specialties, CyberArk’s offerings deserve attention.\n\nStory continues\n\nCyberArk’s bread and butter is in identity security, a promising sub-scene in the cybersecurity market. As the Israel-based firm continues improving its already impressive Identity Security Platform, it’s tough not to be bullish on the lightweight cybersecurity firm eyeing a vast market.\n\nDespite its size, CyberArk stands out as a market leader in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) market, which could enjoy a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% between now and 2032, according to Fortune Business Insights. With impressive subscription annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth of 60% posted last year, CyberArk looks like a cash cow in the making.\n\nAt writing, CYBR stock is close to a fresh all-time high. Shares are on the high end of the past-year historical range at 14.5 times price-to-sales (P/S). However, the rich multiple may be worth paying for such a fast grower in a lucrative corner of cybersecurity.\n\nWhat’s the Price Target for CYBR Stock?\n\nCYBR stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 21 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average CYBR stock price target of $297.25 implies 8.7% upside potential.\n\nHubspot (NASDAQ:HUBS)\n\nHubspot stock has been blistering hot over the past two years, soaring almost 80%. Though the rally has since petered off in 2024, the small- and medium-sized (SMB) business software firm may still have legs going into the second half of the year as IT spending looks to experience a bit of an uptick. As a compelling takeover target with a great deal of AI innovation under the hood, I’m inclined to stay bullish on the stock, just like analysts.\n\nUndoubtedly, recent headlines have been dominated by chatter regarding a potential $33 billion Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) takeover. Robust, AI-leveraging customer relationship management (CRM) software certainly seems to be the missing piece of the Alphabet puzzle. A deal would help it more effectively clash against some of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) rivals, most notably enterprise giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has been busy infusing AI across the suite.\n\nMore recently, reports noted that other “bidders” have stepped up, expressing interest in gobbling up the firm for an unknown amount.\n\nDeal or not, Hubspot stands out as a compelling software recovery play and a serious CRM market disruptor as it triples down on AI tools to help customers “work smarter.” At 80.6 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), HUBS shares don’t come cheap. However, if Google and others are eyeing a potentially higher admission price, perhaps investors may be at risk of underestimating the magnitude of the growth narrative.\n\nWhat’s the Price Target for HUBS Stock?\n\nHUBS stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 18 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average HUBS stock price target of $681.22 implies 16.2% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThe following Strong-Buy-rated software plays are worth checking out as they look to seize any market opportunities headed their way. Whether we’re talking about Trimble and its new 3D scanner, CyberArk’s ever-improving identity security offering, or Hubspot’s AI-first software that’s caught the attention of “bidders,” it’s clear some huge opportunities lie outside the market’s top five. Of the trio, analysts see the most upside potential (22%) from TRMB stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Microsoft intends to offer Apple's iOS-based devices to its employees in China to access authentication apps, a company spokesperson said on Monday, citing absence of Google's Android services in the country.\n\nMicrosoft has been under increased scrutiny after a series of security breaches, the latest being that of Russian hackers who spied and accessed emails of the company's employees and customers earlier this year.\n\nThe development was first reported by Bloomberg News, which, citing an internal memo, said the Windows OS-maker instructed its employees in China to use Apple devices at workplace from September.\n\nAs a part of Microsoft's global Secure Future Initiative, the move to switch to iOS-devices stems from the lack of availability of Google Play Store in China that limits its employees' access to security apps such as Microsoft Authenticator and Identity Pass, the report added.\n\n\"Due to the lack of availability of Google Mobile Services in this region, we look to offer employees a means of accessing these required apps, such as an iOS device,\" a company spokesperson told Reuters in an email.\n\nMicrosoft is among those U.S. companies that have a strong presence in China. It entered the Chinese market in 1992 and also operates a large research and development center in the country.\n\nThe company will provide iPhone 15 models to employees, currently using Android handsets across China, including Hong Kong, the Bloomberg report said.\n\n(Reporting by Priyanka.G in Bengaluru; Editing by Mohammed Safi Shamsi)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Piper Sandler (PIPR) will no longer release year-end price targets for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) after concluding that the index no longer truly reflects the stock market's performance.\n\nIn a video interview on Yahoo Finance, Piper Sandler co-chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz explained the firm’s reasoning.\n\n“In the last few months, as I was trying to think about raising my target again, I didn't really feel that comfortable being intellectually honest saying that I can have a high conviction view of where the S&P 500 is going to end up,” Kantrowitz said. “Nor did I think it really adds value to our clients who are institutional investors.”\n\nAccording to a note from Piper Sandler, a small group of high-performing stocks, including “Magnificent 7” tech names such as Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA), significantly influence the market's activity.\n\nPiper Sandler found that the top 10 stocks represented 75% of the index’s year-to-date returns. And, as Yahoo Finance’s Josh Schafer observed, AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) was solely responsible for nearly one-third of the S&P 500’s gains as of late June.\n\nKantrowiz maintained the importance of having a bullish or bearish view of the market and reiterated that Piper Sandler continues to have a bullish view for this year. Previously, the firm's year-end price target for the S&P 500 stood at 5,250. On Monday, the benchmark index closed at 5,572.\n\nHowever, Kantrowiz cited how investors view large caps and smaller-cap stocks differently due to their respective performances. While the S&P 500 managed to reach all-time highs in the second quarter of this year, the average stock saw a decline in value.\n\nInstead of focusing on the S&P 500, Kantrowitz told Yahoo Finance that he recommends clients prioritize \"quality at a reasonable price\" by focusing on companies that outpace their peers in terms of earnings growth but aren’t the most expensive.\n\n\"You kind of have to sacrifice a little bit of growth, perhaps, in quality to find names that aren’t egregiously expensive,” he said. \"We’ve got — in the S&P 500 — 50 names that have beaten the index this year, and it’s not just about all AI or all tech.\"\n\nEarlier this year, multiple strategists raised their targets for the S&P 500 due to the record-breaking rally that had continued to pick up steam. Ultimately, strategists are finding it difficult to keep up, and there may be more that take a similar approach to Piper Sandler and pivot away from monitoring the index.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear to date, the S&P 500 is up nearly 17%. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on June 18, 2024, in New York City.

        "content": "Big Tech's Next Milestone Is The $4 Trillion Market Cap\n\nBig Tech is racing towards a milestone that would have seems impossible only a few decades ago, a market capitalization of $4 trillion.\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) are members of the $3 trillion market cap club, with Google-parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) having only surpassed the $2 trillion milestone.\n\nNvidia could win the $4 trillion race.\n\nWith even more powerful chips on the way, the AI boom could be that powerful to drive Nvidia to $4 trillion valuation. For a moment, Nvidia even became the world’s most valuable company on June 18th. But, Nvidia got dethroned quickly due to concerns over the sustainability of its skyrocketing growth. On the other hand, Microsoft and Apple are ahead in terms of market size. Looking at past numbers, Apple was the first the reach the first three of the trillion valuation milestones. Both Apple and Microsoft are as strong as ever, but Nvidia has an incredible momentum on its side. But, just because it enjoys dominating the market does not mean it should not take seriously the threat of AMD or Intel catching up at some point, although Nvidia does have the resources to defend itself and continue to innovate. Perhaps Nvidia’s biggest protection lies in its expansion of revenue sources as it aims to go beyond chips and build an entire AI ecosystem, ensuring it remains in the center of things as opposed to being only one link in the chain.\n\nNvidia’s Promise Of Blackwell\n\nAt the end of June, Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang spoke at the company’s annual general meeting and pitched the upcoming Blackwell chips as not only the most successful product in Nvidia’s history but also in the entire computer history. Huan proudly spoke of reinventing Nvidia, the computer industry, and consequently, the world. The good part is that at the absolute end, Nvidia still does not have a big rival. But only time will show if the AI hype is enough to propel Nvidia to new heights, refuting doubts of concerned investors.\n\nPutting the the economic promise of AI and the fourth Industrial Revolution aside, there is a lot that is still unknown, the market dynamic is shaped with a lot of uncertainty that is out of even Big Tech’s control, all of which would undoubtedly impact their path to a $4 trillion valuation. In addition, there’s the long-term tech battle to think about in a new AI-shaped era that is in the making.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy From the ‘Ultimate’ Buy-and-Hold Portfolio",
        "content": "If you’re looking for stocks to buy and hold, I have answers for you, straight from a portfolio that recently appeared in a June 25 article in The Globe and Mail, Canada’s national newspaper.\n\nFreelance columnist Gordon Pape has been writing about investing for as long as I can remember. He’s one of Canada’s longest-serving personal finance and investing authors. He’s written countless books, investment newsletters, and columns like the recent one in the Globe.\n\nPape launched his Internet Wealth Builder Buy and Hold Portfolio in June 2012. It’s a combination of U.S. and Canadian stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n“I used several criteria to choose the stocks. These included a superior long-term growth profile, industry leadership, a good balance sheet, a history of dividend increases, and relative strength in down markets. The objective is to generate decent cash flow (all the stocks pay dividends), minimize downside potential, and provide slow but steady growth. The target rate of return was originally set at 8 per cent annually.”\n\nSounds pretty good to me.\n\nThe current portfolio consists of nine stocks – five Canadian and four U.S. stocks, although they all are listed on U.S. stock exchanges – one bond ETF and a small amount of cash. As Pape said, they all pay dividends.\n\nHere are three I particularly like.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is the second-largest holding in Pape’s IWB portfolio.\n\nUnitedHealth is the largest health insurer in the U.S. with nearly 16% market share, 600 basis points higher than Elevance Health (NYSE:ELV), formerly known as Anthem. UNH stock has taken it on the chin in 2024, down over 9%.\n\nThe decline is due to a cyberattack in February against Change Healthcare, the company’s claims processing clearinghouse that it acquired for $13 billion in 2022.\n\nIn Q1 2024, the cyberattack cost the company $872 million, with estimates as high as $1.6 billion for the entire year. To make matters worse, it’s facing a possible class action lawsuit because of the attack.\n\nWhile class action lawsuits are common in a litigious America, they are not a good look for a company that possesses significant amounts of sensitive data.\n\nNonetheless, the issue will pass, and UNH is expected to bring in $26 billion in annual adjusted net earnings.\n\nWalmart (WMT) A photo of the Walmart (WMT) logo on the side of a truck.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile I thought about selecting Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Google’s parent, and the third-largest holding in IWB, but Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is the world’s biggest retailer, so I went with it instead, the largest of nine stocks in the portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile some believe Walmart stock is way overvalued and investors should take profits, the reality is that out of the 38 analysts that cover its stock, 32 rated it a “buy,” with a $73 target price, about 8% above where it’s currently trading.\n\nIn May, BofA Securities raised its target for Walmart by $8 to $75, based on the view that the company’s long-term profitability will rise due to several factors, including its digital advertising business.\n\nIn the end, while it might be expensive, Walmart is a quality company that investors are willing to pay more to own, and that’s unlikely to change anytime soon.\n\nBrookfield Corporation (BN) canadian flag over city to represent canadian stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBrookfield Corporation (NYSE:BN) is one of Pape’s more successful bets. The average price paid for the alternative asset investor’s stock was 12.75 CAD ($9.35). Due to 345% cumulative gain, BN accounts for 12.7% of the buy-and-hold portfolio, making it the fourth-largest position.\n\nI’ve been a fan of Brookfield CEO Bruce Flatt for a long time. In February 2018, I recommended investors look at the company, which at the time was called Brookfield Asset Management.\n\nIn December 2022, Brookfield changed its name to Brookfield Corporation and spun off a 25% interest in the asset management business into a publicly traded company that retained the Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) name and ticker. Brookfield Corporation then began trading under the BN ticker, retaining 75% of this asset-light, fee-generating business model. Its investors received 0.25 shares in the new BAM for every share held in the old BAM.\n\nBloomberg reported on July 8 that it was working with the founding family of Grifols SA (NASDAQ:GRFS) on a take-private deal for the beleaguered Spanish pharmaceutical and chemical company.\n\nGrifols shares are down 23% in 2024 due to a short seller report from Gotham City Research that said it manipulated its debt and profit figures to keep its share price artificially inflated. In response to the allegations, it hired an outside CEO and a new CFO.\n\nAs is often the case, Brookfield is an opportunistic investor.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +9.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 8.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.84 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.60 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.61 indicates a change of +13.3% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $70.55 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $291.26 billion and $325.08 billion estimates indicate +13.6% and +11.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL shares have rallied 35.2% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 29.7%. It is benefiting from the robust performance of the Google Services segment, which is mainly driven by Search, YouTube and Android.\r\n\r\nYouTube is playing a vital role in driving Google Services’ growth prospects. The company is continuously expanding YouTube’s capabilities, thereby enhancing user experience.\r\n\r\nPer a 9to5Google report, Alphabet’s division Google rolled out an updated version of YouTube’s \"Erase Song\" tool, allowing content creators to remove copyrighted songs from videos without affecting other audio.\r\n\r\nThe AI-based tool removes the song without affecting the creator's dialogue or other sounds, and can also mute all audio during specific video portions affected by the copyright claim.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is expected to gain solid popularity among content creators on the back of this newly launched feature.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStrong YouTube Efforts to Note\n\nPer a Mordor Intelligence report, the global media streaming market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.9% between 2023 and 2028. Google remains well-positioned to capitalize on this solid growth opportunity on the back of its growing YouTube capabilities.\r\n\r\nRecently, Google introduced new features like Jump Ahead and Shorts Picture-in-Picture for YouTube Premium subscribers. Jump Ahead allows users to skip frequently skipped sections, leveraging AI and viewership data. Shorts now support Picture-in-Picture on Android, allowing users to watch their favorite Shorts while browsing other apps or checking messages.\r\n\r\nGoogle added a Cast menu redesign to the YouTube app. The updated Cast icon now features a floating bottom sheet with rounded corners, allowing users to control volume and voice search, and also provides remote control options for televisions.\r\n\r\nIt also introduced a redesign for YouTube Music on the web. This redesign features a dual-column layout with album information displayed on the left and songs displayed on the right. It also adds a blurred background for a lively experience.\r\n\r\nPartnerships are also playing a key role in expanding YouTube’s adoption rate. Alphabet recently collaborated with Garmin GRMN to expand the reach of YouTube Music to more platforms.\r\n\r\nPer the terms, the YouTube Music app is now available on Garmin IQ Connect smartwatches. The app experience is similar to Wear OS watches, with users able to search their library for music and podcasts and a slick playing page with physical buttons for play, pause and skip.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s partnership with Peloton Interactive PTON to further strengthen its YouTube business remains noteworthy. This partnership marks a significant step for Google to expand its YouTube TV subscriber base, as it requires Peloton All-Access members to have a YouTube TV subscription to watch content while on their machine.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nThe above-mentioned endeavors are expected to boost YouTube’s overall subscribers. In the first quarter of 2024, YouTube surpassed 100 million Music and Premium subscribers globally.

        "title": "Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum",
        "content": "Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL), a global leader in enterprise software and cloud computing solutions, was founded in 1977. The company excels in developing and marketing database software and technology, cloud-engineered systems and enterprise software products, particularly its own brands of database management systems.\n\nOriginally an enterprise software database giant, Oracle has transitioned to the cloud over the past 10 to 15 years and is now poised to tackle the artificial intelligence revolution. As such, the company presents a compelling investment opportunity amid its impressive momentum in AI and cloud businesses.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with ORCL.\n\nDespite tight competition, Oracle has delivered high double-digit growth in both areas recently. As a legacy database provider, its database solutions have become a key competitive advantage against industry peers, strengthening its position in the cloud business. Oracle offers a comprehensive and fast cloud solution for deploying AI, boasting the fastest infrastructure in the industry, backed by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) hardware. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nSource: Oracle Investor Relations\n\nOracle reported its fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 earnings on June 11. Quarterly earnings of $1.63 per share narrowly missed estimates by 1.20%. Revenue of $14.29 billion also missed expectations by 1.90%. Despite these misses, the stock price surged due to growth in the remaining performance obligation, which has remained resilient despite the deceleration in the company's cloud infrastructure growth rate.\n\nSignificant deals with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, OpenAI and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) around Oracle Cloud Infrastructure also contributed to this positive sentiment. Oracle's earnings growth was complemented by strong margins, with the adjusted operating margin and adjusted Ebitda margin expanding to 44% and 55%, respectively, highlighting the scalability of OCI across its operations. I believe Oracle can sustain this exceptional growth rate as it continues to build larger data centers. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nYear to date, Oracle has outperformed the S&P 500 by over 20%, with the stock yielding more than 35% compared to the S&P 500's 17% increase.\n\nThe company's expanded partnership with Microsoft and other cloud computing providers is expected to enhance the expansion and reach of its leading database management services. Given its smaller scale compared to Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, Oracle must capitalize on multi-cloud adoption opportunities to justify its premium valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrategic moves\n\nOracle's transformation is certainly pushing the boundaries of what the company can achieve, with the primary growth constraint being the speed at which it can establish new data centers. Despite missing both top and bottom-line estimates in the fourth quarter, the stock surged over 13% post-earnings release.\n\nThis surge was driven by the impressive growth in Oracle's RPO, which grew 44% year over year to an astounding $98 billion and increased by $18 billion from the third quarter. Management expects 39% of this amount, or about $38.20 billion, to materialize in the next 12 months. The significant contracts signed in the third and fourth quarter, driven by the unrelenting AI demand, marked the largest sales quarters in Oracle's history. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nSource: Oracle's Investor Relations\n\nThroughout the year, the company secured pivotal deals with industry giants OpenAI, Google and Microsoft. These contracts are crucial as they involve leading names in the AI space that are poised to dominate in the coming years. OpenAI, the entity behind the AI revolution with ChatGPT, signed on to run deep learning and AI workloads on the Oracle OCI. Oracle reported that a total of 30 AI contracts were signed in the fourth quarter, valued at over $12 billion. For these projects, the company will utilize cutting-edge Nvidia chips, interconnect network solutions and liquid cooling to train neural networks. Management also announced the construction of four large data centers for this initiative, potentially incorporating Nvidia's new Blackwell GPUs.\n\nAdditionally, Oracle entered a partnership with Google to offer OCI database services through Google Cloud, planning to build 12 OCI data centers within Google Cloud. The company also advanced its collaboration with Microsoft, with 11 of the planned 23 OCI data centers within Microsoft Azure already operational. During the earnings call, there were hints of a potential future partnership with Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS. With the global shift towards multi-cloud adoption, a deal with AWS would not be surprising. These strategic moves demonstrate Oracle's strong positioning to capitalize on the AI boom through its data centers.\n\nFlexibility and scalability in cloud services\n\nOracle is also offering private OCI for enterprises looking to leverage its cloud services within their own data centers. As outlined in the earnings call, customers will not pay for hardware, but only for consumption costs, with the ability to scale services as needed for training large language models and neural networks. This flexibility is expected to drive scalable revenue generation for Oracle. Its multi-cloud integration and adaptable cloud services position it as a versatile and comprehensive solution for various enterprise needs.\n\nFurther, its Gen2 AI Cloud Infrastructure currently faces demand that far exceeds supply. The company's legacy as a database provider gives it a competitive edge, allowing it to leverage its position in the cloud business. Oracle's capital expenditure guidance for 2024, ranging between $7 billion and $7.50 billion, reflects the increasing demand for Oracle Cloud. This includes growing demand in national security and European Union sovereign regions. While Oracle's infrastructure as a service is in growth mode, its profitable legacy platform supports its overall profitability, enabling competitive pricing for its cloud offerings. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nSource: Statista\n\nWith only a 2% market share in the cloud market, Oracle has substantial room to grow and capture share from competitors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google, the top three players in the field. Recent quarters have seen the company growing its cloud revenue at a faster pace than its main competitors, indicating a strong growth trajectory.\n\nBusiness performance and outlook\n\nDespite the quarterly earnings misses, Oracle's standout performer was the cloud infrastructure segment, which saw revenue jump 42% year over year. The Cloud Application segment also registered growth, reaching $3.30 billion, a 10% increase. Non-GAAP operating margins showed significant strength, increasing 47%.\n\nFor the full year, Oracle reported total revenue of $53 billion, a 6% increase, with non-GAAP operating margins at 44%. It generated $5.56 in non-GAAP earnings per share. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nSource: Oracle's Investor Relations\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, I anticipate exceptional top-line growth as Oracle continues to build out regional AI factories and expand embedded OCI services in Azure data centers. The company has carved out a niche with its automated OCI services, which are poised to grow as quickly as data centers can be constructed. Management projects strong sequential growth for the year as OCI capacity scales to meet demand, with cloud infrastructure services expected to increase 50%. They also reiterated their fiscal 2026 revenue goal of $65 billion, though they now believe this target may be conservative given the accelerated growth momentum seen in 2024. This target seems achievable given the rapid growth across OCI infrastructure and services.\n\nMargin analysis\n\nThere has been some tightening on the margin side due to significant investments to meet the surging demand for Oracle's second generation AI Cloud infrastructure. I expect margins to improve as the company works through its backlog of orders. As the top-line growth continues, I foresee margins scaling and expanding due to the company's automated, modular data center capacity. Additionally, given the recent data breach by one of Oracle's cloud database competitors, there may be opportunities to capture additional market share that were previously unavailable.\n\nCapital expenditures and free cash flow\n\nA key takeaway from the fourth-quarter earnings report was the management's update on capital expenditure spending. For the year, capital expenditures amounted to nearly $6.90 billion. During the earnings call, management stated they expect capex spending to double in fiscal 2025, reaching nearly $14 billion, significantly higher than the earlier prediction of $10 billion.\n\nWhile this figure is substantial, Oracle's cash flow statement shows it has become a free cash flow-generating machine. In 2024, Oracle generated $11.80 billion in free cash flow, a 39% growth. Although FCF growth slowed compared to 2023's 68%, the absolute magnitude of the cash flows should alleviate concerns about the company's capital expenditure.\n\nInvestors should keep an eye on capex spending, but Oracle's ability to generate significant free cash flows, combined with its focus on major AI players as customers, mitigates some of the concerns surrounding the high figure.\n\nValuation analysis\n\nOracle currently trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of about 22, aligning with some peers such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) (22.30) and Alphabet (22.10), but more attractively priced compared to others like Microsoft (33) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) (28.40).\n\nHistorically, Oracle has traded at lower multiples, but the recent surge in positive developments, particularly partnerships with AI giants like OpenAI, Alphabet and Microsoft, has justified a higher multiple. These strategic partnerships have significantly boosted the company's growth potential, particularly in the AI and cloud infrastructure space. Given the company's trajectory, I believe a forward earnings multiple of 22 is appropriate. The company has demonstrated robust earnings per share growth, recording an 8.60% increase, which is close to its fiscal 2026 target of over 10%.\n\nWith a forward PEG ratio of approximately 1.80 and considering management's earnings growth target of 10% by 2026, we can adjust our valuation assumptions accordingly. This adjustment yields an adjusted PEG ratio of around 2. If Oracle achieves this growth target in 2025, the projected EPS would be around $6, aligning closely with the analyst consensus of $6.30. Using a forward price-earnings ratio of 22, this would result in a price target of $135, roughly matching the current trading levels and implying a potential downside of about 5%.\n\nTo further validate the valuation derived from the price-earnings multiple approach, a discounted cash flow analysis can be employed. Using a discount rate of 11% and aligning with management's 10% growth estimate through 2026, the DCF valuation also does not provide a sufficient margin of safety to recommend the stock at current levels. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nWhile Oracle's growth is commendable, particularly in cloud infrastructure and AI, it faces stiff competition from companies like Microsoft, whose Azure and intelligent cloud offerings are better positioned. Microsoft's superior growth in these areas highlights the competitive challenges the company must navigate. Given that Oracle's stock has already surged over 15% following its impressive earnings release and is up over 35% year to date, the current valuation reflects much of the positive developments.\n\nGiven the little to no upside potential at the current price levels, I am maintaining my hold rating on Oracle. The stock has already incorporated significant gains, and while its partnerships and growth in AI and cloud infrastructure are promising, the current valuation does not present a compelling entry point for new investors.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nOracle stands at the forefront of the AI and cloud computing revolution, leveraging its legacy as a database provider to drive growth in these burgeoning sectors. The company's strategic partnerships with key players in the AI space, coupled with its robust financial performance and free cash flow generation, position it well for future expansion.\n\nHowever, given the current valuation levels, which already account for much of the anticipated growth, the stock appears fairly priced with limited immediate upside potential. Thus, while Oracle's long-term outlook remains strong, I advise investors to watch for more attractive entry points in the future.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Companies Paid Their Investors $16 Billion More in Dividends Last Quarter. These 2 Magnificent Stocks Helped Drive the Increase.",
        "content": "Companies have been increasingly generous in distributing a portion of their profits to shareholders over the past year. U.S. companies paid a net $16 billion more in dividends during the second quarter, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That was slightly more than the net increase in the first quarter and about four times higher than in the prior-year period.\n\nMany companies contributed to the increase by initiating a dividend or raising their payout. However, two companies stood out as the biggest drivers of the boost in dividend payments last quarter: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Here's a closer look at these two magnificent dividend stocks.\n\nA monster dividend\n\nTech titan and \"Magnificent Seven\" member Alphabet initiated a regular quarterly dividend in late April. It made its first payment of $0.20 per share in mid-June.\n\nAlphabet's initial dividend seems small relative to its stock price (it currently has a 0.4% dividend yield, well below the S&P 500's 1.3% yield). However, it's massive on an absolute basis. It will cost the company about $10 billion per year. That made it the most meaningful contributor to the second quarter's increase in dividend payments.\n\nThe technology giant can easily afford that monster payment. The company generated $16.8 billion in free cash flow during the first quarter alone. It also had $108 billion of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet against a mere $13.2 billion of long-term debt. That strong financial position enabled the company to add a whopping $70 billion to its share repurchase program.\n\nAlphabet's initial dividend is likely only the starting point. Given the company's financial strength and earnings growth (more than 50% in the first quarter), it should be able to steadily increase its dividend payment in the future.\n\nAnother magnificent dividend\n\nAlphabet's dividend initiation followed in the footsteps of fellow Magnificent Seven member Meta Platforms, which initiated a dividend during the first quarter. The social media giant is paying $0.50 per share each quarter.\n\nLike Alphabet, Meta Platforms' dividend might seem small at first glance, given its low 0.4% dividend yield. However, its total payments will tally a massive $4.4 billion per year. That's the second-highest absolute dividend increase this year, more than double the newly minted dividends of Salesforce ($1.5 billion) and Booking Holdings ($1.2 billion). Add that trio to Alphabet's recently initiated payment, and 53% of this year's net increase in dividends has come from those four new dividend stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms can also easily afford to pay its mammoth dividend. The company generated $12.5 billion in free cash flow during the first quarter and had $58.1 billion of cash, equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet. The company's robust financial position is giving it the flexibility to invest heavily in AI while also returning generous amounts of cash to shareholders through its recently initiated dividend and share repurchase program (Meta bought back $14.6 billion in shares during the first quarter while paying about $1.3 billion in dividends).\n\nThe company is in an excellent position to increase its dividend in the future. In addition to its strong financial profile, Meta's earnings are growing briskly (over 110% increase in the first quarter). The company's heavy investment in AI could drive robust future growth.\n\nCompanies are doling out more dividends\n\nCompanies in the S&P 500 are on track to pay 6% more in dividends this year. That's an acceleration from last year's increase (5.2%), thanks in part to the recently initiated dividends from Magnificent Seven members Meta Platforms and Alphabet.\n\nThat upward trend in dividend payments appears likely to continue. Many companies, especially large technology companies, are flush with cash and briskly growing their free cash flow. That puts them in an excellent position to continue lining their investors' pockets with higher dividend payments. So, if you're looking to make some extra money, investing in dividend stocks could be your ticket to a steadily rising passive income stream.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Amazon: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) hit an all-time high this week after rising 53% over the last 12 months. The company has rallied Wall Street with multiple quarters of stellar financial growth and an expanding role in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmazon Web Services' (AWS) dominance in the cloud industry grants the company a promising position in AI, as more and more businesses turn to such platforms for their AI needs. Meanwhile, the company has announced a venture into chip design. Amazon has an exciting outlook in AI and would likely make an asset to any portfolio over the long term. However, its stock growth over the last year hasn't exactly matched its earnings growth, meaning its shares are slightly overpriced for now. AMZN PE Ratio Chart\n\nThis table shows Amazon has the highest price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow ratios out of some of the most prominent names in AI software. The figures suggest Amazon is currently one of the worst-valued stocks among its peers.\n\nHowever, two companies stand out as bargain buys in the space, indicating they could be worth considering over Amazon: Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). These tech giants are investing heavily in AI and could see significant gains as the industry develops.\n\nSo, forget Amazon and consider buying these two artificial intelligence stocks now.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is a no-brainer at its current price point. The company has delivered significant earnings and stock growth over the last year, yet is trading at a bargain price compared to its peers. Meanwhile, Alphabet has the brand power, tech, and cash reserves to go far in AI.\n\nThe company's Google Cloud platform holds an 11% market share in cloud computing, compared to AWS' 31%. It's the third-largest cloud company after Amazon and Microsoft. However, it's outpacing both in growth.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Google Cloud revenue jumped 28% year over year. Comparatively, the same period saw AWS sales rise by 17% and Microsoft Azure's revenue increase by 21%.\n\nAlphabet is investing billions in AI and is in a solid position to build a lucrative AI ecosystem around its products. As the home of potent brands like Android, YouTube, and the many services under Google, Alphabet has countless opportunities to boost its business with AI. The company has the potential to offer more efficient digital advertising, add generative features to its smartphone operating system, better track viewing trends on YouTube, and create a Google Search experience closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues GOOGL Chart\n\nMoreover, this chart shows Alphabet is a thoroughly reliable stock. Over the last five years, it has beaten Amazon in stock and free cash flow growth. Meanwhile, it has delivered a similar rise in operating income. In addition to its far better-valued share price, Alphabet is a screaming buy right now and a better AI stock than Amazon.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple's stock has risen 14% since Jan. 1. The figure is considerably lower than its peers, with Amazon's and Alphabet's stocks rising more than 30% during that time. Apple missed out on the initial boom in AI, preferring to take a more gradual approach to the market. However, recent developments suggest it could come back strong in the coming years.\n\nBloomberg reported on Jul. 2 that Apple is poised to get an observer role on ChatGPT developer OpenAI's board. The move follows an announcement at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference in June that revealed its smart assistant Siri will receive a major AI overhaul, making it more intuitive and able to answer hundreds of new questions. Siri will now pass off certain questions to ChatGPT as part of the update, making the OpenAI platform available to users through its iPhones, iPads, or Macs.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, \"The board observer role will put Apple on par with Microsoft Corp., OpenAI's biggest backer, and its main AI technology provider.\" Apple has been in steep competition with Microsoft for years, with both leaders in consumer tech and responsible for the two most used computer operating systems. As a result, Apple's seat at OpenAI's table could bring its AI technology more in line with its rival and boost its entire position in the industry. AAPL Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nThis table shows that Apple is potentially better financially equipped than Amazon or Microsoft to expand in AI. The company is a cash cow, with far more free cash flow and operating income over the last five years. So, despite its slower approach to AI, I wouldn't be against it carving out a lucrative position in the sector over the long term.\n\nAlongside its better-valued stock price, Apple is worth considering over Amazon stock this July.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Is Now the Best-Performing Stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average In 2024. Is It a Buy Around Its All-Time High?",
        "content": "Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average in late February -- giving the traditionally stodgy, income-oriented index more exposure to growth.\n\nAmazon has continued its torrid run since 2023. As of June 27, it is the best-performing stock in the index.\n\nHere's why Amazon continues to climb higher and whether the growth stock is worth buying around its all-time high. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon is gushing cash\n\nBefore changing its name to Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Google was named after its flagship search engine. But YouTube is arguably Alphabet's crown jewel. Facebook was named after its flagship social media app, but then changed its name to Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Instagram is arguably more valuable than Facebook today. Similarly, Amazon is named after its only retail outlet, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) is where much of the value lies.\n\nAWS is the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure. According to HG Insights 2023 Infrastructure as a Service Market Report, AWS had a 50.1% market share among the top 10 cloud providers and the highest year-over-year customer count growth at 31%. AWS has been tapping into start-ups, with 86% of AWS customers spending less than $1,000 a month on AWS services -- according to HG Insights.\n\nThe impact of AWS on the broader business is undeniable. Here's a look at Amazon's trailing-12-month (TTM) results as of the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same periods over the last five years.\n\nMetric Q1 2020 TTM Q1 2021 TTM Q1 2022 TTM Q1 2023 TTM Q1 2024 TTM North America revenue $181.09 billion $254.52 billion $284.71 billion $323.52 billion $362.29 billion North America operating income $6.06 billion $10.79 billion $2.25 billion ($381 million) $18.96 billion International revenue $77.64 billion $115.96 billion $125.9 billion $118.37 billion $134.01 billion International operating income ($2 billion) $2.37 billion ($3.46 billion) ($7.71 billion) $903 million AWS revenue $37.55 billion $48.65 billion $67.14 billion $83 billion $94.44 billion AWS operating income $10.05 billion $14.62 billion $20.89 billion $21.45 billion $28.93 billion\n\nData source: Amazon.\n\nNotice the inconsistent operating income from Amazon's North America and international segments, as well as the somewhat sluggish top-line growth. Meanwhile, AWS has been a juggernaut, with TTM operating income increasing nearly threefold in just five years.\n\nThe most impressive metric in this table is that AWS operating income has grown faster than AWS revenue, suggesting that margins are improving. Not long ago, one of the biggest red flags for Amazon's investment thesis was that AWS couldn't keep up its margins in the face of mounting competition. But the results tell a different story and are likely a reason why the stock has been crushing the market as of late.\n\nStory continues AMZN Chart\n\nA higher-quality business\n\nAmazon is notorious for reinvesting profits back into the company. So using net income-based metrics like the price-to-earnings ratio can be unhelpful. Traditionally, Amazon's go-to metric was its price-to-sales ratio, which is the value of a company compared to its revenue. In the following chart, you'll notice that Amazon's P/S ratio is higher than historical levels -- suggesting the stock is more expensive. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe P/S ratio can be useful when dealing with a consistent business over a period of time. But the issue with using it to evaluate Amazon is that the company is fundamentally different today than it was even two to three years ago because of the growth of AWS. That's why I think the best way to value Amazon is by looking at its P/S ratio within the context of its operating income and operating margin. AMZN Cash from Operations (TTM) Chart\n\nThis chart is perhaps the simplest way to visualize Amazon's success. Amazon's TTM operating income is nearly $100 billion, and its operating margin is at a 10-year high thanks to AWS and a rebound in its North America and international segments.\n\nPaying a 3.53 P/S ratio for a high-growth, low-margin business is one thing. But that same ratio for a company growing its top line and expanding margins is entirely different.\n\nThe biggest bull case for Amazon is that it is within striking distance of its historical P/S ratio, but the quality of the business is vastly improved, and it is on a path toward consistent profitability. After all, analyst consensus estimates call for $4.55 in 2024 earnings per share (EPS) and $5.78 in 2025 EPS -- giving Amazon a 34.1 P/E based on 2025 estimated earnings. That's not a sky-high valuation -- especially when considering the stock is up 130% in 18 months.\n\nAmazon is stretched thin but is still a good buy\n\nAmazon is at the top of its game, but its stock chart reflects that. Warren Buffett once said, \"You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.\" In other words, consensus positivity toward a company usually results in an expensive stock price, just as an out-of-favor stock can be quite cheap.\n\nLess than two years ago, Amazon was under immense pressure due to slowing growth and recession fears. It was the opposite of a cheery consensus. Today, Amazon is, once again, a darling. But the long-term investment thesis has also gotten stronger as AWS continues to be a high-margin growth engine that can fuel the company's other exploits.\n\nAll told, Amazon is a decent buy, but it is no longer the no-brainer buy it was before. It still must grow into its valuation and prove its higher margins aren't a one-off. If growth slows, expect Amazon to be under pressure.\n\nThe higher a stock runs up in the short term, the more its valuation gets stretched. But over the long term, Amazon certainly has the trajectory needed to compound earnings and benefit patient investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Strong cash flows reflect financial stability, allowing companies to pay down debt, pursue growth opportunities, and shell out dividend payments.\n\nThese companies are also better equipped to weather downturns, providing another beneficial advantage for investors from a long-term standpoint.\n\nAnd for those seeking cash-generating machines, three mega-cap giants – Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, and Alphabet GOOGL – all fit the criteria nicely. Let’s take a closer look at how each currently stacks up.\n\nApple Shares Bounce Back\n\nApple shares have jumped back into favor over the last month after a notably slow start to 2024, gaining 15% and widely outperforming relative to the S&P 500. Favorable news concerning its China iPhone shipments has aided performance, with recent commentary surrounding AI also providing tailwinds. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company has long been a cash-generating machine, providing many benefits over the years, including higher dividend payouts. In fact, Apple raised its quarterly payout in its latest quarterly release, reflecting the 12th consecutive year of higher payouts.\n\nShares yield a modest 0.5% annually, though the company’s 4.9% five-year annualized dividend growth helps bridge the gap. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts have positively revised their earnings expectations for the mega-cap giant, landing it into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Though the revisions haven’t been robust, it’s undoubtedly a bullish development for the stock and provides the fuel needed to continue outperformance. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicrosoft Posts Strong Cloud Results\n\nMicrosoft shares have helped lead the market’s charge all year long, up nearly 25% and seeing regular positivity following quarterly results. Analysts have revised their earnings expectations for its current fiscal year consistently over the last year, with the $11.77 per share expected up roughly 9% over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRecent cloud strength has analysts optimistic, with the company expected to benefit nicely from AI. Cloud revenue popped 23% year-over-year throughout its latest period, reflecting a reacceleration and positively shocking investors.\n\nMany had feared a cloud slowdown, which was present for a few periods, but the recent results overall paint positivity moving forward. Like AAPL, strong cash flows have aided its shareholder-friendly nature, with Microsoft sporting a 10% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.\n\nAlphabet Stays in Growth Mode\n\nAlphabet shares have experienced positivity all throughout 2024, up nearly 40%. Like MSFT, the revisions trend for its current fiscal year has been notably positive, with the $7.60 per share expected climbing 14% over the last year.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company positively shocked investors when it announced the initiation of a quarterly dividend back in April. Alphabet’s cash-generating nature allows for future dividend growth, with the company posting $16.8 billion in free cash flow throughout its latest period.\n\nAnd to little surprise, the mega-cap giant remains firmly in growth mode, as consensus expectations suggest a 31% pop in earnings on 14% higher sales in FY24. Growth spills over to FY25, with earnings and revenue forecasted to climb 13% and 12%, respectively. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nCompanies boasting strong cash-generating abilities can be great investments, as they have plenty of cash to fuel growth, pay out dividends, and easily wipe out debt. And as mentioned above, these companies are better equipped to handle an economic downturn, undeniably a positive.\n\nFor those seeking cash-generators, all three companies above – Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, and Alphabet GOOGL – fit the criteria nicely.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Stocks are at record highs. Investors keep playing the hits.",
        "content": "Stocks are trading at record highs, and the market's main characters haven't changed.\n\nYahoo Finance's data whiz Jared Blikre flagged the stocks making new intraday record highs alongside the index on Friday. The names are a who's who of market leaders with only one exception — Nvidia stock (NVDA) was down after receiving a downgrade from New Street Research.\n\nApple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Costco (COST), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Walmart (WMT), on the other hand, all saw their stocks trade at intraday records on Friday.\n\nInvestors can maybe point to the soft jobs report and the prospect of lower interest rates as a catalyst for the move. At least for a chunk of these winners.\n\nTech was the biggest winner of low-interest-rate environments over the last decade, and the so-called hyperscalers in the AI race — Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet among them — are set to be the arms dealers should another speculative investment boom break out.\n\nBut on Wall Street, it appears that spending too much time in this market teasing out the fundamental particularities of why the same group of market leaders continues to lead the market is no longer a worthwhile exercise.\n\nTo wit: Piper Sandler's chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz on Wednesday dropped coverage of the S&P 500, writing that, \"Talking about the S&P 500 to communicate investment insights to institutional investors has become an exercise in futility.\"\n\nThe 10 biggest stocks in the index account for almost 40% of the index's market cap, Kantrowitz noted. And both the index's returns and earnings growth are being driven by this small handful of companies.\n\nRather than reflecting a broad swath of the corporate world's fortunes, then, the so-called benchmark stock index has become captive to the AI trade. For some, this is not a flaw of the index, but a feature, as argued by strategists at the BlackRock Investment Institute last week.\n\nSure, the S&P 500 may seem to tip out of balance, reflecting the fortunes of a privileged few over the more measured progress (or struggles) of the quieter majority. But the concept of an index is that investors can capture the market return in whatever form that takes.\n\nThis dynamic often benefits the DIY investor class looking for cheap exposure to \"the market,\" but it is a thorn in the side of portfolio managers who charge institutions more for their services as they seek to best the returns available to the masses.\n\nSaid another way, what institutional investors seek are returns — preferably returns that beat the market, of course — but most importantly, returns that do not come in whatever form the market takes. For big-money investors, safety is often paramount. And AI hype minting new multi-trillion dollar winners each week doesn't exactly scream safe by this measure.\n\nStory continues\n\nBack in 2020, before the pandemic turned markets upside down, we talked to Tom Lee at Fundstrat who saw the rally in Tesla (TSLA) stock that year as a sign of investors chasing their benchmark. Tesla stock, at the time, was responsible for a large chunk of the gains in the Russell 1000 Growth index (VONG), an index favored as the benchmark by many of Fundstrat's clients at the time.\n\nIn an effort to make up this gap, clients had a simple card to play: buy Tesla.\n\nFriday's market action — and much of what has been seen in stocks since May — seems reminiscent.\n\nBecause if the benchmark index is no longer a useful benchmark, a portfolio manager has a (seemingly) simple choice to make: either buy more of the stocks leading your benchmark, or find another way to explain your performance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- The S&P 500 closed at record highs Friday on bets that Federal Reserve rate rate cuts may soon be on the horizon after the June monthly jobs report pointing to cooling in the labor market.\n\nAt 15:43 ET (19:53 GMT), the S&P 500 gained 0.5% to a record high of 5,566.75 , the NASDAQ Composite climbed 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%, or 68 points.\n\nTreasury yields nosedive after payrolls point to cooling labor market\n\nTreasury yields came under pressure after the monthly jobs report for June showed the economy added 206,000 jobs last month, down from 218,000 in May, but the solid headline payrolls number was accompanied by \"sizeable downward revisions,\" Macquarie said, as jobs gains for the May and April were revised lower. Adding to signs of cooling labor market the the unemployment rate rose to 4.1%, from 4.0% in May, average hourly wage growth slowed, strengthening the case for a September rate cut.\n\n\"While for now our base case for a first cut remains December, it has become increasingly likely that one may occur earlier than this, with a reduction at the September meeting a strong possibility,\" Macquarie added.\n\nTraders now see a 70% of a rate cut in September, down from 60% in the prior week, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Too.\n\nThis cooling in the jobs market through June also comes after a series of weaker-than-expected labor market readings this week.\n\nMeta hits all time highs as tech adds to gians; Nvidia stumbles on downgrade, Tesla in China win\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) led the rise in big tech as the social media company soared more than 4% to hit record highs earlier in the day, with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also higher.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), down 2%, failed to partake in the broader market rally after New Street Research downgraded the stock to hold from buy, citing concerns about valuations.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock added 2% on reports that several state-owned firms in China's financial hub of Shanghai have recently purchased the EV manufacturer's best-selling Model Y as service cars after Tesla cars reportedly were added to the list Chinese local government purchase list.\n\nMacy's in fresh deal fever; Chinese EV stocks hit by new EU tarrifs\n\nMacy’s (NYSE:M) stock rose over 9% after the Wall Street Journal reported that Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management have raised their bid to buy the department store chain for about $6.9 billion.\n\nChinese EV stocks including Li Auto Inc (NASDAQ:LI), Nio Inc Class A ADR (NYSE:NIO) and Xpeng Inc (NYSE:XPEV) were sharplly lower after the European Union proposed increased tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China commended on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrypto stocks recover ground as Bitcoin pares some losses amid Mt. Gox supply wave fears\n\nCryptocurrency stocks including MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) ended the day off their lowest level after Bitcoin eased losses following a dip below $54,000 even as Mt. Gox exchange, which declared bankruptcy in 2014 after falling victim to a heist that saw it lose 950,000 bitcoin, said it had started making payments in both bitcoin and bitcoin cash to creditors. Many are worried that creditors will sell their bitcoin -- now valued at much than it was in 2014, given BTC's astronomical rise since then -- and force prices lower.\n\n(Peter Nurse, Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTD's chief compliance officer departs amid US anti-money laundering probe\n\nWorld stocks rise, US yields dip amid jobs data, UK labor landslide\n\nView comments",

With this new upgrade, a “Locked” option appears directly next to the Favorites, Archive and Trash options in the Google Photos app for much faster access.\r\n\r\nAlphabet also upgraded Google Keep on Android tablets and foldables, which now supports multi-accounts when two instances of the app are open. This allows users to view two notes simultaneously on the left and right sides of the screen.\r\n\r\nIt also introduced a “Lookup” reverse number shortcut feature on the Google Phone app on Pixel devices, further bolstering its Android app offerings.\r\n\r\nThese efforts are expected to drive the performance of the Google Services segment, which, in turn, will likely contribute to the overall financial performance of the company in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $291.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.6%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.60 per share, indicating a 31.03% rise from the year-ago figure.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL shares have rallied 33.2% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 28.7%. The company is continuously benefiting from its growing generative AI capabilities to enhance user experience.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s division Google recently introduced a Gemini-powered summarize feature in Gmail for Android.\r\n\r\nThis generative-AI-backed feature will be useful in summarizing long newsletters in Gmail. Users can also recap conversations in Gmail with the “Summarize this email” option.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is expected to gain solid traction among Android users using Google Workspace on the back of this new feature.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowing Generative AI Efforts Aid Prospects\n\nIn addition to the latest summarize feature, Google launched Gemma 2, a lightweight open model available in 9B and 27B parameter sizes, aiming to accelerate AI deployment and innovations across various enterprises.\r\n\r\nAlphabet rolled out its generative AI-powered note-taking app, NotebookLM, which was previously available only in the United States, to Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, the U.K., and 208 more countries and territories.\r\n\r\nNotebookLM, powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro language model, aids in document understanding and reasoning. It generates summaries and suggests follow-up questions, focusing on the content of the documents.\r\n\r\nGoogle also rolled out YouTube Music Gemini Extension, which enables users to search for music and play radio, among others, with the help of an AI chatbot experience.\r\n\r\nIt also enhanced Android Studio's bot with Gemini Pro, allowing developers to ask coding-related questions and seamlessly integrate generative AI features into their apps.\r\n\r\nThese efforts will enable Alphabet to capitalize on the solid growth opportunities present in the generative AI market, which, per a Statista report, is expected to hit $36.06 billion in 2024 and reach $356.10 by 2030, witnessing a CAGR of 46.5% between 2024 and 2030.\r\n\r\nAlphabet currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nCompetitive Advantage in the Generative AI Space\n\nGrowing generative AI capabilities boost Alphabet’s competitive position against its peers like Microsoft MSFT, Adobe ADBE and Amazon AMZN, which are also making concerted efforts to strengthen their foothold in the generative AI space.\r\n\r\nGOOGL shares have outperformed MSFT and AMZN’s return of 23% and 30%, respectively, in the year-to-date period. ADBE shares have lost 4.4% in the same time frame.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s move to enhance its generative AI capabilities by integrating GPT-4 into Bing and Edge, providing a ChatGPT-like user experience, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Adobe is riding on the success of its family of creative, generative AI models, Firefly. It recently integrated Firefly-powered Generative Fill, Remove Background, Erase and Crop features into Acrobat. These features are designed to allow customers to edit images directly in PDFs.\r\n\r\nAmazon, on the other hand, is benefiting from the solid adoption of Amazon Bedrock, which offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nAlphabet’s strengthening generative AI capabilities, coupled with its strong competitive position, are acting as key drivers of its long-term growth prospects.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the company’s robust cloud division, growing momentum across Google’s mobile search, and increasing demand for its Android, Search and YouTube offerings are other positives.\r\n\r\nThese factors are expected to continue driving the overall financial performance of the company in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $291.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.6%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.60 per share, indicating a 31.03% rise from the year-ago figure.

        "content": "The Japanese stock market has been surging this year, with the Nikkei 225 index up more than 22%. These are gains comparable to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100. Unlike the Nasdaq 100 or even the S&P 500, the Japanese market still seems incredibly underpriced.\n\nIndeed, Japan’s economy has been in a tough place for such an extended period. But now that it’s making new highs again after decades of stumbling en route to recovery, I view the market as very compelling for value investors seeking underappreciated growth and international diversification.\n\nUndoubtedly, 2024 marks a historic year for the Nikkei 225. Now that it’s eyeing higher highs, thanks to strength in a broad range of names, perhaps it’s time to give some names a look.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese three Japanese stocks still look to be on sale, even after their strong year-to-date rallies. Further, they could have more gas in the tank to surge even higher in the second half.\n\nRyohin Keikaku (RYKKY) A close-up shot of a woman walking down the street with several paper shopping bags. retail stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLet’s start the list with a stock you’ve probably never heard of but may have done business with. Ryohin Keikaku (OTCMKTS:RYKKY) is the firm behind Japanese retailer Muji. The store sells minimalist (and sometimes innovative) consumer products that function quite well. Indeed, the Japanese aesthetic is perhaps the biggest draw to Muji’s international stores.\n\nShares of RYKKY have been hurting in recent years but have more recently begun to sustain a recovery, now up 65% in the past year alone. Indeed, Muji sells discretionary goods, ranging from clothing to diffusers and even furnishings. This makes it vulnerable to shifts in consumer spending. Amid inflation, the consumer has undoubtedly felt enough of a pinch to cut back on various goods.\n\nAs Ryojin Keikaku continues expanding internationally (most notably to Europe) while bolstering its digital presence, the company seems positioned to boom as global consumer spending recovers.\n\nSony (SONY) Sony logo on the side of a building at its offices in Silicon Valley.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSony (NYSE:SONY) is a better-known Japanese firm that is behind popular branded electronics (think flatscreen televisions) and entertainment offerings.\n\nOver the past two and a half years, SONY stock has been a roller coaster. Still down around 33% from its all-time high, shares of the behemoth trade at with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 17.6, making it an intriguing value play.\n\nIt’s rare to get such a mix of entertainment (gadgets, music, film, and video games) from one stock. As a diversified behemoth with a massive library of assets, Sony should be that one stock to put on your watchlist if you could only buy one Japanese stock—also, the name trades on the New York Stock Exchange, making it an easy purchase for U.S. investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoving ahead, Sony Pictures may pull the trigger on a major media acquisition. Whether it’s Paramount (NASDAQ:PARA) or rival, though, remains to be seen.\n\nSoftbank (SFTBY) Softbank (SFTBY) logo on a corporate building during the day time\n\nSource: Ned Snowman / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of diversified Japanese giants, we have Softbank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY), a software juggernaut that has major investments in several technological innovators. Lately, Softbank has leaned more heavily towards artificial intelligence investments. The new AI focus has garnered much enthusiasm, with shares up more 51% in 2024.\n\nMost recently, Softbank announced its Vision Fund 2 will invest $10 million to $20 million in Perplexity AI, a U.S. AI search firm that hopes to rival Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and its Google Search product.\n\nIndeed, it’s a rather small bet in a firm valued at around $3 billion, but one that gives the Japanese giant skin in the game of a credible AI-leveraging industry disruptor. I’m a big fan of the Perplexity investment and think Softbank could easily up its stake if the AI search firm can make meaningful strides over Google.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held a LONG position in GOOG.

        "title": "2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett took a cue from a classic Western film last year when he expanded on the idea of the FAANG stocks, dubbing his new set of the most important companies on Wall Street the \"Magnificent Seven.\" These commanding megacaps are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAll of them remain dominant forces in today's market -- other than Tesla, which is struggling with slowing EV sales. Two of them in particular look like top-tier buys preparing to crush the market right now: Alphabet and Meta Platforms.\n\nGenerative AI is a new tool for each company\n\nWhile both Alphabet and Meta are involved in artificial intelligence (AI), their businesses are far more diverse than that. AI may grab headlines, but the bigger business for both companies is the advertisements they serve up along with the content and search results their users are after.\n\nIn Q1, 77% of Alphabet's revenue came from advertising-related sources. For Meta, an incredible 98% came from ad revenue. This makes the advertising market a key factor in both stocks' investment cases.\n\nFurthermore, each is developing AI technologies to stay at the top of their game. In both cases, that means using generative AI models they have developed in-house to aid advertisers. For example, advertisers on Meta can use its tools to create multiple iterations of the same ad nearly instantly, which allows them to tailor their ads to their viewers. Alphabet offers tools that help advertisers quickly create campaigns that meet all of its internal guidelines. These examples show how each company is trying to stay ahead of its rivals by integrating new AI technologies as quickly as possible.\n\nThese innovations may (or may not) bring any new revenue, as the AI upgrades are essentially required for them to stay at the top of their respective industries. However, each company is doing so well right now that new revenue from new technologies isn't necessarily required for them to excel.\n\nGrowth for each business is strong\n\nIn Q1, Alphabet's ad revenue rose 13% to $61.7 billion. In particular, YouTube excelled, with revenue rising 21% to $8.1 billion. While most of Alphabet's advertising empire is fairly mature, YouTube is still growing quickly. Still, 13% growth companywide is impressive, considering the maturity of the business.\n\nMeta's growth put Alphabet's to shame. In Q1, its ad revenue grew 27% to $35.6 billion. And its revenue increased at a healthy pace in all of its regions worldwide.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese strong results aren't outliers, either. Wall Street analysts project Alphabet's revenue will rise 13% this year and 11% next year. For Meta, Wall Street expects 18% and 13% growth. Both of these are strong projections (considering the companies' size) and are great reasons to invest.\n\nHowever, the last point is just icing on the cake.\n\nYou don't have to pay a fortune to own either stock\n\nWhen you look at the rest of the Magnificent Seven  -- Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla -- every one of them is expensive from a valuation standpoint. Measured by their forward price-to-earnings ratios (which consider earnings projections over the next 12 months), none trades lower than 30.\n\nThat's a historically expensive price to pay, which should give investors pause. However, Alphabet and Meta don't command premiums quite that high. META PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt 24 and 25 times forward earnings, both still command slight premiums to the broader market's average of 22.3 (using the S&P 500 as a benchmark).

        "title": "These 5 Stocks Account for 63% of the S&amp;P 500 Returns So Far This Year. Can Their Dominance Continue?",
        "content": "We're officially halfway through 2024, and it's shaping up to be another great year for stock investors.\n\nThe S&P 500 produced a total return of 15.3% through the end of June. That's more than double its historical average for the first half of the year. Its continuous push to new all-time highs bodes well for the second half of the year, too.\n\nIf you look under the hood, the vast majority of the S&P 500's returns have been driven by just five stocks through the first half of 2024. The list isn't too dissimilar from the group of stocks that accounted for the bulk of 2023's return either. If you know about the \"Magnificent Seven,\" you'll be familiar with these names. Can these five continue their dominance through the rest of the year?\n\nThe five stocks accounting for 63% of the S&P 500's returns in 2024\n\nThe S&P 500's aggregate market capitalization increased $5.8 trillion through the first half of 2024.\n\nThe following five stocks generated the biggest market cap increases during the first six months of the year, totaling about 63% of the S&P 500s increase in value for 2024.\n\nStock Market Cap Jan. 1 Market Cap June 28 Increase Increase as a % of S&P 500 Gain Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) $1.223 trillion $3.039 trillion $1.816 trillion 31.3% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) $2.795 trillion $3.322 trillion $527 billion 9.1% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) $1.764 trillion $2.266 trillion $502 billion 8.7% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) $1.57 trillion $2.013 trillion $443 billion 7.6% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) $910 billion $1.279 trillion $369 billion 6.4% Total $8.262 trillion $11.919 trillion $3.663 trillion 63.2%\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nAll of those companies were already among the largest components of the S&P 500 to start the year. Nvidia's continued dominance of the AI chip market has fueled a massive increase in its stock value. Meanwhile, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are four of the biggest companies investing in developing cutting-edge artificial intelligence. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon also provide the cloud platforms required for training and running AI-powered applications.\n\nThe current trend toward generative AI favors the biggest companies. Building large data centers capable of training large language models and running inferences all day requires a ton of capital. Meta leading the group with its plan to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion in capital expenditures this year. That's an investment smaller companies can't even start to compete with, especially in today's interest rate environment where debt isn't nearly as cheap as it used to be.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, the S&P 500 has become increasingly concentrated among just a few companies. Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple account for 20% of the index's value. The next seven components add another 16%. We haven't had this level of concentration among the top-10 companies in the S&P 500 since the 1970s.\n\nWhile there are good reasons for the current level of concentration, investors need to ask if these giant companies can continue to lead the market higher.\n\nWho will lead the next leg up in the market?\n\nRising concentration in the stock market isn't inherently a concern. As mentioned, there are good reasons the biggest companies have gotten bigger. But, investors should remain mindful of valuations and where the market presents good value.\n\nNvidia, for example, trades for a forward PE of around 47. That makes it a risky bet on its continued dominance of the AI chip market. It faces challenges from other chipmakers, and its biggest customers are designing their own chips to reduce their reliance on Nvidia. Analysts currently expect strong bottom-line growth for Nvidia, but its high valuation makes any shortfall extremely damaging to the share price.\n\nNot every member of the above group is expensive. Meta Platforms and Alphabet trade for forward PEs around 25x. While those valuations are higher than the S&P 500's overall earnings multiple, it's not an outlandish multiple relative to their earnings growth prospects.\n\nLooking beyond the biggest companies may present many more opportunities for investors. The S&P 500 equal-weight index historically outperforms the cap-weighted index over the long run. Smaller companies typically grow faster than the giants at the top of the market. A $1 billion increase in the market cap of a $10 billion company is a 10% increase. The same amount of inflows into a $1 trillion company is a 0.1% increase.\n\nTo make a larger bet on the other 495 companies in the S&P 500, investors could buy the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF(NYSEMKT: RSP). Investors could diversify beyond the S&P 500 using a small-cap ETF, too, such as the iShares Russell 2000 ETF(NYSEMKT: IWM).\n\nWhile the first half saw the continued dominance of a small number of large-cap growth stocks, the next leg up in the market could come from a large number of smaller companies.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Wedbush analysts are bullish on the tech sector, predicting a further 15% upside for the Nasdaq in 2024. They believe the current momentum is just the beginning of an AI-driven tech bull market, with the \"AI party\" just reaching 9 pm.\n\nWedbush highlights Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the early leaders of this \"AI Revolution,\" pioneering the foundation for a wave of new applications and spending. They anticipate a \"tidal wave of $1 trillion\" in tech sector spending related to AI over the next 12-18 months.\n\n\"We believe NASDAQ has another strong 2H ahead as tech stocks will be up 15% the rest of 2024 in our view with tech fundamentals set to accelerate as AI use cases materially expand,\" writes Wedbush.\n\nTheir initial forecast for a 25% growth in tech stocks for 2024 remains on track, fueled by strong performances by tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta (NASDAQ:META). They emphasize this is a new era – a \"1995 moment\" of technological revolution, not a repeat of the dot-com bubble of 1999.\n\nWedbush expects Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to join the party in the latter half of the year, unleashing the consumer side of the AI revolution. The upcoming iPhone 16 is seen as a potential catalyst for this shift, ushering in an era of AI-powered smartphones.\n\nWedbush predicts a race to a $4 trillion market cap between tech giants Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft over the next year. The firm says Nvidia's dominance in GPU chips, considered the \"new gold\" of the tech sector, positions them well for continued growth as enterprises and consumers embrace the AI revolution.\n\nWedbush concludes that they believe the tech sector is poised for significant growth fueled by the ongoing AI revolution.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWedbush sees 15% upside left for Nasdaq, tech stocks\n\nTD's chief compliance officer departs amid US anti-money laundering probe\n\nWorld stocks rise, US yields dip amid jobs data, UK labor landslide\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – July 5, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nMarket Breakout: 3 Leading Stocks to Buy Now\n\nUS stock indexes have staged yet another bullish breakout. The economy is steady, employment is robust, inflation continues to fall, and stocks are making record highs – if you aren’t bullish now, I don’t know what else to tell you.\n\nStock Market Generals Grow Profits, Show Powerful Momentum\n\nLife can be very easy in this market, as some of the largest and most prevalent companies in the world are still trading at appealing levels.\n\nThe 'Magnificent 7' continues to grow earnings at an incredible pace, while the stocks also show encouraging momentum. Q2 earnings for the ‘Magnificent 7’ companies are expected to be up +25.5% from the same period last year on +13.1% higher revenues, while the stock prices on several of them push YTD highs.\n\nMy favorite names from the Mag 7 currently are Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet. Also, Nvidia, gets an honorable mention because it too is still a fantastic stock with a top Zacks Rank.\n\nIn the chart below we can see that each of these stocks is showing significant relative strength against the broad market. Apple, although it trails the market YTD, shows the most significant short-term momentum, up 30% in just the last three months.\n\nRising Earnings Trend Lifts Share Price\n\nApple, a consistently successful company with a strong stock performance, is one whose earnings trends I closely monitor. However, over the past two years, earnings revisions have been flat, and while it remains a decent performer, it hasn't delivered any exceptional growth.\n\nNotably, Apple’s earnings revision trend has begun to turn higher for the first time in a while. This is extremely encouraging action, and Apple now enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\n\nAmazon too has seen its earnings revision trend turn higher, giving it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating as well.\n\nApple, Amazon, and Alphabet all have massive tailwinds coming from the AI boom. We learned about Apple’s new AI software integrations, as well as Alphabets new AI agents over the last couple of months, but there are numerous other ways the technology is being used behind the scenes as well.\n\nAt Amazon, its web services business is going to be a huge beneficiary as technology companies ramp up computing power. But AI will also be used at its fulfillment operations, as the massive scale benefits from optimizations. Amazon is also quietly one of the biggest users of new robotics tech, as its operations continue to be automated.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on these developments it’s no surprise we are beginning to see analysts raise earnings estimates.\n\nReasonable Valuations, Especially Alphabet\n\nAlthough Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting a flat earnings revision trend, it still has a lot going for it. It is currently the relatively cheapest stock in the group.\n\nToday, it has a one year forward earnings multiple of 24.4x, which is just above the market average, and below its 10-year median of 26.1x. GOOGL is also expected to grow its EPS 17.5% annually over the next 3-5 years, plans to buy back some $70 billion in shares this year, and is now paying a tidy 0.43% dividend.\n\nAmazon too is trading at a deep historical discount. At 43x forward earnings it is well below its 10-year median of 98.2x, and EPS is forecast to grow 29.6% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nAt 33.4x, Apple is the only one trading above its historical median valuation, but for a company of its quality it is no surprise it earns a premium valuation.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThis bull market continues to charge, fueled by a robust economy, falling inflation, and stellar earnings growth from industry leaders. The \"Magnificent 7\" stands out with their impressive earnings and momentum, offering attractive entry points for investors seeking exposure to top performers.\n\nMoreover, the growing adoption of AI across these companies, particularly in areas like automation and cloud computing, positions them for long-term dominance in the evolving technological landscape. With valuations remaining reasonable and fundamental strength unwavering, this market rally appears poised to extend its winning streak.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Alphabet Stock Soars to New Peak. Here's Why I'm Doubling Down.",
        "content": "After a rebound year in 2023, the tech sector continued its momentum through the first half of this year. Notable tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq-100 are up around 20% and 19%, respectively, largely due to the growth of big tech stocks.\n\nLike most stocks associated with artificial intelligence (AI), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has benefited from the technology's ushering into the mainstream. Alphabet's stock is up close to 32% this year and reached a new all-time high in late June.\n\nWhen stocks are flirting with peaks, many investors become hesitant, fearing a correction could be in the works. Whether that happens remains to be seen, but as a long-term investor, I'm doubling down on Alphabet, and here's why.\n\nGoogle will remain the king of search advertising\n\nAlphabet's bread and butter has been and will continue to be money earned from Google advertising. In the first quarter, Alphabet made $80.5 billion, and Google advertising accounted for over 76% of it. The good news, though, is that it's less than in previous quarters, a signal that it's becoming less reliant on it.\n\nConcerns about how new AI implementation may affect Alphabet's advertising revenue are valid but overblown. On one end, Google makes money when users click links on their search ads, so if users get their questions answered by Google's AI Overview answers, then a slowdown is possible.\n\nOn the other hand, AI inclusion also opens up new advertising opportunities with new ad formats. Google advertising is so important to Alphabet's business that you have to assume the company wouldn't overlook the effect of its AI Overview implementation.\n\nWhen you routinely have around a 90% market share in online search, you have more room to experiment and discover ways to enhance user engagement and create more targeted advertising opportunities. GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nGoogle Cloud could be a huge growth area\n\nThe cloud computing industry is rapidly growing, and many assume AI advancements will add to the momentum. Google Cloud is still a ways behind leaders Amazon Web Services (31% market share) and Microsoft Azure (25% market share) in terms of adaptability, but the platform has turned the corner on profitability and should contribute to growing margins.\n\nCloud platforms have a lot of fixed costs, such as data center operations and other infrastructure-related expenses. This means it takes a certain scale before the platforms achieve sustainable profitability. Now that Google Cloud has seemingly crossed that threshold, it should see a financial boost from a segment that was once weighing down its margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle Cloud revenue in the first quarter was $9.6 billion, up $2.1 billion from last year. Its operating income (profit from its core operations) had a more dramatic jump, increasing over 370% year over year. This increased efficiency helped increase Alphabet's operating margin to 32% from 25% last year.\n\nAlphabet seems to be the best value in big tech\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a phrase coined to describe seven of the world's most influential tech companies. They include Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Alphabet. As they go, so does the tech sector, for the most part.\n\nAlphabet seems to be the \"cheapest\" of the bunch, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just under 28. Being the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven doesn't automatically make Alphabet cheap because those stocks are routinely priced at a premium, but Alphabet is cheaper than its average for the past decade. GOOGL PE Ratio Chart\n\nThis could be a great chance for investors to grab a piece of a world-class company at a fair valuation. Alphabet has strong growth prospects, so it's easy to justify its valuation for long-term investors. This growth won't happen overnight, but Alphabet's newly announced dividend should buy some patience from investors.\n\nThe quarterly dividend is $0.20, with a yield below 0.5%, so it's not necessarily a must-have for income-seeking investors. Still, initiating a dividend program at all should signal Alphabet's confidence in its financial health and ability to sustain long-term profitability.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Millionaire-Maker Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy in 2024",
        "content": "The stock market has seen considerable growth in the first half of the year, with the Nasdaq Composite index rising about 19% since Jan. 1. However, it's not too late to invest in companies that are likely to continue growing over the next six months.\n\nDespite an explosion of growth since last January, the artificial intelligence (AI) market remains a compelling place to start. According to Grand View Research, the industry hit $197 billion last year and is expanding at a rate that would see it reach close to $2 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nThe industry has made a lot of millionaires since the start of last year, but it is likely not done yet. Demand for AI services and the high-powered chips needed to run them is continuing to rise, boosting the earnings of some key companies.\n\nSo, get in before it's too late. Here are two millionaire-maker AI stocks to buy in 2024.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has made more than a few millionaires since a boom in AI kicked off at the start of 2023, with its stock up 745%. The company had already gained a reputation as a reliable growth stock thanks to success in gaming, consumer products, and data centers. However, Nvidia's involvement in AI has taken its business to another level. It became the first chipmaker to achieve a market cap above $3 trillion this year.\n\nSome analysts have questioned how much more growth the company could realistically offer after rising so high. However, its nearly unrivaled dominance in AI chips and growing cash reserves, which are far ahead of its rivals, suggest its lead is unlikely to dissipate anytime soon. Meanwhile, developers have only scratched the surface of what's possible with AI, indicating chip demand is nowhere near hitting its ceiling.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices and Intel are Nvidia's biggest rivals in the AI chip market. Despite significant investments over the last year from both of them, Nvidia maintains an estimated 90% market share in AI chips. Additionally, soaring earnings have widened the financial gap between these companies. NVDA Operating Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis chart shows that Nvidia's quarterly operating income and free cash flow dwarfed the same metrics for AMD and Intel over the last year. The figures suggest Nvidia is far more capable of investing in its business and maintaining its lead in AI for years.\n\nNvidia has the cash and brand power to continue expanding long into the future. Despite recent stock growth, its price/earnings-to-growth ratio remains at less than 1, which could mean it is still trading at a value compared to its potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, Nvidia is a millionaire-maker stock that is too good to pass up in 2024.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nWhile Nvidia is crushing it in AI chips, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) is investing heavily in the software side of the market. The Google company has steep competition from cloud giants Microsoft and Amazon. However, stock valuations and recent earnings make Alphabet a no-brainer investment this year.\n\nCloud platforms have taken on a critical role in AI, as businesses worldwide are increasingly turning to such services to boost productivity with the generative technology. Alphabet holds the third-largest market share in cloud computing with Google Cloud (after Microsoft and Amazon). However, Alphabet is expanding quickly and outpacing its rivals. In the first quarter of 2024, Google Cloud revenue increased by 28% year over year, beating Microsoft Azure's 21% rise in sales and Amazon Web Services' 17% growth.\n\nIt's been eight years since Alphabet announced it would move forward as an AI-first company. However, the company has ramped up development over the last year. Alphabet launched its Gemini AI model this year, which has allowed it to add AI features throughout its product lineup. Meanwhile, its DeepMind AI research subsidiary has transitioned into an AI product factory, developing commercial services. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nMoreover, despite delivering more stock growth than Amazon or Microsoft over the last 12 months, Alphabet's stock remains the biggest bargain among the three companies. The table above shows that Alphabet has the lowest forward price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free cash flow among its competitors, meaning the company's stock offers the most value.\n\nWith 522% stock growth since 2014, Alphabet has created many millionaires. However, its potential in AI and its vast financial resources suggest it's not done yet and is worth considering this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $751,670!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its “ClearBridge Dividend Strategy” second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here.  In the second quarter, the S&P 500 Index increased 4.3%, for a half-year gain of 15.3%. The performance for the quarter was almost entirely driven by the information technology (or \"IT\") sector. The firm has optimistic views about the economy and not expecting a recession near term despite a slowdown in activity. During the second quarter, the strategy underperformed its S&P 500 Index benchmark. The strategy gained four out of 11 sectors in which it was invested in the quarter on an absolute basis. The IT sector was the main positive contributor, while the materials and financial sectors detracted. Stock selection and sector allocation detracted, relatively. Please review the strategy's top five holdings to see its best choices for 2024.\n\nClearBridge Dividend Strategy highlighted stocks like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, offers various platforms and services operating through Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments. The one-month return of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was 5.83%, and its shares gained 52.81% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On July 3, 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock closed at $187.3 per share with a market capitalization of $2.305 trillion.\n\nClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Communication services gains in the S&P 500 were driven mainly by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (aka Google). The company has a dominant position in internet search and video advertising, and a solid cloud services business. Alphabet’s initiation of a dividend in the quarter enabled us to take a small position. We see further meaningful revenue opportunities from AI innovations across its segments and may look to increase our holdings over time. Alphabet’s exceptional balance sheet and improving cost efficiencies further solidify its strong position and growth prospects, and we expect its dividend will grow sharply over time.\n\nThe recent addition of Alphabet and Meta reflect the benefits of our flexible dividend approach. Our active (as opposed to formulaic) approach to dividends enabled us to move quickly and buy the shares soon after each announced its dividend. Over the years, our nimble approach to dividend investing has frequently enabled us to profit from long-term investments in high-growth technology companies that many passive or formulaic dividend investors likely missed (e.g., American Tower, Mastercard, Meta, Visa).\"\n\nStory continues Why You Should Buy Alphabet Stock\n\nGoogle\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in 7th position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 165 hedge fund portfolios held Alphabet Inc.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman's Best-Performing Stocks of 2024 So Far: Are They Still Buys?",
        "content": "Andrew Carnegie is credited as saying, \"The way to become rich is to put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket.\"\n\nBill Ackman has amassed a net worth of over $9 billion by following a modified version of the strategy. All his Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund's assets are currently invested in only eight stocks -- two of which are different classes of shares for the same company.\n\nDespite having a small number of holdings, Ackman has several big winners this year. Here are the billionaire hedge fund manager's best-performing stocks of 2024 so far.\n\n1. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) ranks as Ackman's top stock of the year. Shares of the restaurant chain operator are up nearly 34% year to date after soaring 65% in 2023.\n\nAckman reduced Pershing Square's position in Chipotle by 9.8% in the first quarter. However, it remained the hedge fund's largest single holding at the end of the quarter, making up over 20% of Pershing Square's total portfolio.\n\nOne key factor behind Chipotle's strong performance so far in 2024 is the company's solid growth. The company reported Q1 revenue jumped 14% year over year to $2.7 billion, and its adjusted earnings per share soared 27% to $13.37.\n\nChipotle also generated excitement in March when it announced a 50-for-1 stock split. The company conducted this big split after the market close on June 25, 2024.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) trails slightly behind Chipotle as Ackman's second-best performer so far in 2024. The tech giant's shares have vaulted 31% higher this year.\n\nPershing Square owns both Alphabet's class A and class C shares. At the end of Q1, they made up 6.1% and 13.3%, respectively, of the hedge fund's total portfolio.\n\nThe generative AI boom has provided a nice tailwind for Alphabet's Google Cloud business. In Q1, the unit's revenue increased more than 28% to $9.6 billion.\n\nMost of Alphabet's revenue, though, is generated from its other operations -- primarily Google Search and YouTube. These businesses also continue to perform well, with total Google Services revenue rising nearly 14% year over year in Q1 to $70.4 billion.\n\n3. Hilton Worldwide Holdings\n\nAckman's No. 3 stock of 2024, with less than six months remaining in the year, might be surprising. Shares of hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings(NYSE: HLT) are up 18% year to date.\n\nTechnically, Hilton was Pershing Square's second-largest holding at the end of Q1. However, with the class A and class C shares of Alphabet combined, it would have been the hedge fund's third-largest position.\n\nStory continues\n\nHilton's revenue increased 12% year over year in Q1 to $2.3 billion. Its earnings jumped nearly 29% higher to $265 million, or $1.04 per diluted share.\n\nAre they still buys?\n\nI'd be leery of buying Chipotle after the stock's impressive run. The Mexican restaurant chain's shares trade at a sky-high forward price-to-earnings ratio of 56.8. That lofty level is hard to justify with Chipotle's growth.\n\nHilton Worldwide Holdings also appears to be a bit pricey. Its forward earnings multiple is 30.3. Again, I don't think Hilton's growth prospects warrant this valuation.\n\nThat leaves Alphabet. It isn't cheap, either, with shares trading at 24.3 times forward earnings. Some investors could be worried that artificial intelligence (AI) presents an existential threat to the company's search business.\n\nHowever, Ackman said last year that Alphabet \"will be a dominant player in AI for the very, very long term.\" I agree with his take. I like the opportunities for Google Cloud and the Waymo self-driving car technology business. Of Ackman's three biggest winners of 2024 so far, Alphabet is the best pick for long-term investors, in my view.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Soar: 2 Remarkable Growth Stocks to Buy Now for the Bull Market",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) entered a bull market in December 2022. In the 18 months or so since, the technology-heavy index has advanced by 76% amid surging interest in artificial intelligence. But based on historical patterns, those gains are likely just the beginning.\n\nSince 1990, the Nasdaq has returned an average of 215% during bull markets that had average durations of about 40 months. If the current bull market aligns precisely with the historical average, then the Nasdaq will climb by another 139% from its cyclical low during the next 22 months.\n\nThat does imply a somewhat unrealistic return of 61% annually. But investors still have good reason to believe the Nasdaq will soar over time. The index has risen by a total of 2,420% during the last two decades, or 11.3% annually. That period encompassed such a broad range of economic conditions that it's reasonable for investors to expect similar returns in the future.\n\nWith that broad outlook in mind, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU) would be worthwhile investments to consider buying now.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet derives most of its revenues from digital advertising and cloud computing. Its Google subsidiary is the largest ad tech company in the world due to its ability to engage internet users and collect data. It owns six consumer-facing products and services that reach 2 billion monthly users each, among them Google Search, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. That reach and the insight it provides are valuable to advertisers. So much so that according to a forecast from Emarketer, Google will soak up 27.4% of digital advertising revenue worldwide in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud is the third-largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services. Google Cloud trails Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure by a wide margin in market share, but it did gain a percentage point over the past year, and that trend could continue as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) consume a greater portion of IT budgets.\n\nIndeed, a recent CIO survey from Morgan Stanley predicted that Microsoft would be the cloud provider that will see the largest incremental share gain in AI/ML workloads over the next three years, but it forecast that Google would be the second-largest beneficiary in that space. Supporting that conclusion was the early success of multimodal model Gemini, designed to compete with the models that power ChatGPT. Google's Gemini is currently the second most popular AI cloud service.\n\nAlphabet showed financial strength in the first quarter, with growth accelerating on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 15% to $80.5 billion due to strong momentum in the Google Cloud segment, which also includes Google Workspace office productivity software. Meanwhile, GAAP net income soared 57% to $23.7 billion, a gain that was helped along by disciplined expense management.\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough 2027, Wall Street analysts estimate that Alphabet will grow earnings per share at an annualized rate of 16%. That forecast makes its current valuation of 28.2 times earnings seem reasonable. From that level, I think Alphabet has a good shot at outperforming the Nasdaq over the next three to five years.\n\n2. Roku\n\nRoku connects streaming content publishers and advertisers with consumers. It is the leading streaming video platform in the U.S. as measured by streaming hours, and its Roku OS is the best-selling TV operating system in the U.S. and Mexico. Approximately 40% of smart TVs sold in those nations during the first quarter were Roku TVs.\n\nAdditionally, it offers on-demand content and live television through The Roku Channel, an ad-supported streaming service that consistently ranks as one of the most popular channels on the platform. Indeed, The Roku Channel recently surpassed Peacock (owned by Comcast) and Max (owned by Warner Bros. Discovery) to become the seventh-most-popular streaming service in the U.S.\n\nRoku reported encouraging financial results in the first quarter. Revenue rose 19% to $882 million, a sequential acceleration from 14% growth in Q4 2023. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA improved to $41 million, a big flip from its EBITDA loss of $69 million in the prior-year period. Investors have good reason to believe that the favorable momentum will continue.\n\nEmarketer forecasts that U.S. connected TV ad spending will increase at an annualized rate of 13% through 2027. Roku is set to benefit from that growth due to its superior ability to engage viewers, as evidenced by its leadership position among streaming platforms and the growing popularity of The Roku Channel.\n\nRoku also stands to benefit from its recently announced partnership with The Trade Desk, the largest independent ad tech platform for media buyers. Specifically, Roku will share data with advertisers using The Trade Desk to help them \"better understand and optimize their campaigns for TV streaming viewers.\" That should make Roku's ad inventory even more compelling.\n\nOn average, Wall Street analysts expect Roku's sales to increase by 12% annually through 2027. I think that estimate leaves room for upside surprises, given that the broader connected TV advertising market is forecast to grow even more quickly. However, even if Wall Street is correct, the stock still looks reasonably valued at its current price-to-sales ratio of 2.4, and Roku has a good shot at outperforming the Nasdaq over the next three to five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG): Is It the Biggest AI Story Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stories.\n\nAre Growing Patents in AI from China a Threat to the US?\n\nChina and the United States continue to compete against each other as the AI boom continues to reign in the tech industry. On July 2, Reuters reported that China plans to develop 50 new national and industrial standards for artificial intelligence by 2026. The country aims to standardize systems in the artificial intelligence sector by providing thorough guidelines to companies and budding startups. Furthermore, on July 3, Reuters reported that China filed six times more patents than the United States for inventions in AI like chatbots. On a global scale, more than 50,000 patent applications were filed in the past decade, a quarter of which were filed in 2023 alone. China filed 38,000 generative AI applications between 2014 and 2023, while the United States only filed slightly over 6,200 applications during the same period. Of the total applications, ByteDance, Alibaba Group, and Microsoft filed the largest number of applications. The report added that Chinese patent applications covered a wider range of sectors such as autonomous driving, publishing, and document management. South Korea, Japan, and India were ranked third, fourth, and fifth with the highest number of patent applications.\n\nThe United States, on the other hand, has reportedly accumulated $55.6 billion in venture capital funding in the second quarter of 2024, the highest quarterly total in two years. On July 3, Reuters reported that the surge in venture capital funding is driven by developments in artificial intelligence. Such is a 47% increase from the $37.8 billion raised by startups in the first quarter of 2024. Significant investments include $6 billion by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion raised by CoreWeave. Previously, venture capital funding took a hit, reporting $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 amid high interest rates and sluggish economic growth. While venture capital and investment in AI are increasing, the IPO market remains sluggish.\n\nOpenAI & Anthropic: A Comparative Analysis\n\nWhile the threat of Chinese innovations looms over the United States, startups in the country are disrupting the industry with key innovations. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is a leading artificial intelligence company based in the United States. In February this year, OpenAI closed a deal with venture capital firm Thrive Capital, allowing it to buy some of its shares in a tender offer, bringing its total valuation to $80 billion. This is a threefold increase in its value from a few months ago in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn June 10, OpenAI and Apple announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Users will now be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities on all these devices without having to switch tools. Siri will also be able to reach ChatGPT when a user asks a question and will present them with an answer directly from the chatbot. ChatGPT will be integrated into Apple's writing tools, allowing users to create content when required. The development ensures that user security remains intact. Requests are not stored by OpenAI and IP addresses remain obscured. Users may connect to their ChatGPT account, allowing them to choose their data preferences. The integration will be executed later this year and can be accessed for free without having to create an account.\n\nIn another update, Apple is reportedly positioned to join OpenAI's board. On July 2, Reuters reported that Apple is set to get an observer role on OpenAI's board, part of the agreement made by the two entities a month ago. Phill Schiller, head of Apple App Store and former marketing chief, was selected for this position. The board agreement will take effect later this year. As of yet, Schiller has not attended any meetings.\n\nAnthropic, OpenAI's direct competitor, is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2021. The company is led by Dario and Daniela Amodei as CEO and president. The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.\n\nClaude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models. The company strongly believes that the initiative will enhance AI safety level assessments, improve safety metrics, and develop infrastructure and tools for evaluations. The safety level assessments will encompass cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, model autonomy, national security risks, and social manipulation.\n\nA lot is going on in the AI space and several companies have emerged as interesting AI stories. We have compiled a list of the most interesting AI stories on Wall Street by studying many reports and publications and watching interviews. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, which was sourced from Insider Monkey's proprietary database that tracks over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 222\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the best AI stories in the market and is well-positioned to exploit the next wave of artificial intelligence and innovation. Google DeepMind, the company's research lab is making moves to develop new models that will provide teams with a single access point to all the company's models. The research lab is working relentlessly to improve the Gemini experience. Back in February, the company launched Gemini 1.5  Pro, with accelerated performance across text, audio, video, and code.\n\nOverall, the company's new AI models and algorithms are 100 times more efficient compared to 18 months ago. Additionally, over 60% of generative AI startups and 90% of generative AI unicorns are customers of the Google Cloud, backed by the company's fifth-generation tensor processing unit. Additionally, more than one million developers are using its generative AI tools including AI Studio and Vertex AI. The company spent $12 billion on capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2024, twice as much as the expenditure in Q4 2023.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also launched its NVIDIA chip rival in May. Trillium is the company's family of AI data center chips, almost five times faster than its previous models. While Google's tensor processing units (TPU) only account for almost 20% of the market, its advancements promise higher market shares in the future. The sixth generation Trillium chips perform 4.7 times better in terms of computing performance. Moreover, they are also 67% more energy efficient compared to the previous generation of Trillium processors. The new chip will be made available to Google Cloud users by the end of 2024.\n\nOverall, 222 investors held stakes worth $32.35 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Of those, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $6.99 billion.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the stock. On July 3, Needham reiterated a buy rating on the stock and maintained its price target of $210.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of the biggest AI stories right now. You can visit 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Weekto see the other AI stories that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Market Break Out: 3 Leading Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "US stock indexes have staged yet another bullish breakout. The economy is steady, employment is robust, inflation continues to fall, and stocks are making record highs – if you aren’t bullish now, I don’t know what else to tell you. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nStock Market Generals Grow Profits, Show Powerful Momentum\n\nLife can be very easy in this market, as some of the largest and most prevalent companies in the world are still trading at appealing levels.\n\nThe ‘Magnificent 7’ continues to grow earnings at an incredible pace, while the stocks also shows encouraging momentum. Q2 earnings for the ‘Magnificent 7’ companies are expected to be up +25.5% from the same period last year on +13.1% higher revenues, while the stock prices on several of them push YTD highs.\n\nMy favorite names from the Mag 7 currently are Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOGL). Also, Nvidia (NVDA), gets an honorable mention because it too is still a fantastic stock with a top Zacks Rank.\n\nIn the chart below we can see that each of these stocks is showing significant relative strength against the broad market. Apple, although it trails the market YTD, shows the most significant short-term momentum, up 30% in just the last three months. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRising Earnings Trend Lifts Share Price\n\nApple, a consistently successful company with a strong stock performance, is one whose earnings trends I closely monitor. However, over the past two years, earnings revisions have been flat, and while it remains a decent performer, it hasn't delivered any exceptional growth.\n\nNotably, Apple’s earnings revision trend has begun to turn higher for the first time in a while. This is extremely encouraging action, and Apple now enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\n\nAmazon too has seen its earnings revision trend turn higher, giving it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating as well.\n\nApple, Amazon, and Alphabet all have massive tailwinds coming from the AI boom. We learned about Apple’s new AI software integrations, as well as Alphabets new AI agents over the last couple of months, but there are numerous other ways the technology is being used behind the scenes as well.\n\nAt Amazon, its web services business is going to be a huge beneficiary as technology companies ramp up computing power. But AI will also be used at its fulfillment operations, as the massive scale benefits from optimizations. Amazon is also quietly one of the biggest users of new robotics tech, as its operations continue to be automated.\n\nBased on these developments it’s no surprise we are beginning to see analysts raise earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nReasonable Valuations, Especially Alphabet\n\nAlthough Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting a flat earnings revision trend, it still has a lot going for it. It is currently the relatively cheapest stock in the group.\n\nToday, it has a one year forward earnings multiple of 24.4x, which is just above the market average, and below its 10-year median of 26.1x. GOOGL is also expected to grow its EPS 17.5% annually over the next 3-5 years, plans to buy back some $70 billion in shares this year, and is now paying a tidy 0.43% dividend.\n\nAmazon too is trading at a deep historical discount. At 43x forward earnings it is well below its 10-year median of 98.2x, and EPS is forecast to grow 29.6% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nAt 33.4x, Apple is the only one trading above its historical median valuation, but for a company of its quality it is no surprise its earns a premium valuation. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThis bull market continues to charge, fueled by a robust economy, falling inflation, and stellar earnings growth from industry leaders. The \"Magnificent 7\" stands out with their impressive earnings and momentum, offering attractive entry points for investors seeking exposure to top performers.\n\nMoreover, the growing adoption of AI across these companies, particularly in areas like automation and cloud computing, positions them for long-term dominance in the evolving technological landscape. With valuations remaining reasonable and fundamental strength unwavering, this market rally appears poised to extend its winning streak.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Prepare yourself for the AI smartphone wars",
        "content": "Smartphone innovation has largely slowed to a crawl over the last few years. We’re long past the days when each successive generation of phones offered up features that drove waves of excitement among consumers, who’d then wait outside the Apple Store.\n\nBut that might be about to change thanks to AI. At least, that’s what smartphone makers hope.\n\nYes, we’re about to enter a new phase of smartphone sales spin. Prepare yourselves for the great AI smartphone war.\n\nTo be fair, smartphone makers have been adding AI and machine learning capabilities to their devices for years — for everything from improving photo quality to intelligent notifications. But generative AI technologies promise a whole new host of innovations ranging from fresh photo-editing tools and content summarization to live translation and transcription features. And, of course, smarter digital assistants.\n\nGoogle kicked things off last year, including AI features with its Pixel 8 line of smartphones. Samsung followed suit earlier this year with its Galaxy AI platform. And now, Apple is preparing to enter the ring with Apple Intelligence, which is set to launch later this fall.\n\nNot to be outdone, Samsung and Google are also preparing their own major product events in the coming weeks that are expected to include even more AI news.\n\nSamsung will host a Galaxy Unpacked event in Paris, France, on July 10, where it’s expected to show off the next generation of its foldable phone lines: the Galaxy Flip and Galaxy Fold. Google will hold its Made by Google keynote in Mountain View, Calif., on Aug. 13, during which it’s likely to show off its latest Pixel phones. Samsung holds a drone show as part of its launch of the Galaxy S24 smartphone line with AI features. (Joe Maher/Getty Images for Samsung) (Joe Maher via Getty Images)\n\nThe thrust behind all of these moves is that AI will provide exciting new functions for your smartphone that were never before possible. It also means you’ll need to cough up some extra cash to get your hands on those features if your phone can’t take advantage of those AI capabilities.\n\nA battle for your attention and wallet\n\nGoogle and Samsung kickstarted the AI smartphone fight, but Apple's impressive response managed to make generative AI look like a far more approachable and consumer-friendly technology.\n\nThe iPhone maker laid out its plans for Apple Intelligence during its June WWDC event, giving developers and fans alike a glimpse at how the software will work across its Photos, Messages, and Mail apps, as well as with its Siri assistant. The company says you’ll be able to do things like ask Siri to pull up specific pictures from the Photos app. So if you want to see a picture of that time you and your friend Susan went to New York, you can ask Siri to show pictures of Susan in New York, and it will surface them for you.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat’s more, Apple says it’s integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its products, giving users access to the chatbot. The company says you’ll also need to give ChatGPT permission to search the web each time you use it, ensuring you know when you’re using Siri and when you’re using ChatGPT. Apple WWDC event where it introduced its Apple Intelligence AI platform. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nApple also spent a significant chunk of its time going over how it intends to preserve its users’ privacy while using Apple Intelligence’s online functionality. It says it won’t share data with OpenAI — and won’t save any private data from users’ interactions with Apple Intelligence.\n\nSamsung is up next with its Unpacked event where, according to its latest advertising blitz, it will show off all-new generative AI options for its phones. So far, the company has mostly shown that its Galaxy AI can pull off some fancy photo-editing tricks and translation services, so it’ll be interesting to see what it has to rival Apple’s announcements.\n\nGoogle, which provides some of its AI know-how to Samsung, is in a similar position. The company let fly with its generative AI-powered smartphones well before Apple, with options to edit photos and videos, but the software felt more scattered than the kind of comprehensive services Apple plans to provide.\n\nNow the company is gearing up for its next Pixel phone launch and specifically pointing to AI as a key aspect of the phones’ functionality. Google uses its Pixel line more as a blueprint for how its Android phone partners can innovate using its various software services. And part of that means proving to customers that its generative AI features can take on Apple Intelligence.\n\nYou can expect all three companies to start making major advertising pushes for their generative AI platforms throughout the fall and holiday shopping season as each tries to prove it’s the better choice for what they’re banking on as the next major paradigm shift in smartphones.\n\nA choice that, ultimately, you and I will get to make.

        "title": "2 Outperforming Big Tech Stocks to Buy This Quarter",
        "content": "Big Tech stocks have had a stranglehold on the stock market so far in 2024, and this summer could be no different. Two stocks in particular, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL), are poised to extend their ascents.\n\nPer Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, AAPL and GOOGL made the list of 25 best-performing S&P 500 Index (SPX) stocks to own this quarter, historically, in the past 10 years. Apple boasts an average quarterly return of 7.6%, with an 80% win rate, while the Google parent is higher 6.8% of the time and has finished the quarter higher nine times in the last decade. Best Stocks Q3\n\nApple stock was last seen trading at $219.55, just below yesterday's record close of $220.38. The shares are 14.3% higher so far in 2024, with support stepping up at their 20-day moving average before a 6% post-earnings bull gap in early May. On the chart below, note the bullish flag pattern that preceded yesterday's 1.6% gain.\n\nGOOGL is trading at $185.24 at last check, a chip shot from its June 27 record high of $186.05. Compared to AAPL, Alphabet shares are up a much more robust 32.1% this year, and also sport a 53.57% year-over-year lead amid a channel of higher highs. Big Tech Best Q3\n\nBoth equities sport attractively priced premiums at the moment, per their respective Schaeffer's Volatility Indexes (SVI) that sit in the bottom 25th percentile of their annual ranges. Where they differ is that AAPL's Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) sits at 79 out of 100, suggesting the security has tended to exceed options traders' volatility expectations during the past year. GOOGL's SVS, meanwhile, sits at 7, making the equity an intriguing premium-selling candidate.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Google’s greenhouse gas emissions have risen 48% since 2019, according to the firm’s latest environmental report, driven by the increasing power demands of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe tech giant has set itself the goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2030, but said the increasing amount of energy needed by its data centres to carry out the more intense levels of compute required to power AI services made reducing emissions challenging.\n\nOne of the major concerns around AI has been the potential environmental impact of its development, with a recent study by the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasting that the amount of electricity being used by the world’s data centres in 2022 could double by 2026.\n\nIn January, Google committed to investing one billion dollars (£788 million) in the UK to build a new data centre in response to demands around AI.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to Google’s latest environmental report, in 2023, green house gas emissions from the company were up 13% on 2022, and just under 50% since 2019.\n\n“This result was primarily due to increases in data centre energy consumption and supply chain emissions”, the company’s report said.\n\n“As we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment.”\n\nAs well as the increasing electricity demands sparked by the rise in demand for AI services, the report also highlighted the stark contrasts in carbon-free energy use in the company’s different data centres around the world.\n\nGoogle’s data showed that while most of its centres in Europe and the Americas got the majority of their energy from carbon-free sources, centres in the Middle East, Asia and Australia used far less.\n\n“In spite of the progress we are making, we face significant challenges that we’re actively working through,” Google said.\n\nStory continues\n\n“In 2023, our total GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions increased 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by increased data centre energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\n\n“While we advanced clean energy on many of the grids where we operate, there are still some hard-to-decarbonise regions like Asia-Pacific where CFE (carbon-free energy) isn’t readily available.\n\n“In addition, we often see longer lead times between initial investments and construction of clean energy projects and the resulting GHG reductions from them.”",

        "title": "Is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) the Best AI Stock Pick of Billionaire Leon Cooperman in 2024?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of the 10 Best Stock Picks of Billionaire Leon Cooperman in 2024. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Leon Cooperman predicted in April that the US is headed for a financial crisis. Cooperman said that the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero, but raised them dramatically in a period of 12 months. The  Omega Family Office chairman and CEO expects “one or two” rate cuts this year. He emphasized that the market remains overvalued.\n\nIn February last year, the billionaire said that the market was headed for a recession, and noted that the S&P 500 high of about 4,800 recorded in 2022 could “stand for some time.” In July 2022, while talking to Bloomberg, Cooperman said that he was “shocked” that interest rates were so low.\n\n“I am of the view that equities are the best house in the financial asset in the neighborhood, but I don’t like the neighborhood, for a lot of reasons.”\n\nCooperman in the Bloomberg interview in 2022 had categorically said that sooner or later the strong dollar, prices of oil and the Fed would “lead us into a recession.” He went on to add that recession would be a “2023 event” and predicted that the market would bottom somewhere near 35% to 45% below its peak of 4800.\n\nThe billionaire had said that he would be “very surprised” if we were to see another bull market anytime soon, given his view that we’ve had one of the biggest bull runs driven by FAANG, SPACs and speculation. The AI revolution that started in 2023 was indeed a shocker for Cooperman as his recession predictions were proven wrong.\n\nFor this article we scanned billionaire Leon Cooperman’s Q1 portfolio and picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Best Stock Pick of Billionaire Leon Cooperman in 2024?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 166\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) accounts for about 4% of the total Q1 portfolio of Leon Cooperman. Omega Advisors has been holding stakes in the search engine company since 2015 (except for Q2 2020 when the fund totally dumped Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), only to buy it again in the following quarter). Omega Advisors owns a $98 million stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) as of the end of the March quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the company is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrate with other Google apps. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) app is to urge users to sign up for ‘Google One AI Premium’ plan, which has a $19.99 price tag.  Google saw advertising revenue accelerate in Q1 2024, boosted by YouTube in particular growing by almost 21% last quarter. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\n\nHere is what Bronte Capital said about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Our biggest position is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the holding company for Google. It is currently about 12 percent of funds under management. This has been a large position for over ten years.\n\nWe bought a large position in Google in October 20104, and the stock immediately dropped 11 percent.\n\nThat was an astonishingly good purchase and if we had held it all from October 2010 until the end of this month the gain would have been about 1300 percent.\n\nAlas we did not hold it all.

        "title": "These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Make Up 35.9% of the Entire Nasdaq-100 Index",
        "content": "The Nasdaq-100 index is made up of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. It's often used as a barometer for the performance of the technology sector, but it also features stocks from the retail, healthcare, transportation, and media industries.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 is weighted by market capitalization, which means larger companies have a greater influence over its performance than smaller companies. The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving a surge in the value of some of America's trillion-dollar tech stocks, and the following five now make up 35.9% of the entire index:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has a market cap of $3.3 trillion. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a market cap of $3.2 trillion. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has a market cap of $3 trillion. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a market cap of $2.2 trillion. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has a market cap of $2 trillion.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 is up 18.9% so far in 2024. However, the Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted index -- which assigns the same representation to all 100 companies regardless of size -- is up just 6.2%. The difference can be explained (in part) by the outperformance of the above five stocks, which have delivered an average return of 47.3% year to date.\n\nEach of the five companies has a track record of success spanning decades, and they are now deploying their vast financial resources to dominate the fast-growing AI industry. If they succeed, they could have an even greater influence over the Nasdaq-100 in the future.\n\n1. Microsoft: 8.71% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nMicrosoft is the world's largest company, which is an impressive feat given it was founded way back in 1975. To maintain its near 50-year track record of success, Microsoft had to expand beyond its roots in software development by moving into other growth industries like gaming, cloud computing, and now, AI.\n\nMicrosoft agreed to invest $10 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI last year, and it used the start-up's latest GPT-4 models to develop its own virtual assistant called Copilot. It's capable of answering complex questions, and generating text, images, and computer code on command. Copilot is now integrated into some of Microsoft's flagship products including Windows, Edge, Bing, and 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more), to help businesses and consumers increase their productivity.\n\nEnterprises can also access OpenAI's models through the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, which they can use to develop their own AI applications. Microsoft says 65% of the Fortune 500 companies are already using Azure OpenAI Service, which speaks to the surging demand for this new technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft is a widely recognized leader in AI, and the company is likely to continue creating value for investors over the long term.\n\n2. Apple: 8.5% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, which includes the flagship iPhone, the iPad, and the Mac line of computers. Apple recently announced its own AI software called Apple Intelligence, which was developed in partnership with OpenAI, and it could make the company the world's largest distributor of AI to consumers.\n\nApple Intelligence is expected to launch with the iOS 18 operating system in September. It will transform existing Apple features like the Siri voice assistant, which will draw on the powerful capabilities of ChatGPT. Plus, users will be able to instantly craft text content inside writing tools like Notes, iMessage, and Mail.\n\nApple Intelligence could drive a significant upgrade cycle when the new iPhone 16 smartphone is released later this year, which is expected to come with a new chipset designed specifically for processing AI workloads on-device. Apple's gigantic installed base places it at the forefront of AI's shift away from the data center and into the devices we use each day.\n\n3. Nvidia: 7.89% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nNvidia was a $360 billion company at the start of 2023. In just the last 18 months, it added $2.7 trillion to its market cap to join the $3 trillion club alongside Apple and Microsoft. The company's incredible growth stems from surging demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) for the data center, which are the best in the world for training and inferencing AI models.\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU set the industry benchmark, but the company is gearing up to ship a new generation of chips based on its more advanced Blackwell architecture. Its upcoming GB200, for example, can inference AI models 5 times faster than the H100, which could save developers substantial amounts of money as they typically pay for computing capacity by the minute.\n\nNvidia's data center revenue soared 427% year over year during the recent fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), coming in at a record $22.6 billion. Competition is ramping up but Nvidia remains comfortably ahead, so its run of success looks set to continue (at least in the near term).\n\n4. Alphabet: 5.54% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nAlphabet is the tech conglomerate behind Google, YouTube, Waymo, DeepMind, and more. Google Search remains the organization's largest source of revenue, and considering it has been the window to the internet for over two decades, it arguably has more valuable data with which to develop AI than any other company.\n\nAlphabet has developed a series of AI models, culminating in Gemini, which is designed to compete with OpenAI's GPT-4. Gemini operates as a stand-alone chatbot, but it can also be integrated into popular Google Workspace applications like Docs, Sheets, and Gmail for an extra fee, allowing users to rapidly craft content and boost their productivity.\n\nGoogle Search now also uses generative AI to deliver text-based responses to queries, saving users from having to sift through web pages looking for answers. It's helping to fend off threats from competitors like Microsoft Bing, which is powered by ChatGPT.\n\nInvestors seem to appreciate Alphabet's AI progress, because they have catapulted its stock to an all-time high this year and right into the $2 trillion club.\n\n5. Amazon: 5.33% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nAmazon is one of the most versatile AI companies. The technology powers the recommendation engine on its globally dominant e-commerce website, amazon.com, which learns what products customers like to buy and shows them similar ones in an effort to boost sales. Plus, it offers sellers a suite of AI tools to help them craft more engaging product descriptions, images, and advertisements.\n\nAmazon is also home to the world's largest cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which designed its own AI data center chips, called Trainium and Inferentia; its own family of large language models (LLMs), called Titan; and even its own virtual assistant, called Amazon Q. Plus, Amazon invested $4 billion in leading AI start-up Anthropic, which now uses AWS as its primary cloud provider and has committed to training its future models using Amazon's chips.\n\nAmazon hopes this will entice other start-ups and AI developers into the AWS ecosystem, giving it the edge over competitors like Microsoft Azure.\n\nAmazon's valuation surpassed $2 trillion just last week on the back of its surging stock, which currently trades near an all-time high. That momentum is likely to build as the company reaps more rewards from its aggressive expansion into AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in July",
        "content": "A boom in the artificial intelligence (AI) market at the start of 2023 kicked off just when tech stocks needed it most. Companies were dealing with the aftermath of an economic downturn the year before, which led the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector to plunge 40% in 2022. However, the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT seemed to breathe life back into the industry and reminded investors of the vast growth potential of tech stocks. As a result, the same index has soared 88% since Jan. 1, 2023.\n\nCompanies across tech have ventured into AI, an industry projected to hit close to $2 trillion in spending by the decade's end. The generative technology can potentially boost countless sectors as demand for AI services and the chips that make them possible soar.\n\nDespite this explosion of growth in the past 18 months, it's not too late to invest in the market and profit from its long-term development. Here are two AI stocks to buy hand over fist in July.\n\n1. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has been slightly overlooked amid the rally in AI. While rivals like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) have seen their stocks rise 745% and 144% since the start of last year, Intel's share price has increased a more moderate 18%. A series of challenges over the last decade have made Wall Street weary, including lost market share in the chip industry and the end of a lucrative partnership with Apple.\n\nHowever, Intel has announced significant structural changes in its business model over the last year that could trigger a change in fortunes for the chipmaker. The company is shifting its focus to two high-growth markets: AI and manufacturing. Consequently, Intel unveiled its Gaudi 3 AI accelerators this year, which undercut Nvidia in price and offer similar performance.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is building chip plants throughout the U.S. as it works to retake the top spot in manufacturing and become the primary chip fab in the country. The move could allow Intel to profit from rising chip demand across the market as companies like Nvidia and AMD outsource their manufacturing. INTC PE Ratio Chart\n\nMoreover, the data in the table above shows Intel's stock is a bargain compared to its competitors. Its considerably lower price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) suggests its stock offers far more value, making it a no-brainer this July.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nLike Intel, Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock is trading at a significantly better value than its rivals. The company is in steep competition with cloud giants Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) as AI has boosted the entire industry. Alphabet has the third-largest market share in cloud computing (after Microsoft and Amazon), yet is quickly catching up.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, the chart below shows Alphabet's shares potentially offer far more value than its rivals. The Google company's lower P/E and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios suggest Alphabet could be one of the best-valued stocks in AI. AMZN PE Ratio Chart\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Alphabet's revenue rose 15% year over year to $81 billion, beating analysts' expectations by nearly $2 billion. The company profited from a 14% spike in Google Services revenue and a 28% increase in Google Cloud sales. Alphabet's cloud revenue growth is especially impressive as it beat Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services in cloud growth for the quarter, with sales for those platforms rising 21% and 17% year over year.\n\nCloud computing has become a crucial growth area in AI as businesses increasingly use such services to integrate the technology into their workflows. As a result, Alphabet has invested heavily in expanding its AI offerings over the last year, introducing new tools to Google Cloud, adding generative features to Google Search, and improving its ad services.\n\nAlphabet hit $69 billion in free cash flow this year, only strengthening the argument for its stock. The figure suggests the tech giant has the financial resources to continue investing in its business and keep up with its rivals. That, alongside its bargain price point, makes Alphabet a stock to buy hand over fist this month.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Google’s Emissions Shot Up 48% Over Five Years Due to AI",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google’s emissions climbed by almost half over five years, as the company has infused artificial intelligence throughout many of its core products — making it harder to meet its goal of eliminating carbon emissions by 2030, according to a new environmental report from the tech giant.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDemocrats Weigh Mid-July Vote to Formally Tap Biden as Nominee Powerful Storm Beryl Aims at Jamaica After Grenada Strike S&P 500 Closes Above 5,500 in Record-Breaking Run: Markets Wrap ‘Upflation’ Is the New Retail Trend Driving Up Prices for US Consumers Trump Immunity Ruling Means Any Trial Before Election Unlikely\n\nThe annual report was released Tuesday and covers Google’s progress toward meeting its environmental goals last year. The Alphabet Inc. unit said its greenhouse gas emissions totaled 14.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent throughout 2023. This is 48% higher than in 2019, the company said, and 13% higher than in 2022. Google said higher energy consumption at its data centers and emissions from its supply chain were to blame, and said its push to add AI to its products could make it more difficult to reduce emissions going forward.\n\n“As we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,” Google wrote in the report.\n\nFor several years, the Mountain View, California-based company has said it plans to eliminate such emissions from its operations by 2030.\n\nAI — and in particular generative AI, which takes in user inputs and spits out new content like text, images or songs — is extremely resource-intensive, as a recent Bloomberg News investigation showed. As the technology grows rapidly, more and more data centers are needed to build and run it, leading to surging power requirements.\n\nThe dramatic increase in power demands from Silicon Valley’s growth-at-all-costs approach to AI threatens to upend the energy transition plans of entire nations as well as the clean energy goals of trillion-dollar tech companies. In some countries, including Saudi Arabia, Ireland and Malaysia, the energy required to run all the data centers they plan to build at full capacity exceeds the available supply of renewable energy, according to a Bloomberg analysis of the latest available data.\n\nGoogle is not the first major technology company to cite the rapid growth of AI as an obstacle to achieving environmental goals. In May, Microsoft Corp. said its carbon emissions climbed 30% since 2020, as the company increasingly invested in AI. The increase made that company’s target of getting to below net-zero emissions by 2030 even harder than it was when it announced its carbon-negative goal.\n\nStory continues\n\nSasha Luccioni, climate lead at startup Hugging Face Inc., said the data show tech companies weren’t anticipating the massive growth of AI when they set their environmental goals. “They couldn't have,” she said. “The baseline year in that Google report was 2019 — definitely not anticipating it.” Companies have been blindsided both by how much energy is required to build such technology, Luccioni said, and how much energy is required to run it.\n\nListen on Zero: Microsoft Wanted to be Carbon Negative.

        "title": "Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation",
        "content": "Ever since the Federal Reserve went on a crusade to increase interest rates and slow the progression of inflation at the beginning of 2022, investors have been cheering for a Goldilocks-type of economic soft landing. Last month, this narrative remained intact.\n\nThe S&P 500 index surged +3.5% for the month, the technology-heavy NASDAQ rocketed +6.0% (fueled by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other AI-related companies), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average a more modest +1.1% move thanks to the contribution of older economy stocks.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nDespite the looming presidential election this November and the recent debate, the stock market has continued on a +56% bull market tear since the October 2023-low, eight months ago (see chart below). The not-too-hot, not-too-cold economic data have provided comfort to investors. For example, growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the broadest measurement of economic activity, was positive (+1.4%) during the first quarter and it is expected to modestly accelerate in the second quarter (+2.2%), as forecasted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nIn addition, the job and inflation stories are staying consistent with the soft landing plot line, as well. The unemployment rate has been creeping higher, but currently remains near multi-decade lows at 4.0%. Inflation also continued its downward trend as evidenced by last week's Core PCE inflation data (the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge), which came in at +2.6%, the lowest level since March of 2021 (see chart below). Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nGasoline and food costs are significant inputs to the overall declining inflation dynamics. The two largest crops in the United States are corn and soybeans, and with those prices down significantly year-over-year (see chart below), it should come as no surprise that consumers are finally seeing some relief in skyrocketing food prices. Declining gasoline prices have also chipped-in to the improving inflation outlook. Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nWith all these economic statistics harmoniously aligning with a soft landing scenario, investors are currently comfortable in forecasting one interest rate cut over the next six months, and three and a half interest rate cuts over the next 12 months (see chart below). Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nSource:Yardeni Research\n\nBut a bull market cannot survive on interest rate cut expectations alone. Over the long-run, stock prices generally follow the direction of corporate profits, and as the chart below indicates (red line), fortunately, the path of profits has been rising after a period of stagnation last year.\n\nStory continues Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nSource: Yardeni Research\n\nThe last eight months have been an exhilarating ride in the overall stock market, which has been propelled by the multi-trillion dollar technology companies participating in the A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) buildout revolution (i.e., NVIDIA, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet-Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), et.al.). However, neither trees nor stock markets can grow, uninterrupted, to the sky forever. The recent environment has been jubilant for investors, but party participants cannot go on forever without experiencing a hangover. The best advice is to celebrate responsibly, while managing the risk of your investment portfolio, because eventually the cops will arrive and the party will come to an end.\n\nThis article is an excerpt from a previously released Sidoxia Capital Management complimentary newsletter (July 1, 2024).\n\nDISCLOSURE: Sidoxia Capital Management (SCM) and some of its clients hold positions in individual stocks , certain exchange traded funds (ETFs), including NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL, META, and AMZN but at the time of publishing had no direct position in any other security referenced in this article.

        "title": "Google falling short of important climate target, cites electricity needs of AI",
        "content": "Three years ago, Google set an ambitious plan to address climate change by going “net zero,” meaning it would release no more climate-changing gases into the air than it removes, by 2030.\n\nBut a report from the company Tuesday shows it is nowhere near meeting that goal.\n\nRather than declining, its emissions grew 13% in 2023 over the year before. Compared to its baseline year of 2019, emissions have soared 48%.\n\nGoogle cited artificial intelligence and the demand it puts on data centers, which require massive amounts of electricity, for last year’s growth.\n\nMaking that electricity by burning coal or natural gas emits greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, which warm the planet, bringing more extreme weather.\n\nThe company has one of the most significant climate commitments in industry and has been seen as a leader.\n\nLisa Sachs, director of the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, said Google should be doing more to partner with cleaner companies and invest in the electrical grid.\n\n“The reality is that we are far behind what we could already be doing now with the technology that we have, with the resources that we have, in terms of advancing the transition,” she said.\n\nGoogle Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt told The Associated Press, “Reaching this net zero goal by 2030, this is an extremely ambitious goal.\n\n“We know this is not going to be easy and that our approach will need to continue to evolve,\" Brandt added, \"and it will require us to navigate a lot of uncertainty, including this uncertainty around the future of AI’s environmental impacts.”\n\nSome experts say the rapidly expanding data centers needed to power AI threaten the entire transition to clean electricity, an important part of addressing climate change. That's because a new data center can delay the closure of a power plant that burns fossil fuel or prompt a new one to be built. Data centers are not only energy-intensive, they require high voltage transmission lines and need significant amounts of water to stay cool. They are also noisy.\n\nThey often are built where electricity is cheapest, not where renewables, such as wind and solar, are a key source of energy.\n\nGlobal data center and AI electricity demand could double by 2026, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nOther major tech company sustainability plans are also challenged by the proliferation of data centers. They caused Microsoft's emissions to grow 29% above its 2020 baseline, the company said in an environmental sustainability report in May.\n\nTech companies make the case that AI, including tools such as ChatGPT, is not only partially causing climate change, it's also helping to address it.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the case of Google, that could mean using data to predict future flooding, or making traffic flow more efficiently, to save gasoline.\n\nAmanda Smith, senior scientist at the climate nonprofit Project Drawdown, said those who use AI — both large companies and individuals just making memes — need to do so responsibly, meaning using the energy only when it benefits society.\n\n“It’s up to us as humans to watch what we’re doing with it and to question why we’re doing that,” Smith added. “When it’s worth it, we can make sure that those demands are going to be met by clean sources of power.”\n\nGoogle’s emissions grew last year in part because the company used more energy; 25,910 gigawatt-hours more, an increase from the year before and more than double the hours of energy consumed just four years earlier. A gigawatt-hour is roughly the energy that a power plant serving several hundred thousand households puts out in one hour.\n\nOn the positive side, as Google’s consumption grows, so has its use of renewable power.\n\nThe company said in 2020 it would meet its massive need for electricity using only clean energy every hour of every day by 2030, all over the world. Last year, Google says, it saw an average of 64% carbon-free energy for its data centers and offices around the globe. The company says its data centers are, on average, 1.8 times as energy efficient as others in the industry.\n\nSachs, at Columbia University, credited Google for its ambition and honesty, but said she hopes “that Google would join us in a more rigorous conversation about how to accelerate\" clean energy amid the climate crisis, \"so that it doesn’t get much worse before it starts getting better.”\n\n___\n\nAlexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter.

        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL recently announced the wider availability of a new “Select recipients” user interface (UI) redesign for the Google Messages app on Android.\r\n\r\nThe Google Messages UI now displays five recent conversations, a search button and a contact list. Users can select multiple conversations, select profile avatars and share individually by tapping the \"Next\" FAB.\r\n\r\nAlphabet aims to enhance the user experience of the Google Messages app, thereby increasing its adoption among Android users on the back of its latest UI redesign.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it will enable Google to capitalize on solid growth opportunities present in the global mobile messaging market, which, per a Future Market Insights report, is expected to reach $443.53 billion by 2033, indicating a CAGR of 15.9% between 2023 and 2033.\n\nExpanding Android Offerings Aid Google Services\n\nAlphabet’s shares have rallied 30.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 24.9%. The company is benefiting from strength in the Google Services segment.\r\n\r\nThe latest move to boost Google’s messaging app bodes well for the company’s increasing efforts to strengthen its Android offerings, which play a vital role in driving the prospects of the Google Services segment.\r\n\r\nGoogle recently introduced a new Notifications feature for one of its Android apps, Google Wallet. The Wallet app now has six notification categories, namely, Tips, Purchases, Passes, Transit, Updates & Alerts, and Promotional Campaigns, allowing users to receive transaction notifications from Google Wallet directly instead of Google Play services.\r\n\r\nIt also expanded its YouTube Create video editing app for Android to 13 more countries, including Australia, Brazil, Spain and the United States.\r\n\r\nStrengthening the Google Services segment on the back of growing Android capabilities will, in turn, likely aid the overall financial performance of the company in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $291.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.6%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.60 per share, indicating a 31.03% rise from the year-ago figure. The figure has been revised upward by 0.4% in the past 60 days.\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nStrengthening Android operating system is continuously aiding Alphabet in sustaining its dominance in the global smartphone market against its rival Apple AAPL, which is also gaining solid momentum across its mobile operating system, iOS, which has a loyal customer base.\r\n\r\nPer a Statista report, Android maintained its position as the leading mobile operating system worldwide in the first quarter of 2024, with a market share of 70.7%, whereas Apple's iOS had a market share of 28.5% during the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Garmin GRMN and Badger Meter BMI, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nGarmin shares have gained 30.6% in the year-to-date period.

        "title": "Is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) the Best AI Stock to Stick To During Upcoming Volatility?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of the 10 Best AI Momentum Stocks to Benefit from Volatility Ahead. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWolfe Research has joined the ongoing market correction chorus as more and more experts warn of volatility ahead amid soaring valuations led by AI. Wolfe Research, however, believes investors would stick to mega-cap tech stocks to survive through this volatility.\n\n“Our sense is that volatility will continue to pick up over the summer. However, we expect this to generally benefit the Mag 7, secular growers, and the overall Momentum Trade in the weeks ahead.”\n\nWolfe analysts expect investors to pile into quality stocks that “they can count on” amid economic “data surprises” ahead. The firm expects “these themes to continue to benefit from an environment in which growth is slowing but the Fed is expected to kick off a deep cutting cycle.”\n\n“Further, our sense is that the biggest companies driving these trends will once again put up very solid results during 2Q earnings season.”\n\nSince Wolfe believes investors are poised to stick with Magnificent Seven stocks in the upcoming volatility and called The Information Technology (SPG1200-45)(XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) “big winners”, we picked Mag. 7 stocks and top 3 AI stocks from the XLK for this article. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) the Best AI Momentum Stock to Benefit from Volatility Ahead?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nWolfe believes Mag. 7 stocks like GOOG will see more investor interest this summer amid any volatility.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the company is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrate with other Google apps. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) app is to urge users to sign up for ‘Google One AI Premium’ plan, which has a $19.99 price tag.  Google saw advertising revenue accelerate in Q1 2024, boosted by YouTube in particular growing by almost 21% last quarter. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Momentum Stocks to Benefit from Volatility Ahead. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has Almost 20% of His Pershing Square Portfolio Invested in This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock",
        "content": "The average investor can learn a lot by following some of the professionals in the industry. Take Bill Ackman, whose strategy -- probably influenced by the great Warren Buffett -- focuses on making concentrated bets in high-quality businesses trading at compelling valuations.\n\nAckman's hedge fund firm, called Pershing Square Capital Management, currently manages $10.8 billion in assets. Rather than blindly following his portfolio decisions, investors should try to understand why he owns what he does.\n\nOne of Ackman's top holdings is tech titan Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). Let's look at what factors may have drawn the hedge fund manager's attention to this dominant \"Magnificent Seven\" company.\n\nQuality business\n\nPershing Square first purchased shares in Alphabet over a year ago during the first quarter of 2023. It might be surprising to see it quickly becoming a huge position. But Ackman went so far as to call this \"one of the world's greatest businesses.\" That might be a bold statement, but I wouldn't disagree with his assessment.\n\nMost readers are familiar with Google Search. With 91% share of the global search industry, this is undoubtedly Alphabet's bread-and-butter segment. Ackman calls out its powerful network effects and high barriers to entry.\n\nAcquired by the business in 2006 for over $1.6 billion, YouTube also deserves some attention. Not only does it possess network effects as well, but it supports Alphabet's dominance in the digital ad industry. Ackman believes that the business is well-positioned to continue growing its sales over time due to the shift away from offline advertising to online methods.\n\nAlphabet is poised to benefit from another secular trend, which is cloud computing. As IT spend transitions from on-site to off-premises, Google Cloud should continue its rise. This segment posted a 26% revenue gain in 2023, and it's now generating consistent operating income.\n\nIf you look through the Pershing Square portfolio, you'll realize that Ackman appreciates companies that are in a strong financial position. There are very few businesses in the world that can match Alphabet in this regard. As of March 31, it did carry $13.2 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet. However, the company had $108.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, virtually eliminating any financial risk.\n\nAI leader\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) boom is drawing lots of attention from the investment community. After Chat GPT was first launched in late 2022, the market was worried that Alphabet was falling behind rivals when it came to developing this technology and introducing new features. But Ackman believes that this concern was overblown.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet was using AI in Search as far back as 2001. And nearly all of its offerings, from YouTube and Maps to Gmail and Google Cloud, all utilize AI in some way. The fact that this business has such wide reach means that it can launch new AI features to almost instant adoption. Plus, Alphabet has the financial resources and technological know-how to be one of the leaders in AI going forward.\n\nIs it too late to buy Alphabet stock?\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, Ackman's purchase of Alphabet shares looked like an incredibly timely move. When his firm started buying the stock, it traded at a compelling forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 16. This investment has worked out extremely well thus far, as shares are up 109% in the past 18 months.\n\nOf course, the situation isn't as much of a no-brainer these days. As of this writing, Alphabet stock sells at a forward P/E multiple of 24.4. While not as good as the price Ackman paid, I still think this valuation makes shares a smart buy today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "7 5G Stocks You’ll Regret Ignoring in the Future",
        "content": "The size of the 5G services market is expected to grow from $98.3 billion in 2023 to more than $427 billion by 2028. That equates to forecast compounding annual growth rates above 34% in that period. Those strong figures underpin the need to consider 5G stocks to watch.\n\nMost investors associate 5G with mobile carrier networks. While that is where much of the opportunity lies, 5G also has applications in other markets. Agriculture, smart grids, and other systems will all benefit from the continued development of 5G.\n\nThe 5G opportunity reaches deep across the technology sector creating opportunities in hardware, software, chips, and more. It isn’t simply about mobile networks by any means. That means there are a lot of stock opportunities that touch on 5G that some might not expect. Those hidden opportunities and the massive growth anticipated in 5G create exciting opportunities. Let’s learn more about 5G stocks to watch that leverage those opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nT-Mobile US (TMUS) tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facade\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nT-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) is one of the more prominent 5G stocks available to investors. It is a network service provider and, as such, is deeply exposed to the 5G opportunity. Readers will also note that it’s the only pure play 5G opportunity on this list.\n\nThe primary reasons I think investors should consider T-Mobile US are all financial. Some impressive fundamentals lead me to believe that T-Mobile US is headed in the right direction. Due to those improvements, it should be able to capitalize on the 5G opportunity. The company made some impressive improvements in 2023.\n\nDrastic reductions in the cost of revenue and other reduced expenses led to much higher operating income. The result was net income increased by nearly $6 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, T-Mobile US reduced the number of shares outstanding, leading to a bigger pot of earnings and fewer shareholders to pay. That all suggests that the stock will reward shareholders. As the 5G opportunity grows, that pot could grow as well.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is primarily known as an AI chip stock. Most of the potential and excitement around the stock stems from its positioning as the second-best AI chip maker on the market. However, AMD is also a company to watch concerning 5G.\n\nAMD continues to collaborate with other well-known chip makers, including Samsung. Those two firms are collaborating to advance 5G virtualized RAN. The virtualization of RAN is transforming traditional Radio Access Network hardware into software.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD is clearly, therefore, also a part of the development of low-latency, high-efficiency networks necessary for the continued development of 5G. Samsung is leveraging new AMD EPYC 8004 processors in the collaboration. Those sales are yet another reason to consider AMD at the moment. The company has a massive opportunity in data centers and all things AI. Yet, AMD is also at the forefront of technological development elsewhere.\n\nAMD provides excellent exposure to multiple high-growth opportunities moving forward. 5G and AI are two of the more prominent opportunities in that regard.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) primarily focuses on 5G semiconductor solutions. As this article notes, the company is not particularly well-known outside of industry circles, but is a prominent supplier of 5G equipment. Its strong association and relationships within the 5G industry have been a blessing and a curse at the same time.\n\nMarvell Technology is the only supplier of physical layer-up chips to Nokia (NYSE:NOK). The company also made important connections with RAN leaders, including Samsung. As good as all of that sounds, the RAN market has suffered lately as the broader 5G opportunity continues to disappoint to a degree.\n\nAnalysts continue to be keen on Marvell Technology and its stock. The company is an auxiliary player in the AI market. Some of its digital signal processors connect GPUs that dominate the markets. Marvell Technology is more heavily associated with the 5G opportunity than the AI one.\n\nIf and when that opportunity reaches its potential, MRVL stock should grow rapidly.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Logo of Alphabet (GOOG) website displayed on the screen of the mobile device. alphabet logo visible on display of modern smartphone on white\n\nSource: turbaliska / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is such a large and expansive company that many of its opportunities often get lost. Yet, the stock is very much one to watch in relation to 5G.\n\nOne of the main reasons to watch Alphabet in relation to 5G is the delivery of wireless services to enterprise customers via the cloud. Cloud infrastructure is widely expected to play an integral role in the delivery of 5G wireless deployments. For that reason, the big three cloud operators are all expected to offer exposure to 5G opportunities.\n\nThe 5G opportunity is not the driving force behind GOOG stock and its success. Ad revenues from search are much more important to the company. Fortunately, the company has recovered there. Google’s Cloud segment also continues to grow, which is where much of that 5G opportunity lies. That means there are multiple reasons to consider investing in GOOG stock, 5G being one of them.\n\nRogers Communications (RCI) The logo for Rogers Communications displayed on an office building.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nRogers Communications (NYSE:RCI) is a 5G stock to watch, but it generally doesn’t get a lot of attention. Rogers Communications continues to be downplayed because it’s a Canadian company. For better or worse, Canadian companies don’t garner much attention in the U.S. stock market.\n\nThe company is a broad communications firm offering wireless, cable, voice and more. I believe that Rogers Communications is worth paying attention to for the growth the company has experienced over the past few years. Between 2020 and 2023, overall revenues grew by nearly 40%.\n\nRogers Communications owns Canada’s only true national 5G radio access network. Its 5G Network covers 2,200 communities across the nation. Rogers secured nationwide 5G spectrum with its winning bid for 3.8 GHz spectrum in November 2023. Its shares are rated a “buy” and have the potential to double or more over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) Where and Why You Can Steal Cisco Stock\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a strong enterprise 5G provider. The company offers private 5G across a diversity of industries. It made a strong name for itself as an ultra-reliable hardware provider. Cisco also offers private 5G networks at the enterprise level.\n\nOutside of the 5G opportunity, there are multiple reasons to consider Cisco Systems. The company is well known to be one of the more reliable tech dividend stocks, yielding 3.3%. Dividend yields of 3% aren’t unusual, but that’s relatively high in the tech world.\n\nMy colleague Charles Munyi noted that Cisco Systems is transforming into a recurring software business. That transition offers more predictable, recurring revenues. It is also less exposed to the cyclical ebbs and flows more commonly in the hardware industry. Better margins are another added benefit of a greater overall software exposure. Furthermore, Cisco Systems is exposed to data center AI growth through its switching business.\n\nIridium Communications (IRDM) the Iridium Satellite Communications logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIridium Communications (NASDAQ:IRDM) stock represents a firm that is part telecom company and part space company. The company provides voice and data communication services to governments, non-governmental organizations and consumers.\n\nIt also provides hosted payload services on satellites, satellite handsets, and other products and services that give it a firm footing in the space sector.\n\nEarly this year, the company announced that it plans to make its low Earth orbit constellation compatible with 5G standards.\n\nIridium Communications stands out to me for its fundamentals. The company has experienced strong top line growth over the past five years. However, it’s the last three years that stand out to me. It is within that time frame that the company found overall profitability.\n\nThe company posted its first full year of net earnings in 2022, and those earnings nearly doubled in 2023. This suggests that Iridium Communications is a well-run company that is exposed to the emerging 5G opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "AI meets 'Do no harm': Healthcare grapples with tech promises",
        "content": "Major companies are moving at high speed to capture the promises of artificial intelligence in healthcare while doctors and experts attempt to integrate the technology safely into patient care.\n\n\"Healthcare is probably the most impactful utility of generative AI that there will be,” Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at AI hardware giant Nvidia (NVDA), which has partnered with Roche’s Genentech (RHHBY) to enhance drug discovery in the pharmaceutical industry, among other investments in healthcare companies, declared at the company's AI Summit in June.\n\nOther tech names such as Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Intel (INTC), and Microsoft (MSFT) have also emphasized AI's potential in healthcare and landed partnerships aimed at improving AI models.\n\nGrowing demand for more efficient healthcare operations has had tech companies racing to develop AI applications that assist with everything from appointment scheduling and drug development to billing to assisting with reading and interpreting scans.

(I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) (I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images)\n\nThe overall market for AI in healthcare is expected to grow to $188 billion by 2030 from $11 billion in 2021, according to Precedence Research. The market for clinical software alone is expected to increase by $2.76 billion from 2023 to 2028, according to Technavio.\n\nPractitioners, meanwhile, are preparing for the potential technological revolution.\n\nSneha Jain, a chief fellow at Stanford University's Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, said that AI has the potential to become as integrated with the healthcare system as the internet while also stressing the importance of using the technology responsibly.\n\n“People want to err on the side of caution because in the oath of becoming a doctor and for healthcare providers, it’s first: Do no harm,” Jain told Yahoo Finance. “So how do we make sure that we first do no harm while also really pushing forward and advancing the way AI is used in healthcare?”\n\nPotential patients seem wary: A recent Deloitte Consumer Health Care survey found that 30% of respondents stated they \"don't trust the information\" provided by generative AI for healthcare, compared to 23% a year ago.\n\nThe fear: 'Garbage in, garbage out'\n\nPatients seem to have reason to doubt AI's current capabilities.\n\nA study published in May evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs), which interpret media like images and videos, found that AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4V performed worse in medical settings than random guessing when asked questions regarding medical diagnosis.\n\n\"These findings underscore the urgent need for robust evaluation methodologies to ensure the reliability and accuracy of LMMs in medical imaging,\" the study's authors wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nDr. Safwan Halabi, vice chair of imaging informatics at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, highlighted the trust issues surrounding the implementation of these models by comparing the use of AI in healthcare without testing to the use of self-driving cars without conducting proper test drives.

If a model was trained using health data about Caucasians in Northern California, he said, it may not be able to provide appropriate and accurate care to African Americans on the South Side of Chicago.\n\n\"The data is only as good as its source, and so the concern is garbage in, garbage out,\" Halabi told Yahoo Finance. He added that \"good medicine is slow medicine\" and stressed the importance of safety tests before putting the technology into practice.\n\nBut others, like Dr. John Halamka, president of the technology initiative Mayo Clinic Platform, emphasized AI’s potential to leverage the expertise of millions of doctors.\n\n“Wouldn't you like the experience of millions and millions of patient journeys to be captured in a predictive algorithm so that a clinician could say, 'Well, yes, I have my training and my experience, but can I leverage the patients of the past to help me treat patients of the future in the best possible way?'” Halamka told Yahoo Finance.\n\nCreating guardrails\n\nFollowing an executive order signed by President Biden last year to develop policies that would advance the technology while managing risks, Halamka and other researchers have argued for standardized, agreed-upon principles to assess AI models for bias, among other concerns.\n\n“AI, whether predictive or generative, is math not magic,\" Halamka said. \"We recognize the need to build a public-private collaboration, bringing government, academia, and industry together to create the guardrails and the guidelines so that anyone who is doing healthcare and AI has a way of measuring: Well, is this fair? Is it appropriate? Is it valid? Is it effective? Is it safe?”\n\nThey also stressed the need for a national network of assurance laboratories — spaces to test the validity and ethics of AI models. Jain is at the center of these discussions, as she's starting one such laboratory at Stanford.\n\n\"The regulatory environment, the cultural environment, and the technical environment are ripe for this kind of progress on how to think about assurance and safety for AI, so it's an exciting time,\" she said.

        "title": "Forget AMD in 2024: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Over the last year, increased interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has spotlighted several tech stocks that could enjoy major gains as the industry develops. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has seen its stock soar 150% since the start of 2023, driven primarily by investors' excitement over AI. AMD's second-largest market share in graphics processing units (GPUs) has made Wall Street bullish as similar offerings from Nvidia have flown off the shelves amid the increased demand for the high-powered chips.\n\nHowever, mediocre quarterly results, alongside a soaring share price, have tanked the value of AMD's stock. The company's business hasn't seen a big enough return on its investment in AI, suggesting there could be better options for backing the high-growth industry. AMD PE Ratio Chart\n\nThis chart uses price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to compare the valuations of some of the most prominent names in AI. AMD's stock is by far the worst value, with a P/E of 238. However, two companies stand out as bargains compared to their peers: Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG).\n\nThese companies have expanding ventures in AI that could majorly pay off over the long term, with one investing in AI chip manufacturing and the other quickly growing in AI software.\n\nSo, forget AMD in 2024 and consider buying one of these AI stocks instead.\n\n1. Intel: Delivering growth in multiple areas of its business\n\nIntel investors haven't had it easy in recent years, with its stock down 35% since 2019. The company was once the biggest name in the chip market, dominating manufacturing and boasting a lucrative partnership with Apple as the leading chip supplier for its Macs. However, trouble keeping up with competitors like AMD and Nvidia caused Intel to fall behind and lose market share.\n\nYet, sometimes, the best test of a company is how it responds to challenges, and recent developments suggest Intel could come back strong in the coming years. The chipmaker has increased its market share in central processing units (CPUs) for three consecutive quarters. Since the fourth quarter of 2023, Intel's CPU share has risen from 61% to 64%, while AMD's has fallen from 36% to 33%.\n\nMoreover, recent earnings from Intel further highlight its gradual improvements. In Q1 2024, the company's revenue increased by 9% year over year to $13 billion. The company benefited from a 31% rise in client revenue, representing a spike in consumer sales. Meanwhile, its data center and AI segment posted revenue gains of 5%, with operating income hitting $184 million after the company reported losses of $69 million the year before.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel is restructuring all areas of its business to prioritize long-term profit growth. The company is refocusing its business model around AI and manufacturing, with plans to build at least four plants in the U.S. and more abroad. Intel wants to become the country's leading AI chip manufacturer, which could allow it to profit from rising GPU demand throughout the industry.\n\nWith positive signs of growth and a bargain stock price, it's worth considering Intel stock over AMD in 2024.\n\n2. Alphabet: The best-valued way to invest in AI software\n\nAlphabet is home to some of the most widely recognized brands thanks to products like Android, YouTube, and the many offerings under Google. Alphabet's success has made it the world's fourth most valuable company, with a market cap above $2 trillion. GOOGL Chart\n\nThe tech giant has proven itself as one of the most reliable long-term investments. This year alone, Alphabet has outperformed many of its rivals in stock growth (as seen in the chart above). Yet, it has the lowest P/E out of these companies, indicating it is trading at the best value. Furthermore, Alphabet has the lowest stock price among these tech companies, potentially making its shares the most accessible.\n\nIn addition to trading at a bargain, Alphabet has significant potential in AI. The company was an early investor in the industry, first introducing AI to its search engine in 2001. Then, in 2016, the tech giant became an AI-first company, well ahead of many of its rivals. Its Google DeepMind AI research subsidiary is driving the company's innovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's recently launched AI model, Gemini, could elevate its entire position in the industry by bringing generative upgrades across its product lineup.\n\nAlphabet likely has a bright future in tech and is just too good to pass up at its current price point, making it a screaming buy in 2024 and a better option than AMD.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "New Zealand to press ahead with media content pay law",
        "content": "SYDNEY (Reuters) -New Zealand's conservative coalition government will proceed with a bill that would make it compulsory for digital technology platforms to pay media companies for news, it said on Tuesday.\n\nThe bill is being introduced as New Zealand media companies struggle against technology firms for advertising dollars, leading them to find new ways to provide news programming.\n\nThe Fair Digital News Bargaining Bill, introduced last year by the previous Labour government, will be presented in Parliament with amendments to support \"our local media companies to earn revenue for the news they produce\", Communications Minister Paul Goldsmith said.\n\nThe proposed changes would align it more closely with Australia's digital bargaining law, Goldsmith said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat law, which took effect in Australia in March 2021, gives the government power to force internet firms such as Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Alphabet Inc's Google to negotiate content supply deals with media outlets, if the parties fail to reach an agreement on payments.\n\nMeta said the New Zealand bill ignored the realities of how its platforms work, their voluntary nature, the preferences of users and the free value it provided news outlets.\n\n\"We will continue to be open and transparent with the government and publishers on our business decisions as this bill progresses,\" a Meta spokesperson said in an email.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.\n\nAfter Canada introduced a similar law in 2023, Meta blocked news content from appearing on Facebook there. Meta has also said it plans to stop paying Australian media companies for news and the government is still considering whether to intervene.\n\nGoldsmith said the proposed changes would give power to the communications minister to decide which digital platforms would come under the law. An independent regulator will be appointed as the bill's authority, he said.\n\nOne of the governing coalition's partners, the right-wing ACT New Zealand party, will not support the bill, Goldsmith said, which means it must have the support of other parties to pass.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe opposition Labour party said it would check the amendments but supported the intent of the bill.\n\n\"I am relieved the government is seeing sense and progressing with legislation to make the media landscape fairer for news companies operating online,\" Willie Jackson, Labour spokesperson for media and broadcasting, said in a statement.\n\n(Reporting by Renju Jose in Sydney; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Stephen Coates)",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Google said on Monday it would make it mandatory for advertisers to disclose election ads that use digitally altered content to depict real or realistic-looking people or events, its latest step to battle election misinformation.\n\nThe update to the disclosure requirements under the political content policy requires marketers to select a checkbox in the \"altered or synthetic content\" section of their campaign settings.\n\nThe rapid growth of generative AI, which can create text, images and video in seconds in response to prompts, has raised concerns about its potential misuse.\n\nThe rise of deepfakes, convincingly manipulated content to misrepresent someone, have further blurred the lines between the real and the fake.\n\nGoogle said it will generate an in-ad disclosure for feeds and shorts on mobile phones and in-streams on computers and television. For other formats, advertisers will be required to provide a noticeable \"prominent disclosure\" for users.\n\nThe \"acceptable disclosure language\" will vary according to the context of the ad, Google said.\n\nIn April, during the ongoing general election in India, fake videos of two Bollywood actors that were seen criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi had gone viral online. Both AI-generated videos asked people to vote for the opposition Congress party.\n\nSeparately, Sam Altman-led OpenAI said in May that it had disrupted five covert influence operations that sought to use its AI models for \"deceptive activity\" across the internet, in an \"attempt to manipulate public opinion or influence political outcomes.\"\n\nMeta Platforms had said last year that it would make advertisers disclose if AI or other digital tools are being used to alter or create political, social or election-related advertisements on Facebook and Instagram.\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Mohammed Safi Shamsi and Alan Barona)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A former jet-setting Chicago billionaire was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for a $1 billion fraud at an advertising startup that included investors such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker’s venture capital firm.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDemocrats Weigh Mid-July Vote to Formally Tap Biden as Nominee Trump Immunity Ruling Means Any Trial Before Election Unlikely Beryl Becomes Earliest Ever Category 5 Hurricane in Atlantic ‘Upflation’ Is the Latest Retail Trend Driving Up Prices for US Consumers Trump Isn't Going to Like the Supreme Court's Immunity Decision\n\nRishi Shah, 38, the co-founder of Outcome Health, which provided ads on TVs in doctors’ offices, was convicted of more than a dozen fraud and money laundering charges by a federal jury last year. He and two other Outcome executives were sentenced last week in Chicago by US District Judge Thomas Durkin, the US Attorney’s Office said in a statement Monday.\n\nProsecutors had sought a 15-year sentence, describing Shah as the “driving force behind a dizzying array of lies to clients, lenders, investors and an audit firm.” He and the other executives were accused of lying to pharmaceutical company clients and taking money for ads that were never placed, and then misrepresenting the health of the company to investors.\n\nBefore the fraud was revealed in a 2017 Wall Street Journal article, Shah was a budding star in Democratic circles. Shah got the idea for Outcome — then known as Context Media Health — in 2006 while he was a student at Northwestern University just north of Chicago, and the company’s rapid rise over the next decade boosted his public profile. Then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel declared at a company press conference, “as Outcome goes, so goes Chicago.”\n\nOversold Ads\n\nBut Outcome’s claims of exponential revenue growth were driven by fraud, as the company sold more ads than it could broadcast and lied to clients like pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk A/S about the size of its network of TVs in doctors’ offices, according to prosecutors and securities regulators.\n\nThe company’s surge in cash from ad sales and financings allowed Shah to extract hundreds of millions of dollars from Outcome to live a lavish lifestyle, with weekend trips on private yachts and jets as well as a $10 million home, the government said. After raising more money from lenders and investors based on bogus financial statements in 2016, Shah’s net worth was reported at more than $4 billion, prosecutors said.\n\n“Outcome’s former executives deceived their clients, their auditor, their lenders, and their investors for years,” Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, said in the statement. “Their sentences should serve as yet another reminder that ‘faking it until you make it’ is not an acceptable practice for any business.”\n\nStory continues\n\nShah told the judge last week in a prepared statement that he was “ashamed and embarrassed” by his failure to properly manage the company’s aggressive push for growth, which led to “a number of fatal mistakes” that included not tracking the delivery of ads paid for by clients.\n\n“The culture I created permissioned people on my team to think it was okay to create false data in response to client questions,” he said in the statement, which was filed with the court.\n\nShah was convicted in April 2023 along with Outcome President and co-founder Shradha Agarwal and Chief Financial Officer Brad Purdy. Prosecutors had sought 10-year sentences for Agarwal, 38, and Purdy, 35. But Durkin sentenced Agarwal to three years in a half-way house and Purdy got two years and three months in prison.\n\nA group of funds, including those owned by Goldman, Alphabet and Pritzker, were among the investors that sued Outcome in 2017, claiming fraud tied to a $487.5 million fundraising that year that led to a $225 million dividend pocketed by Shah and Agarwal.\n\nIn addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Shah, Agarwal, Purdy and former chief growth officer Ashik Desai, claiming they used false financial statements to raise cash. Desai and two other Outcome employees pleaded guilty to charges before the criminal trial against the company’s top executives.\n\nThe criminal case is US v. Shah, 19-cr-00864, US District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America Japan’s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found The FBI’s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Supreme Court Sends Social Media Laws Back to Lower Courts",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The US Supreme Court sent a pair of cases about state laws that restrict social media content curation back to lower courts, ruling there isn’t enough information about how the laws apply to Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and other major tech companies.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDemocrats Weigh Mid-July Vote to Formally Tap Biden as Nominee Trump Immunity Ruling Means Any Trial Before Election Unlikely Beryl Becomes Earliest Ever Category 5 Hurricane in Atlantic ‘Upflation’ Is the Latest Retail Trend Driving Up Prices for US Consumers Trump Isn't Going to Like the Supreme Court's Immunity Decision\n\nVoting 9-0, the court said the Republican-backed Texas and Florida measures require further analysis, declining to decide whether they’re constitutional. The court did find that the lower courts failed to properly assess the First Amendment issues central to the dispute — though the case elicited five different opinions from the justices.\n\nThe ruling is a partial victory for trade groups representing the tech companies that argue they have the right to moderate their sites as they see fit, in the run-up to the November election and beyond.\n\nBoth laws seek to prevent the companies from removing certain kinds of political speech, a response to claims that platforms like Meta’s Facebook and Google’s YouTube censor conservatives. The court said the states shouldn’t curtail the editorial decisions of the social media companies.\n\n‘Vision’ of Balance\n\n“A state may not interfere with private actors’ speech to advance its own vision of ideological balance,” Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the court. She compared the social media platforms’ curation to editors shaping news coverage.\n\n“The principle does not change because the curated compilation has gone from the physical to the virtual world,” she wrote.\n\nDespite the unanimous decision, a raft of concurring opinions in the case exposed stark divisions among the justices over whether the laws might violate the First Amendment’s free speech protections — and signaled how the court might split on such cases in the future.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Sonia Sotomayor joined Kagan’s opinion, while Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson joined it in part. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas and Barrett filed concurring opinions with some disagreements over the details of the cases.\n\nAnd both Thomas and Alito lambasted the others for making what they said were sweeping statements about the First Amendment’s application to social media content curation.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeplatforming Trump\n\nThe laws, backed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, were enacted in response to decisions by some platforms to oust former President Donald Trump from their sites after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The court in particular challenged the Texas law, which bars large platforms from discriminating based on “viewpoint.” Kagan wrote that the law is “unlikely to withstand First Amendment scrutiny.”\n\n“This court has many times held, in many contexts, that it is no job for government to decide what counts as the right balance of private expression,” she wrote.\n\nThe Florida law includes a dozen major provisions, including a requirement that platforms provide a “thorough rationale” for each content moderation decision. The law says they can’t deplatform political candidates or use an algorithm to limit the visibility of their posts or posts about them. Platforms also can’t censor or ban journalists based on what they say online.\n\nThe case arrived at the high court even as social media companies were pulling back from their efforts to combat political falsehoods online. The shift has been especially dramatic at X, formerly Twitter, which owner Elon Musk has said he intends to make into a bastion of free speech.\n\nOnerous Rules\n\nThe trade groups – NetChoice LLC and the Computer & Communications Industry Association – said the laws would impose onerous and confusing restrictions. They argued that the Texas measure would unconstitutionally bar platforms from removing neo-Nazi and Ku Klux Klan screeds or Russian propaganda about its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“Today’s ruling from the Supreme Court is a victory for First Amendment rights online,” said Chris Marchese, director of Netchoice’s litigation center.\n\nBut two of the conservative justices in particular, Alito and Thomas, criticized the court for declaring that the First Amendment likely protects Facebook’s right to curate its News Feed and YouTube’s right to curate its video-sharing platform. Thomas has previously said the social media companies should be subject to stricter government scrutiny because they have become powerful communication tools with the power to restrict certain viewpoints.\n\nIn an opinion supported by Thomas and Justice Neil Gorsuch, Alito wrote that the Kagan opinion “unreflectively assumes the truth of NetChoice’s unsupported assertion that social-media platforms — which use secret algorithms to review and moderate an almost unimaginable quantity of data today — are just as expressive as the newspaper editors who marked up typescripts in blue pencil 50 years ago.”\n\nDanger of ‘Embarrassments’\n\nWhen faced “with the application of a constitutional requirement to new technology, we should proceed with caution,” he wrote. “Premature resolution of such questions creates the risk of decisions that will quickly turn into embarrassments.”\n\nAll the justices criticized the tech companies’ decision to bring a “facial” challenge, an approach that normally requires a litigant to show that all aspects of the law are unconstitutional. Barrett, in her concurrence, wrote that it was difficult to determine how the laws will apply to services like Uber and Gmail.\n\nIn his concurrence, Thomas took issue with the facial challenge’s targeting the laws’ constitutionality rather than simply how the laws regulate the sites. Such challenges force courts “to take a maximalist approach,” he wrote.\n\nThe Atlanta-based 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals had blocked most of Florida’s law as probably violating the First Amendment. The New Orleans-based 5th Circuit upheld the Texas law but left the measure on hold to allow time for an appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Florida case is Moody v. NetChoice, 22-277. The Texas case is NetChoice v. Paxton, 22-555.\n\n--With assistance from Erik Larson.\n\n(Updates with fresh details and context throughout, starting in second paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America Japan’s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found The FBI’s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Supreme Court handed a temporary win to social media giants like Facebook (META), YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL), and TikTok as it sent a set of free-speech cases back to the lower courts.\n\nBut the unanimous decision left unsettled the question of whether states can strip dominant social media companies of their power to unilaterally block users or remove posts that express certain viewpoints.\n\nThe set of cases before the high court challenged state laws in Florida and Texas limiting the capacity of such platforms to moderate posts.\n\nBoth laws were passed due to concerns following the Jan. 6, 2021 US Capitol attack that the platforms had restricted or removed posts expressing conservative viewpoints. The US Capitol building in Washington. REUTERS/Jim Bourg (UNITED STATES) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nWhat the Supreme Court decided to do Monday was to send these Florida and Texas cases back to lower courts, explaining that the Eleventh Circuit and the Fifth Circuit failed to properly analyze so-called \"facial\" challenges to the state laws.\n\nSuch challenges attack an entire law as unconstitutional, as opposed to challenges that allege a law, or part of a law's application to a particular party, is unconstitutional.\n\n\"Today’s ruling from the Supreme Court is a victory for First Amendment rights online,\" said Chris Marchese, director of the NetChoice Litigation Center.\n\nNetChoice, a technology organization that advocates for Big Tech companies including Yahoo Finance, opposed both laws and was involved as a plaintiff in the Texas dispute and a defendant in the Florida matter.\n\nIt argued that, like newspapers or other editorial decision-makers, social media companies are entitled to their own First Amendment right to decide which statements by third parties are permitted on their platforms.\n\nThe Florida law blocked companies from removing content posted by \"journalistic enterprises,\" and from de-platforming qualified political candidates.\n\nIt also prohibited deprioritizing candidate-related posts and said platforms must notify and explain to users when they censor their speech. The law further required the platforms to apply their content moderation rules consistently to all users. The Supreme Court in Washington. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe Texas law said major social media platforms must not remove posts that express a \"viewpoint.\" And like the Florida law, it said platforms must individually explain each decision to moderate a user's post.\n\nAn appellate court upheld the Florida law, and a separate appellate court blocked Texas's legislation.\n\nSocial media companies have long pushed back against regulation that interferes with their editorial control over content by invoking Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The act immunizes the platforms from liability for content contained in user posts.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The irony of both the Texas and Florida laws is that they invoke journalistic liberty to force social media platforms to host speech they don’t like,\" Cliff Davidson, a partner at Snell & Wilmer, told Yahoo Finance before the high court's decision was rendered.\n\nThe laws, he said, could be difficult for social media companies to interpret and follow because their application to carry content from \"journalistic enterprises\" depends on the amount of content an enterprise creates or the number of its paid subscribers or users.\n\nBut \"it’s unclear how a social media platform is supposed to determine what content these laws protect day-to-day\" because the laws are silent on how those figures are determined, how long the minimums must be met, and whether the reported number of users must be verified.\n\nThe court also issued a decision in another case this term that challenged the editorial power of social media platforms.\n\nThe case — Murthy v. Missouri — questioned whether federal government officials and agencies infringed on First Amendment rights by encouraging social media platforms to remove their posts during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe officials encouraged platforms to remove posts that the administration deemed misinformation and to combat false health-related information.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling, the court held that the plaintiff states and social media users in the case lacked standing — the legal right to challenge the administration in federal court.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Apple's China issues could hamper iPhone sales in 2025: Analyst",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is expected to launch its next-generation AI-centric iPhone in September, but the company's Apple Intelligence software platform may not be enough to spark a new sales supercycle in 2025. That's according to UBS Global Research analyst David Vogt, who says Apple's market share losses in China to homegrown companies like Huawei, act as a \"material governor on iPhone unit growth.\"\n\nApple is heavily dependent on iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market by total revenue behind the Americas and Europe. In 2023, China accounted for $72.56 billion of Apple's $383.3 billion in revenue. The Americas brought in 162.6 billion, while Europe made up $94.3 billion.\n\nThe resurgence of Huawei, which was initially kneecapped by US sanctions on high-powered smartphone chips in 2019 but has since released phones with sufficiently advanced chips, has meant increased competition for Apple in China. That, coupled with a tepid economic environment, led to slower iPhone sales in the region in the early part of the year.\n\nApple has attempted to goose sales for Chinese consumers, offering deep discounts across the Greater China market. And by some measures it's working. According to Bloomberg, iPhone shipments increased as much as 50% in April and 40% in May.\n\nDespite those gains, Huawei could still pose a threat to Apple's growth in China. To counter that, and build sales in other regions, the company announced its new Apple Intelligence platform during its WWDC event in June. But according to Apple, the software, which infuses generative AI technologies across apps ranging from Messages and Photos to the iPhone's Calculator app, requires powerful processors only found in the iPhone 15 Pro line and, presumably, future iPhones.\n\nThat means users who want to take advantage of Apple Intelligence but have older iPhones or even the standard iPhone 15 will have to pony up to use the new software.\n\nStill, Apple isn't the only company rolling out generative AI technologies. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Samsung have already debuted their own generative AI-powered smartphones, and you can expect more Android device makers to do the same.\n\nSamsung is also gearing up for its annual Unpacked event next week, where it is expected to launch its newest foldable phones, while Google is aiming to announce its own updated Pixel smartphone lineup in August.

        "content": "I’ve got a surprising fact for you:\n\nNew technologies are often astonishingly S… L… O… W… to take off.\n\nIn 1950, there were only 25 million registered vehicles in America, or one for every six people. Though Henry Ford had introduced the Model T more than four decades earlier, many families still saw no reason to buy a car.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat’s because, besides “working,” cars — like all new technologies — needed three other ingredients to succeed:\n\nInfrastructure. Cars need roads, gas stations and service centers. Culture. People must want to drive. Incentives. Car-friendly regulations need to be in place.\n\nIn the automobile’s case, the technology required the National Highway System expansion of 1955, suburbanization and a rise of American car culture before it could truly take off. By 1970, there were 118 million cars on the road. By 1990, almost 200 million.\n\nThe automobile also illustrates how these three ingredients develop in phases. The Official Microsoft Blog calls December 20, 1922, “The Day the Horse Lost Its Job” after New York City’s last horse-drawn fire wagon was replaced with a motorized engine. Streetcar usage declined soon after, when motor cars began clogging up streets. It would take several more decades for railways to eventually succumb; between 1967 and 1972, six major railroads went bankrupt after competition from trucks and other intermodal transport options ate into profits.\n\nThe same was true for the fax machine, the personal computer and … even the internet. Infrastructure, culture and incentives are built in stages. That’s why Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) “beat” booksellers decades ago, yet still has trouble competing against fresh grocers and big-box stores like Costco (NASDAQ:COST).\n\nToday, the same battle is taking shape with artificial intelligence.\n\nSome businesses will survive for decades against this new technology. Surgeons, structural engineers and hang-gliding instructors all work with life-or-death situations. So, while AI might enhance the jobs in the near term, it would take significant cultural and regulatory shifts to replace these positions with AI.\n\nBut other companies are already beginning to struggle. These firms are finding themselves on the wrong side of history… and are failing to mount a counteroffensive.\n\nThis week, the writers and analysts at InvestorPlace.com consider three categories of firms – and nine stocks among them – that are especially exposed to “losing their job” in these early days of artificial intelligence…\n\nLow-End Content Creation: Where AI Will Hurt the Most A photo of a person's hands on a laptop keyboard. Several notebooks are on a desk surrounding the laptop.\n\nSource: Undrey / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThe lowest-hanging fruit for an AI takeover may be generic content creation – the stock imagery, clickbait articles and other low-quality content you see online.\n\nThat’s because AI already has the three ingredients to compete:\n\nInfrastructure. AI-generated content is now often indistinguishable from generic human-created stuff. Culture. Consumers are becoming more accepting of low-quality AI-generated content. Incentives. Regulations around AI-generated content is lax, so companies have an incentive to cut costs by using AI.\n\nNBC, for instance, found it wise to launch an AI version of announcer Al Michaels to read sports recaps from the Paris 2024 Olympics. Similarly, here are three companies that could soon see their content-producing “jobs” replaced by AI:\n\nShutterstock (NYSE:SSTK). This week at InvestorPlace.com, Thomas Niel notes that Executive Chairman Jonathan Oringer is selling millions of dollars’ worth of shares into strength – a big red flag in his book. The company specializes in stock images and footage, which are at risk of being replaced by AI-generated content. IZEA Worldwide(NASDAQ:IZEA). InvestorPlace Chief Investment Analyst Luke Lango previously turned bearish on this content creation firm… in 2021. He saw how much trouble the firm’s influencer-marketing-as-a-service was running into. Now, at InvestorPlace.com, we note how the firm is missing on earnings and revenues – a bearish sign of more losses to come. Fiverr International (NYSE:FVRR). In April, Ian Bezek noted that there were good reasons to be skeptical of Fiverr, an online marketplace for freelancers offering their services. He notes that AI will be able to perform many rudimentary tasks offered by Fiverr in coming years. A recent 20% price spike now gives investors an ideal window to take profits.\n\nMidtier Services: The Next to Fall A stack of open textbooks on a table in front of a chalkboard background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nProfessional services will be the next area to worry about. This segment still lacks some of the infrastructure required to turn AI into usable products. (Data collection remains a fragmented and incomplete industry, making it difficult to train specialized AI.) There’s also a culture issue of relying on AI to do important (though nonessential) tasks. The IRS will probably reject “AI did my taxes” as a reason to waive tax penalties.\n\nNevertheless, it’s only a matter of time before AI grows “smart” enough to compete. Our analysts find two companies that are already seeing earnings drop as a result.\n\nChegg (NYSE:CHGG). Louis Navellier and his team note that Chegg is facing some critical problems due to the rise of artificial intelligence. Generative AI platforms are able to help students – and even do work for them – cutting into demand for the homework assistance and online tutoring services that Chegg provides. Earnings are expected to slide 8% this year. 2U (NASDAQ:TWOU). Muslim Farooque warned in January that online education firm 2U was struggling with mounting debt costs and continuous cash burn. Shares have fallen 82% since that article. The rise of AI is now compounding this issue, because chatbots are increasingly able to tutor and help with homework. This month, 2U announced it will do a 1-for-30 reverse stock split, which is a historic sign of more losses to come.\n\nCrowding Out: The Small Become Smaller a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFinally, the rise of AI will favor larger tech companies with access to data and enough computing power to use it. To borrow the same automobile example from earlier, it’s like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) or General Motors (NYSE:GM) using its dominant positions in the 1920s and 1930s to develop more powerful and efficient engines, crowding out smaller players like Brewster, Durant Motors and hundreds of others.\n\nThat puts smaller firms at a disadvantage, as the writers at InvestorPlace.com note this month. AI is already consolidating some fragmented markets, and the trend will only continue as artificial intelligence widens this gap between the “haves” and “have-nots.”\n\nVeritone (NASDAQ:VERI). Muslim Farooque observes that this AI-powered media and advertising company is at the mercy of Amazon. Veritone relies on the tech giant for 30% of its sales, and its data intelligence offerings could be quickly eclipsed if the tech giant horizontally expands into the space. Viktor Zarev goes further and calls Veritone another generic AI service provider with no competitive moat. BigBear.ai Holdings (NYSE:BBAI). Ian Bezek writes how this AI data mining and analytics firm is losing significant contracts at a time when larger rivals are growing. “Stop and think about that for a minute,” he notes in a recent update. “In the midst of the biggest imaginable AI boom possible, BigBear.ai’s revenues plunged 22% over the past 12 months.” The company competes directly against public cloud firms like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which have far greater financial resources. SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN). Tyrik Torres calls SoundHound an overhyped stock to sell before it crashes and burns. He notes that the the company’s product is “not very unique” from what is already on the market, which puts it in direct competition with better-funded firms like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung, which have their own top-tier vocal-recognition software. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Finally, Louis Navellier and his team observe this week that Intel continues to fall behind rivals. “AI and foundry growth revival is far from a near-certainty for INTC,” they say. They see shares falling into the mid-$20s by 2025. Analysts predict the firm will only grow its research and development (R&D) budget in the low single-digits through 2027, right as rivals are upping their R&D spending by 60% or more annually.\n\nThe Internet… but 10X Bigger\n\nThe AI developments I’ve been describing are exactly what happened with the internet in the early 2000s. Poorly run firms without the ability to adapt were the first to get wiped out. Service providers like travel agencies were next. Finally, smaller tech players disappeared as large internet firms took over.\n\nAnd almost all new technologies follow this same arc.\n\nBut major technologies and the investing mania that follow them don’t come around very often… maybe once every generation. In fact, Louis Navellier is predicting that AI will be the last major financial mania that he or anyone over the age of 50 will see in time to capitalize on it.\n\nLouis talks about all that – plus what “financial mania” could lead to the rise of a “New America” that’ll be almost unrecognizable to anyone from our generation – in more detail in his brand-new special event, Prediction 2024.\n\nYou can check out that free event by going here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung owned shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).

        "title": "Alphabet (GOOGL) Boosts Zero Carbon Efforts With New Green Power",
        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL is making concerted efforts toward reducing its carbon footprint and achieving its zero-carbon goals. This is evident from the latest strategic step taken by its division, Google.\r\n\r\nThe search giant has bought a stake in a Taiwan-based solar power firm, New Green Power, owned by a fund managed by BlackRock's Climate Infrastructure business.\r\n\r\nGoogle strives to cut its greenhouse gas emissions on the back of its latest move in the Asia-Pacific region, where decarbonization is challenging due to less developed infrastructure and several corporate restrictions.\r\n\r\nIt intends to purchase up to 300 megawatts of renewable energy from New Green Power.\r\n\r\nGoogle is also planning to offer solar power to some of its suppliers and manufacturers in the region in order to reduce its Scope 3 emissions.\n\nZero-Carbon Move Gains Steam\n\nGoogle, which has been carbon-neutral since 2007, is gearing up to achieve net-zero emissions across all of its operations and value chain by 2030. The company aims to reduce 50% of its combined Scope 1, 2 and 3 absolute emissions before 2030. Its global operations are powered by 64% carbon-free energy, including wind and solar, at present.\r\n\r\nRecently, Google partnered with NV Energy, a utility company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, to power its data centers located in Nevada with geothermal electricity. Google strives to boost the amount of carbon-free geothermal electricity from 3.5 megawatts to 115 megawatts into the local power grid for its operations over the next six years.\r\n\r\nWe believe Google’s growing investments in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize its remaining emissions are important as it is witnessing increasing emissions due to solid demand for data-processing capacity to power AI applications.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s shift from fossil fuels to clean energy is anticipated to reduce costs in the near and long term, which is a plus.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe carbon-free drive is gaining strong traction across the technology sector.\r\n\r\nNot only Alphabet but companies like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Lam Research LRCX are also taking strong initiatives to lower overall carbon footprints and cut energy bills substantially.\r\n\r\nAmazon is known as the biggest corporate investor in renewable energy. Its growing investments in the projects have accelerated the pace of its journey toward powering its infrastructure with 100% renewable energy. The goal was initially targeted to be met by 2030, which is now expected to be achieved by 2025. In 2021, the company reached 85% renewable energy across its business.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is gathering steam to become carbon-negative by 2030. Further, MSFT aims to remove all green gas emissions by 2050.\r\n\r\nLam Research is committed to reaching its goal of carbon net-zero emissions by 2050 and operating business on 100% renewable energy by 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this era, investors worldwide not only look at how much a company is capable of generating high profits but also consider how much its business is sustainable for the future. Hence, environmental, social and governance factors have become crucial for building a sustainable business.\r\n\r\nGiven this scenario, Alphabet, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present, is moving steadily toward attaining its zero-carbon goals. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks (Strong Buy) here.\r\n\r\nAlphabet has gained 30.6% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 25%.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL is making concerted efforts to strengthen its Google TV offerings in a bid to boost the viewing experience for its users.\r\n\r\nPer a 9to5Google report, Alphabet’s division Google recently added a slew of Free Ad-Supported Television (FAST) channels to Google TV.\r\n\r\nThe latest additions include ION+, Yahoo Finance, The FBI Files and Property & Reno, among others.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is expected to gain solid traction among smart TV users on the back of these new FAST channels.\n\nGrowing Google TV Efforts Aid Prospects\n\nPer a Statista report, the global smart streaming devices market is expected to witness a CAGR of 8.98% during the forecast period of 2024-2029. Alphabet is well-positioned to capitalize on this solid growth opportunity on the back of its growing Google TV efforts.\r\n\r\nGoogle added a generative AI-powered description feature to Google TV by leveraging its in-house generative AI model, Gemini, to generate auto descriptions for movies and TV shows, reducing viewers’ search time.\r\n\r\nThese AI-generated summaries will be curated to suit a viewer’s personal preferences of a particular genre or actor, catering to their individual interests. It will also allow Google TV to reach a wider audience by translating these summaries into their native languages.\r\n\r\nGoogle has also released a minor refresh with circular app icons and smaller app sizes to Google TV, allowing Chromecast with Google TV to show nearly 10 apps at once compared to the previous seven.\n\nCompetitive Advantage\n\nStrengthening Google TV is helping Alphabet, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present, to compete well against notable industry players like Amazon AMZN and Roku ROKU, which are also making concerted efforts to gain a solid footing in the smart streaming devices market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nAmazon partnered with Microsoft’s MSFT gaming unit, Xbox, in a bid to boost its streaming device offerings.\r\n\r\nWith the Microsoft deal, Amazon will bring a slew of games like Starfield, Fallout 4 and Horizon 5 to its Fire TV stick models, allowing subscribers to play cloud-enabled games directly through the Xbox app on select Fire TV devices.\r\n\r\nRoku, on the other hand, introduced Roku Smart Picture, a set of generative AI-powered features that uses machine learning and content partner data to adjust backlighting, uniformity and colors based on the TV type, thereby automatically optimizing brightness and colors. The platform aims to set a new standard for streaming excellence, ensuring users can automatically set the viewing experience of all Roku TV models.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nStrengthening the Google TV capabilities, along with robust Android, Search and YouTube offerings, will drive the Google Services segment’s performance, which has been a key growth catalyst for Alphabet. The company’s shares have rallied 30.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 24.9%.\r\n\r\nThis apart, Alphabet’s robust cloud division, growing momentum across Google’s mobile search and strengthening generative AI capabilities are other positives.\r\n\r\nThese factors are expected to continue driving the overall financial performance of the company in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $291.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.6%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.60 per share, indicating a 31.03% rise from the year-ago figure. The figure has been revised upward by 0.4% in the past 60 days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Megacap Stocks Hit Record Highs: Should You Buy Into The Hype?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nThe stock market has remained upbeat despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, with the benchmark S&P 500 index and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index hitting all-time closing highs last week. The AI-frenzy drove major tech giants to massive highs, driving the Nasdaq composite index up by over 18% this year.\n\nThe slowing inflation levels have boosted consumer sentiment, propelling hopes for a rate cut soon. According to data released by the Commerce Department, the core personal consumption expenditures price index rose at its slowest annual rate in more than three years in May.\n\nHowever, despite the bullish outlook, broader concerns still linger, raising questions regarding the sustainability of the tech surge.\n\n\"We may see more volatility,\" John Tyner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, said. \"All in all, everyone is enjoying the last 10 months of the market because it's been easy, [but] at some point, the complacency will have to end.\"\n\nApple\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the second-largest company in the world by market capitalization, has been bouncing back lately, with its shares rising over 9% year-to-date.\n\nApple's iPhone sales fell by 10% year-over-year in the quarter ended March 30, 2024, due to slowing demand in China, its biggest market. However, the company has been taking active steps to boost overseas sales by offering steep product discounts. Interestingly, according to a Bloomberg report, Apple's iPhone shipments to China rose by 50% in April and by 40% in May.\n\nApple also approved a $110 billion share repurchase plan last month, marking a 22% increase from the prior year's $90 billion repurchase plan.\n\nThe company hopped on the AI bandwagon by launching Apple Intelligence earlier this month, integrating a custom artificial intelligence system across all its products.\n\n\"Our unique approach combines generative AI with a user's context to deliver truly helpful intelligence. It can access that information privately and securely to help users do the things that matter most to them. This is AI as only Apple can deliver it, and we can't wait for users to experience what it can do,\" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO.\n\nWedbush Securities currently has an \"Outperform\" rating on Apple, with a price target of $275, indicating a potential upside of nearly 30%.\n\nGoogle\n\nShares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have risen by over 30% so far this year, shrugging off sentiment regarding a potential slowdown in the field of AI. The company's better-than-expected earnings report for the fiscal first quarter and its first-ever dividend payout drove share prices significantly. In April, Google's board of directors approved a $70 billion share repurchase program.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, some believe that Google has lost ground in the AI war, as evidenced by Rosenblatt Securities' recent downgrade of GOOGL stock from \"Buy\" to \"Neutral.\" This comes as EU regulators inspect Google's partnership with South Korean phone maker Samsung to embed the former's generative AI technology into the Galaxy S24 smartphone series.\n\n\"We are also sending requests for information to better understand the effects of Google’s arrangement with Samsung to pre-install its small model Gemini Nano on certain Samsung devices,\" said Margrethe Vestager, EU competition chief.\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

        "content": "The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance, the price of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is up an impressive 226% over the last five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 18% gain in the last three months.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Alphabet achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 27% per year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 27% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Alphabet has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Alphabet will grow revenue in the future.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that Alphabet has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 52% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 27%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. Before forming an opinion on Alphabet you might want to consider these 3 valuation metrics.\n\nIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this freelist of companies.

        "title": "Nvidia Led the Market Higher in the First Half of 2024, but Another \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Is Poised to Power the Market in the Second Half",
        "content": "The first half of 2024 has been a strong one for the stock market, and the clear leader driving that growth has been Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The stock of the chipmaker has been on a meteoric rise over the past five years and that momentum continued into the first half of 2024 with the stock up over 150%.\n\nWith the first half of the year now behind us, though, it is time to look for a stock that can potentially help power the market higher in the second half. One candidate is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG).\n\nAll about AI\n\nThe biggest trend in the market in the first half of 2024 was clearly artificial intelligence (AI). Not long ago considered a nascent technology, AI certainly hit the mainstream early this year with numerous tech companies beginning to offer AI-powered features in their products.\n\nThe biggest early beneficiary of this technological shift has been Nvidia, whose graphic processing units (GPUs) are used to build out the infrastructure needed to run AI training and inference. With AI taking off and companies rushing to introduce AI solutions, demand for Nvidia chips has outstripped supply as the company has worked with its manufacturing partners to expand production capacity quickly.\n\nThis has led to explosive growth from the company to start the year, with its first-quarter revenue soaring 262% to $26 billion.\n\nWhy Alphabet could lead the market higher\n\nAI infrastructure was the dominant theme in the first half of the year. But it may be Nvidia's cloud computing customers that help lead the market higher in the second half. The three large cloud computer companies of Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet have all benefited from the rise of AI thus far, but they still have a lot more potential growth coming down the road.\n\nOf the three companies, the one I like the most is Alphabet for a few reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that with the smallest cloud segment of the three, it has some of the best earnings growth potential. The cloud computing business has a lot of high fixed costs associated with it, so companies need to reach a certain level of scale before they become profitable. However, once they do, the operating leverage of the business model starts to kick in and profitability growth will outpace revenue growth.\n\nGoogle Cloud just recently hit this scale and turned profitable last year. As such, the segment should see strong profitability growth in both the second half of this year as well as in future years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSecond, while there have been some kinks with the company introducing new AI overlays with its search results, there is some solid potential for the company in this area. Alphabet traditionally only served up link-based ads on about 20% of its search results and only gets paid when those links get clicks. However, the company is already testing new ad formats both with its AI overlays and well as new AI-powered formats for retailers. With 80% of its search results previously not monetized, this offers a huge potential upside in the years ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet is also the cheapest of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 25. Given this, in addition to its growth prospects, the stock also has the potential to expand its multiples (which is simply when its P/E ratio and other valuation metrics move higher). That sets the stock up for a strong potential performance in the back half of this year. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile I still wouldn't count out Nvidia as leading the market once again in the second half of the year just given how much momentum it is seeing in its business, I think Alphabet is a strong candidate to lead the market forward the rest of this year.\n\nLuckily for investors, you don't have to choose just one and can own both Nvidia and Alphabet. Both continue to have bright long-term futures.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Reuters) - A Russian consortium leading a buyout of Yandex, often dubbed Russia's Google, from its Dutch parent company Yandex NV said on Monday it has received bids from investors to exchange 43.9 million shares as part of the deal.\n\nYandex is being bought by a consortium made up of senior Yandex Russian management, a fund controlled by oil major Lukoil and three other companies owned by businessmen Alexander Chachava, Pavel Prass and Alexander Ryazanov.\n\nIn May, the consortium announced terms for Yandex NV shareholders to either sell their shares or exchange them for shares in the Russian entity, MKPAO Yandex. The offer was open to owners of Yandex NV shares that were purchased on the Moscow or St Petersburg exchanges.\n\nOn Monday the consortium said it had received bids to exchange 43.9 million out of an eligible 50.0 million shares..\n\nA consortium representative said the figure of 43.9 million represented an estimated 99% of eligible Yandex NV shares that were not held in so-called type C accounts.\n\nThe assets of many foreign investors, including both individuals and major U.S. investment funds, have been effectively blocked in type-C accounts since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and was hit by Western sanctions. Assets in these accounts cannot be transferred out of Russia without permission from Russian authorities.\n\nYandex is Russia's dominant tech company with an array of services including ride-hailing and food delivery as well as online search and advertising, where it has gained market share since Alphabet's Google stopped selling online ads in Russia after the start of the war.\n\nThe $5.2 billion sale of Yandex is the largest deal by a Western-held company to exit Russia since the start of the war. It reflects a mandatory discount of 50%, as required by Russian law for the sale of Russian assets by parent companies in what Moscow considers \"unfriendly\" countries.\n\nYandex NV says it expects to rebrand itself and will retain a portfolio of four international businesses plus non-Russian assets, including a Finnish data centre, and minority investments in other tech businesses.\n\n(Reporting by Mark Trevelyan; Editing by Kim Coghill and Louise Heavens)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com — Despite the continued outperformance in the tech space, the market saw a broadening of the rally into more areas of the market over the last few weeks. In fact, the advance-decline ratio (also known as the market breadth indicator), which measures the number of positive stocks against the number of negative ones, hit a 15-month high just last week.\n\nBut were you able to bank on that trend, or are you still buying the same stocks that already rallied in the first half of the year?\n\nThose following our state-of-the-art AI-powered stock strategies for less than $7 a month as part of our exclusive summer sale are in that first bucket.\n\nJust to give you an example: While NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - part of both Tech Titans and Beat the S&P 500 strategies for June - kept on gaining, it was far from the top performer in our list, which had stocks such as Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) (+25% in June) and Autodesk Inc (NASDAQ:ADSK) (+22.75% in June) posting much better numbers.\n\nNot only that, more than a handful of stocks from our list outperformed Nvidia in June, showcasing our AI's impressive ability to pick winners otherwise obscure for most retail investors.\n\nThis has helped both our AI's Tech Titans and Beat the S&P 500 strategies beat the benchmark S&P 500 again in June.

        "content": "By Simon Jessop and Susanna Twidale\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Google said it has taken a stake in Taiwan's New Green Power and could buy up to 300 megawatts of renewable energy from the BlackRock fund-owned firm to help cut its carbon emissions and those of suppliers.\n\nCompanies are being pushed to cut greenhouse gas emissions linked to their operations and value chains by investors and Big Tech firms have been among the most ambitious in their targets.\n\nGoogle aims to constantly run on carbon-free energy wherever it operates. Yet sector growth in demand for data-processing capacity to power artificial intelligence has seen emissions jump.\n\nTaiwan, a major site for Google's cloud technology with a data centre and company offices, still relied on fossil fuels to generate nearly 85% of its power, Amanda Peterson Corio, Google's Global Head of Data Center Energy told Reuters.\n\n\"The goal of this investment is really to support the build out of a large-scale solar pipeline in Taiwan,\" Corio added.\n\nRegions such as Asia Pacific can be harder to decarbonise due to less developed infrastructure and restrictions limiting the ability of corporate users to buy green power.\n\nNew Green Power, owned by a fund managed by BlackRock's Climate Infrastructure business, was one of the leading solar developers and operators in Taiwan, BlackRock's Global Head of Climate Infrastructure David Giordano told Reuters.\n\nGoogle and BlackRock both declined to specify the size of the equity stake being taken in NGP, but Corio said the investment was expected to drive the equity and debt financing for the build-out of its 1 gigawatt (GW) pipeline.\n\nTaiwan is targeting 20 GW of solar capacity by 2025 and up to 80 GW by 2050, BlackRock said.\n\nCorio said that as well as using some of the solar power it buys to drive its own operations, Google would also be able to offer some to its suppliers and manufacturers in the region.\n\nSharing with suppliers would help Google lower its so-called Scope 3 emissions, those tied to its value chain, she added.\n\n(Editing by Alexander Smith)\n\nView comments",

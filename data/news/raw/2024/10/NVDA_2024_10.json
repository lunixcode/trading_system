        "title": "Nvidia and other AI stocks are getting dragged down by Microsoft and Meta",
        "content": "Despite posting robust quarterly profits, Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) shares slumped Thursday as both tech giants signaled substantial future AI spending requirements and slower growth prospects. The companies, which have emerged as leaders in the AI sector, saw their stocks decline despite heavy investments in generative AI that had previously fueled investor optimism.\n\nThe downward pressure rippled through the broader AI ecosystem, dragging down shares of key semiconductor and hardware providers. Nvidia (NVDA) fell 4.5%, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped 2.8%, Micron Technology (MU) slid 4.4%, and Broadcom (AVGO) was down 4.8%. Meanwhile, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) faced an even steeper decline, plummeting 15% amid an ongoing dispute with its auditor. The AI hardware company is now at risk of potential delisting from the Nasdaq, adding further uncertainty for investors.\n\nMicrosoft can’t meet AI demand\n\nIn Microsoft’s (MSFT)  third-quarter earnings report Wednesday evening, it acknowledged that it can’t build data centers fast enough to meet the AI demand. Microsoft’s “inability to build data centres fast enough has constrained its guidance for the coming quarter,” Richard Windsor, founder of Radio Free Mobile, said in a note.\n\nDuring a post-earnings call with analysts, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company has run into external constraints due to high demand for artificial intelligence training and inferencing.\n\n“[Data centers] don’t get built overnight,” Nadella said. “Even in Q2 for example, some of the demand issues we have, or rather our ability to fulfill demand is because of, in fact, external third-party stuff that we leased moving up. That’s the constraints we have.”\n\nThe tech giant’s shares were down over 5% during trading on Thursday, trading at $409 per share. The stock is approaching its worst performance in months, having dropped nearly 2% over the past three months.\n\nMeta is spending a lot on AI\n\nFacebook parent Meta Platforms (META) has invested billions of dollars into artificial intelligence as it looks to keep pace with its Magnificent 7 competitors. The tech giant warned that this spending will only grow into next year and beyond.\n\nChief executive Mark Zuckerberg gave analysts a hint of what some of those investments could look like on a call Wednesday but said the company would offer more details once it finalizes its budget in the fourth quarter.\n\n“First, it’s clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years,” Zuckerberg said. “So, I think we should invest more there.”\n\n“And second, our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure, and I expect to continue investing significantly there too,” he added.\n\nThe shares of Meta were down 3.75% on Thursday afternoon.\n\n– Britney Nguyen and Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

Parameters are the variables a model learns from training data that guide its ability to make predictions.\n\nThe smaller model “makes breakthroughs more accessible to researchers worldwide,” while Cohere’s larger model “offers state-of-the-art multilingual capabilities,” the company said. The multilingual models outperformed open-weight models from Google (GOOGL), Mistral, and Meta (META), according to Cohere.\n\nDenmark’s first AI supercomputer, Gefion Denmark’s King Frederik X, right, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, left, and Danish Centre for AI Innovation A/S CEO Nadia Carlsten power on the supercomputer Gefion at the Vilhelm Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark on October 23, 2024. - Photo: Mads Claus Rasmussen/Ritzau Scanpix (AP)\n\nNvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang and King Frederik X of Denmark unveiled the country’s largest sovereign AI supercomputer, Gefion, this week alongside Danish Centre for AI Innovation A/S chief executive Nadia Carlsten. The country’s first AI supercomputer is named after a goddess from Danish mythology, and is operated by the Danish Center for AI Innovation. The AI supercomputer is an Nvidia DGX SuperPOD powered by 1,528 Nvidia H100 Tensor Core graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nGefion is still being prepared, and will launch in a pilot phase for projects focused on using “AI to accelerate progress, including in such areas as quantum computing, drug discovery and energy efficiency,” Nvidia said.\n\nAmazon One Medical’s new AI tools Amazon One Medical is not pictured. - Illustration: Luis Alvarez (Getty Images)\n\nAmazon One Medical (AMZN) launched new AI tools for its healthcare providers this week to reduce time spent on administrative tasks such as reviewing medical records and taking notes. The new AI tools are integrated into Amazon One Medical’s proprietary electronic health record.\n\nThe AWS HealthScribe takes notes of conversations during patient visits in real-time, which allows providers to engage with patients more, Amazon said. Afterwards, providers can review and update the notes before submitting them.\n\nAnother new AI tool can read, label, and summarize medical records from outside of Amazon One Medical, allowing providers to scan for screening exams, results, and information on medications.\n\nLuminance’s legal AI agent, Agent Lumi Agent Lumi is not pictured. - Illustration: J Studios (Getty Images)\n\nLuminance launched Agent Lumi this week, which combines the company’s proprietary, domain-specific legal large language model (LLM), AI tools, and memory. Agent Lumi “performs tasks and makes decisions without needing human oversight,” the company said.\n\nThe active AI agents can automate legal tasks on top of Luminance’s LLM, which has been trained with over 150 million verified legal documents. Agent Lumi also has short-term and long-term memory, meaning it can “retain and recall information, learning from past interactions with individual users to tailor its actions and responses over time,” according to the company.\n\nLegal AI platform Alexi’s all-in-one platform Alexi’s revamped all-in-one legal AI platform. - Image: Alexi\n\nAI litigation platform Alexi announced an all-in-one platform this week to automate up to 80% of routine legal tasks, allowing litigators more time for “high-impact work,” the company said.\n\nThe upgraded Alexi platform includes new features such as a conversational AI assistant and the ability to analyze and summarize legal documents of any length or format.\n\n“This new Alexi product is built on our strong foundation in AI-generated legal research work products; now, however, we’re revolutionizing the entire litigation workflow,” Mark Doble, chief executive of Alexi, said.\n\nClinical decision support platform, Wound AI Wound AI is not pictured. - Illustration: bymuratdeniz (Getty Images)\n\nReal-time smart application platform Vantiq, Telemedicine Solutions, and NTT DATA launched Wound AI this week, which they call a “state-of-the-art clinical decision support platform” for wound-care treatments. The platform uses generative AI to recommend precise wound care and support for deciding treatments.\n\nWound AI can integrate into existing Electronic Health Records, “and is built on a federated AI model that prioritizes data privacy and security while promoting continuous learning and improvement,” the companies said.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Tech pioneer Intel (INTC) has seemingly missed out on the artificial intelligence boom — and part of it can reportedly be traced back to a decision not to buy the chipmaker at the center of it all almost two decades ago.\n\nIntel’s former chief executive Paul Otellini wanted to buy Nvidia in 2005 when the chipmaker was mostly known for making computer graphics chips, which some executives thought had potential for data centers, The New York Times (NYT) reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. However, Intel’s board did not approve of the $20 billion acquisition — which would’ve been the company’s most expensive yet — and Otellini dropped the effort, according to The New York Times.\n\nInstead, the board was reportedly more interested in an in-house graphics project called Larrabee, which was led by now-chief executive Pat Gelsinger.\n\nAlmost two decades later, Nvidia (NVDA) has become the second-most valuable public company in the world and continuously exceeds Wall Street’s high expectations. Intel, on the other hand, has seen its shares fall around 53% so far this year and is now worth less than $100 billion — around 30 times less than Nvidia’s $3.4 trillion market cap.\n\nIn August, Intel shares fell 27% after it missed revenue expectations with its second-quarter earnings and announced layoffs. The company missed profit expectations partly due to its decision to “more quickly ramp” its Core Ultra artificial intelligence CPUs, or core processing units, that can handle AI applications, Gelsinger said on the company’s earnings call.\n\nAnd Nvidia wasn’t the only AI darling Intel missed out on.\n\nOver a decade after passing on Nvidia, Intel made another strategic miss by reportedly deciding not to buy a stake in OpenAI, which had not yet kicked off the current AI hype with the release of ChatGPT in November 2022.\n\nFormer Intel chief executive Bob Swan didn’t think OpenAI’s generative AI models would come to market soon enough for the investment to be worth it, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The AI startup had been interested in Intel, sources told Reuters (TRI), so it could depend less on Nvidia and build its own infrastructure.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "A London-based autonomous vehicle startup backed by Uber and Softbank is finally going international.\n\nWayve on Wednesday said it would begin testing its self-driving cars on roads in San Francisco and in California’s Bay Area, marking its first on-road trials outside of the U.K. It’s also opening an office in Sunnyvale, right in the “true heart” of Silicon Valley.\n\nThe company has conducted trials on public roads in the U.K. since 2018, the year after it was founded. In May, the U.K. passed a law outlining standards for the rollout of autonomous vehicles in the country by 2026.\n\n“We are now testing our AI software in real-world environments across two continents,” Wayve CEO Alex Kendall said in a statement. “San Francisco’s unique driving conditions offer rich data insights that will be crucial in further developing a global AI platform for automotive customers.”\n\nThe announcement comes just two months after ride-hail service provider Uber said it would join Wayve’s Series C fundraising round, although it didn’t provide an idea of how large that investment would be.\n\nBefore Uber’s involvement, the startup had raised $1.05 billion in that round, which was led by Japanese investment bank Softbank and joined by Microsoft and Nvidia. The seven-year-old company had raised a $200 million Series B in 2022 and a $20 million Series A in 2019.\n\nWayve’s self-driving vehicles are expected to eventually become available on Uber’s network in multiple markets around the world, the companies said in August. Wayve had previously said that its Series C funding will help it expand into new markets, attract global talent, and build geographically diverse data assets.\n\n“Launching our U.S. testing program in California deepens our collaboration with key partners like Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Uber,” Kaity Fisher, Wayve’s vice president of operations and commercial, said in a statement. “Their support in cloud computing, silicon, and mobility services will accelerate the creation of a global ecosystem that will bring our AI-driving technology to automotive partners.”\n\nWayve’s vehicles run on what it calls “embodied AI,” which it describes as the “next frontier of AI innovation.” The technology is intended to allow vehicles to interact with and learn from human behavior in real-world environments. Wayve says its technology has the potential to enhance the safety of autonomous vehicles, which — if perfected — can make the roads much safer for humans.\n\nIts launch in San Francisco comes as the city has become a hub for self-driving cars. Vehicles operated by Google-backed Waymo are a common sight now in the city, where it is the only publicly available robotaxi service. Amazon-backed Zoox has started offering journalistsrides in its vehicles in a nearby suburb and Las Vegas.\n\nUber is working with both Waymo, Wayve, and General Motors’ Cruise, which halted its operations in San Fransisco last year following a safety incident. The company has since returned to the Bay Area with a driver behind the wheel.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) says it has fixed a design flaw in its latest artificial intelligence chips that led to production and shipping delays.\n\nThe chipmaker worked with its partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), to resolve the engineering setback in its highly anticipated Blackwell AI platform.\n\n“It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,” Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said, according to Reuters. “It was 100% Nvidia’s fault.”\n\nThe complexity of the project contributed to the setback. The Blackwell computer involved seven new chip designs that needed to be developed and put into production simultaneously, according to Huang.\n\nThe problems first surfaced in August, when Nvidia’s stock fell around 8% after a report that Blackwell’s production was delayed due to a design flaw, possibly setting deliveries back by three or so months and impacting major customers such as Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nDuring the company’s second-quarter earnings that month, Huang said Nvidia shipped samples of Blackwell to customers and that the AI platform’s production would ramp up in the fourth quarter into the next fiscal year. To “improve production yield,” Nvidia made a change to Blackwell’s GPU mask, the chipmaker said during earnings. However, “there were no functional changes necessary,” Huang said on a call with analysts. The company said it expects to “ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue” in the fourth quarter.\n\n“What TSMC did, was to help us recover from that yield difficulty and resume the manufacturing of Blackwell at an incredible pace,” Huang said during an appearance in Denmark to unveil the country’s first AI supercomputer, Gefion.\n\nThe recovery appears successful. In October, Nvidia shares got a boost after Huang said Blackwell was in full production and demand for the chip was “insane.”\n\n“Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first,” Huang said during an appearance on CNBC.\n\nNvidia stock closed at a record high of $143.71 per share earlier this week ahead of major technology companies’ earnings. The chipmaker’s shares were down 2.9% during Wednesday morning trading but are up around 189% so far this year.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nChipmaker Nvidia closed at a record high on Monday, up more than 4% to hit $143.71.\n\nThis latest advance in share price comes as Wall Street analysts held firm on their bullish outlook on the company.\n\nBank of America (BAC) raised its price target on Nvidia from $165 to $190 per share, citing strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks mixed as UK government borrows £16.6bn in September\n\nInvestment research firm CFRA also raised its price target for Nvidia last week from $139 to $160. Overall, analysts see shares rising to $148.37 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Hopes are high that the market leader in AI hardware will shine in next month’s third quarter report shrugging off weakness seen in other areas of the semiconductor world.\"\n\nNvidia is set to report its third-quarter results on 20 November.\n\nThe rise in Nvidia shares have given it a market capitalisation of $3.53tn (£2.72tn), keeping it behind Apple (AAPL) as the world's second most valuable company.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nTech giant Apple also ended Monday's session at a fresh record high, rising 1.5% to close at $236.48.\n\nShares are up nearly 23% year-to-date, giving the company a market valuation of $3.59tn.\n\nApple hit an intraday last week, also on the back of Wall Street analysts issuing bullish outlooks on the stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley (MS), Bernstein, and Evercore ISI have reiterated their buy ratings on Apple.\n\nRead more: Pound, gold and oil prices in focus: commodity and currency check, 22 October\n\nMeanwhile, positive preliminary iPhone shipment data posted by International Data Corporation (IDC) showed strong demand for Apple's previous smartphone models. Sales were also helped by Apple's rollout of the latest iPhone 16 model.\n\nThat came following concerns over weak demand for the iPhone 16, which had slightly dampened investor enthusiasm around the stock more recently.\n\nApple is set to report earnings on 31 October and Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg expect earnings to rise 9% from last year to $1.59 per share.\n\nSAP (SAP.DE)\n\nShares in German software firm SAP were up nearly 4% in pre-market trading on Tuesday morning, after the company raised its full-year outlook following strong third-quarter results.\n\nSAP reported a 9% rise in total revenue for the third quarter to €8.5bn (£7.1bn) and cloud revenue up by a quarter to €4.4bn.\n\nThe software giant also posted a 29% rise in operating profit to €2.2bn, with earnings per share up 15% to €1.25.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nAs a result, SAP CEO Christian Klein said the company \"confidently\" raising its outlook for 2024.\n\nHe said: \"Cloud revenue growth developed remarkably well in the quarter, especially for our cloud ERP suite. Even more importantly, we are making strong progress on business AI with groundbreaking innovations such as SAP Knowledge Graph. A significant part of our cloud deals in Q3 included AI use cases.\"\n\nSAP said it now expected cloud and software revenue of between €29.5bn and €29.8bn, up from a previous range of €29bn to €29.5bn. The company also lifted its operating profit guidance to between €7.8bn and €8bn, up from €7.6bn to €7.9bn.\n\nHSBC (HSBA.L)\n\nNew HSBC CEO Georges Elhedery, unveiled an overhaul of the bank's structure on Tuesday, dividing the bank into four businesses.\n\nHSBC will operate through four businesses from 1 January: Hong Kong, UK, corporate and institutional banking, as well as international wealth and premier banking.\n\nIn an announcement outlining the changes, HSBC said this was aimed at reducing the \"duplication of processes and decision making\" in the business.\n\nElhedery said: \"The new structure will result in a simpler, more dynamic, and agile organisation as we focus on executing against our strategic priorities, which remain unchanged.\"\n\nRead more: UK borrowing for September was third highest on record in blow for Rachel Reeves\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Elhedery's \"actions are akin to getting the house in order, clearing away clutter and putting things in the right place, before embarking on a new paint job and then thinking about expanding sideways or upwards\".\n\n“It feels as if Elhedery is focusing on what the bank does best,\" he said. \"By combining the commercial and institutional banking operation, HSBC can bring together teams and strengthen the focus on a key target market.\"\n\nIn addition, HSBC announced that it appointed Pam Kaur as group chief financial officer (CFO). Kaur, who joined HSBC in 2013 and is currently group chief risk and compliance officer, is the first woman to hold the role of CFO in the bank's 159-year history.\n\nHSBC shares were flat following the release of these updates on Tuesday morning.\n\nMulberry Group (MUL.L)\n\nLuxury handbag maker Mulberry rejected the increased takeover offer of £111m from Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, calling it \"untenable\" in an update on Tuesday.\n\nMulberry said its board of directors had considered the revised offer from Fraser Group, as well as the \"clear position\" of its majority shareholder Challice Limited, in which it stated it would sell its stake to Frasers or support the offer.\n\nInstead, Mulberry said that the board believed the company \"should focus its attention on driving the commercial performance of the business\".\n\nRead more:The best stocks to buy in the UK, according to Barclays\n\nHowever, the board said that it acknowledged that Frasers, \"through its participation in the company's recent fundraising, has shown itself to be supportive of maintaining the value of the Mulberry brand. The board appreciates this and looks forward to further interactions with Frasers in the future.\"\n\nMould said: “Frasers was never going to win the takeover battle for Mulberry with a bigger shareholder blocking its way.\n\n“The debate now shifts to whether Frasers will keep its stake in the business or whether it will push for Challice to buy it out and take the business private,\" he said. \"There seems little point in Mulberry remaining a listed company if Frasers loses interest after the bid.\"\n\nMulberry shares were trading more than 3% in the red following the news on Tuesday morning.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) closed at a record high Monday as Wall Street anticipates Big Tech’s earnings report in November.\n\nThe chipmaker’s stock rose 4.14% and closed at $143.71 per share, and its shares continued climbing in after-hours trading. Earlier in the day, the company’s stock reached an intraday record high of $142.46, according to Barron’s. Nvidia’s shares are up 198.34% so far this year.\n\nFriday, Bank of America (BAC) raised its price target for the chipmaker to $190 from $165, citing “confidence in NVDA’s competitive lead and generational opportunity.”\n\nResearch analyst Vivek Arya cited “recent industry events,” including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) (TSM) earnings results and Advanced Micro Devices’ AI event, as part of the reason for the price target lift in the Bank of America Global Research report last week.\n\n“We also highlight a growing presence of AI in enterprise, where NVDA is the partner of choice,” Arya said.\n\nLast week, Nvidia set an intraday high after TSMC beat earnings expectations. The chipmaker’s stock briefly climbed over 3% to set an intraday record of $140.89 per share Thursday. The stock’s last record intraday high was on June 20, when it reached $140.76 per share.\n\nMeanwhile, TSMC reported revenue of NT$759.69 billion, or $23.5 billion, for the quarter ending Sept. 30. Third-quarter revenue was up 36% year over year in U.S. dollars, TSMC said, and was up 12.9% from the previous quarter.\n\nShares of Nvidia fell over 4% last Tuesday after closing at a record high $138.07 the previous day. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. The Arrived Homes investment platform has created an Income Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nWhile NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) are “the core drivers of AI, now we are seeing many other tech stalwarts join the AI Party,” Ives wrote, listing Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR), Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL), IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) among the companies making significant moves in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe analyst expressed optimism about the technology sector’s near-term prospects, stating, “We believe the next phase of the AI Revolution has begun.” He expects this momentum, combined with strengthening enterprise spending and a recovery in digital advertising, to push technology stocks higher through the end of the year.\n\nThis expanding AI landscape indicates a broader range of investment opportunities beyond the few companies that initially dominated the AI narrative earlier in the year, according to Ives.\n\nWhile Nvidia and Microsoft are the core drivers of AI, now we are seeing many other tech stalwarts join the AI Party including Oracle, SAP, ServiceNow, Palantir, Salesforce, Dell, IBM, Apple, and AMD among others 🔥🏆🐂🍿 https://t.co/kfpqGZYmYu\n\n— Dan Ives (@DivesTech) October 20, 2024\n\nSee Also:If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy It Matters: The anticipation of a strong third quarter for tech firms aligns with recent trends in the industry. Nvidia remains a top pick within the AI sector, with analysts labeling it a “generational opportunity” due to its dominant market position in AI chips.\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd.‘s (NYSE:TSM) recent earnings, which exceeded expectations due to strong demand for AI chips, further supporting the bullish outlook for tech companies.\n\nAdditionally, the third quarter earnings preview suggests that the tech sector is poised to outperform, while other sectors like energy may face challenges.\n\nThis optimism is further supported by increased ad spending, as seen with Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), where analysts have raised price targets ahead of its earnings report, driven by strong ad spending.\n\nLock In High Rates Now With A Short-Term Commitment\n\nLeaving your cash where it is earning nothing is like wasting money. There are ways you can take advantage of the current high interest rate environment through private market real estate investments.\n\nEquityMultiple's Basecamp Alpine Notes is the perfect solution for first-time investors.

        "content": "It's natural for investors who don't own Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock to think they've missed out. After all, the stock price has soared 243% in just the past year, and 543% over the last three years. But rather than looking back, let's look ahead and see if it has even more room to run.\n\nNvidia isn't just an artificial intelligence (AI) company. It has four business segments, and each one realized sequential quarterly revenue growth as well as year-over-year increases in the latest quarterly period. The data center segment that supports the growing need for advanced AI computer chips is growing the fastest, and there may be plenty more to come. Data source: Nvidia. Chart by author.\n\nPrediction: Another $1 trillion investment coming\n\nBack in February Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made this prediction: \"There's about a trillion dollars' worth of installed base of data centers. Over the course of the next four or five years, we'll have $2 trillion worth of data centers that will be powering software around the world.\"\n\nNvidia already has a market cap of about $3.4 trillion. But if he's right, that's a significant amount of additional sales for the undisputed AI leader. And there's growing evidence that Huang's prediction is playing out.\n\nMicrosoft recently gave investors an idea of just how much its spending on data centers has exploded. In its latest 10-K annual report filed for fiscal year 2024 (ended in June), Microsoft noted that it had $108.4 billion in financial lease commitments for data centers that will commence over the next five years. That's almost $100 billion more than just two years ago, and these leases will run for up to 20 years.\n\nNot many investors saw the explosive growth in AI data centers coming. There looks to be plenty of growth left for that segment, though, and it's a great reason to buy Nvidia stock now. And don't forget its other businesses like automotive and robotics that could follow as progress is made on self-driving cars and businesses seek more automation.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

(NASDAQ:NVDA) experience a remarkable stock surge.\n\nAs per Benzinga Pro, the T-Rex ETF has seen a dramatic 96% decline in investor wealth over the past year. This stark contrast comes as Nvidia’s stock has soared by 221.08% during the same timeframe.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.\r\nThis is a paid advertisement.

Read them carefully before investing.\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nHowever, it is noteworthy that the T-Rex ETF is designed to achieve daily inverse investment results, meaning its long-term performance may not mirror Nvidia’s stock trends. It aims for a daily return of 200% of the inverse of Nvidia’s daily performance, setting it apart from conventional ETFs.\n\nSimply put, this ETF is designed to gain value when Nvidia's stock price decreases and lose value when Nvidia's stock price increases. It achieves this by using derivatives, such as options or futures, to bet against Nvidia’s stock performance.\n\nSee Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin On The Rise As ‘Uptober’ May Be Finally Here: Analysts Predict Bullish Breakout For King Crypto, ETH’s Rally To $3,300\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia remains a leader in the chip industry, with its shares closing up 0.8% at $138 on Friday, boosting its market capitalization to over $3 trillion. Experts like Ram Ahluwalia from Lumida Wealth Management are optimistic about Nvidia’s potential to reach a $4 trillion valuation, citing strong demand for GPU chips.\n\nAdditionally, Dan Niles of Niles Investment Management forecasts that Nvidia’s revenues and stock could double in the coming years, driven by AI investments. Goldman Sachs and Bofa Securities have also increased their price targets for Nvidia, reflecting confidence in its growth prospects.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities In A Shifting Market?\n\nThe changing interest rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) is poised to challenge Apple's (AAPL, Financial) market position as its market capitalization reached an impressive $3.4 trillion, following $3.5 trillion, a figure currently held by Apple. This surge of Nvidia towards a $3.5 trillion market cap is supported by significant investments in Nvidia's AI-centric GPUs by major tech firms such as Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) and Amazon (AMZN, Financial). Recent financial results also show the demand growth for the company's AI chips, including its latest products that are pivotal in AI computing and architecture. Since deep learning has become more and more significant in the artificiafirm's intelligence sphere, Nvidia has had stable growth and can be considered to be a competitor to Apple, becoming the most valuable company in the world. Based on these factors, Nvidia is in a strategic place in the AI hardware business, with good growth and solid financials. This stock could forcefully take on the leadership position of Apple as the most valuable company.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with DIS.\n\nThis competitive advantage is further strengthened by Nvidia's engagement as a forward-thinking company in the next generation of AI innovation, complemented by increased research and development spending in advanced machine learning tech and improving data center solutions. This is coupled with the company's focus on sustainability and ethical ways of using artificial intelligence, which is a trend internationally. This primary source shows how the company's context of market dynamics today and how its strategic adaptation to the future demands of such markets not only strengthens its market position but also positions it as the primary driver of the future of technology.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Insiders are Selling These 10 AI Stocks. Since NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 8th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nPositive sentiment is prevailing in the market after strong bank earnings and increasing hopes of a soft landing. Ryan Detrick, Carson Group chief market strategist, said while talking during a recent program on CNBC that he sees more runway for the current bull market.\n\n“This is a bull market. Now we’re in the third year of a bull market. My friend Sam Stovall said once you get to 65 years old, the odds of getting to 85 are really, really high. Bull markets work that way. Going back 50 years, there’s five other bull markets that made it into their third year, like this one is right now. The worst any of them went was another three years. A five-year total. The average was eight years. I’m not saying we have another six years of a bull market but what we’re saying is this is an economy that keeps surprising to the upside.”\n\nREAD ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nHowever, the analyst said large-cap tech stocks are “pricey.” He believes small- and mid-cap stocks are cheap and labeled financials and industrials as fairly valued.\n\nThere are some top AI stocks that are seeing insider selling activity. In this article, we take a look at those stocks and analyze their fundamentals and market sentiment. With each company, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Insiders Selling Nvidia (NVDA) Amid Blackwell GPU Delay and Stock Surge\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nOn September 19, 2024, Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Director Tench Coxe sold 2 million shares at $117.87 per share, reducing his ownership by 5% to 34,578,208 shares. The sale was valued at approximately $235.7 million. The stock is up 16% since then. But that wasn’t the only insider selling move around the stock.\n\nOn September 6, 2024, Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) President and CEO Jen Hsun Huang sold 240,000 shares at $104.35 per share, with no significant change to his ownership of 861,499,236 shares. The transaction was valued at approximately $25 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn September 24, 2024, Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Director Mark A. Stevens sold 165,100 shares at $121.27 per share, with no significant change to his ownership of 38,592,685 shares. The transaction was valued at approximately $20 million.\n\nNvidia’s declines after the Q2 results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\n\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\n\nAt Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\n\nOf course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\n\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Over the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA’s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA’s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Insiders are Selling These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Jensen Huang and Mark Zuckerberg each got $76 billion richer this year—equal to Spotify’s market cap",
        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg and Jensen Huang, two of tech’s wealthiest and most famous executives, saw their net worth grow this year by more than anyone else's on the planet.\n\nThe net worth of Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, increased by $76.5 billion so far this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. Just behind Huang was Facebook cofounder and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose net worth rose by $76 billion in 2024.\n\nThat is equal to or exceeds the entire market cap of some companies, such as fellow tech juggernaut Spotify and the spirits maker Diageo, which both have a market cap of $76 billion, as well as CVS ($73 billion), Target ($70 billion), and Capital One ($60 billion).\n\nZuckerberg and Huang are now the third and 11th richest people in the world, respectively. Zuckerberg, who is behind only Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder and executive chair Jeff Bezos on Bloomberg’s rich list, has a total net worth of $204 billion, while Huang is worth $121 billion.\n\nBoth Zuckerberg and Huang benefited tremendously from the standout stock performance of the companies they helm. Since the start of the year, Nvidia’s share price has surged 192% and Meta’s went up 65%.\n\nBoth Meta and Nvidia are part of the so-called Magnificent Seven of mega-cap tech stocks that have powered much of the past year’s market rally. Investors have rewarded both companies for their solidified market positions—Meta in digital advertising and Nvidia in chip manufacturing—along with their AI-focused innovation pipelines and the steady leadership provided by their executives.\n\nThe two executives control substantiation portions of their companies’ shares. Zuckerberg owns about 13.5% of Meta stock, amounting to about 345 million shares. Meanwhile, Huang owns between 3.5% to 4% of Nvidia, totalling about 861 million shares. Nvidia’s stock underwent a 10-to-one stock split in July.\n\nEarlier this year, Huang announced his intention to sell up to 6 million shares by the first quarter of 2025. To do so, Huang adopted a prearranged plan meant to avoid spooking investors and finished selling the 6 million shares in September, ahead of the 2025 date he had previously announced, according to regulatory filings.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Are No-Brainer Buys",
        "content": "If you want to create huge upside potential for your portfolio, get familiar with the AI industry. According to data compiled by Statista, the AI market is already worth $184 billion. But by the end of the decade, its value will increase to an astounding $827 billion -- an average annual growth rate of nearly 30%!\n\nHow can you profit from this growth? The two AI stocks below have you covered.\n\nGet in on the ground floor of AI\n\nLooking to bet on the rise of AI? Start with Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nThere's an old saying: During a gold rush, sell shovels. The idea is that whether or not the gold rush amounts to anything concrete in terms of actual gold production, those who sell the shovels still profit. The same can be said today about Nvidia today when it comes to AI. Training and running AI models takes a huge amount of computing power. These complex, data-heavy tasks often require specialized chips based on high-end graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nNvidia's AI accelerator GPUs are the best on the market right now. This reality is borne out in its market share numbers, with most estimates giving the company a 70% to 95% share of the AI chip market. Nvidia's dominance is also demonstrated by its pricing power. Gross margins for the company are around 76% -- a solid lead versus the competition, which is currently generating 40% to 50% gross margins. NVDA Profit Margin Chart\n\nNVDA Profit Margin data by YCharts\n\nThe AI spending craze fueling Nvidia's rise likely isn't a short-term phenomenon. Industry spending on AI infrastructure is expected to quadruple by the end of the decade, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 30%. And to be sure, competition will grow fiercely in the years to come. But Nvidia has a strong lead, with the financial and reputational might to invest heavily in new products.\n\nIntel and Advanced Micro Devices are contrarian AI hardware picks if you think Nvidia's market lead might dissipate over time. For now, however, Nvidia remains the undisputed leader for investors looking to bet directly on the rise of AI.\n\nTake a swing at the next big AI stock\n\nI love Nvidia stock. But with the company now valued at $3.3 trillion, it's unclear whether it can repeat its past success -- at least when it comes to stock price performance. I fully expect Nvidia's sales base to take off over the next decade. But the market has caught on to this growth potential, pricing the company at an astounding 35 times sales.\n\nIf you want to make the most money possible with AI stocks, you'll need to look at something smaller. SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN), for instance, is valued at just $1.9 billion, even though it's directly exposed to many of AI's biggest growth drivers. There's potentially more risk with this company than with Nvidia, but there's also the opportunity for significantly greater profit.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs its name suggests, SoundHound is involved in the voice and sound categories of AI. Anytime you interact with your devices with your voice -- say, asking your phone what song is currently playing, talking with your car about maintenance issues, ordering from a drive-thru window, or talking to a customer service representative on the phone -- SoundHound wants to be involved. Its AI technology can augment your experience in these situations while driving efficiencies for businesses regarding labor costs.\n\nSoundHound's technology isn't new. The company has been around for decades, with a growing customer list that includes major automakers, global restaurant brands, and even a suite of technology companies. But the voice AI category will have stiff competition from Big Tech companies, nearly all of which are developing their own platforms.\n\nWhether or not SoundHound will become a long-term winner is unclear. The company is still losing money, while its research and development budget -- which currently stands at just $56 million per year -- pales in comparison to what Big Tech is spending. But in return you get a stock directly exposed to AI tailwinds -- with proven technology -- at under a $2 billion market cap. There's plenty of risk to this story, but it's easy to imagine the company growing significantly in size should its technology and sales growth maintain its current trajectory.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "title": "Microsoft deploys AI bots to free workers from routine tasks",
        "content": "Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft (MSFT), has compared the transformative potential of AI with the industrial revolution, as the company launched new tools designed to help businesses streamline operations.\n\nSpeaking at Microsoft's AI Tour event in London, Nadella said the goal is to “empower people to do things that they couldn’t do previously.”\n\nOne of the leading investors in AI, Microsoft announced the rollout of its Copilot AI features, which aim to enhance business productivity by automating routine administrative tasks. These AI tools, known as autonomous agents, are custom-built applications that can handle specific tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more strategic work.\n\nDuring the event, Microsoft showcased examples of how Copilot is already being used in business processes. Consultancy firm McKinsey & Company, for instance, is using Copilot to automate responses to client requests. The AI-powered tool extracts key information from emails, such as the client’s name, company, and the nature of the proposal. It then cross-references it with relevant data and forwards the details to the appropriate expert. McKinsey estimates that the tool could reduce the time partners spend managing client engagements by 30%.\n\nThese autonomous agents can be built with Microsoft’s Copilot Studio using low-code or no-code instructions, allowing users to create AI-driven workflows without requiring extensive technical expertise.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Stocks head lower as China rate cut supports miners\n\nFor example, businesses can instruct an agent to sort and process incoming emails and specify how the AI should respond to missing or incomplete information. Employees can also oversee the AI's work to ensure accuracy and correct any errors, known as \"hallucinations.\"\n\nMicrosoft’s broader AI strategy is closely tied to its significant investments in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. The tech company envisions a future where AI-powered agents are found everywhere in the workplace, functioning autonomously or responding to user prompts. Nadella described these agents as the \"new apps for an AI-powered world.\"\n\nWilliam Hewish, UK-based Pets at Home (PETS.L) CIO, said AI has helped staff focus on more complex tasks by handling time-consuming data collection. The company’s profit protection team, for instance, uses AI to assess potential profit loss cases more efficiently, allowing them to focus on skilled analysis rather than basic information gathering.\n\nThe new software will be available for public preview next month.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe announcement comes only weeks after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff criticised Microsoft’s Copilot, likening it to the infamous Clippy assistant from the 1990s and claiming it fails to deliver meaningful value.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Boeing, Sanofi, SAP, Nokia and Tata Consumer Products\n\n“It doesn’t work,” Benioff said, adding that Salesforce’s (CRM) own AI tool, Agentforce, can handle trillions of transactions per week and offers a more impactful solution for businesses.\n\nMicrosoft, which has consistently ranked among the world’s most valuable companies, is locked in a race with Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) to become the first company to reach a $4tn market capitalisation.\n\nSince Nadella took over as CEO, Microsoft’s stock price has more than doubled, driven by a shift in focus toward cloud computing, cross-platform technologies, AI, and emerging fields such as quantum computing.\n\nNadella has moved the company away from its former reliance on Windows, scrapping its failed mobile phone division and pushing into new technologies that he hopes will define the future of computing.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "$2 trillion Norway oil fund CEO Nicolai Tangen says AI stock boom has created a concentration risk ‘we have never seen before’",
        "content": "The boss of Norway’s $2 trillion sovereign oil fund has fired a warning to investors who have won big on the AI stock market boom, as he cautioned that “we are heading for a period of low returns.”\n\nNicolai Tangen, the CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, said there was a new reality in the stock market amid geopolitical tensions and falling liquidity.\n\n“The time of very low interest rates is gone. The world is a much more dangerous place,” Tangen told the Financial Times’ Unhedged podcast.\n\nThe companies that have solidified their place at the top of that new reality is becoming a risk in itself. Businesses that create or design AI semiconductor chips and those that use the tech for their burgeoning AI capabilities saw massive share price appreciation in the last couple of years.\n\nTangen said leadership in the stock market was very narrow, pointing out that the top of the market was now comprised of “companies with some kind of AI connection,” while the top 10 companies in the U.S. S&P 500 accounted for around 20% of the index.\n\n“The concentration is absolutely worrying. It means that there is a risk in the stock market which we have never seen before.”\n\nTangen described how the biggest players in the stock market were now heavily interlinked around the business of microchips. He cited Dutch giant ASML, “which makes the machines to make the chips,” before selling them to Taiwan. Many chips are then designed by NVIDIA, before being sold to the likes of Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\n“So there are very few companies tied into them and they are getting bigger and bigger and more and more important.”\n\nNorway’s tech risk\n\nDespite his warnings about concentration risk in the stock market, Tangen’s $2 trillion oil fund is heavily invested in the companies he cited as key risk areas.\n\nNorges holds more than a 1% stake in the U.S.’s biggest tech groups, including Microsoft, Apple, NVIDIA, and Alphabet. It also holds a sizeable stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.\n\nCollectively, Norges owns $196 billion worth of shares in Microsoft, Apple, NVIDIA, Alphabet,, Amazon, Meta, TSMC, and ASML.\n\nTangen said heavy AI regulation in Europe meant it was likely that the big tech players would continue to come from the U.S.\n\n“We have hardly any large tech companies in Europe, we are far behind. Will we manage to catch up? I would be surprised if we did.\n\n“In America, you have lots of AI and little regulation, and in Europe, you have little AI and lots of regulation.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Should You Buy Costco Stock? These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Cheaper and Growing Faster",
        "content": "Shares of Costco(NASDAQ: COST) are up 54% over the last 12 months, but most of that return was driven by an increase in the price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple that Wall Street is willing to pay for the shares -- not actual growth in the company's earnings per share.\n\nAnalysts expect Costco to report annualized earnings growth of 9% over the long term, yet the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio that is usually reserved for the best growth stocks. Costco's forward P/E of 45 is even more expensive than some of the world's strongest tech companies, including top Magnificent Seven stocksAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which are expected to grow earnings faster and trade at lower valuations. COST PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nCostco is a retailer trading at a growth tech stock valuation, and Wall Street has made this mistake before. In the late 1990s, shares of Coca-Cola and Walmart traded at over 50 times earnings. The subsequent returns over the next decade were disappointing, as these stalwarts couldn't deliver enough earnings growth to support their high valuation.\n\nThe key to success in the stock market is to always go for strong businesses that offer the best growth prospects at a relatively attractive valuation. This framework says to pass on Costco right now, because there are plenty of growth stocks offering better value. These Magnificent Seven stocks are a good place to start.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon is one of Costco's chief competitors in e-commerce. To its credit, Costco is growing its online sales faster than Amazon. Costco's e-commerce business grew sales 19% year over year on an adjusted basis in the fiscal quarter ending Sept. 1. This beats Amazon's single-digit growth from online stores.\n\nCostco has the benefit of growing from a smaller base of online sales than Amazon. Amazon controlled 37% of the domestic e-commerce market in 2023, according to Statista, compared to 6% for No. 2 Walmart. Costco was in a distant seventh place with 1.5% share.\n\nHowever, considering all of Amazon's revenue sources -- including advertising, cloud services, subscription services, and physical retail locations -- it's better positioned to deliver superior returns to investors. Amazon's total revenue grew 10% year over year in the second quarter. Over the last 10 years, Amazon grew sales at a 22% compound annual rate, compared to just 8% for Costco.\n\nMoreover, Amazon is implementing several cost-cutting initiatives to bolster its profits. Operating income grew 91% year over year last quarter, as management continues to shorten transportation distances between fulfillment centers and customers' doorsteps. In contrast, Costco's operating profit grew just 9% year over year last quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nImportantly, most of Amazon's operating income comes from its cloud services business. Amazon Web Services is the top cloud provider in a $297 billion market that grew 22% in Q2, according to Synergy Research. The lucrative revenue streams Amazon generates from non-retail services like cloud computing are a major advantage over traditional retailers. They allow Amazon to be more aggressive in investing in e-commerce infrastructure to protect its lead.\n\nAnalysts expect Amazon's earnings per share to grow 23% on an annualized basis over the long term. The stock's forward P/E is 39 on 2024 earnings estimates, which is a discount to Costco shares, and should lead to better returns. COST EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia shares have delivered incredible returns of over 2,700% over the last five years. Some investors might look at that amazing run and assume the stock is overvalued. But this top semiconductor company is benefiting from powerful trends in artificial intelligence (AI) and data center growth that could fuel more market-beating returns.\n\nWall Street has underestimated the market for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs were originally used in the 1990s for playing video games and running other graphics-intensive computer software. But in recent years, Nvidia's chips have run some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.\n\nThe company estimates that there is about $1 trillion worth of data center infrastructure in the process of switching from legacy computing hardware to more powerful GPUs that are needed to accelerate computer processing for AI workloads. As a result, Nvidia's revenue has accelerated over the last few years, as data centers build more optimized infrastructure to train AI models, which require tremendous amounts of data and computing horsepower. COST Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIt's important to be aware that, as a leading company in a cyclical chip industry, Nvidia's revenue growth hasn't been as consistent as Costco's. But investors are being well compensated for accepting a more bumpy ride.\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia to deliver 38% annualized earnings growth over the next several years. Nvidia's earnings jumped 168% year over year in the most recent quarter. This is thanks to a shortage in AI chips relative to demand, which is allowing Nvidia to charge high prices. Over the last 10 years, Nvidia's earnings grew at a compound rate of 51%. The opportunities ahead in the data center market should continue to drive stronger growth and returns for shareholders than Costco shares.\n\nNvidia currently trades at a forward P/E of 49. But using next year's earnings estimate, the stock trades at a forward P/E of 34, compared to a more expensive 45 multiple for Costco.\n\nDon't pay a high P/E for below-average growth\n\nThere is a right time to pay a high valuation for a stock, but there are also wrong times. To justify a high P/E, the company needs to deliver lots of earnings growth. Amazon and Nvidia are meeting those expectations, but investors should think twice before paying a high P/E for Costco's single-digit sales and earnings growth.\n\nThere are plenty of expensive-looking growth stocks that have crushed the stock market's average return, but Costco can't be considered a growth stock when it's not growing earnings higher than the average company in the S&P 500 index.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – October 21, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, AppFolio, Inc. APPF, Spotify Technology SPOT, Vertiv VRT and Nvidia NVDA.\n\n3 Growth Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold: VRT, SPOT, APPF\n\nToday’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks dives into the S&P 500’s jump to fresh highs following Taiwan Semiconductor’s bullish earnings release.\n\nThe episode then digs into three market-beating technology stocks—AppFolio, Spotify and Vertiv—to buy as the busy part of earnings season ramps up.\n\nThe S&P 500 hit new highs on Thursday after Wall Street bulls dove back into Nvidia and other technology stocks after Taiwan Semi’s impressive earnings results.\n\nSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.\n\nThe chip-making powerhouse’s growth and outlook signaled strong, AI-boosted demand. Taiwan Semi’s clients include Nvidia, Apple, and other market-driving technology stocks.\n\nThe backdrop of solid earnings growth and lower interest rates should support the bull market even though the stock market could experience volatility in the near term, fueled by the chaos of earnings season, the coming presidential election, and beyond.\n\nBuy AppFolio Stock on the Dip for Huge Upside?\n\nAppFolio, Inc. is a real estate and property management-focused technology company. AppFolio’s offerings include accounting, communication, maintenance, marketing, leasing, investment management, and more.\n\nAppFolio helps clients in all corners of real estate from single and multi-family to commercial, student housing, and beyond.\n\nAppFolio boasts that it offers the “industry’s favorite real estate investment management software,” and its growth has been impressive. AppFolio grew its revenue by an average of nearly 30% in the trailing five years. The company grew its total units under management by 9% to 8.4 million in the second quarter.\n\nAppFolio is expected to boost its sales by 25% in 2024 and 20% next year to climb from $620 million in FY23 to $935 million in FY25. AppFolio is projected to grow its adjusted earnings by 146% in 2024 and 30% next year. Plus, APPF has topped our EPS estimates by an average of 30% in the trailing four quarters.\n\nAPPF stock has climbed 120% in the past five years to top the S&P 500’s 100%. Yet the stock is down 25% from its July peaks and trading 40% below its average Zacks price target. AppFolio stock is trading at some of its most oversold RSI levels over the past five years and it might find support near its 2024 lows.\n\nStory continues\n\nAppFolio’s balance sheet is stellar and seven of the eight brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys.” All in, investors might want to put AppFolio on their radars ahead of its Q3 earnings release on Thursday, October 24.\n\nBuy Soaring Spotify Technology Stock Near New Highs?\n\nSpotify Technology changed the music industry like Netflix transformed TV and movies. Spotify grew its Premium Subscribers by 80% between Q2 FY20 and Q2 FY24, while monthly active users surged 110%. Spotify reportedly held 32% of the global streaming music market share in 2023, blowing away No. 2 Apple Music’s 15%.\n\nSpotify’s growth efforts, price hikes, and efficiency commitments helped recharge the company and the stock. Spotify’s FY24 EPS estimate has soared 300% over the last 12 months, with its FY25 figure up 160%.\n\nSpotify is projected to swing from an adjusted loss of -$2.95 a share last year to +$6.24 per share in 2024 and surge 40% next year. Spotify is projected to grow its revenue by 19% in 2024 and 15% next year to reach $20 billion—to double its revenue between FY20 and FY25.\n\nSpotify stock has skyrocketed 370% since the end of 2022, including a 95% YTD run. SPOT finally broke above its 2021 highs to a new record last month. SPOT recently slipped below its 21-day moving average and it might experience more profit-taking in the near-term.\n\nThat said, Spotify trades at a 40% discount to the Zacks Tech sector and 40% vs. its highs in terms of forward sales. SPOT has already cooled off to reach neutral RSI levels. Now might be a good time to consider Spotify with its Q3 results due on November 12.\n\nWhy Vertiv Is a Must-Buy AI Stock\n\nVertiv's power, cooling, and IT infrastructure solutions and services operate across data centers, communication networks, and beyond.

Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.

(3:45) - Top Stocks To Keep On Your Watch List Right Now (31:25) - Episode Roundup: NVDA, AVGO, TSM, LRCX Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week, Tracey is going solo to discuss the semiconductor stocks. Should you buy the semiconductor stocks right now or is it too late to get in?\n\nSemiconductors: Too Hot to Handle?\n\nThe semiconductor stocks, which includes more than just the chips, have been on a tear the last 18 months. Over the summer, the stocks took a break and fell back. But some, like NVIDIA, are now back at all-time highs.\n\nThis earnings season may push them even higher.\n\nTracey looked at 5 of the biggest names in the industry.\n\nAre they too expensive to buy right now or is the growth just so strong you MUST own them?\n\n5 Semiconductor Stocks: Should You Buy Them Now?\n\n1. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\n\nNVIDIA has been a top stock all year. Shares of NVIDIA are up 184.2% year-to-date, easily outperforming the S&P 500 which is up 23%. But it’s been rocky the past 3 months, with big sell-offs. However, thanks to a surge in October, NVIDIA shares are up 15% over that time while the S&P 500 is up just 4.2%.\n\nEarnings look spectacular. Earnings are expected to rise 116% in fiscal 2025 and another 32.8% in fiscal 2026.\n\nWhile NVIDIA may seem expensive with a forward P/E of 48, it has a PEG ratio of just 1.16. A PEG under 1.0 indicates a company has both value and growth. NVIDIA’s PEG is nearly that low.\n\nShould investors still buy NVIDIA right now?\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has lagged in 2024. While shares of Advanced Micro Devices are up 48.6% over the last year, year-to-date they’re up just 12.8%. Over the last 3 months, Advanced Micro Devices is down 4.9% while the S&P 500 is up 4.2%.\n\nEarnings are expected to jump 26.8% in 2024 and another 54.6% in 2025. You won’t get Advanced Micro Devices cheaply, though. It trades with a forward P/E of 46. However, it’s PEG ratio is just 1.6, which is low.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs this a buying opportunity in Advanced Micro Devices?\n\n3. Broadcom Inc. AVGO\n\nBroadcom shares have been testing new all-time highs again in 2024. Broadcom is up 67.3% year-to-date, outperforming the S&P 500 which is up 23.3%. Over the last 3 months, it is outperforming as well, up 13.4% compared to 4.2% for the S&P 500.\n\nEarnings are expected to rise 14% in fiscal 2024 and another 27% in fiscal 2025. Broadcom’s P/E is a little more reasonable, at 36.7x. It has a PEG ratio of 2.2, however. That’s higher than NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nShould Broadcom be on your short list?\n\n4. Lam Research Corp. LRCX\n\nLam Research is the only one of these 5 stocks that is underperforming the S&P 500 year-to-date. Shares of Lam Research are down 2.4% year-to-date. Over the last 3 months, the performance has been dismal. Shares are down 26.7% during that time.\n\nYet earnings are expected to rise 8.7% in fiscal 2025 and another 32.6% in fiscal 2026. Lam Research has attractive valuations with a forward P/E of just 22.8 and a PEG ratio of 1.69.\n\nIs this share weakness a buying opportunity in Lam Research?\n\n5. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor just reported earnings and beat again. It also sees strong demand for AI chips for the next several years.\n\nShares of Taiwan Semiconductor have spiked on the earnings news and are up 19.1% over the last 3 months. However, they have been on the move higher all year and are now up 102.7% year-to-date.\n\nEarnings are expected to rise 24.5% in 2024 and another 28.4% in 2025. Remarkably, the stock is still cheap even with the huge move higher in the shares. Taiwan Semiconductor trades with a forward P/E of 29.1 but a PEG of just 1.1.\n\nShould Taiwan Semiconductor be on your short list?\n\nWhat else do you need to know about the semiconductor stocks?\n\nTune into this week’s video podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of AVGO in Zacks Insider Trader portfolio.]\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nFollow us on Twitter:  https://twitter.com/zacksresearch\n\nJoin us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearch/\n\nZacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com/performance\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "S&amp;P 500 Set to Grind Higher Toward 6,000 Milestone: Survey",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- This year’s furious rally in US stocks is poised to extend into the final stretch of 2024, even as the US presidential election looms as a major wild card, according to the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says\n\nThe S&P 500 Index will approach 6,000 by year-end — a record milestone 2.3% above Friday’s close — based on the median estimate from 411 questionnaire participants. Three quarters of respondents expect this earnings season to give the benchmark a boost, and the strength of Corporate America’s results are seen as more crucial for the stock market’s performance than who wins the November vote or even the Federal Reserve’s policy path.\n\nUS stocks face a big earnings hurdle this week, with roughly 20% of S&P 500 members scheduled to release results, including heavyweights Tesla Inc. and IBM Corp. About 70 companies in the gauge have reported already, with 76% announcing earnings that surpassed estimates, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.\n\nAfter Tesla, the other so-called Magnificent Seven members report starting later this month. Those technology behemoths — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. — have driven the brunt of the equities advance since last year. But they trailed last quarter as the Fed cut interest rates for the first time since 2020, supporting sectors like financials and utilities.\n\nSurvey takers anticipate the tech giants will take the lead again. A combined 75% expect the Magnificent Seven to either beat or perform in line with the rest of the market this quarter, after the group started October with a 0.9% decline. One reason investors remain bullish is that the bulk of the S&P 500’s earnings growth still comes from the Magnificent Seven.\n\n“The catch-up in the Magnificent Seven after a lackluster quarter is a compelling trade to look at right now,” said Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital.\n\nThe median survey respondent sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 5,977, up from Friday’s close of about 5,865. That would extend the index’s 23% gain in 2024, which has taken it to 47 record closing highs, including two last week.\n\nThe historical median of S&P 500 returns from mid-October to Dec. 31 is roughly 5%, according to data from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s trading desk going back to 1928. It’s even higher in election years, at about 7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings First\n\nOptimism around US equities from survey-takers comes as the race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is coming down to the wire, with polling showing the candidates largely neck and neck.\n\nThere’s been chatter lately about a supposed revival in trades that are expected to benefit from a victory by Trump, the Republican candidate, including in Bitcoin and shares of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. However, the biggest chunk of respondents — 45% — said the strength of earnings matters most for their equity portfolios, compared with 39% pointing to the election outcome and 16% for the magnitude of Fed easing.\n\n“I know the election brings a lot of emotion depending on whether one’s candidate wins or not, but don’t let that come into your portfolio,” said Brian Spinelli, co-chief investment officer at wealth advisory firm Halbert Hargrove.\n\nOne event that tech-stock watchers will be focusing on is Nvidia’s earnings, to be released in November. The company’s last report drove the chipmaker’s shares down in the following days. This time around, the biggest group of survey respondents, 45%, see the results pushing the stock up. Nvidia has been the poster child for the boom in AI technology, with its stock almost tripling this year.\n\nWhile poll-takers show plenty of enthusiasm around tech, there’s another area that they anticipate will lead the S&P 500 this quarter: financials.\n\nRead More Banks Put Up Strong Earnings, Pushing Stocks Beyond 2023 Levels\n\nThat result is playing out so far. The sector is up 5% in October, the most among the 11 S&P 500 groups, buoyed by strong earnings from Wall Street. Bank stocks tend to do well when the Fed cuts rates, which stands to boost borrowing and other economic activity.\n\nThe MLIV Pulse survey was conducted Oct. 14-18 among Bloomberg News terminal and online readers worldwide who chose to engage with the survey, and included portfolio managers, economists and retail investors.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on Taiwan Semiconductor, Netflix, and Other Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other stocks on Jim Cramer's list.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently expressed concern that some investors are overlooking potential market opportunities by fixating on the Federal Reserve's next moves regarding interest rates. He emphasized that, over the years, many in the investment community have become overly reliant on the Fed’s actions rather than focusing on individual companies and their profitability.\n\n“Everyone who’s obsessed with the Fed’s next foray is basically investing with blinders on, and as a result, they’re missing out on some of the greatest moves I’ve ever seen in my life. Moves coming from the most unlikely of stocks. And I don't want to see you ignoring these opportunities anymore.”\n\nCramer said that he is an admirer of Fed Chair Jay Powell, but he recognizes the limits of the Fed's influence. He noted that while Powell wields significant power, he cannot dictate the performance of high-quality companies that are less affected by economic cycles. According to Cramer, when a company is not tied to the business cycle, it is less susceptible to the whims of the Fed. However, many traders still seem oblivious to this reality.\n\n“... I needed to say something because over the past couple of decades, so many people in this business have become creatures of the Fed, not of companies and the profits that they make. Unless the Fed's happy… unless it has its pound of flesh, these Fed watchers won't pull the trigger and buy stocks, even stocks of companies have almost nothing whatsoever to do with our central bank and are doing really well.”\n\nHe highlighted that fear of the Fed often extends to stocks that appear pricey based on earnings multiples, particularly when investors worry that the Fed might have to abandon rate cuts to combat inflation. This fear, he noted, can drive investors away from promising sectors, like semiconductors. While Cramer acknowledges the importance of being aware of the Fed’s actions, he insists that it should not become an obsession. He believes that although the Fed has considerable influence, it is not all-powerful.\n\nHe clarified that he does not claim the stock market will never decline during periods of Fed easing, but he maintains that there are limits to the Fed's impact.\n\n“I’m not saying the stock market will never go down when the Fed’s easing… I am saying there are limits to what the Fed impacts. And I swear by the managers who know a lot about business, and who don’t cower when Jay Powell grabs the mic to talk about the pace of rate cuts.”\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 17. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is TSM Stock a Good Long Term Buy?\n\nA close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 156\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Cramer was a big proponent of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) as he explained why the semiconductor giant is important in today’s landscape.\n\n“… If you didn't listen to Taiwan Semi’s conference call last night, you missed out on a performance that explains so much of what's going on in this market, in the world.\n\nI'm talking about the off-the-charts demand for chips that enable artificial intelligence. Those are almost all manufactured by Taiwan Semi, which is the crucial cog in the semiconductor machine. That's how you know this move is for real.\n\nThis company is the biggest and the best. Last night was a tour de force show, especially for one customer, Nvidia. They might as well have entitled the conference call in praise of Nvidia because Nvidia is crushing it in partnership with this amazing Taiwanese company. I talk about Nvidia a great deal, but I don't say much about Taiwan Semi, which is wrong. See, like most American semiconductor companies, Nvidia is actually more of a designer. Taiwan Semi is the company that builds the product.. You can't have Nvidia without Taiwan Semi.”\n\nCramer discussed the company’s focus on AI-related operations and its position in the AI industry, saying:\n\n“How close are they? Let me quote from Doctor C. C. Wei, he's a PhD and chairman and CEO of Taiwan Semi ‘So one of my key customers said the demand right now is insane.’ Well, the key customer is Nvidia. And like Nvidia's redoubtable, implacable CEO Jensen Huang, Wei says that the demand for AI chips ‘is real, and I believe it is just the beginning of the demand.’\n\nBingo. There it is. Unlike ASML, the semiconductor equipment maker that gave you a sob story about the whole industry the other night, with the exception of AI, Taiwan Semi’s focused on the cutting edge of the industry. That's what they are. They know it because they use it. As Wei said, ‘We have our real experience. We have been using AI and machine learning in our fab and R&D operations. By using AI, we are able to create more value by driving greater productivity, efficiency, speed, qualities.’\n\nHe goes on to explain that Taiwan Semi’s customers would say the same thing. What a contrast to the lame ASML call that caused so many people to sell Nvidia. Panic, panic, and once again revved up the chip obituary machine.”\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is engaged in the production, packaging, testing, and distribution of integrated circuits and various semiconductor components. As a key player in the industry, it is responsible for the majority of the global supply of advanced high-end semiconductors, which are essential for powering many artificial intelligence applications.\n\nThe company announced third-quarter results on October 17 and reported revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars (1 New Taiwan Dollar = $0.031), a significant increase of 39% compared to the same period the previous year. The company also experienced a noteworthy rise in earnings per share, which climbed to NT$12.54, which is a 54% year-over-year improvement. According to CFO Wendell Huang, these strong results are because of heightened demand in both smartphone and AI-related markets.\n\nAmong Taiwan Semiconductor’s (NYSE:TSM) revenue streams was its high-performance computing segment, which includes chips utilized in AI technologies. It experienced a remarkable growth of 51% year-over-year. The surge highlights the increasing reliance on advanced computing capabilities to support AI innovations. Additionally, the recovery in smartphone sales contributed to the company's overall performance, with revenue from this sector increasing by 34%.\n\nOverall TSM ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanleyand Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Should you buy Nvidia stock now? It may be a once-in-a-generation opportunity",
        "content": "Nvidia has been one of the most hyped and closely followed stocks in recent memory as the fortunes of the broader market increasingly hinge on the AI chip leader.\n\nAt one point this year, the stock accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500's gains, and some investors even held watch parties for Nvidia's earnings release.\n\nNvidia's astronomical run to a $3 trillion company has also been somewhat divisive as many on Wall Street have doubted that the stock can sustain further gains while others see the AI boom fueling more upside.\n\nThat's left investors asking, \"should I buy Nvidia stock right now, or sell it?\"\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America have an answer: In a note on Thursday, they reiterated their buy rating on Nvidia stock and raised their price target to $190 from $165, implying it could soar 38% higher from Friday's closing price.\n\nAt $190 a share, Nvidia's market cap would also explode to $4.7 trillion from $3.4 trillion today.\n\nIn fact, BofA is so bullish on Nvidia stock that analysts called it a \"generational opportunity,\" estimating a total addressable market of more than $400 billion for AI accelerators.\n\n\"AI models (demand) continue to evolve, with the cadence of new LLM model launches now increased to 3-5 times/yr per developer (OpenAI, Google, Meta, etc.), and each new major generation requiring 10-20x compute requirement to train,\" analysts said.\n\nTheir confidence in Nvidia has been boosted by others in the chip sector like Taiwan Semiconductor and ASML, which both recently signaled strong AI demand. BofA's meetings with executives at Broadcom and Micron as well as comments from AMD have yielded similar indications.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also touted huge demand for the company's next-generation AI chip.\n\n“Blackwell is in full production, Blackwell is as planned, and the demand for Blackwell is insane,” he told CNBC earlier this month. “Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.”\n\nAdding to BofA's bullish case for Nvidia is its underappreciated enterprise partnerships with the likes of Accenture, ServiceNow, Microsoft, and others as well as its software products that help reinforce Nvidia's dominance in hardware. They combine to create a deeper overall Nvidia ecosystem for AI.\n\nPlus, Nvidia could generate more than $200 billion in free cash flow over the next two years, rivaling even Apple, BofA estimated.\n\nEarnings reports later this month from tech giants that are developing AI technologies, such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, should provide more insight into demand. And Nvidia is due to report Nov. 20.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile some on Wall Street have expressed skepticism on whether massive investments in AI are translating to the bottom line, the tech sector is locked in a cutthroat race to be first on the scene with the latest advances in AI.\n\n\"We continue to see the pace of new model development increase,\" BofA said. \"LLMs in particular are being developed for both larger size and better reasoning capabilities, which both require greater training intensity.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Best American Stocks To Buy and Hold in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024.\n\nNeutral Stance Amid Uncertainties\n\nThe tech sector has been showing positive performance amid market concerns, driven by improved earnings estimates and substantial investments in artificial intelligence. Approximately 40% of operating cash flow is currently allocated to AI, raising questions about when these investments will begin to yield returns. The strong profit margins of mega-cap stocks, averaging over 23%, compared to just over 8.5% for other sectors, suggest continued capital inflows into tech companies demonstrating earnings strength. While some consolidation and growth slowdown may occur, there is confidence that investor sentiment will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.\n\nAs sentiments shift regarding major tech stocks, other profitable tech companies are maintaining positive momentum in the market. There was a conversation regarding this, covered a few days back in our article about the 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In, where Jason Snipe, Odyssey Capital Advisors principal, discussed the tech sector’s mega-cap momentum, particularly in light of recent mega-cap stock downgrades and significant investor outflows. Here’s an excerpt from his sentiment:\n\n“…This focus on AI has contributed to some recent downgrades but also suggests continued upside potential for select names within the sector.\n\n…He acknowledged that while there may be some consolidation and a slowdown in growth, he believes that investors’ muscle memory will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.\n\nSnipe’s analysis underscores the complexities facing the tech sector amid market volatility and evolving economic conditions. While challenges persist, particularly with mega-cap stocks experiencing downgrades, there are also significant opportunities driven by innovation and strong profit margins that could support continued growth in this space…”\n\nKatie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on October 17 and highlighted that there’s a likelihood that the markets could move into choppier territory. Katie Stockton characterized her stance as neutral regarding the indices despite the strength of the trend and the participation of most stocks on the upside. She noted that while short-term momentum is currently positive, particularly behind major indices, there are concerns about potential problems if key players like NVIDIA falter. She highlighted that sentiment appears overly bullish or greedy, as evidenced by the Fear and Greed Index reaching an extreme level of 5%. This situation makes it challenging for the market to sustain overbought conditions, which are prevalent across various timeframes.\n\nStory continues\n\nStockton anticipates a pullback or possibly a more significant corrective phase in the fourth quarter for the S&P 500, suggesting that this could mark the beginning of a range-bound environment. She pointed to indicators such as the VIX, which has entered a new higher volatility cycle, and mentioned signs of long-term exhaustion indicated by the DeMark indicators, levels not seen collectively since late 2021. While this does not necessarily signal an impending bear market, it does enhance the likelihood of experiencing a choppier trading environment.\n\nWhen asked about the recent performance of banks and cyclical stocks compared to defensive stocks, Stockton acknowledged that while there has been a positive move from the financial sector contributing to the S&P 500’s recent gains, it is too early to conclude that this represents a breakout in relative strength for financials. She indicated that most metrics suggest financials will likely perform in line with broader market trends rather than leading them. Furthermore, she expressed concern that mega-cap sectors are poised to lose their leadership position, which could pose challenges to overall market performance.\n\nRegarding small-cap stocks, Stockton noted that while the Russell 2000 index made another attempt at an upside move, closing close to 2,300 with a 1.6% increase, long-term trends still indicate underperformance relative to the S&P 500. She pointed out that there has not been a breakout in the Russell 2000, which remains stalled below resistance levels established during summer highs. Consequently, she does not see actionable opportunities in small caps at this time and anticipates neutral trading conditions for this segment.\n\nOn the topic of bonds, Stockton mentioned that Treasury yields have shown some upside momentum but backed off recently. She sees potential entry points in Treasury bond proxies like TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF), suggesting signs of short-term downside exhaustion within a broader long-term uptrend for fixed income. She believes there is an opportunity for investors to enter Treasury bond proxies now, while also expecting yields to stall without significant long-term declines.\n\nHer insights highlight her focus on maintaining balance amid prevailing uncertainties in both equity and bond markets.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo find the best American stocks, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database to find US stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA): Leading the AI and GPU Revolution\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global technology company that designs and manufactures GPUs, AI chips, and other computing technologies. The high-performance GPUs are widely used in gaming, professional graphics, and data centers, and also power AI applications, such as machine learning and deep learning.\n\nThe company’s stock has surged 2000% in 5 years due to GPU and AI-related demand. FQ2 2025 revenue soared 122.4% to $30 billion, with net income at $16.6 billion. Increased data center chip demand drove these results. Q3 revenue is projected at $32.5 billion. Blackwell and Hopper Architecture products are expected to perform well. On October 14, its stock hit a record high of $138.07 as the third week of this month began, driven by anticipation for AI infrastructure spending and the company’s dominant 70-95% market share in AI chips.\n\nNetApp’s new AI tool leverages NVIDIA technology. Elon Musk’s xAI is using 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for its AI project, Colossal. The company has partnered with Accenture and Salesforce to accelerate AI innovation. Its Blackwell AI chip is in high demand, and its Aerial tool optimizes wireless networks. CUDA software provides a competitive edge. Future success depends on continued innovation and effective AI monetization.\n\nRecently, the White House is considering expanding export limits for NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) along with AMD AI chips to certain Persian Gulf countries. This follows last year’s restrictions on China and other countries. The move aims to limit the Persian Gulf’s global influence over the AI industry.\n\nThe company reported that its Blackwell platforms are now fully operational, so the prior production challenges have been addressed. The company’s CEO believes its AI chip advantage is sustainable. Snowflake, a cloud data warehousing company using NVIDIA Corp.’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI Enterprise software, has seen its stock rise 10% due to strong prospects. Positive earnings, revised guidance, and upward stock movement suggest continued growth.\n\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Over the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA’s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA’s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.”\n\nOverall, NVDA ranks 6th on our list of best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "NVIDIA (NVDA): Among the Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other profitable stocks.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on October 14, Michael Kantrowitz, Chief Investment Officer at Piper Sandler noted that while the market is expensive, it's not a reason to get bearish and that unless a risk arises, the market will likely stay expensive. Kantrowitz explains that the market's valuation is driven by the pricing out of risks that existed two years ago, such as inflation and higher interest rates. He believes that if these risks were to resurface, it would be a reason to get worried, but currently, that's not the backdrop.\n\nHe also notes that investors should focus on stocks with continued earnings momentum, as these names will likely see the best outperformance and can hold their expensive multiples for longer. Kantrowitz is not too concerned about higher bond yields but notes that they can be a problem at some point. He thinks that yields would need to reach 4.25% to show up in the broader market.\n\nRegarding earnings revisions, Kantrowitz believes that revisions coming down have not overdone it and that it's normal to see estimates from the sell-side start out high and then trickle down throughout the year. He expects to see more downward earnings revisions but notes that large-cap stocks have held up far better in terms of earnings, which is why they continue to outperform.\n\nTom Lee, Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors discussed the markets and his recent observations. Lee believes that the market's resilience is due to the large amount of cash on the sidelines. He thinks that investors have been under-invested in stocks and that the market is becoming less dependent on macro data.\n\nLee pointed out that the market has been able to shrug off negative news and that the recent PPI and CPI reports were not enough to knock the market off track. He believes that the Fed will continue to be dovish, especially since inflation is still tracking towards the 2% target. Lee also thinks that the election, which is becoming less of a coin toss, is also contributing to the market's conviction.\n\nRegarding the impact of the election on the market, Lee believes that markets like visibility, but they also need to like what they see on the other side of the election. He thinks that whether Trump or Harris wins, stocks will do well next year, but there will be differences in sector and asset class performance depending on who wins.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile some may be concerned about the market's expensive valuation, others see it as a sign of strength and resilience, with that in context, let’s take a look at the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 30 largest companies by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to companies with positive TTM net income and 10-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 10-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income. Our list is sorted in ascending order of the 10-year net income growth rates.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 smallcap and largecap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\n10-Year Net Income CAGR: 58.47%\n\nTTM Net Income: $53.01 Billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) and a pioneer in AI, gaming, and data center technology. The company’s GPUs are widely utilized in gaming, deep learning, and high-performance computing. NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI and machine learning solutions have been adopted across various industries, including healthcare, automotive, and finance. Notable customers include Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Tesla.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is positioned for ongoing growth, driven by its strong presence in the data center market and the upcoming Blackwell chip. Blackwell is highly sought after by companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta, who are building AI data centers to support their products. The Blackwell GPUs, priced between $30,000 and $40,000 each, are already being distributed to data centers and industrial customers for AI applications, with consumer availability expected in 2025.\n\nIn a CNBC interview, CEO Jensen Huang remarked that \"Blackwell is in full production and demand for Blackwell is insane,\" adding, \"Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first.\" NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) leadership in accelerated computing and generative AI is also a key factor in its growth outlook.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is poised to benefit from the expanding enterprise AI market, along with growing opportunities in the automotive and healthcare sectors, as its products and solutions gain traction in these areas.\n\nIn Q2, global spending on cloud infrastructure rose by 19% year-over-year to $78.2 billion, according to Canalys. Hyperscalers are expected to spend approximately $160 billion on AI infrastructure in 2024.\n\nWith its robust position in the data center market and emerging opportunities in various industries, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and drive further growth. Analysts estimate that the company’s earnings will grow by 81.88% this year. With a consensus Buy rating from industry analysts, the stock has a target price of $148.53, which represents a 12.08% upside potential from its current level.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the most profitable stocks of the last 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for decades. From industrial automation and unbeatable chess engines to self-driving cars and automatic vacuum cleaners, AI-assisted technologies are becoming a normal part of our everyday lives.\n\nBut the adoption and general awareness of AI accelerated dramatically in November 2022, when OpenAI released the ChatGPT AI platform. This ultramodern large language model (LLM) could do things previously seen as uniquely human. ChatGPT and its rivals can write halfway decent text, generate nearly photorealistic images and videos, and even create new music from a primordial soup of earlier examples. Large sets of human creations have become fodder for computer-powered, semi-creative productions.\n\nA handful of companies are driving this generative AI boom, led by AI accelerator designer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). That stock has soared more than 1,000% higher in two years, powered by a 237% uptick in revenues and a ninefold boost to Nvidia's free cash flows. The LLMs you see today wouldn't be possible without Nvidia's high-performance AI accelerator chips, and the company is often seen as the best AI stock on the market today.\n\nBut even stellar business performers can become overvalued. Nvidia's stock trades at extremely lofty valuation ratios nowadays, and many die-hard bulls are ignoring the rise of alternative AI hardware solutions.\n\nSo I have a few Nvidia shares in my portfolio, but am not eager to buy more today. There are safer AI investments out there, and I'm here to show you a couple of great AI stocks not named Nvidia.\n\nStock Two-Year Return Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S) Price-to-Free Cash Flow Ratio (P/FCF) Nvidia 1,050% 58.4 72.4 IBM 92% 3.4 16.9 UiPath 5% 5.1 21.6\n\nData collected from Finviz.com and YCharts on 10/18/2024.\n\nIBM's strategic focus on enterprise-class AI\n\nYeah, you heard me: International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) is one of the best AI stocks to buy right now.\n\nBig Blue has been an AI innovator since the 1970s, introducing game-changing technologies such as the first speech recognition system and the first programming language for self-learning manufacturing robots. And IBM's AI interest never faded. The company remains a leading AI researcher today, even though you don't often see its name in generative AI headlines.\n\nYou see, IBM lets other companies mess around with consumer-friendly chatbots and image generation systems. Meanwhile, the company focuses its AI products on deep-pocketed enterprise clients. The IBM Watsonx generative AI platform delivers business-oriented features such as deep integration with other business-grade information systems, audit-ready paths from input data to generated content, and robust digital security.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo IBM took some extra time to prepare these AI tools for release, insisting on quality results instead of rushing a half-baked solution to the market. Now it's time to reap the rewards of that strategic delay.\n\nWatsonx has been around for a year and a half now, and has already generated more than $2 billion of generative AI orders. Next week's third-quarter report will show how quickly corporate clients are embracing IBM's AI solutions in a healthier economy. And as seen in the table, the stock looks downright cheap next to Nvidia's high-flying shares.\n\nUiPath's AI-powered automation solutions\n\nProcess automation expert UiPath(NYSE: PATH) is another low-priced bet on a solid AI business. The company's robotic process automation (RPA) may sound like an industrial hardware controller, but is actually software that helps businesses automate repetitive tasks.\n\nAutomated software has many benefits over their human counterparts in this area. Computers don't get bored or tired. Their actions can't result in \"human error,\" and UiPath's sophisticated software robots don't suffer from machine learning equivalents such as sloppy programming. With the recent addition of LLM functions, UiPath's robots can even manage advanced but repetitive tasks like filling out forms and interpreting the meaning of text entered by end users.\n\n\"RPA is not AI; AI is not RPA,\" according to UiPath. But the combination of robust RPA systems and powerful AI backends bring out the best of both worlds in a single job-automation process. UiPath's tools are already game changers for clients with lots of rote information management activities. They will only grow more powerful over time.\n\nUiPath's shares have barely moved in two years, falling far behind other AI specialists and the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) market index. At the same time, trailing sales rose by 32% over the last two years, while free cash flows swung from a $134 million loss to $327 million of cash profits.\n\nThe stock is swooning while financial results are soaring, and UiPath's AI-plus-RPA solutions are only getting more powerful. That's why this game changer looks like a no-brainer buy today.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,285!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $44,456!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $411,959!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 14, 2024\n\nAnders Bylund has positions in International Business Machines and Nvidia.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nI have never been one to have a cluttered desk at work.\n\nTo me, everything has a place. Awesome desk organization, awesome outcomes, is how my head works.\n\nBut I broke this rule slightly by the close of trading on Friday. Going forward, I will have a paper cutout of Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang in his trademark leather jacket thumbtacked to the wallboard (see pic below). And I'll tell you why.\n\nFor one full day this week I forgot to check Nvidia's stock price my usual 10 times a day — only checking in five times. I let myself (and you all) down because, in the blink of an eye, Nvidia's stock went from a quick sell-off from the Monday record highs back to those same highs come the end of the week.\n\nI missed it!\n\nThe stock is up 13% in October, dusting the 1.4% gain for the S&P 500. AMD's (AMD) stock is down by 5% this month, similar to Intel (INTC).\n\nSo Jensen's face on my desk is a reminder to check in with Nvidia's stock price and fundamentals numerous times a day. And to ask everyone I encounter about Nvidia, even people not in the chip space (as I did at one annual CEO dinner this week hosted by ServiceNow's (NOW) CEO Bill McDermott). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang visits my NYC desk. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nHere's what I was reminded of by recommitting to an Nvidia obsession: Something insanely bad from a company-specific perspective will be the only thing taking this market darling down for any prolonged period of time. To be honest with you, I don't see where that insanely bad stuff would sprout from over the next few quarters.\n\nNeither do the array of plugged-in characters I chat up each week.\n\n\"I don't think when you get to Nvidia, there is any hype at all. I have known Jensen for decades, and he is the real deal. What these guys are doing is very real and very powerful,\" C3.ai (AI) founder and CEO Tom Siebel told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).\n\nHey Sam Altman, you should watch what Siebel thinks about your latest valuation...\n\nAnyhow, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) CEO Antonio Neri has known Jensen for ages. I didn't get the sense Nvidia's products were anything but super hot sellers in a chat with him, yours truly, and Seana Smith on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts.\n\n\"When you think about the large-scale [cloud] providers, what they want is to come to market with the latest technologies. And obviously, Blackwell is a key component of that as they go from air-cooled to the liquid cooling, more power density and more performance, and they are on track to do that,\" Neri said about Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking of Blackwell — Nvidia's new ultra-high-powered AI chip — the analyst community feels as if they are readying to jack up their fourth quarter profit forecasts on better-than-expected demand.\n\n\"We believe demand is outstripping supply for Nvidia 15:1, and the Street is realizing this AI party is still at 9 pm and being led by the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia. TSMC had monster [earnings] numbers, and Blackwell looks like an Aaron Judge debut coming out of the gates,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told me.\n\nThe JPMorgan team estimates \"several billion dollars\" in Blackwell revenue in Nvidia's fourth quarter. Huge if it happens, underscoring the appetite to build out AI infrastructure.\n\nBelieve me, I look at Nvidia very critically, just like all the companies I report on.\n\nBut geez, it sure looks as if Nvidia being back in beast mode makes a lot of sense — as does having a cutout of Jensen at my desk.\n\n\"Jensen is an innovator, great leader, great operator. You can't count those guys out of anything,\" Siebel added.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- There’s a growing divide in the $530 billion semiconductor industry between the companies that are riding the artificial intelligence wave and those that aren’t. And looking at the early returns from this earnings season, that gulf could soon widen into an abyss.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes Inside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided\n\n“Without AI, the market would be very sad,” Christophe Fouquet, chief executive of ASML Holding NV, said last week on a conference call after the Dutch chip production equipment maker cut its sales forecast for 2025 due to sluggish demand in everything other than AI.\n\nASML’s results sparked a new round of worries about the health of the chip industry, which is being hurt by weakness in key businesses like personal computers and automobiles. It also has been caught up in the rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China that could cut off access to the Chinese chip market, which is the biggest in the world.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which includes Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. among its customers, assuaged some of those fears after lifting its revenue forecast for 2024. While its growth is being fueled by AI-related drivers, overall chip demand has “stabilized” and is starting to improve, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said.\n\nThe Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, better known by its symbol SOX, tumbled last week, losing 5.3% on Tuesday alone before paring its losses following TSMC’s results on Thursday. To highlight the bifurcation, semiconductor equipment makers like ASML and Lam Research Corp. were among the leading decliners, while several chipmakers, including Marvell Technology Inc., managed to rise.\n\n“We should expect this kind of divergence to continue, since it is completely correct to assume it is all AI,” said Gabelli Funds research analyst Ryuta Makino, who sees the separate paths remaining until at least 2025.\n\nChip Creators\n\nThe semiconductor business is often viewed as a barometer for the global economy since chips are vital for a range of products, from data center servers to dishwashers. The companies that provide the equipment used to create these chips are on the industry’s front lines.\n\nBefore semiconductor companies can begin production, it takes months to build, install and test the machines used to manufacture the chips. As a result, companies like ASML have unusually long-range views of how their customers are feeling. At the moment, they’re flashing a caution signal for everything other than AI. For example, automotive and industrial suppliers are experiencing a demand slump as clients sit on elevated inventories.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, Intel Corp. is cutting costs and delaying new factories as it grapples with falling sales and mounting losses. Samsung Electronics Co. apologized to investors this month after delays in high-bandwidth memory chips led to disappointing financial results. And investors will be monitoring Texas Instruments Inc. this week, with its earnings due on Tuesday, since the company’s analog chips are used by a wide range of customers.\n\nTaken together, it appears there’s a tough road ahead for equipment makers, many of which saw their stocks hit record highs earlier this year. Some traders aren’t waiting around to see how this plays out and are already dumping the stocks.\n\nASML just suffered its worst week since early September, with its US-listed share price dropping 14%. Applied Materials Inc., the biggest US maker of chip equipment, sank 9.1%, while KLA and Lam Research each fell more than 12%.\n\n“We have been more cautious on other semi equipment names,” CJ Muse, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, wrote in a research note. “But had thought a longer lead time player like ASML would outperform. Clearly we were wrong with this assumption.”\n\nAfter ASML’s results, the analyst said he expects more downside for the stocks.\n\nInvestors will get more insight this week when chip equipment maker Lam Research reports on Oct. 23. KLA is due to release results on Oct. 30, followed by Applied Materials on Nov. 14.\n\nAI Spending Bump\n\nThings are very different for the semiconductor companies that will benefit from Big Tech’s continued heavy spending on AI development. Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. pumped more than $50 billion into capital expenditures in the second quarter, with much of that going to computing component makers. And many of these behemoths say they plan to spend even more in coming quarters to expand their AI infrastructures.\n\nOverall AI semiconductor industry sales are expected to jump to $245 billion in 2025 from an estimated $168 billion this year, according to Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management. She advised clients to add to AI-related chipmakers in the wake of ASML’s results.\n\n“We continue to see a strong growth outlook for AI semis, and are closely watching managements’ guidance on future demand in the days and weeks ahead,” she wrote in a research note last week.\n\nThe chief beneficiary from all the spending is Nvidia, whose chips dominate the market for AI accelerators. The stock hit a fresh record last week after assurances from Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang that its new Blackwell chip is in full production and seeing strong demand from customers. Nvidia shares are up more than 175% in 2024 and within striking distance of overtaking Apple as the world’s most valuable company with a market value of nearly $3.4 trillion.\n\nOther companies that should get a lift from the rising tide of AI spending include TSMC, Broadcom Inc., Arm Holdings Plc, Micron Technology Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which is attempting to loosen Nvidia’s grip on the accelerator market.\n\nHowever, even some of the winners aren’t immune from non-AI weakness. Just look at Broadcom. Its custom chips and networking semiconductors are used in data centers, but its stock price tumbled last month after posting disappointing results from parts of its business not tied to AI.\n\n“There will eventually be a value case to be made for non-AI chipmakers and a point when a strengthening economy means demand flips back,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. “However, it’s a question of timing. AI will remain a focus in the meantime.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAI Detectors Falsely Accuse Students of Cheating—With Big Consequences BYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs Neuralink Co-Founder’s New Startup Sells a Brain Computer Toolkit A Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work How Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meet the Newest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chip Stock to Join Nvidia in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) flew into the $1 trillion club in May 2023 as it capitalized on growing spending on artificial intelligence. The chipmaker has gone on to increase more than three-fold in value since, becoming the second most valuable company in the world, behind only Apple.\n\nThe rest of the $1 trillion club is full of some of Nvidia's biggest customers, the \"hyperscalers\" building out massive data centers for training and running generative AI. But the newest member of the club is actually a key part of Nvidia's supply chain. It's not just Nvidia, though. This semiconductor company works closely with almost every tech company in the $1 trillion club, and now, it's finally a member itself.\n\nThe newest artificial intelligence (AI) chip stock in the $1 trillion club is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM). Here's why $1 trillion may be just a milestone in the stock's continued ascension into the ranks of the mega-caps. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n\"The world's best by an incredible margin\"\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC, is a chip manufacturer, also known as a foundry or fab. It's the top choice for many chip designers, attracting over 60% of spending in the industry. There's good reason for that. TSMC's technology is much further ahead than that of nearly every competitor.\n\nAt an investor conference last month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said: \"We're fabbing out of TSMC because it's the world's best. And it's the world's best not by a small margin, it's the world's best by an incredible margin.\"\n\nThat's evidenced in TSMC's recent financial results for the third quarter. The company reported 39% year-over-year revenue growth. Its gross margin expanded to 57.8% from 54.3% last year, and net income grew 54.2% as a result. The driving force behind those stellar results is TSMC's technology lead. That makes it the must-have partner for anyone wanting to print advanced chips for AI (like Nvidia's GPUs) or smartphones (like Apple's iPhone).\n\n\"Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,\" CFO Wendell Huang wrote in the earnings release.\n\nThe AI story may be just getting started\n\nManagement expects revenue from AI chips to more than triple in 2024, but the segment will only account for a mid-teen percentage of TSMC's total for the year. There's a long runway for growth for TSMC in AI, and it's investing to take advantage of the opportunities presented.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia works with TSMC to print its chips, but it's not the only AI chipmaker taking advantage of the leading fab's advanced technology. Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices are all contracting with TSMC to develop AI accelerator chips. Apple has been using TSMC for years to develop its chips for the iPhone and iPad, and more recently, the Mac.\n\nIn other words, no matter how the future of AI data centers, large language model training, and AI inference plays out, TSMC stands to be a big winner.\n\nManagement increased its capital expenditure expectations for 2024 to more than $30 billion, and it expects to spend even more in 2025. It's also spending on research and development, which increased 11.4% year over year last quarter.\n\nBoth are keys to TSMC's ongoing success. As the largest foundry in the world by a wide margin, it's capable of spending more on machinery and technology while advancing its technological capabilities than any other competitor. That ensures it maintains its position as the technology leader, which in turn leads to continued relationships with the biggest customers in the world. That virtuous cycle is a tremendous competitive advantage for TSMC that's hard to overcome.\n\n$1 trillion may be just the start\n\nWhile shares of TSMC more than doubled in 2024, there's still room for the stock to climb higher.\n\nAt its current share price, it trades for just over 25 times analysts' estimates for 2025 earnings. And that's before they've had a chance to update their models with the most recent results and guidance from management. Over the next five years, TSMC is capable of growing its bottom line at a rate in the 20% range. AI spending remains robust, and the company is able to maintain its high gross margin from strong utilization even as it brings the next generation of technology online. That level of growth more than justifies the current earnings multiple.\n\nWhat's most attractive about the company is that it's protected from future changes in the industry. No matter who's designing the chips needed for data centers and smartphones, TSMC is sure to grab the vast majority of that business, thanks to the virtuous cycle described above. Given the excellent execution of management over the last few years amid the AI boom, the future continues to look bright for the newest member of the $1 trillion club.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be In 3 Years?",
        "content": "The extent of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) growth over the last three years came as a surprise to most investors. The stock spent most of 2022 selling off along with its tech peers. However, the company once known best for gaming and graphics processing units (GPUs) experienced an unprecedented surge amid the spike in demand for its leading artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\n\nEven when including the 2022 pullback, Nvidia stock rose by around 560% over the last three years. Given that massive gain, the question now may be what will happen to the semiconductor stock over the next three years.\n\nMaking sense of Nvidia\n\nAdmittedly, it is often hard to imagine where a company can go next when it has climbed to the pinnacle of its industry like Nvidia has. For all the talk of AI accelerators from AMD, Qualcomm, and others, Nvidia is the dominant company, and competitor alternatives are unlikely to catch up to it anytime soon.\n\nPredicting how the AI accelerator market will look in three years is speculation. Still, observers know that the data center segment, which develops AI accelerators, now accounts for 88% of Nvidia's revenue. It wasn't even Nvidia's largest revenue source three years ago.\n\nAlso, competition is rising. AMD plans to release its MI325X accelerator in the first quarter of 2025. That still lags behind the release of Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell accelerator, which is expected to come out in the current quarter.\n\nStill, Oracle chose AMD's chips to power the newest OCI Compute Supercluster instance. AMD has also indicated that Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and OpenAI have used its AI GPUs in some instances.\n\nNonetheless, Nvidia still controls up to 90% of the AI chip market, according to some estimates. Additionally, Nvidia's CUDA programming language keeps more users in its ecosystem, a factor likely to reinforce its dominance as other companies compete for a place in the AI chip industry.\n\nNvidia by the numbers\n\nThat knowledge has taken Nvidia stock into the stratosphere. Indeed, revenue for the first half of fiscal 2025 (ended July 28) was $56 billion, a 171% increase compared to the same period in fiscal 2024. However, such growth rates are unlikely to be sustainable, meaning growth will be significantly less, assuming sales are still rising.\n\nNvidia has other challenges if one looks below the surface. Its recent price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 62 may appear cheap, considering that Nvidia's net income surged 284% higher in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared with the same period in the prior year. Even though analysts forecast only 43% profit growth in fiscal 2026, the earnings multiple could continue to appear low.\n\nStory continues\n\nNonetheless, other valuation metrics might give the most risk-tolerant investors pause. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio now stands at around 34, approximately triple AMD's sales multiple of less than 11. Moreover, Nvidia trades at an astounding 56 times its book value, far above AMD at a price-to-book value ratio of less than 5.\n\nHence, as revenue growth slows, investors may start to question whether Nvidia stock is still worth its premium. That may place considerable pressure on Nvidia's stock, possibly more than it can recover from over the next three years.\n\nWhere will Nvidia be in three years?\n\nNvidia's trajectory over the next three years is uncertain, and investors could struggle with this stock as business conditions force the market to come to terms with a very likely growth slowdown.\n\nIndeed, Nvidia will likely remain a dominant company in a very lucrative AI chip industry. This should mean that Nvidia will remain a winner for investors planning to hold the stock for five years or more.\n\nUnfortunately, rising competition will likely end its triple-digit revenue growth, and the company appears already on track for net income to slow to double-digit levels.\n\nAdditionally, its sales multiple and price-to-book value ratio point to considerable overvaluation. Thus, Nvidia could face deceleration in the near term and possibly over three years as its stock adjusts to a coming slowdown.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "title": "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Sold Out of Nvidia. He's Buying This AI Stock Instead.",
        "content": "Stanley Druckenmiller is one of the greatest investors of all time. As the manager of Duquesne Capital Management from 1981 to 2010, Druckenmiller generated an average annual return of 30% and never had a losing year during that time. These days, Druckenmiller is no longer an active fund manager but still manages a portfolio of his own stocks through the Duquesne Family Office. And investors pay close attention to his moves.\n\nThat's why investors took notice when Druckenmiller, who was early to buy shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in Q4 2022 after ChatGPT launched, dumped most of his stake in the AI chip leader in the first half of this year. At the time, he said that the market now sees in Nvidia what he recognized earlier. In an interview last week with Bloomberg, the Duquesne chief revealed that he had sold his entire stake in Nvidia.\n\nDruckmiller admitted that it was a mistake to sell the chip stock, as Nvidia's stock price has continued to run up since then. He also said he remained bullish on artificial intelligence (AI), adding, \"We're big long-term believers in AI, and there are still many ways we're playing AI, particularly the infrastructure that's been built to support the power needed.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI stock Druckenmiller has been buying\n\nWhile Druckenmiller has sold all 9.5 million shares of Nvidia he once owned, he's been accumulating shares of another under-the-radar AI stock. That's Vistra (NYSE: VST), and it was Duquesne's third-biggest holding by market value as of the end of the second quarter at $225.7 million.\n\nDruckenmiller first bought the stock in the third quarter of 2023, the same quarter he started to unload his Nvidia stake. Since the end of that quarter, the stock is up 309%, and it's now the best-performing stock on the S&P 500 this year, having recently passed Nvidia for the title after a recent surge. Year to date, Vistra is up 252%.\n\nShould you follow Druckenmiller into Vistra? Let's take a look at what this unique AI play has to offer.\n\nWhat is Vistra?\n\nAs Druckenmiller alluded to in the quote above about AI infrastructure, energy is going to play a major role in AI as it takes incredible amounts of power to run AI data centers. That's where Vistra comes in. The Texas-based company is now the largest competitive (meaning deregulated) power generator in the country, with 41,000 megawatts (MW) of installed generation capacity.\n\nIt's also one of the biggest producers of nuclear energy in the country at 6,400 MW capacity. Following its acquisition of Energy Harbor earlier this year, it now has the second-largest energy storage capacity in the country at 1,020 MW.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe reason why investors increasingly see Vistra as a play on the AI boom is because power demand from data centers is expected to roughly triple from 2023 to 2030, adding 35 gigawatts of power demand in that time. Vistra also sees a number of other growth drivers, including the reshoring of industrial activity, construction of new semiconductor foundries due to the CHIPS Act, and increased electrification needs, including in the Permian Basin where it expects demand to jump by 20 gigawatts by 2030.\n\nThat growth explains why investors believe utility stocks like Vistra offer an appealing way to get exposure to the growth of AI.\n\nIs Vistra a buy?\n\nVistra is a utility company, so it's still subject to most of the constraints of a utility. However, it has one advantage over other utilities: It operates in unregulated power markets, supplying power at market price, rather than at a price determined by regulators. That's the way most utilities operate because they're regulated monopolies.\n\nThat gives the business significant upside potential if a supply crunch ensues from the growth of AI and data centers.\n\nDespite that growth opportunity, at this point, Vistra is actually more expensive than Nvidia, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 100, though analysts expect profits to ramp up through 2025. Energy prices are notoriously difficult to predict, however.\n\nAnnouncements this week from Alphabet and Amazon have helped drive nuclear stocks higher. They show that big tech companies are working to secure adequate sources of clean power for their data center needs.\n\nVistra could fit in an AI portfolio. However, after the recent run-up, I think it makes more sense to wait for a better price to buy the stock.\n\nDruckenmiller seems to agree with that statement. After buying the stock three quarters in a row, he took a break in the second quarter, perhaps thinking that the price had already run up substantially.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Bloomberg recently reported the U.S. could impose caps on exports of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips to some Middle Eastern countries. Semiconductor fabrication equipment maker ASML lowered its 2025 guidance. Both were widely viewed as bad news for Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nIs Nvidia's huge multiyear run nearly over? I don't think so. Instead, I predict that Nvidia's share price could be headed to $175 in 2025.\n\nWhy a 30% gain is achievable\n\nNvidia's stock would have to jump 30% to reach $175 next year. I believe this gain is achievable for three key reasons.\n\nFirst, the shift to accelerated computing appears to be unstoppable. This trend should easily offset any negative impact on Nvidia from restrictions on shipping advanced AI chips to some Middle Eastern countries. During the first half of 2024, only 6.5% of the company's total revenue came from countries other than the U.S., Singapore, Taiwan, and China. Middle Eastern revenue is only a portion of that percentage.\n\nBut what about ASML's weaker outlook? I suspect it's more related to overcapacity at factories that manufacture chips than anything else. Just because the demand for chipmaking equipment declines doesn't necessarily mean that the demand for chips will fall, too.\n\nSecond, Blackwell is coming. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC the demand for its new GPU platform is \"insane.\" Morgan Stanley learned in a meeting with Nvidia's management that Blackwell GPUs are already sold out for the next 12 months.\n\nHuang has said in the past that Blackwell could be the most successful product in Nvidia's history. I think he could be right. As Nvidia begins to report sales numbers for Blackwell in the next few quarters, I expect the stock to rise.\n\nThird, look for Nvidia to announce its next generation of AI chips sometime next year. Even if the company doesn't begin shipping these chips until the end of 2025 (or even early 2026), investors' excitement about the next big GPU advance could provide a catalyst for the stock.\n\nMany on Wall Street don't agree (yet)\n\nGranted, many Wall Street analysts aren't nearly as bullish. The average 12-month price target reflects an upside potential for Nvidia of around 10%.\n\nOf the 38 analysts surveyed by financial data provider LSEG in October, 15 rated Nvidia as a \"hold.\" Another recommended selling the stock. That's a marked change from September, when 55 of 60 analysts rated Nvidia as a \"buy\" or a \"strong buy.\"\n\nHowever, I've noticed a pattern with Wall Street recommendations and price targets for Nvidia. The consensus tends to be modestly optimistic until the company reports its next quarterly results. Then, analysts frantically scramble to revise their estimates upward.\n\nStory continues\n\nI fully expect that history will repeat itself as we move into 2025. As Nvidia reveals its sales figures for Blackwell, my hunch is that the average price target for the stock will increase significantly -- and perhaps to my predicted level of $175.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nOf course, my prediction could fall flat on its face. What could go wrong? Several things.\n\nThe U.S. economy could run into trouble. An escalation of tensions around the world could negatively impact Nvidia's business. Major cloud service providers could choose to scale back their investments in GPUs. They could also shift some of their spending to buy chips from Nvidia's rivals or rely more heavily on their own AI chips.\n\nWhile I acknowledge these risks, I stand by my prediction. Nvidia's share price could reach $175 next year. How long it stays at or above that level, though, is another question.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "2 Stocks That Could Join Nvidia in the $3 Trillion Club",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best stocks to profit off the artificial intelligence (AI) boom over the last two years. Shares of the AI chip leader have surged more than 820% since 2022 and currently have of a market cap of nearly $3.3 trillion -- trailing only Apple's $3.5 trillion.\n\nThe following \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are not far behind and could deliver exceptional returns in the next few years to join Nvidia and Apple in the $3 trillion club.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) shares have delivered life-changing returns to investors over the last few decades and continue to generate market-beating gains. The stock has doubled over the last five years, bringing its total market cap to $2 trillion. Based on the company's opportunities, the shares could climb another 50% in the next few years to reach $3 trillion in total market value.\n\nWhen you deliver billions of orders each year, every last mile of cost adds up. Amazon was able to reduce the cost to serve retail customers in 2023 for the first time since 2018. It continues to find ways to strip costs out of the retail business. The company's operating profit has doubled over the last year, as it shortens and optimizes delivery routes.\n\nReducing costs can benefit Amazon more than simply boosting its short-term profitability. It also can allow Amazon to gain market share in online shopping by lowering prices on select goods. Shortening transportation distances also means customers receive their orders faster, and that can lead to more frequent shopping.\n\nAmazon says it has plenty of opportunities to reduce costs by using automation and robotics and continuing to build its same-day delivery network. The company already controlled 37% of the U.S. e-commerce market in 2023 -- 6 times the share of No. 2 Walmart, according to Statista. Amazon's efforts to improve efficiencies and speed up order delivery show a relentless competitor continuing to look for ways to protect and stretch its lead. This is the kind of business you want protecting and growing your savings for retirement.\n\nAnalysts expect earnings to reach $7.30 per share by 2026, an increase of 52% over 2024 estimates. Amazon investors can expect the stock to climb along with that increase and reach a $3 trillion market cap within two years.\n\n2. Alphabet (formerly Google)\n\nShares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) also doubled in the last five years. The company's market cap is currently hovering around $2 trillion, putting it within striking distance of Nvidia's market value.\n\nWhile Amazon Web Services is the leading cloud service provider for enterprises, many businesses prefer Google Cloud. Google has been steadily gaining share of the cloud market in recent years. New AI services offered in Google Cloud are fueling its momentum.\n\nThe company credited strong demand for AI infrastructure and generative AI services for driving recent growth in the cloud. Google Cloud's revenue grew to more than $10 billion in the second quarter, but equally important, the segment's operating profit nearly tripled to surpass $1.1 billion last quarter. This shows Alphabet is earning a high return on investment on AI tools offered to Google Cloud customers like Vertex and the Gemini AI model.\n\nIt's also impressive that Alphabet can make the necessary investments to drive strong demand for cloud services and AI while producing solid earnings growth. Earnings grew 31% year over year in Q2, and analysts expect Alphabet's earnings to grow 16% over the long term.\n\nBy 2026, the consensus estimate has Alphabet's earnings reaching $10. If Alphabet earns a market average price-to-earnings ratio of around 27, the shares could be worth $270, implying upside of 62%. It could easily hit a $3 trillion market cap in two years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying Another Brilliant Stock-Split Stock",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) are brilliant companies. The former is a critical supplier in the artificial intelligence economy, and the latter has built enviable brand authority in the restaurant business. In turn, they have been such rewarding investments of late that both companies conducted stock splits in June to reset their soaring share prices.\n\nHowever, the billionaire hedge fund managers below still sold shares of Nvidia in the second quarter while buying shares of Chipotle.\n\nCliff Asness of AQR Capital Management sold 1.3 million shares of Nvidia and purchased 673,292 shares of Chipotle. Israel Englander of Millennium Management sold 672,242 shares of Nvidia and added 3.5 million shares of Chipotle. Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management sold 409,042 shares of Nvidia and purchased 1.4 million shares of Chipotle. Steven Schonfeld of Schonfeld Strategic Advisors sold 370,349 shares of Nvidia and added 131,715 shares of Chipotle.\n\nInvestors should not interpret those trades to mean Nvidia is a bad investment. All four fund managers still have some level of exposure to the semiconductor company, and the exposure is significant in some cases. For instance, Nvidia is still the largest position in AQR's portfolio.\n\nNevertheless, the trades are worth consideration. Here's what investors should know about Nvidia and Chipotle.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia is the foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in accelerated computing, which pairs specialized hardware and software to speed up data center workloads, like AI training and inference. Nvidia has 80% market share in AI accelerators. That utter dominance reflects not only the superior performance of its GPUs but also the unparalleled breadth of its software development tools.\n\nVivek Arya at Bank of America recently raised his 12-month price target to $190 per share. The rationale behind the revision is that Nvidia will still have a 75% market share in AI accelerators by the end of the decade, such that data center revenue increases at 20% annually in the interim. That seems plausible, given that Nvidia is gaining share in adjacent data center hardware verticals, especially AI networking equipment.\n\nNvidia reported strong financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended July 2024), beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 122% to $30 billion due to particularly strong momentum in the data center segment, driven by demand for AI hardware. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings soared 152% to $0.68 per diluted share.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors have good reason to think that momentum will continue. Nvidia has a big catalyst on the horizon with the launch of its next-generation GPU, Blackwell. The production ramp will begin in the fourth quarter, and demand is already so strong that the processors are booked out for 12 months. That means customers who place orders today will not receive Blackwell GPUs until late 2025.\n\nImportantly, the hedge fund managers mentioned earlier were selling Nvidia in the second quarter. During that period, the stock traded at an average valuation of 66.4 times earnings, and earnings were projected to increase 34% annually over the next three years. But the stock is more attractive today. The stock currently trades at 64.7 times earnings, and analysts expect earnings to increase by 38% annually over the next three years.\n\nBuilding on that, the present earnings multiple divided by the three-year earnings forecast gives a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of 1.7, a significant discount to the three-year average of 3.1. Long-term investors should consider buying a few shares here, though I would keep the purchase relatively small. The valuation is reasonable, but it's not cheap.\n\n2. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle operates more than 3,500 fast-casual restaurants in North America and Europe. The company has built brand authority and consumer loyalty by focusing on \"food with integrity.\" It sources only responsibly raised meats, never treated with hormones or antibiotics, and uses only fresh ingredients, meaning no preservatives, freezers, or can openers involved. As a result, Chipotle consistently ranks above average in same-store sales and customer traffic.\n\nChipotle has been laser-focused on improving throughput. It regularly retrains workers on fundamentals to ensure ingredients are stocked, food is prepared, and stores are properly staffed. Additionally, following the pandemic, the company launched new labor management and coaching tools and added technologies that automate certain workflows. Those efforts get customers through the line more quickly, which tends to improve satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nChipotle reported solid financial results in the second quarter. Revenue rose 18% to $3 billion on strong same-store sales driven by increased customer traffic and larger checks. Non-GAAP net income jumped 36% to $0.34 per diluted share. Former CEO Brian Niccol said, \"Our focus and training around throughput paid off as we were able to meet the strong demand trends with terrific service and speed.\"\n\nImportantly, the hedge fund managers mentioned earlier were buying Chipotle in the second quarter. At the time, shares traded at an average valuation of 65.9 times earnings, and earnings were forecasted to grow by 21% annually over the next three years. But the stock looks more attractive today. Shares currently trade at 58.2 times earnings, and earnings are projected to increase by 22% annually over the next three years.\n\nThat said, Chipotle stock is still expensive. The present earnings multiple divided by the three-year earnings forecast gives a PEG ratio of 2.6, a premium to the three-year average of 2.4. Prospective investors should wait for a pullback (maybe 10%) before buying shares.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Among the Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks owned by hedge funds.\n\nWall Street stocks surged this month after the Federal Reserve released minutes of its September meeting, which resulted in the first interest rate cuts in over four years. The details disclosed a ‘substantial majority’ of central bankers backing the 0.5 percentage-point cut, raising optimism among investors for further cuts ahead.\n\nThe broader market hit record highs on October 11, driven by several financial stocks reporting stronger-than-expected results during the recently concluded quarter. Another factor encouraging investors has been the downturn in US inflation, which fell to 2.4% in September and is inching toward the Federal Reserve’s goal of a two percent annual rate. This has raised hopes of a quarter-point cut in the central bank’s next meeting in November.\n\nHowever, some analysts warn against diving into stocks after interest rate cuts, citing uncertainty around the upcoming presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider in early September discussed historic patterns in US markets towards the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth.\n\nShe noted how the market performs well between June and August due to thinner volumes when traders are on vacation, while volatility picks up with an uptick in activity after they return to their desks in September. However, during the election year, this volatility peaks around mid-October, instead of September, according to Young Thomas.\n\nFundstrat Global Advisors’ co-founder, Tom Lee, has also cautioned investors against election-related uncertainty. Here is what he stated in an interview with CNBC late last month:\n\nThis Fed cut cycle I think is setting the stage for markets to be really strong over the next one month or next three months. But, what the stocks do between now and let’s say election day, I think is still a lot of uncertainty. And that’s the reason why I’m a little hesitant for investors to dive in.\n\nEarlier that month in the weeks leading to the interest rate cuts, Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, forecasted a 7-10% dip between September and October amid nervousness around the presidential elections. However, Lee urged investors to ‘buy the dip’, indicating that he sees the likely fall as an opportunity to buy stocks while they trade for a lower value.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdam Turnquist from LPL Financial also anticipates seasonal volatility in the weeks ahead but reiterated what Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes. Turnquist advises investors not to readjust their existing portfolios because seasonal volatility has short-term effects and is difficult to forecast.\n\nWith that said, let’s now shift focus to hedge fund sentiment on the stock market and discuss some of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s share price has surged by over 2000% over the last five years, driven by robust demand for graphics processing units (GPU) and AI models. It is the go-to company for firms looking for GPUs and semiconductors as they increase spending on artificial intelligence, which has been a significant catalyst behind the company’s growth.\n\nThe software and fabless company had another strong quarter in Q2 2024, with revenues soaring 122% from last year to $30 billion. Net income for the quarter stood at $16.6 billion, which enabled NVIDIA to beat earnings forecasts as it posted an EPS of $0.68, against projections of $0.645. The company attributed these solid results in Q2 to increased demand for data center chips.\n\nNVIDIA anticipates a revenue of $32.5 billion in Q3, with gross margin in the range of 74.4% and 75%. It also expects a strong performance from its Blackwell and Hopper Architecture products during the back half of 2024. Wall Street analysts have a consensus on the stock’s Strong Buy rating and project an upside potential of over 8% in NVIDIA’s share price. However, if growth fails to meet forecasts, that could result in a downturn in the share’s value.\n\nMost investors remain bullish on the stock. It is also one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q2 2024, 179 hedge funds had investments in the company. Here is what Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including data center acceleration, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefited from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Tech Stocks According to Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other promising tech stocks.\n\nNASDAQ is Poised for Long-Term Returns\n\nBig tech is expected to outperform in the coming months. On October 2, Ari Wald, Oppenheimer's Head of Technical Analysis, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis and explain why investors must consider high-growth companies.\n\nWald highlights that market breadth is expected to remain high supporting extended highs throughout the end of 2024. In addition to that, he expects the bull cycle to remain intact and believes the trend will continue in 2025. During the late summer, the market saw a change in the high beta versus low volatility ratio stocks. It was seen that high-beta stocks could not keep up with high dividend-paying and lower-volatility names.\n\nGiven the rotational nature of the market, Wald expects higher beta names to make a strong comeback and reclaim their leadership position. Wald suggests that investors should consider investing in higher growth companies, as the Nasdaq and Russel 100 are expected to lead again. Trends show that the mag seven is growing and climbing, as the market conditions continue to settle.\n\nViewing Tech Stocks on Valuations Alone is Wrong, Strategist Says\n\nTechnology stocks have more room to run. On October 14, Malcolm Ethridge, Capital Area Planning Group managing partner, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the technology market outlook and revealed his favorite picks.\n\nEthridge suggests that judging stocks based on their valuations alone is a big mistake, especially in the current market cycle which is heavily influenced by the AI boom. Looking at the broader perspective, he believes there are a lot of positive opportunities among the magnificent seven and outside of it.\n\nHe adds that companies among the mega tech have been pouring billions into generating large language models and the likes of it. He also suggests that most of this technology is yet to be understood and therefore the true value we can derive from these technologies is yet to come. These companies also have a lot of intrinsic value and there is more to be realized soon.\n\nNow that we have studied the technology market outlook, let's take a look at the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. You can also read our piece on the most promising AI stocks according to analysts.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the most promising technology stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through multiple ETFs, our own rankings, and similar rankings on the internet. We then ranked the most promising tech stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment as of Q2 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

The chip maker is also a provider of cloud services and gaming products.\n\nThe company is rapidly growing and garnering attention from across the globe. Recently the company closed a deal with Salesforce and also launched a new AI tool to meet the needs of the next generation of mobiles, robots, autonomous vehicles, and 5G. On October 8, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) partnered with TSMC to push the limits for the next generation of advanced semiconductor chips using Nvidia's computational lithography platform.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to generate $32.5 billion in revenue during the fiscal third quarter of 2024. This revenue is likely to come from its rapidly growing Hopper architecture and its new and improved Blackwell Chips. By the end of this year, the company is also expected to ramp up production for the chips.\n\nOn October 14, Ben Reitzes, Melius Research's head of technology research, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed his outlook on NVDA. He suggests that there is a lot of upside near the company's growth estimates and revenue, quite less than any other stock. According to him, NVDA will be trading at one time its P/E to growth ratio in 2025, which is highly attractive for a name as influential as NVDA. He adds that the demand for its Blackwell chips is huge and the company will have to ramp up production.\n\nThere is no denying that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a crucial role to play in the artificial intelligence industry, which explains why 179 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the close of Q2 2024.\n\nIthaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs).

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Stocks with Lowest Short Interest to Buy.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks with lowest short interest to buy.\n\nA report from S3 Partners revealed that the rally in Chinese stocks as a result of stimulus measures cost traders who were betting against the US-listed shares ~$6.9 billion in mark-to-market losses. Benchmark CSI 300 index saw an increase of more than ~22% over the past month. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon index went up by over ~34% during the same period. Much of these increases were seen off the back of policy-easing measures.\n\nS3 Partners went on to say that, before this market rally, short sellers continued to build their positions profitably in the falling market. However, after the rebound, the short selling in the group slowed. Before China announced the stimulus plans, shorting the Chinese stocks was a popular strategy, with several market players going underweight in the sector.\n\nShort Selling in Q2 2024\n\nS3 Partners reported that short interest in the US/Canada markets went up by $57.9 billion, or 5.1%, to $1.20 trillion in Q2 2024. The increase comprised $73.9 billion of new short selling, which was partially offset by a $16.0 billion fall in the mark-to-market value of shares shorted. During the quarter, the sectors that saw the largest increase in short selling were the IT, Industrials, and Communication Services sectors. On the other hand, the Energy sector was the only sector that saw a decrease in shares shorted (short covering).\n\nShort Sellers Reduced Their Positions in This Sector\n\nS&P Global reported that short sellers decided to pull back their bets against consumer staples stocks on the US exchanges during the summer months. This comes amidst the general increase in overall short interest throughout equities. Recent data suggests that the short interest in the consumer staples sector declined to 3.87% at the end of August from 4.16% at the end of May. The decline in short interest against consumer staples stocks might be due to the decline in inflation.\n\nOn the other hand, short interest in the industrial sector went up by 21 bps from the end of May to the end of August, rose 20 basis points in the healthcare sector, and jumped 19 basis points in the real estate sector, as per the company. With the expectations of further rate cuts, market experts opine that the consumer staples sector might see sustained demand. The consumer spending resulted in solid Q2 2024 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 3% (annualized), approximately double the rate of Q1 growth, as per the US Bank.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter the rate cut in September, market strategists recommended going long on consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors. This is because these sectors are expected to receive a boost as declining mortgage rates might benefit spending, reported Reuters.\n\nTherefore, with the expectations of lower inflation and interest rates, there can be some revival in consumer confidence. This should result in increased spending on staple goods, which might lead to improved performance in the consumer staple sector. As per Evercore, among the S&P 500 sectors, consumer staples and consumer discretionary have seen the best average performance, with both sectors gaining ~14% a year after the rate cut.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list 8 Stocks with Lowest Short Interest to Buy, we used a Finviz screener to extract the list of stocks having the lowest short interest. Next, we narrowed down our list to the following 8 stocks having short interest of less than 2%. Finally, the stocks were ranked in the descending of their short interest.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nShort % of Float (as of September 30): 1.07%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers graphics and compute and networking solutions.\n\nMarker experts opine that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to dominate the AI chip market space, capitalizing on its robust position in graphics processing units (GPUs) in a bid to capitalize on the growing demand for AI infrastructure. The healthy demand for the company’s Hopper GPU computing platform, together with growth in InfiniBand and Ethernet for AI revenue, should continue to fuel its financial performance over the near term.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s CUDA software platform and system software capabilities are expected to act as primary differentiators. The company continues to focus on expanding its presence in enterprise and edge computing markets. Its AI Foundry and NIMs (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) offerings target simplifying AI rollouts for enterprises, opening up new revenue streams as and when businesses adopt AI technologies.\n\nDespite the competitive pressures, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s technological lead and ecosystem advantages should help it maintain market leadership over the next few years. Analysts at Rosenblatt Securities reiterated a “Buy” rating on the shares of the company, issuing a $200.00 target price on 29th August.\n\nVltava Fund, an investment management company, recently released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Over the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA’s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA’s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the less reliable those estimates are. So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the stocks with lowest short interest to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Is A Stock With High Consensus ROE",
        "content": "We recently looked at Goldman Sachs’ Stocks With Highest Consensus Returns: 42 Stocks With The Highest Consensus ROE. In this piece, we will look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks in the list.\n\nAs the fourth quarter of 2024 settles in, the narrative surrounding stocks on Wall Street is starting to shift. This is unsurprising since the beginning of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cycles stands to change economic conditions in America. These will naturally affect businesses, and cyclical stocks along with financials should see an improved outlook.\n\nFor instance, consider two reports by investment bank Morgan Stanley. One of these was released before the interest rate cut, and it covered the bank’s thoughts about the stock market and the US economy for September. The other came in October, after the rate cut. In its September report,  MS laid out three scenarios for the flagship S&P index’s performance for the rest of this year. The best case scenario posits that the index would close at 5,650 points in the near term, while the “attractive” and “fair” scenarios predict a closing of 5,200 and 5,350 points, respectively.  Yet, the market has outperformed even the best scenario, as its recent reading is 5,764.\n\nThe bank also shares that inflation is finally dropping in America. This fact is explained through the S&P’s second quarter earnings performance. In fact, the shifting inflationary trends have set new highs for a decade when we consider sales and earnings surprises for the index according to MS. Its data shows that when inflation was soaring in Q4 2022, the net of positive and negative EPS surprises stood in lowest quintile since businesses struggled with costs. This was despite the fact that during the same time period the net of positive and negative revenue surprises was in the 70% percentile. However, now that inflation has dropped, data for the second quarter earnings season shows that the EPS surprise was in the uppermost quintile (above 80%) while the revenue surprise had dropped to roughly 35%. This data covers the past ten years, and as a result, it illustrates the momentous shifts that the market is undergoing right now.\n\nSince interest rates are the hottest topic on Wall Street, MS also commented on its expectations for them. At the September start, the bank posited that markets were expecting 100 basis points of cuts by 2024 end. The bank shared that it thought “this looks aggressive unless the U.S. economy has a hard landing, but this is not our base case.” With September’s 50 basis points cut out of the way, these expectations have remained unchanged as the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that for the Fed’s November and December meetings, the market has set the probabilities for a 25 basis point cut in each at 85.5% and 82.1%, respectively. These cuts are important for determining the market’s direction, as MS’ data shows that when economic activity as measured by the ISM Manufacturing Index sat at ~67 in 2010, the S&P’s 12 month total return was 30%.\n\nStory continues\n\nShifting gears to the October report, MS cautions that while historically equities have outperformed following the first Fed rate cut, elevated valuations, and “consensus forecasting of EPS acceleration rather than decline, equities upside after the first cut may prove more limited this cycle.” The bank’s key stock market insight from its October report comes through its comments about cyclical stocks, though. MS shares that as upward economic growth surprises softened from April through August, “sector and factor trends skewed defensive, consistent with softer economic growth.” However, this might not be the case moving forward, as shown by the Citi Global Economic Surprise Index. MS outlines that this index had bottomed out in August with a ~-25 reading, which had jumped to roughly -12 in September. This trend was mirrored in the difference between global cyclical and defensive sectors, with the reading also moving upward as the economic surprises jumped.\n\nThese factors are key when we analyze Goldman Sachs’ list of stocks with the highest expected ROE since the bank believes that stock quality will be determined by economic growth and economic rates. The bank also recently upped its 2024 closing target for the S&P to 6,000 points. This was the fourth revision of its target and a sizeable increase from the previous estimate of 5,600 points. This increase was also accompanied by optimism for the index’s earnings. GS now believes that S&P’s 2025 earnings will sit at $268, for a 4.7% revision from the previous estimate of $256. Its 2024 estimate is unchanged, though, and its value of $241 implies that earnings next year will grow by 11.2%.\n\nAs for the next 12 months, GS believes that the S&P will sit at 6,300 points, for an 8.9% growth over its recent value of 5,779. As MS’ data pointed out that EPS surprises are growing as inflation tames, Goldman is also of a similar view. This is because the bank’s chief US equity strategist David Kostin shares that the upward EPS revision is reflective of the fact that the “macro backdrop remains conducive to modest margin expansion, with prices charged outpacing input cost growth.” In a later note, the analyst outlined that “Over the past year, performance of several quality factors has tracked the broad trajectory of market views on growth and monetary policy.” Kostin added that “A positive jobs print could prompt some investors to rotate out of expensive ‘quality’ stocks into less-loved lower quality firms as the market would likely price lower odds of substantial labor market weakening.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs’ stocks with the highest consensus ROE, we used the bank’s latest list of 50 such stocks and chose those with a 5% or higher consensus ROE.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA senior manager studying a market index alongside a team of young stock market analysts.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nConsensus ROE: 42%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 108\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor designer. The firm sells x86 based CPUs, GPUs, and custom chips. It has one of the most unique positions for any company in the world. In the CPU market, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) competes with the larger rival Intel, while in the GPU market, it competes with Wall Street’s AI darling NVIDIA. Consequently, it is the only company within the trio with an established position in both markets. Like NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s narrative in 2024 has focused on AI. Its ability to perform well depends on how well it can capture the AI accelerator market from NVIDIA and whether the AI products lead to bottom line profits. Additionally, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has also continued to gain CPU market share over Intel due to the latter’s struggles with manufacturing. With NVIDIA’s chips pricey and in short supply, the firm could see tailwinds from capturing sizeable AI accelerator orders from the likes of Tesla and Microsoft.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s data center division has been its fastest growing segment for several quarters. Here’s what management shared during the Q2 2024 investor call. Here is what they said:\n\n“Turning to the segments, data center segment revenue increased 115% year-over-year to a record $2.8 billion, driven by the steep ramp of Instinct MI300 GPU shipments and a strong double-digit percentage increase in EPYC CPU sales. Cloud adoption remains strong as hyperscalers deploy fourth-gen EPYC CPUs to power more of their internal workloads and public instances. We are seeing hyperscalers select EPYC processors to power a larger portion of their applications and workloads, displacing incumbent offerings across their infrastructure with AMD solutions that offer clear performance and efficiency advantages.\n\nThe number of AMD-powered cloud instances available from the largest providers has increased 34% from a year ago to more than 900. We are seeing strong pull for these instances with both enterprise and cloud-first businesses. As an example, Netflix and Uber both recently selected fourth-gen EPYC Public Cloud instances as one of the key solutions to power their mission critical customer facing workloads. In the enterprise, sales were increased by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially. We closed multiple large wins in the quarter with financial services, technology, health care, retail, manufacturing, and transportation customers, including Adobe, Boeing, Industrial Light & Magic, Optiver, and Siemens. Importantly, more than one-third of our enterprise server wins in the first half of the year were with businesses deploying EPYC in their data centers for the first time, highlighting our success attracting new customers, while also continuing to expand our footprint with existing customers.”\n\nOverall AMD ranks 7th on our list of stocks with the highest consensus ROE according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 7 Most Profitable Gaming Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the most profitable gaming stocks to invest in.\n\nGaming Evolution: Key Trends Shaping the Market\n\nThe gaming industry is currently experiencing significant changes driven by technology and evolving consumer preferences. One of the most notable trends is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), which is transforming game development and player experiences. AI is being used to create more realistic environments and enhance gameplay by adapting to individual player styles. Here’s a short excerpt from our previous article “7 Best Gaming Stocks To Buy Now” that discusses this in more detail:\n\n“According to Bernard Marr, a world-renowned futurist and author of ‘Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is Changing Business and Society’, generative AI is revolutionizing video game development by providing tools that enable developers to create engaging content, realistic visuals, and immersive gameplay experiences. Marr believes that generative AI can help developers create vast, unique game environments through procedural generation, allowing for dynamic gameplay experiences that change with each session.”\n\nAnother major trend in the gaming market is the rise of microtransactions, particularly in free-to-play games. This monetization model has become increasingly prevalent as developers look for sustainable revenue streams.\n\nOn March 24, CNBC reported that two of the largest video game companies in the US, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive, are increasingly relying on live-service games, subscriptions, and in-game purchases for their revenue. Microtransactions, which allow players to buy virtual items or features within games using real money, have become a significant source of income. Popular titles like Fortnite, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Clash Royale utilize this model, where players pay for ongoing updates and seasonal content through subscriptions or battle passes.\n\nMat Piscatella, executive director of video games at Circana, noted that the industry has shifted towards a “battle pass” system, which packages seasonal content in a way that players find valuable. This approach has led to a more positive response from gamers, as they feel they receive consistent value for their money. The trend indicates that game publishers must continuously engage players with new content to maintain their interest in these live service games.\n\nAccording to Comscore’s 2024 State of Gaming Report, around 82% of American gamers made in-game purchases in freemium games in 2023.

As the Fed recalibrates to an easier monetary policy and corporate profits continue to grow, the chief investment strategist believes the market will maintain its rally as we approach November and December.\n\nAs of today, the S&P is around 3% shy of hitting 6,000. This is only eight months after it eclipsed 5,000 for the first time. Monday, October 14 proved to be a new record for the S&P, marking the bull market's second anniversary. The milestone represents an impressive recovery over the last two years when stock prices surged despite ongoing recession concerns and elevated interest rates.\n\nS&P 500 reaching all-time highs comes amidst optimism on Wall Street as the third-quarter earnings season kicks in. With corporate earnings proving resilient amidst high rates and moderating inflation, and investors piling into stocks poised to benefit the most from the generative AI craze- the market sentiment remains bullish as traders anticipate strong financial results and continued growth in technology-driven sectors.\n\nArtificial Intelligence-linked stocks have been leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher.

Nevertheless, ongoing AI innovation and a resilient economy are still in support of further gains. In light of this, Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, further notes how third-quarter results could act as a catalyst for market gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI.\n\n\"We continue to expect increased volatility for technology stocks in the near term,” the note states. “However, we remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI).

It is not only the leader in the AI chip market but has built a comprehensive AI ecosystem that spans graphics, computing, and networking solutions. Its GPUs are the backbone of AI innovation globally, powering everything from advanced data centers to autonomous systems.\n\nTD Cowen Analysts further reiterated its $165 price target for Nvidia, calling it its top pick amidst surging demand for its new supercomputing AI chips, Blackwell. Stocks tied to the chipmaker, such as Arm Holdings (ARM), TSMC (TSM), and Nvidia-backed Soundhound AI (SOUN) also gained on October 14, 2024; leading the S&P 500 to a record high.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore has reiterated Nvidia as a “top pick,” with a Buy rating and a price target of $150 per share.

(NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 108\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is an American multinational corporation operating as a semiconductor company worldwide. The company is trying to establish itself as a key player in AI-powered personal computers (AIPCs), driving innovation in hardware to support advanced, next-generation applications. By integrating technology across CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs, it strives to create a strong ecosystem that supports the development of powerful AI applications.\n\nAMD held its Advancing AI 2024 event on October 10, 2024. At its AI event in San Francisco, AMD revealed its latest AI data center processors and new PC and server chips. In particular, the MI325X chip, built on the same architecture as the MI300X, incorporates a new memory variant designed to accelerate AI-related tasks. Vendors like Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) are expected to begin shipping AMD's new AI chip to customers in Q1 2025. AMD aims to use the chip to compete with Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips. AMD also plans to launch its next-gen MI2350 chips that will be more powerful than the MI325 series chips.\n\nRegardless, the stock’s share ended the day down by 4% following the AI event. As per Bernstein Research analysts, its GPU faces a “Zero challenge” against Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip.\n\n\"Even the company's MI350X tease shows raw performance that, while on par with Blackwell on paper, arrives a year later, just in time to compete against Nvidia's next offerings. Hence we do not see even AMD's accelerated road map closing the competitive gap.\"\n\n- Bernstein Research analysts.\n\nVivek Arya, research analyst at Bank of America Securities, further notes how there is \"no near-term catalyst to change the dynamic\" between the company and its chip rivals.\n\n\"Training performance seems 1 year behind Blackwell (on par with H200) while inferencing is only slightly better”.\n\n-Vivek Arya\n\nOn the other hand, Jefferies and Bank of America both maintained Buy ratings for the stock as of Friday (October 11), with price targets of $190 and $180, respectively, while 13 of 17 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha also rated it a \"buy,\" with a consensus target of $192.13.\n\nIn other news, the US is weighing on capping exports of AI chips from both Nvidia and AMD on a country-specific basis. This move is going to limit some countries’ artificial intelligence capabilities. Officials are particularly focused on Persian Gulf countries, and discussions are still in the early and fluid stages, but interest in the policy has increased recently. Last month, Commerce Department officials introduced these regulations, with more rules expected in the future.\n\nOverall AMD ranks 5th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks. Since Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) ranks 7th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer during his October 14 program on CNBC looked excited as he celebrated the rebound of major tech stocks, saying these companies are showing their “staying power” despite the odds.\n\n“We’re back. That’s right. Whatever you want to call them, these big tech plays are demonstrating their staying power no matter what happens.”\n\nCramer said that the latest earnings season would be critical for the overall market and investor portfolios. He also pointed out the broadening of the rally, saying other groups besides the tech industry are also rebounding.\n\n“This rally is not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can work, too, in this market. There’s a lot of money going around, and we know there’s a lot of money coming into the market. The Fed is cutting rates, and friendly cash won’t be worth as much as it was. But the staying power of the Magnificent 7 is truly unbelievable.”\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 important stocks he’s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Lately, it stalled and had a weak second quarter. I’ve always thought when you have a primary idea like NVIDIA and a secondary idea like Super Micro, you don’t need the latter.”\n\nCarillon Scout Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) was the top detractor to returns in the second quarter. Super Micro designs and manufacturers server solutions based on modular and open-standard architecture. This modular approach combined with a strong engineering culture helps the company to supply the market with advanced servers and rack-scale compute solutions quickly. After an impressive return in the first quarter, the company offered disappointing near-term earnings guidance, though we do not believe its long-term opportunity has diminished. We expect continued strong growth for several years, although the range of outcomes is quite wide; it is difficult to forecast AI server market growth with precision.”\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) ranks 7th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Super Micro Computer, Inc.

        "content": "The past few years have marked a renaissance in the popularity of stock splits. The practice was commonplace during the 1990s but had fallen out of favor, only to be discovered by a new generation of investors over the past few years. Companies will generally make the decision to split their shares after years of strong growth and solid financial results that fuel a surging stock price.\n\nThis year provides a few excellent examples:\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) executed a 10-for-1 split payable June 7, 2024. Chipotle announced a 50-for-1 split payable June 25, 2024. Broadcom delivered a 10-for-1 split payable July 12, 2024. Super Micro Computer executed a 10-for-1 split payable Sept. 30, 2024.\n\nThe common thread that weaves these disparate companies together is years, if not decades, of market-beating returns.\n\nIf I could buy only one stock right now, Nvidia tops my list. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAn uncanny ability\n\nMost investors (myself included) would point to the massive opportunity represented by artificial intelligence (AI) as the primary reason to own Nvidia stock. That's certainly one of the most important factors (more on that in a bit). However, one of the more intriguing aspects of the company is CEO Jensen Huang's uncanny ability to anticipate the next big thing and design solutions to meet that need.\n\nNvidia pioneered the graphics processing unit (GPU) that revolutionized gaming in 1999, but the company was already looking ahead and by 2006, had adapted the technology to accelerate supercomputing. The humble GPU is now the gold standard for cloud computing and data centers everywhere, with a dominant 98% of the data-center GPU market last year, according to data provided by TechInsights.\n\nThere's more. Investors might be surprised to learn that Huang positioned Nvidia to tackle the oncoming AI revolution all the way back in 2013, betting the company's future on technology that had not yet come into its own. When AI went viral early last year, Nvidia was able to reap the seeds Huang had sown a decade earlier.\n\nThe results paint a picture\n\n\"A picture paints a thousand words,\" or so the old saying goes. In this case, however, it's Nvidia's financial results that tell the tale. For the fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), Nvidia generated record revenue of $30 billion, which surged 122% year over year and 15% sequentially. The results were driven by record data-center revenue of $26.3 billion, which jumped 154%. Profits also soared, as evidenced by diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.67, an increase of 168%.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement expects Nvidia's winning streak to continue, albeit at a slower pace. Nvidia's forecast is guiding for revenue of $32.5 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 79%, with a corresponding bump in profitability. While that's slower than the triple-digit growth the company had delivered for five consecutive quarters, it's a remarkable accomplishment nonetheless.\n\nWhy now?\n\nI can guess what you're thinking. Sure, Nvidia has been a rocket ship since early last year, but the low-hanging fruit has already been picked. After all, the stock has surged 837% since the start of last year (as of market close on Thursday ) and hit a new record high just this week.\n\nHere's the thing. We're still in the early stages of AI, and new-use cases are still being developed. Some will point to the early fumbles as proof that the technology isn't yet ready for prime time. While that's partially true, it won't be long before the bugs are worked out and AI comes into its own. With that in mind, I'd argue that the best AI-related gains are yet to come.\n\nEstimates regarding the size of the generative AI market abound, yet there's no consensus. The market is estimated to be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. A more bullish estimate comes courtesy of Ark Invest's Big Ideas 2024 report, where Cathie Wood posits that the AI software market alone could generate incremental spending of $13 trillion by the end of the decade. Her bull case is even more eye-catching at $37 trillion. The truth is that we don't know how big generative AI will be, yet estimates continue to ratchet higher.\n\nFurthermore, bears would say the stock is exorbitantly expensive and \"priced to perfection,\" and they'd have a point. Nvidia stock is currently selling for 64 times earnings and 35 times sales, which in most cases would be outrageous. And if the situation were different, I might be tempted to agree.\n\nHowever, analysts' consensus estimates, which have proven to be conservative over the past year, expect Nvidia to generate EPS of $4.05 for its fiscal 2026, which kicks off in January. Based on the stock's closing price on Thursday, that works out to about 33 times forward earnings, which isn't much more expensive than the multiple of 30 for the S&P 500. Wall Street also expects Nvidia to grow its profits by 52% annually over the coming five years, which illustrates why the stock is worthy of a premium.\n\nTaken in its entirety, this lays out a compelling case that Nvidia's growth is far from over, the addressable market for AI continues to grow, and the stock isn't as expensive as it might seem.\n\nThere's one more thing: I'm counting on Huang to predict the next big thing and pivot Nvidia's technology to provide solutions -- and profit handsomely.\n\nIt doesn't get much better than that, which is why if I could only buy one stock right now, it would be Nvidia.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 7 Most Profitable Gaming Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the most profitable gaming stocks to invest in.\n\nGaming Evolution: Key Trends Shaping the Market\n\nThe gaming industry is currently experiencing significant changes driven by technology and evolving consumer preferences. One of the most notable trends is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), which is transforming game development and player experiences. AI is being used to create more realistic environments and enhance gameplay by adapting to individual player styles. Here’s a short excerpt from our previous article “7 Best Gaming Stocks To Buy Now” that discusses this in more detail:\n\n“According to Bernard Marr, a world-renowned futurist and author of ‘Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is Changing Business and Society’, generative AI is revolutionizing video game development by providing tools that enable developers to create engaging content, realistic visuals, and immersive gameplay experiences. Marr believes that generative AI can help developers create vast, unique game environments through procedural generation, allowing for dynamic gameplay experiences that change with each session.”\n\nAnother major trend in the gaming market is the rise of microtransactions, particularly in free-to-play games. This monetization model has become increasingly prevalent as developers look for sustainable revenue streams.\n\nOn March 24, CNBC reported that two of the largest video game companies in the US, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive, are increasingly relying on live-service games, subscriptions, and in-game purchases for their revenue. Microtransactions, which allow players to buy virtual items or features within games using real money, have become a significant source of income. Popular titles like Fortnite, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Clash Royale utilize this model, where players pay for ongoing updates and seasonal content through subscriptions or battle passes.\n\nMat Piscatella, executive director of video games at Circana, noted that the industry has shifted towards a “battle pass” system, which packages seasonal content in a way that players find valuable. This approach has led to a more positive response from gamers, as they feel they receive consistent value for their money. The trend indicates that game publishers must continuously engage players with new content to maintain their interest in these live service games.\n\nAccording to Comscore’s 2024 State of Gaming Report, around 82% of American gamers made in-game purchases in freemium games in 2023. The report also highlighted that 62% of adults over 18 participate in gaming activities, showcasing the widespread appeal of video games across various age groups.\n\nEsports is becoming increasingly popular, especially among younger audiences. The report found that 86% of Gen Z and 80% of millennials watched esports last year. Additionally, 53% of Gen Z and 61% of millennials interacted with esports content, highlighting the increasing popularity of competitive gaming among these age groups.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 7 most profitable gaming stocks to invest in, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest gaming companies. We also reviewed our own rankings, sifted through ETFs, and consulted various online resources.\n\nNext, we focused on profitability. From this initial list of more than 20 gaming companies, we narrowed our choices to stocks that had positive trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income and stocks that have grown their net income positively over the past 5 years.\n\nTo ensure the reliability of our findings, we consulted reputable sources such as SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into the net income CAGR over the past five years, and YCharts, which offered information on TTM net income.\n\nFinally, from this list of the most profitable stocks that met our criteria, we focused on the top 7 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 912 elite hedge funds. The 7 most profitable gaming stocks to invest in are ranked below in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nTTM Net Income: $53.01 Billion\n\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 80.81%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a prominent American technology company that is also known for its role in the gaming industry, particularly through its powerful graphics processing units (GPUs).

        "title": "Nvidia to win the race to $4 trillion market cap, experts say",
        "content": "Buy the dip.\n\nThat was the mindset around chip stocks this week as investors scooped up beaten-down shares, sending Nvidia to a record high. A strong outlook for Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) was enough to revive Wall Street’s enthusiasm for AI as growing confidence in the AI boom overshadowed chip supplier ASML’s sluggish forecast and reports of export caps of advanced AI chips to some Middle Eastern countries.\n\nNvidia closed the week above $138 per share, bringing its market value to $3.39 trillion. It’s now the world's second-largest company behind Apple. But that might not be for long. Experts I spoke with this past week say there’s growing confidence the chip giant will be the first Big Tech firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation.\n\n“There's no question about it,” Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, told me on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts. “The demand for GPU chips is strong, and you're seeing early adopters starting to get some ROI.”\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang fueled the stock’s rally earlier this month after describing demand for the new Blackwell chips as “insane.”\n\nEven amid the stock’s dramatic outperformance, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Tony Wang told me investors still “continuously underestimate” Nvidia’s growth potential. He sees “exceptional” demand for AI making it “definitely possible” that the chip giant crosses that $4 trillion threshold first.\n\nIn the coming weeks, earnings from fellow Magnificent Seven companies will give investors better insight into Nvidia’s market dominance. Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), which account for more than 40% of the chipmaker’s revenue, have all pledged to continue investing in AI.\n\nLast quarter, spending by Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft totaled more than $40 billion, while Amazon said spending in the second half of the year will likely surpass the $30 billion spent during the first half.\n\nBofA analyst Vivek Arya, who views Nvidia as a “generational opportunity,” cites capital expenditure commentary from top hyperscalers among the reasons that he sees Nvidia \"strengthening its position.\"\n\nArya lifted his price target on the chipmaker to $190 this week, implying a rally of nearly 40% from Friday’s closing price.\n\nArya and his team also cited Taiwan Semiconductor’s robust demand outlook as a positive. TSMC — a top supplier for Nvidia and other giants, including Apple — triggered a sector-wide rally after posting a more than 50% jump in net income for the third quarter and forecasting full-year revenue growth of nearly 30%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSafe to say, Big Tech's third quarter numbers will be a crucial test for Nvidia and key to the stock's momentum in the short term. Any disappointment in AI spending plans could lead to volatility for Nvidia and the broader chips market.\n\nBut if that happens, the sell-off may not last long. Niles Investment Management founder Dan Niles recently told me on Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid podcast he remains bullish on Nvidia’s long-term prospects.\n\n“You've got several more years of AI investment before you hit saturation or a more maturing AI landscape,” Niles said. “You'll see Nvidia's revenues double over the next several years, and I think you'll see the stock double over the next several years.”\n\nNvidia shares have rallied 21% so far this month, bringing its gains to 179% year to date.

        "title": "Looking to Buy Your First AI Stock? This Is the Best Choice (Hint: It's Not Nvidia).",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) dominated the artificial intelligence boom thus far, and it's easy to see why.\n\nThe company has a monopoly-like share of the data center GPU market with an estimated 98% in 2023. Those are the components that cloud hyperscalers like Amazon and Microsoft and AI start-ups like OpenAI depend on to run intensive generative AI applications like ChatGPT.\n\nDemand continues to outstrip supply for its chips, and its new Blackwell platform is already sold out for the next 12 months, as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described demand for the new chips as \"insane.\"\n\nNvidia delivered monster returns since the start of 2023, shortly after the launch of ChatGPT, adding roughly $3 trillion in market cap since then, and the stock has increased by nearly 1,000%.\n\nHowever, Nvidia faces a number of risks such as incoming competition. Advanced Micro Devices, for example, just launched its new MI325X accelerator, which is aiming to challenge Nvidia's Blackwell platform. Its top customers, like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms, are also developing their own chips that could relieve some of their need for Nvidia's components.\n\nAdditionally, some investors are skeptical of the AI boom, believing that the tech giants are overspending on AI as they still haven't found a way to make a profit from the new technology. Nvidia's business is cyclical and prices can change quickly according to supply and demand for its components, and its results have changed quickly in the past.\n\nFinally, the stock is expensive at a price-to-earnings ratio of 64, meaning that if its results come up short, the stock could fall substantially.\n\nIf you're looking for a lower-risk way to get exposure to artificial intelligence, especially if you're buying your first AI stock, there's another dominant chip company that presents a better alternative. That's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC, as it's also known. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat is TSMC?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's biggest manufacturer of semiconductors, and it handles more than half of all contract chip manufacturing in the world, serving customers like Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD.\n\nIt's even more dominant when it comes to advanced chips, with a market share of around 90% of all third-party foundries.\n\nTSMC is a linchpin in the semiconductor industry and the global economy as the chips it produces go in everything from smartphones to computers, data centers, automobiles, and appliances. Its expertise in advanced chip manufacturing and its dominant market share give it a significant competitive advantage in its industry, and that was on display in its third-quarter earnings report out Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenue in the quarter jumped 39% to $23.5 billion, and profits rose even faster as gross margin expanded from 54.3% in the quarter a year ago to 57.8%, showing that its pricing power improved as it benefited from the spoils of the AI boom and a rebound in consumer electronics. That's also an outstanding gross margin for any manufacturer, and explains its monopoly-like operating margin of 47.5%. On the bottom line, net income jumped 54% to $10.1 billion, or $1.94 a share.\n\nTSMC beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines and offered fourth-quarter revenue guidance that was well above the consensus, calling for revenue of $26.1 billion to $26.9 billion, up 35% year over year at the midpoint.\n\nCFO Wendell Huang said third-quarter results were driven by \"strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies.\" CEO C.C. Wei said on the earnings call, \"The demand (for AI) is real,\" and he predicted that it would last for many years.\n\nWhy TSMC is a winner\n\nIn addition to its booming growth and wide economic moat, TSMC also looks like a great AI stock to own right now because of two of its closest rivals, Intel and Samsung, are faltering. Intel announced a massive restructuring back in August and said it would cut capital expenditures by about 17% in 2025, while Samsung, the world's No. 2 foundry business, just took the rare step of apologizing to investors after reporting weak third-quarter results earlier this month, including problems with its high-bandwidth memory chip business.\n\nFinally, TSMC stock is surprisingly affordable, especially at its current growth rate, as the stock trades at a P/E of 36, similar to big tech companies like Microsoft and Apple, even though it's growing much faster.\n\nNvidia is an excellent company and still looks like a great stock to own, but TSMC has less downside risk, a cheaper price tag, and more entrenched competitive advantages due to the high barriers to entry in the foundry business.\n\nIf you're looking for a no-brainer stock to start your AI portfolio, TSMC looks like a great choice.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 in Right Now",
        "content": "For most people, $50,000 is a nice sum of money. In fact, you can buy a pretty nice car with that amount. However, instead of spending it, the best move over the long term would be to invest.\n\nAnd when it comes to investing, technology stocks are one of the first places long-term investors should look. As technology, like artificial intelligence (AI), continues to transform the world we live in, technology companies have become the biggest stock market winners.\n\nLet's look at two top tech stocks investors can buy today that are riding the AI wave. One is the leader on the hardware side, while the other is the leader on the software side. While investing $50,000 in these names would be nice, you can, of course, start with any amount.\n\nNvidia\n\nNo company has been a bigger winner from AI than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and there doesn't appear to be anything on the horizon that will stop its momentum. The company's graphic processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of the AI infrastructure buildout, and the company recently called demand for its newest Blackwell chips \"insane.\"\n\nNvidia has been able to take a more than 80% market share in the GPU space through its chips' strong performance, but more importantly through its CUDA software platform. Long before AI was the next big thing, CUDA became the standard platform on which developers learned to program GPUs. This created a wide moat around its booming GPU business.\n\nMeanwhile, AI infrastructure is currently seeing no letup in demand, as major tech companies pile money into the space to develop more sophisticated AI models. As AI models advance, they need more computing power for training, and that power comes from Nvidia's GPUs. For example, Alphabet has said its new Llama 4 large language model (LLM) would need 10 times the compute power of its predecessor, while xAI's Grok 3 LLM used 5 times the number of GPUs as Grok 2. The large tech companies investing in AI infrastructure have all indicated that their spending will continue to ramp up, with Oracle saying it sees no end to AI infrastructure spending over the next five to 10 years. This all benefits Nvidia.\n\nDespite the stock's strong performance, it is still attractively priced, trading a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of under 35 based on next year's analyst estimate and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of about 0.9. A PEG under 1 is generally viewed as undervalued, and growth stocks often carry PEGs well above 1. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nAnother company riding the AI wave is Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), which was one of the first large tech companies to go all-in on the technology when it made a large investment in and formed a partnership with OpenAI.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus far, its Azure cloud computing unit has been the company's biggest AI beneficiary, as organizations turn to its platform to create their own AI solutions. This is a consumption-based business where users are only charged for the resources they use, and so far, usage has been very strong. This can been seen in the company's results, with Azure growing revenue around 29% to 30% the past few quarters.\n\nCloud computing isn't the only area the company is looking at AI to help power growth. Its GitHub Developer platform as been another big AI winner, as customers turned to its AI assistant, Copilot, which can make suggestions as developers type and even complete coding tasks.\n\nHowever, the next big opportunity for the company could be with its Microsoft 365 Copilot. The company recently introduced a number of improved Copilots for Microsoft 365, which it will use to help lure organizations to its Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on. With these new features, users will be able to do things like work with the programming language Python in Excel through only natural language, pull in data from different types of sources with Word Copilot, and create presentations using only natural language with Copilot for Powerpoint.\n\nAt the cost of $30 a month per user for its Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on, this is a huge potential growth opportunity for Microsoft, as its 365 Copilot costs more than many of its subscriptions to Microsoft 365. To purchase the Microsoft Copilot, users are required to have a separate license to a qualifying plan, which can range from as little as $4.75 per user per month for its basic business plan without Teams to $22 per user per month for its premium business subscription with Teams, which also includes cybersecurity and identity management features. Some enterprise plans with more features can cost more.\n\nMicrosoft has proven to be an adaptive and innovative company, which has helped it grow to be one of the largest companies in the world. It is these attributes, along with the AI opportunity in front of it, that make it a great long-term investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Super Semiconductor ETF That Could Turn $400 Per Month Into $1 Million, With Nvidia's Help",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) pioneered the graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999 to render computer graphics for gaming and multimedia purposes.\n\nSince GPUs are capable of parallel processing -- meaning they can seamlessly perform multiple tasks at the same time -- they are also ideal for compute-intensive workloads like machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) development. That led Nvidia to design new GPU architectures for data centers, and the semiconductor industry is now at the heart of the AI revolution.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes data center operators will spend $1 trillion building GPU-based AI infrastructure over the next five years. That's an incredible financial opportunity, not only for his company, but for the entire semiconductor industry.\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) holds every leading chip stock, so it can give investors exposure to that trend in a diversified way. In fact, here's how the exchange-traded fund (ETF) could turn $400 per month into $1 million over the long term. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nEvery top chip stock packed into one fund\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF invests in U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute chips -- especially those poised to benefit from powerful trends like AI. Although ETFs can hold hundreds or even thousands of different stocks, the iShares Semiconductor ETF holds just 30, so it's highly concentrated toward its singular theme.\n\nLed by Nvidia, its top five holdings represent 37.9% of the entire value of its portfolio.\n\nStock iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting 1. Nvidia 8.88% 2. Broadcom 8.60% 3. Advanced Micro Devices  8.54% 4. Qualcomm 6.09% 5. Texas Instruments  5.84%\n\nData source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Oct. 14, 2024, and are subject to change.\n\nNvidia was valued at $360 billion at the start of 2023. Less than two years later, it's now the second largest company in the world, with a market capitalization of $3.2 trillion. The chip giant is delivering the revenue and earnings growth to support its incredible rise in value, thanks primarily to sales of its data center GPUs.\n\nIn the recent fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), Nvidia generated $26.3 billion in data center revenue, which was a whopping 154% increase from the year-ago period. The strong results are likely to continue, because the company is about to start shipping a new generation of GPUs based on its Blackwell architecture. Blackwell GPUs promise an incredible leap in performance of up to 30 times compared to Nvidia's flagship H100 GPU, and Huang recently said demand for them is \"insane.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom also plays a key role in AI data centers. It makes AI accelerators (a type of chip) for hyperscale clients, which typically include tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon. It also makes Ethernet switches like the Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI, which regulate how quickly data travels between GPUs and devices.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has emerged as a direct competitor to Nvidia in the GPU space. It will ship its new MI350X data center chip, which is designed to compete directly with the Blackwell lineup, in the second half of 2025. But AMD also makes neural processors (NPUs) for personal computers, which can handle AI workloads on-device, creating a faster user experience. This could be a big opportunity for the company outside the data center.\n\nBeyond its top five positions, the iShares Semiconductor ETF also holds other top AI chip stocks like Micron Technology, which supplies memory and storage chips designed increasingly for AI workloads, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which fabricates many of the GPUs designed by Nvidia and AMD.\n\nTurning $400 per month into $1 million\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF has generated a compound annual return of 11.6% since its inception in 2001. However, its compound annual return has accelerated to 24.5% over the last 10 years, thanks to the rapid adoption of compute-intensive technologies like cloud computing, enterprise software, and AI.\n\nThe table below highlights the returns an investor could earn with $400 per month over 10 years, 20 years, and 30 years based on three different annual growth rates.\n\nMonthly Investment Compound Annual Return Balance After 10 Years Balance After 20 Years Balance After 30 Years $400 11.6% $91,153 $379,042 $1,292,289 $400 18.1% (midpoint) $135,761 $951,779 $5,871,080 $400 24.5% $206,433 $2,535,833 $28,871,790\n\nCalculations by author.\n\nIt's unlikely that the iShares Semiconductor ETF will deliver an average annual return of 24.5% over the next 30 years -- or even over the next 10 years, for that matter. The law of large numbers will eventually lead to a deceleration in growth. Nvidia is experiencing that phenomenon right now. Despite growing its data center revenue by 154% in its recent quarter, that was a much slower growth rate than the prior quarter just three months earlier, when its data center revenue jumped by 427%.\n\nHowever, even if the ETF reverts back to an annual return of 11.6%, that will still be enough to turn $400 per month into $1 million over 30 years. While nothing is guaranteed, that is a more realistic expectation for investors.\n\nPlus, ETFs can be very flexible. The iShares Semiconductor ETF will rebalance over time, so new companies will find their way into its top holdings if they are outperforming their peers, which will support further returns.\n\nAI is likely to be a game changer for the semiconductor industry over the long term. Goldman Sachs believes the technology will add $7 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade. If that's true, it will drive a consistent reinvestment into chips and infrastructure to fuel future growth cycles.\n\nHowever, there is always a risk that AI will fail to live up to the hype. That's why it's important for investors to buy the iShares Semiconductor ETF only as part of a balanced portfolio.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Billionaire Ken Griffin Sold Most of Citadel's Nvidia Stock and Is Buying This Stock-Split AI Stock Instead",
        "content": "Billionaire Ken Griffin is the founder and CEO of Citadel Advisors, the most profitable hedge fund in history as measured by net gains, according to LCH Investments. That makes Griffin one of Wall Street's most successful money managers, so investors should consider following his trades with quarterly Forms 13F.\n\nIn the second quarter, Griffin sold 9.2 million shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), reducing his exposure by 79%. Meanwhile, he bought 98,752 shares of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), increasing his position by 96%. Currently, Citadel still has more capital invested in Nvidia than Supermcro, but the trades are noteworthy nevertheless because they may hint at a shift in sentiment.\n\nHere's what investors should know about each of these companies.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), chips used to accelerate data center workloads like training large language models and running artificial intelligence (AI) applications. \"Nvidia sets the pace for AI infrastructure worldwide. Without Nvidia GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible,\" according to analysts at Forrester Research.\n\nIndeed, Nvidia has around 90% market share in AI chips, and analysts expect the same level of dominance for at least two or three years. That seems likely for two reasons.\n\nFirst, developers prefer Nvidia GPUs because they are the fastest accelerators on the market, but also because they are backed by a more robust ecosystem of software development tools than competing products. Second, Nvidia provides adjacent data center hardware, including central processing units (CPUs) and network switches, designed for AI. The company also provides software and cloud services that support AI application development. That means Nvidia can innovate across the entire data center computing stack, which leads to better-performing systems with lower energy requirements, according to CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nImportantly, when Ken Griffin was selling shares in the second quarter, Nvidia stock traded at an average valuation of 67 times earnings, which peaked around 79 times earnings. But Nvidia's earnings more than doubled in the June quarter, which lowered its valuation multiple. The stock currently trades at 64 times earnings, a slight discount to where it was when Griffin was selling.\n\nAdditionally, Wall Street anticipates Nvidia's earnings will grow at 37% annually over the next three years. That is an upward revision from the average consensus of 34% during the second quarter.\n\nIn other words, Nvidia shares are a bit cheaper, and earnings are expected to grow a bit faster versus when Ken Griffin was selling shares. Those changes make the stock more attractive, so Griffin may have added to Citadel's position in Nvidia since the second quarter ended.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer manufacturers servers, including complete server racks equipped with storage and networking, to provide a turnkey solution for data center infrastructure. The company's internal engineering capabilities and modular approach to product design allow it to bring new technologies to market more quickly than its competitors. That advantage has helped Supermicro secure a leadership position in AI servers.\n\nImportantly, while the market will likely become more competitive as Dell Technologies and other equipment manufacturers lean into demand for AI infrastructure, Supermicro's leadership in direct liquid cooling (DLC) technology may defend its position in AI servers. DLC can reduce data center power consumption by 40% versus traditional air cooling, so the percentage of liquid-cooled installations is expected to soar alongside AI server deployments.\n\nSupermicro reported mixed financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended June 30). Revenue rose 143% to $5.3 billion. But gross margin fell nearly 6 percentage points to 11.2%, such that non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased only 78%, growing much slower than sales. That may signal waning pricing power amid increased competition, but management said gross margin will return to normal (14% to 17%) by the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nImportantly, Ken Griffin was buying Supermicro stock in the second quarter, but his stance on the company may have changed since short-seller Hindenburg Research accused Supermicro of accounting manipulation in August. CEO Charles Liang said the accusations were \"false or inaccurate statements.\" But the company delayed filing its Form 10-K for fiscal 2024 and has yet to correct the problem.\n\nFor readers with déjà vu, Supermicro was fined $17.5 million in 2020 for infractions similar to those outlined by Hindenburg, including recognizing revenue prematurely and understating expenses. The incidents occurred between 2014 and 2017, and caused the company to file its 10-K for fiscal 2017 nearly two years after it was due, which resulted in the stock being temporarily delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.\n\nIn September, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department was investigating Supermicro based on allegations made by a former employee. The allegations are similar to those made by Hindenburg, but the probe is in its early stages, and details are scant. Nevertheless, investors should be aware of the risk.\n\nLooking ahead, Statista estimates AI server sales will increase at 30% annually through 2033, and Wall Street anticipates Supermicro's adjusted earnings will grow 54% over the next 12 months. Those estimates make the current valuation of 22 times adjusted earnings look cheap. However, given the overhanging regulatory issues, I would not be surprised if Ken Griffin has trimmed his position in Supermicro since the second quarter.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jensen Huang Just Gave Nvidia Stock Investors Billion-Dollar News.",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been delivering outsized growth throughout the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, with earnings soaring in the triple digits quarter after quarter. The company dominates the AI chip market, holding an 80% share, but its success isn't only due to this one element. Instead, Nvidia's earnings have taken off thanks to its development of an entire suite of AI products and services, making Nvidia the go-to destination for any company launching an AI project.\n\nThis has helped the stock advance a mind-boggling 2,700% over the past five years -- and the momentum continues, with the stock heading for a gain of more than 170% so far this year. In spite of this fantastic earnings and stock performance, though, investors have worried about whether Nvidia can keep the pace of growth going -- or whether its highest-growth days are in the past.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang recently offered reason to be optimistic, as he gave Nvidia stock investors billion-dollar news. Let's check out the details. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's rise to AI fame\n\nNvidia, as mentioned, began its ascent to AI fame through its graphics processing units (GPUs). These powerful chips originally served the video game market, but the company realized that the GPU's ability to process multiple tasks simultaneously made it ideal for plenty of other uses -- including AI.\n\nOf course, Nvidia still sells its GPUs to the gaming industry, and revenue there even climbed 16% in the most recent quarter, but AI has jumped ahead to become the company's biggest business. In the quarter, data center revenue -- which includes AI products and services -- made up 87% of total revenue and soared to a record $26.3 billion. And total quarterly revenue now is more than what the company generated in annual revenue as recently as the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nToday, though, investors may question the ability of Nvidia to keep delivering triple-digit revenue growth. After all, earnings growth generally doesn't continue at this rate forever, even for a highly innovative company. And Nvidia's forecast for revenue in the coming quarter calls for a double-digit increase over last year's level.\n\nNow, let's get to the billion-dollar news that CEO Jensen Huang recently delivered. It has to do with a big movement in the world of computers and AI right now, and that's updating older computer systems and data centers. Huang, speaking during an interview with the BG2Pod podcast, said the world has $1 trillion of older systems to update -- and we're only $150 billion into that task so far.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillions of dollars of business ahead\n\nThat suggests billions of dollars of business lies ahead for Nvidia, and this should translate into significant earnings growth -- and potentially explosive stock performance, too.\n\nAs mentioned, this doesn't necessarily mean earnings will rise in the triple digits every quarter. But that's OK, and here's why: Comparison periods are becoming more difficult, with Nvidia's earnings numbers already very strong this year, for example.\n\nSo it's important to consider the actual level of earnings as well as the company's gross margin -- Nvidia's is extremely wide, at more than 70% -- along with the growth figures. And when we do this, Nvidia's present situation, as well as long-term prospects, look incredibly bright.\n\nOn top of this, it's important to remember that Nvidia's current dominance in the field of AI, along with the company's focus on innovation, with a pledge to update its GPUs annually, should put it in the perfect position to benefit as the world updates computing systems.\n\nAll this means Nvidia's best days aren't in the past, and instead, the best days actually may span a long period of time well into the future. As a result, now is a fantastic time to get in on Nvidia stock, which looks reasonably priced at 47x forward earnings estimates, considering the company's track record, potential, and market position.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,121!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $43,917!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $370,844!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 14, 2024\n\nAdria Cimino has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "title": "Demand Is \"Crazy\" for This Spectacular New AI Chip. Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Now Before It Launches?",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the power to transform society and revolutionize the economy, at least according to its evangelists. Whether it lives up to its full potential is yet to be seen, but the technology's impact is already being felt, and with firms like PwC -- one of the \"big four\" accountants -- claiming the technology could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, its revolutionary power looks to be more than just hype.\n\nShares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), the de facto leader of AI, are back trading at all-time highs. And with good reason -- the company's chips are the lynchpin of the industry. Without them, the data-hungry AI models would not be able to run, or at least their power would be greatly diminished. Thus far, no one has been able to match Nvidia's chips in power or efficiency and it may be a while before they do.\n\nNvidia's newest line of chips, Grace Blackwell, is set to begin rolling out soon. Nvidia's own CEO, Jensen Huang, described demand for the chips as \"insane\" while the CEO of Foxconn, one of the world's chief semiconductor manufacturing partners, called it \"crazy.\" With the rollout imminent, is now the time to buy?\n\nNvidia hit some bumps in the road, but things look to be back on track\n\nIn an effort to maintain the near stranglehold Nvidia has on the AI chip market, the company has committed itself to a yearly update cadence for its chip architecture, an incredibly ambitious pace goal. Each iteration is much more powerful than the last. The company claims the new Blackwell will be at least 400% as powerful as Hopper. This pace, if the company can keep it up, will work as a sort of innovation moat: a defense that competitors like AMD will struggle to overcome as they play catch-up with only about half the research and development budget of Nvidia.\n\nIt's a tall order, however, and Nvidia already slipped up. Blackwell was originally set to already be hitting the market by now, but an issue was discovered in the manufacturing process and Nvidia announced its release would be delayed. Luckily, the flaw had to do with the fabrication process rather than the chips themselves or their functioning, but it still was not a good look for the company.\n\nAny fears of a major snafu, however, were put to bed fairly quickly: Blackwell will begin rolling out soon. The delay will only amount to six weeks or so and any loss in the short term is more than made up for by the still strong demand for Hopper chips. It should make you pause, however. Is this update cadence really sustainable over the long term? It's important to maintain some healthy skepticism. That being said, Nvidia handled the situation well and the company looks to be moving forward, full steam ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackwell will be big business, but keep an eye on valuation\n\nNvidia is partnering with Foxconn to build a new production facility in Mexico dedicated solely to producing Blackwell chips. Once complete, it will be the largest in the world. It's a very smart move as it diversifies Nvidia's production away from Taiwan and the geopolitical concerns of the region. And, of course, it will greatly boost manufacturing capacity for the chips.\n\nThat's great news because according to management, Nvidia is already sold out of Blackwell for a whole year. Its production can't keep up with the incredible demand for the new chip. That's certainly a good position to be in.\n\nGiven the advanced sales, investors seem to have found a renewed faith in the company and its stock is trading as high as it's been. I think it could still get a boost once deliveries of Blackwell are actually made. However, proceed with caution. If you are retirement planning or otherwise have a shorter investing time horizon, I suggest holding off at the moment. While Nvidia seems to be doing everything right, its valuation is still quite high with a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 46. That's high even for tech, as you can see below.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nFrom $2.81, BofA raised its EPS projection for Nvidia's fiscal year 2025 to $2.87; from $3.90, it raised its projection for 2026 to $4.47. Also, its 2027 projection, that is expected to jump from $5.67 from $4.72, also represents a massive bump. Apart from the EPS changes, BofA underlined its Buy recommendation on Nvidia and raised its price target from $165 to $190.\n\nMoreover, this week, the stock has reached new highs, reflecting investors' hope for the company's future. Under the direction of Vivek Arya, BofA analysts underscored Nvidia's robust free cash flow (FCF), with margins at 45% to 50%, roughly double the Mag-7 average of 23% to 25%. \"In dollar terms, NVDA could take in $200 billion of FCF over the next two years, rivaling Apple (AAPL) and providing growth optionality,\" Arya stated in a Thursday note to investors.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

Should you buy the semiconductor stocks right now or is it too late to get in?\n\nSemiconductors: Too Hot to Handle?\n\nThe semiconductor stocks, which includes more than just the chips, have been on a tear the last 18 months. Over the summer, the stocks took a break and fell back. But some, like NVIDIA, are now back at all-time highs.\n\nThis earnings season may push them even higher.\n\nTracey looked at 5 of the biggest names in the industry.\n\nAre they too expensive to buy right now or is the growth just so strong you MUST own them?\n\n5 Semiconductor Stocks: Should You Buy Them Now?\n\n1.      NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA has been a top stock all year. Shares of NVIDIA are up 184.2% year-to-date, easily outperforming the S&P 500 which is up 23%. But it’s been rocky the past 3 months, with big sell-offs. However, thanks to a surge in October, NVIDIA shares are up 15% over that time while the S&P 500 is up just 4.2%.\n\nEarnings look spectacular. Earnings are expected to rise 116% in fiscal 2025 and another 32.8% in fiscal 2026.\n\nWhile NVIDIA may seem expensive with a forward P/E of 48, it has a PEG ratio of just 1.16. A PEG under 1.0 indicates a company has both value and growth. NVIDIA’s PEG is nearly that low.\n\nShould investors still buy NVIDIA right now?\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has lagged in 2024. While shares of Advanced Micro Devices are up 48.6% over the last year, year-to-date they’re up just 12.8%. Over the last 3 months, Advanced Micro Devices is down 4.9% while the S&P 500 is up 4.2%.\n\nEarnings are expected to jump 26.8% in 2024 and another 54.6% in 2025. You won’t get Advanced Micro Devices cheaply, though. It trades with a forward P/E of 46. However, it’s PEG ratio is just 1.6, which is low.\n\nIs this a buying opportunity in Advanced Micro Devices?\n\n3. Broadcom Inc. (AVGO)\n\nBroadcom shares have been testing new all-time highs again in 2024. Broadcom is up 67.3% year-to-date, outperforming the S&P 500 which is up 23.3%. Over the last 3 months, it is outperforming as well, up 13.4% compared to 4.2% for the S&P 500.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings are expected to rise 14% in fiscal 2024 and another 27% in fiscal 2025. Broadcom’s P/E is a little more reasonable, at 36.7x. It has a PEG ratio of 2.2, however. That’s higher than NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nShould Broadcom be on your short list?\n\n4. Lam Research Corp. (LRCX)\n\nLam Research is the only one of these 5 stocks that is underperforming the S&P 500 year-to-date. Shares of Lam Research are down 2.4% year-to-date. Over the last 3 months, the performance has been dismal. Shares are down 26.7% during that time.\n\nYet earnings are expected to rise 8.7% in fiscal 2025 and another 32.6% in fiscal 2026. Lam Research has attractive valuations with a forward P/E of just 22.8 and a PEG ratio of 1.69.\n\nIs this share weakness a buying opportunity in Lam Research?\n\n5. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM)\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor just reported earnings and beat again. It also sees strong demand for AI chips for the next several years.\n\nShares of Taiwan Semiconductor have spiked on the earnings news and are up 19.1% over the last 3 months. However, they have been on the move higher all year and are now up 102.7% year-to-date.\n\nEarnings are expected to rise 24.5% in 2024 and another 28.4% in 2025. Remarkably, the stock is still cheap even with the huge move higher in the shares. Taiwan Semiconductor trades with a forward P/E of 29.1 but a PEG of just 1.1.\n\nShould Taiwan Semiconductor be on your short list?\n\nWhat else do you need to know about the semiconductor stocks?\n\nTune into this week’s video podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of AVGO in Zacks Insider Trader portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Nvidia (NVDA)",
        "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\n\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 67.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 117.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -23.1%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 2.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.5% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nNvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why This 1 Momentum Stock Could Be a Great Addition to Your Portfolio",
        "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors alike.\n\nAchieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.\n\nIs This 1 Momentum Stock a Screaming Buy Right Now?\n\nFor momentum investors, upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook take precedent, so they'll want to zero in on the Momentum Style Score. This Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.\n\nNVDA is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, with a Momentum Style Score of B and VGM Score of B. Shares are up 1.6% over the past one week and up 16.2% over the past four weeks. NVDA has gained 225.2% in the last one-year period as well. Looking at trading volume, an average of 277,335,040 shares exchanged hands over the last 20 trading days.\n\nA company's earnings performance is important for momentum investors as well. For fiscal 2025, 13 analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for NVDA, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.12 to $2.81 per share. NVDA also boasts an average earnings surprise of 12.7%.\n\nWith strong earnings growth, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, investors should think about adding NVDA to their portfolios.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia (NVDA) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.24, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 42 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.24 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 42 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.7% and 4.8% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for NVDA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Nvidia, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs NVDA Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month to $2.81.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nvidia may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Nvidia (NVDA)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 16.2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $140.89 in the previous session. Nvidia has gained 176.5% since the start of the year compared to the 26.5% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 124.7% return for the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on August 28, 2024, Nvidia reported EPS of $0.68 versus consensus estimate of $0.64.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share on $124.66 billion in revenues. This represents a 116.15% change in EPS on a 104.63% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $3.73 per share on $174.35 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 32.75% and 39.86%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nNvidia may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nNvidia has a Value Score of F. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 48.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 24.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 110.4X versus its peer group's average of 11X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.17. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Nvidia fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Nvidia shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): ‘It Does Put A Smile On My Face’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Best Performers List: 12 Stocks Cramer is Talking About.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other best performers on Jim Cramer's list.\n\nOn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer took a moment to celebrate the two-year anniversary of the current bull market. He mentioned that this particular bull market has been quiet and gentle, which he attributes to the unusual circumstances surrounding its rise. “The whole first year of this bull’s life was an anomaly. That’s because the Fed was furiously tightening and the market went up anyway,” Cramer explained.\n\nHe emphasized that for the past two years, opportunities have been evident, stating, “Every night I say there’s always a bull market somewhere, and for the last two years, well, it’s been right in front of you.”\n\nCramer then went on to discuss the lead performing stocks and ended the segment, saying:\n\n“The bottom line, if you're going to buy these stocks, I’d go first with Nvidia, then with Broadcom, and finally Fair Isaac, if only because we need something that's not connected to the data center, even as we know, it will remain a strong story for the ages.”\n\nCramer also advised investors to shift their focus away from the consumer price index (CPI) report, suggesting that its significance has diminished since the Federal Reserve began cutting rates.\n\n“We had to be concerned about this stuff when the Fed was on the warpath, either raising rates or leaving them higher for longer. Now, though, the Fed is your friend, so I wouldn't obsess about the details.”\n\nHe did emphasize, however, that the monthly labor report remains important in the current climate. He remarked on the tendency for many to become “Fed watchers,” suggesting that this reliance on government data can detract from the deeper analysis of individual companies. Cramer referenced Austan D. Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed, who advised against an overemphasis on CPI data, as the Fed is unlikely to base decisions on it. Cramer explained:\n\n“When the Fed's raising rates in order to stamp out inflation, it can be very important. When we're in a rate hike cycle, you're trying to figure out when that's going to end. But we're not in that kind of cycle anymore. We're in a rate cutting cycle.”\n\nCramer explained that last month the Fed implemented a double rate cut, setting a downward trend that is expected to continue. He added:\n\n“Sure, if we had a huge spike in the CPI this morning, then maybe the Fed would change its stance. But that would have to be an extreme reading. And there's nothing extreme about today's 2.4% inflation number, just a tick above the expected 2.3, still down from the 2.5% reading from the prior month.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer concluded with a strong reminder about the nature of investing. “Forget the macro, people. It’s not that meaningful when the Fed’s cutting rates. And keep your eyes on the prize: Earnings,” he urged. Ultimately, he reinforced that earnings dictate stock prices in the long run, and that’s where the focus should be for those looking to make money in the market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks with the biggest gains over the past 2 years that were mentioned by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 10. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nHere’s what Cramer had to say about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA):\n\n“People are just beginning to realize that maybe it wasn't just a gaming company with some real fast graphics chips...Eventually, NVIDIA and its renaissance man, CEO Jensen, pioneered both accelerated computing and generative AI. We speak too much about the latter, not enough about the former. Accelerated computing is what makes things really work here. In other words, NVIDIA created machines that think faster than you do and soon will do almost anything better than you can do\n\nNow, I don't want you freaking out. We're in charge here. We make the decisions, but AI saves a lot of time… which is why it's such a revolutionary technology for the enterprise and it's about to get even better because we'll see an amazing jump on the fly thinking from generative AI when NVIDIA's new line of Blackwell chips gets fully deployed next year. They are so powerful, so fast, these guys basically invented a chip that is so quick that it created the entire AI business outta thin air. It wasn't possible before, but now it can do incredible things and very soon it'll be both faster and better.\n\nBy the way, I think it's gonna do some stuff with video that's gonna blow you away. I've never seen a company have such demand for its products, including demand from Tesla, which needs Nvidia for self-driving cars… The whole thing's remarkable and the stock's 1072% gain over the past two years was right there for the taking. As CNBC Investing Club members well know, I do think it's got more upside, which is why I always say own it, don't trade it. It does put a smile on my face.”\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) initially gained widespread recognition in 1999 with the introduction of the GeForce 256, celebrated as the world's first graphics processing unit (GPU). Today, it maintains a dominant position in the GPU market, largely thanks to its A100 and H100 chipsets, which have significantly contributed to the company's record revenue and profit growth over the past few years.\n\nThe company's new Blackwell series GPUs are anticipated to become a major product for the company. CEO Jensen Huang recently expressed excitement about the overwhelming demand for Blackwell, commenting that interest is incredibly high and that many are eager to be at the forefront of this innovation.\n\nAmong the noteworthy advancements is NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) concept of \"physical AI,\" which involves the deployment of semi-autonomous robots capable of interacting in real-world environments. A significant partnership with Foxconn, the electronics supplier, is already in place to develop and train AI-driven robots.\n\nIn the second quarter, the company reported a remarkable 122% increase in revenue compared to the previous year, reaching $30 billion. It was fueled by a heightened demand for data center GPUs, particularly the H100 and H200 models.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 2nd on Jim Cramer's list of best performing stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "There's no question that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the biggest winner in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The AI chip stock added a whopping $3 trillion in market cap since the beginning of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.\n\nHowever, throughout the first half of the year, there was a surprising rotation out of Nvidia stock. A number of billionaire investors who had capitalized on the stock's initial gains sold the AI stock, arguing that there were better opportunities elsewhere.\n\nAmong those investors were David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, Israel Englander of Millennium Management, Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors, George Soros of Soros Capital Management, and Stanley Druckenmiller, who ran Duquesne Capital Management for more than two decades.\n\nDruckenmiller, who occasionally discusses his stock moves in interviews, was early to jump on the AI trend in Nvidia. The investor, whose hedge fund delivered annual average returns of 30% when it was active, first bought shares of Nvidia in the fourth quarter of 2022, recognizing that the launch of ChatGPT would lead to demand for Nvidia's GPUs, which were used for AI applications.\n\nHowever, even Druckenmiller seemed surprised by Nvidia's dramatic surge through 2023 and 2024, and since sold out of the high-flying stock. Back in May, he acknowledged cutting his Nivida position, saying, \"A lot of what we recognized has become recognized by the marketplace now.\" In other words, he believed that the upside potential in the stock was limited in late March when he sold it. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDruckenmiller's mea culpa\n\nMore than six months after that sale, Druckenmiller now has some regrets.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, the billionaire said the decision to sell Nvidia was a \"big mistake.\" He said he sold most of his position when Nvidia was priced between $80 and $95 (post-split) and the stock has now run up past $130, meaning the value of Nvidia has increased roughly 50% since he did most of his selling.\n\nIn 2023, Druckenmiller said he expected to own the stock for years, but he thought the \"valuation was rich\" after the stock tripled in just a year.\n\nAt one point, Nvidia was his biggest holding. At the end of Q2 2023, he had 9.5 million (post-split) shares of the stock worth roughly $400 million. He sold 754,000 in third quarter of 2023, 2.57 million in Q4 of that year, 4.42 million in the first quarter of 2024, and 1.54 million in the next quarter. He's since sold his remaining 214,060 shares of Nvidia, according to the Bloomberg interview.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's difficult to know precisely when the Duquesne boss sold those shares, but using the end-of-the-quarter Nvidia share price from each of its sales, Druckenmiller left roughly $500 million on the table with Nvidia stock.\n\nA bullish signal for Nvidia\n\nIn addition to calling the Nvidia sale a mistake, Druckenmiller also remained bullish on the long-term future of AI, saying, \"We are long-term believers in AI, and there are still many ways we're playing AI.\" He also added, \"And yes, I think Nvidia's a wonderful company, and were the price to come down we'd get involved again, but right now I'm licking my wounds from a bad sale there.\"\n\nNvidia stock might be expensive at a price-to-earnings ratio of 65, but the business has certainly demonstrated it deserves to trade at a premium. It's still delivering monster sales growth with revenue more than doubling for five quarters in a row, and demand for its Blackwell platform has been \"insane,\" according to CEO Jensen Huang. The new hardware is already sold for the next 12 months after it was just released.\n\nDruckenmiller may not get another opportunity to buy Nvidia at a price that makes sense for him, but Nvidia investors should take comfort in knowing that one of the most influential investors in the market now admits he was wrong to underestimate the company.\n\nWith the Blackwell platform off to a roaring start, the future for Nvidia still looks as bright as ever.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 8 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other high growth high market stocks to invest in.\n\nHow Market Trends Shape Opportunities\n\nWhen investor confidence is high, capital tends to flow into growth sectors, driving up stock prices and valuations. This is particularly relevant for companies with strong growth prospects and high margins, as they are often seen as more resilient in a recovering economy. Current market dynamics indicate that much of the upward movement may be attributed to multiple expansions rather than just earnings growth. High-growth stocks typically trade at higher price-to-earnings ratios, so if the market continues to expand, these stocks could benefit significantly as investors are willing to pay a premium for growth potential.\n\nJason Trennert, Strategas Research Partners chairman and CEO, joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ on October 3 to discuss the latest market trends and the state of the economy, highlighting that the bar is high to get bearish now.\n\nJason Trennert revealed that he turned bullish at the end of 2023 after initially predicting a recession. Despite the challenges of 2022 and early 2023, which made it difficult to envision a market recovery, he noted that the market has defied expectations and continued to rise. Trennert attributed a significant portion of this upward movement to multiple expansions rather than just earnings growth. He marked a pivotal moment in 2023 as the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, which led to increased liquidity in the market and a subsequent rally. He recalled that around eleven months ago, the S&P 500 briefly hit 4,100 when ten-year yields reached 5%, suggesting that market dynamics have shifted considerably since then.\n\nWhen discussing current valuations, Trennert pointed out that the market is trading at approximately 22 times earnings during an easing cycle. He expressed skepticism about future earnings growth, as expectations for a 14% increase in S&P earnings next year seem inconsistent with the anticipated six rate cuts from the Fed. He emphasized that if the market is expecting such significant easing while also projecting strong earnings growth, there may be a disconnect.\n\nTrennert also addressed concerns regarding government spending and deficits, noting that the federal deficit has reached 7% of GDP and expressing a desire for more free-market-oriented policies rather than gridlock in Washington. He criticized both parties for their lack of commitment to reducing deficits and highlighted the moral hazard created by prolonged quantitative easing over the past 12 years. He believes that this situation has led to irresponsible spending practices that will eventually necessitate accountability. Despite these concerns, Trennert acknowledged that it is challenging to adopt a bearish outlook given current market conditions. He noted that ten-year treasury yields above 4.5% typically lead to market indigestion, while yields below this threshold make it hard to remain pessimistic.\n\nAs for small-cap stocks, Trennert pointed out that they have historically been underrepresented in portfolios and may offer opportunities for future growth. He highlighted that many venture capital-backed firms are looking to go public, with approximately 45% of them potentially tapping into the IPO market at some point. However, he cautioned that if the economy continues to slow down and earnings growth expectations are not met, small caps may struggle.\n\nSkepticism about the projected earnings growth for the S&P 500 could also apply to high-growth stocks. If expectations for earnings growth are too optimistic relative to economic conditions, such as anticipated rate cuts, it may lead to volatility in high-growth stocks, especially if actual earnings do not meet these elevated expectations. Companies with high-profit margins are generally better positioned to weather economic downturns. As Trennert noted concerns regarding government spending and deficits, firms that maintain or improve their profit margins may be more attractive to investors seeking stability amidst economic uncertainty.\n\nTrennert’s overall analysis underscores the importance of monitoring government policies and economic indicators as they influence investor sentiment and market performance moving forward. Still, his predominantly bullish sentiment lays the groundwork for a lot of investors, and to make the portfolio expansion process even easier for them, we’re here with a list of the 8 high growth high margin stocks to invest in now.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe sifted through Finviz to compile an initial list of the top stocks. From that list, we narrowed our choices to 15 companies with TTM net profit margin above 20% and 5-year net income compound annual growth rates above 25%. We then selected the 8 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA): Leading AI Innovation with Strategic Partnerships\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 56.73%TTM Net Profit Margin: 55.04%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179  NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the pioneer of GPU-accelerated computing, specializing in products and platforms for the large, growing markets of gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. Its GPUs have been instrumental in driving advancements in various fields, including deep learning, autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality. NetApp has launched a new AI tool utilizing NVIDIA technology. Elon Musk’s xAI is leveraging 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for its AI project, Colossal, with potential future expansion to include H200 GPUs and Blackwell chips. NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has formed a strategic partnership with Accenture to accelerate AI innovation. Its AI chip, Blackwell, is now in mass production and experiencing high demand. A partnership with Salesforce is established to enhance businesses’ utilization of AI and data. In September, the company introduced Aerial, an AI tool designed to optimize wireless networks for various devices. Its proprietary software, CUDA, provides a competitive edge. The company’s continued success hinges on its ability to sustain innovation and monetize AI effectively. The company’s CEO believes its competitive advantage in AI chips is sustainable. Snowflake, a cloud data warehousing company, that utilizes Nvidia’s AI Enterprise software to integrate NeMo Retriever microservices into its Snowflake Cortex AI, has seen its stock price rise 10% in the past month due to strong prospects driven by a strong portfolio and expanding partner base. The recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and upward stock movement all point to a potential continued upward trajectory. Investors may want to consider adding NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) to their watchlist or portfolios given its positive momentum. Vltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Over the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA’s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA’s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.”\n\nOverall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of high growth high market stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "These 3 Stocks Turned $10,000 Into More Than $250,000 Over the Last 5 Years",
        "content": "Get rich quickly. Many investors want to accomplish this goal. However, it's easier said than done.\n\nWhat's the key to achieving a fortune in a relatively short time? Finding the right stocks.\n\nWhile it's difficult to predict which ones will be the biggest winners of the future, hindsight is 20/20. These three stocks turned $10,000 into more than $250,000 over the last five years.\n\n1. Celsius Holdings\n\nCelsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH) markets a line of fitness and energy drinks. Although it faces stiff competition, Celsius has executed its growth strategy superbly since entering the market in 2005.\n\nAn initial investment of $10,000 in Celsius five years ago would be worth more than $316,000 today. At one point in May 2024, the investment topped $889,000. The company doesn't pay a dividend, so all of these impressive gains stemmed from share-price appreciation.\n\nThere are several factors behind Celsius' remarkable success. Perhaps the most important one is the strong overall growth in the U.S. energy drink market. However, the company has driven much of this growth. In particular, health and wellness trends have contributed to customers desiring zero-sugar energy drinks with proven performance, and that's exactly what Celsius has delivered.\n\nDon't be fooled by the company's big sell-off in 2024. The steep decline resulted largely from lower growth due to the company's distribution partner and minority owner PepsiCo building up its inventories too much last year. This will only be a temporary issue, though. I predict Celsius will continue to be a winner for investors over the long run.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nYou probably aren't surprised to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) on the list. Nvidia has grown into the second-largest company, based on market cap, thanks to surging demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nIf you invested $10,000 in Nvidia five years ago and didn't sell any shares, you would have over $284,000 today. Most of that total (nearly $283,000) stemmed from share-price appreciation, with the rest generated by the company's small dividend.\n\nThere's no secret as to why Nvidia's shares have taken off. The company's GPUs have enjoyed strong demand in gaming systems and data centers for years. However, OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 ignited a generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom that's still ongoing. Nvidia's chips are the gold standard in powering AI models.\n\nI don't think this boom will be over anytime soon. It could even accelerate with Nvidia's launch of the new Blackwell GPU platform. CEO Jensen Huang recently told CNBC that the demand for Blackwell chips has been \"insane.\" Look for Nvidia to keep delivering crazy good returns.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), commonly referred to as Supermicro, was a small-cap maker of servers and storage systems five years ago. Today, the company's market cap hovers around $28 billion.\n\nHow much would an investment of $10,000 in Supermicro five years ago be worth now? Nearly $255,000. Investors would have had a much greater nest egg earlier in 2024 -- over $618,000 by March 7. However, the stock has fallen roughly 58% below its high, wiping out much of the enormous gains.\n\nMargin pressure and allegations of accounting manipulation by a short-seller have taken a toll on Supermicro's share price. But the same AI tailwind propelling Nvidia continues to blow for Supermicro, too.\n\nI'm not as bullish about Supermicro as I was in 2023 and earlier this year. Will I be surprised if the stock rebounds? Not at all. However, I wouldn't bet on Supermicro turning an investment of $10,000 into anywhere close to $255,000 over the next five years again.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Lisa Su Just Delivered Incredible News for Advanced Micro Devices Stock Investors",
        "content": "Developing artificial intelligence (AI) software wouldn't be possible without data centers and the powerful graphics processing chips (GPUs) inside them. For the past 18 months, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has dominated the GPU industry with a staggering market share of up to 98%.\n\nBut competition was bound to emerge, and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has stepped up to the plate with an exciting GPU roadmap. The company hosted its \"Advancing AI\" event on Oct. 10, where its CEO Lisa Su provided an update on its next-generation chips.\n\nAlthough Advanced Micro Devices is still trailing Nvidia in the market for AI GPUs, Su's comments suggest the company is catching up at a rapid clip. Here's why investors should be excited. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices was more than a year behind Nvidia in the AI GPU race\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU set the benchmark for AI training and AI inference. The chip went into full production in September 2022, although sales didn't ramp up until 2023, when AI fever gripped the tech sector. The H100 is still a hot product today, and Nvidia continues to struggle with supply constraints because demand is so high from leading AI companies like OpenAI, Amazon, Microsoft, and more.\n\nThose supply challenges have opened the door for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices to steal some market share. The company announced its own data center GPU called the MI300X at the end of 2023, which was specifically designed to compete with the H100. So far, it has attracted some of Nvidia's top customers, including Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms.\n\nIn fact, Advanced Micro Devices says some of those customers are seeing performance and cost advantages by using the MI300X compared to the H100. Despite being more than a year behind in terms of a launch date, the challenger delivered a very worthy product. It forecasts the MI300 series will propel its GPU revenue to a record $4.5 billion in 2024 -- an estimate that has already been raised twice.\n\nBut Nvidia still has the edge. It started shipping its new H200 GPU earlier this year, which is capable of performing AI inference at nearly twice the speed of the H100. It meant Advanced Micro Devices was still a step behind. However, at the Advancing AI event, Lisa Su offered fresh details on her company's new MI325X, which will deliver 80% more high-bandwidth memory than the H200 and 30% better inference performance.\n\nThat's great news, but it isn't expected to ship until the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe race to catch up doesn't stop there. Nvidia is now focused on its latest Blackwell chip architecture, which paves the way for the biggest leap in performance so far. The new GB200 NVL72 system is capable of performing AI inference at a whopping 30x the pace of the equivalent H100 system. Each individual GPU will be priced comparably to the H100 (when it was first launched), so Blackwell is going to deliver an incredible improvement in cost efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn other words, even though Advanced Micro Device's MI325X might be a superior product to the H200, it's going to be significantly behind Nvidia's newest hardware.\n\nAdvanced Micro Device's Blackwell competitor is right around the corner\n\nHere's where things get exciting. Lisa Su told the audience at Advancing AI that the company is preparing to ship another new GPU next year called the MI350X. It's based on its new CDNA (compute DNA) 4 architecture, which offers a staggering leap in performance of 35x, compared to CDNA 3 chips like the original MI300X.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has explicitly said the MI350X will compete directly with Nvidia's Blackwell chips.\n\nNvidia plans to ramp up shipments of Blackwell GPUs during its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (which runs from November to January), whereas Su said Advanced Micro Devices will start shipping the MI350X in the second half of calendar 2025. That means after lagging behind Nvidia by more than a year with the MI300X, Advanced Micro Devices has an opportunity to reduce Nvidia's lead to just months with the MI350X.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices will report its latest financial results in a few weeks\n\nThe company could provide further updates on its new chips when it releases its financial results for the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), which is expected to happen on or around Oct. 29.\n\nDuring the second quarter, Advanced Micro Devices generated a record $2.8 billion in data center revenue, which was a 114% increase from the year-ago period. Another strong result could prompt management to lift its full-year GPU sales forecast beyond $4.5 billion. Given the company's track record on that front, there's a good chance it will happen.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices stock currently trades at a very expensive price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 200.3 because it has generated modest earnings per share (EPS) of $0.82 over the past four quarters. For perspective, the Nasdaq-100 technology index currently trades at a P/E of 32.1.\n\nHowever, Wall Street analysts estimate the company could deliver $5.43 in EPS during 2025, placing the stock at a more reasonable forward P/E of 30.6: AMD PE Ratio Chart\n\nThat means Advanced Micro Devices stock could be a great buy right now for investors who are willing to hold onto it for at least a couple of years -- especially with the MI325X and MI350X rolling out in 2025.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Jim Cramer On Oracle Corporation (ORCL): ‘I Like The Prospects’",
        "content": "We recently published an article titled, Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 12 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against other stocks discussed by Jim Cramer during the latest lightning round.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, shared his thoughts on the market’s recent volatility and offered advice to investors regarding earnings reports. He cautioned against making trades based solely on immediate stock reactions following earnings announcements, as many of these movements might not be justified.\n\n“The absurdity of earnings season has arrived. It didn’t take long, did it? People are already doing stupid things. And you know what? I gotta point them out to you so that you don’t make the same mistakes.”\n\nCramer emphasized his mission to guide individuals toward becoming more thoughtful investors, rather than impulsive traders. He noted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 325 points, while the S&P 500 declined by 0.76%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.01%.\n\nCramer referred to this phenomenon as part of what he calls the quarterly repricing process, which is the earnings season. He explained that, typically, most stocks tend to move in tandem with the S&P 500 unless a significant event alters the market. In the absence of such an event, stock movements are often influenced by external factors that may have only a tenuous connection to a company’s actual future performance. He further clarified his perspective and stated:\n\n“Now, I want to make one thing clear. I’m not saying that everybody’s a moron. I’m saying there are details that inform people are looking for benchmarks we’ve accepted going into earnings. Yet for the first few moments of trading, there’s just obviously oblivious action based on who knows what. It’s definitely not the key metrics. It’s definitely not the homework.”\n\nUltimately, Cramer described this chaotic trading behavior as a clumsy way for Wall Street to reassess stock prices in relation to their peers, driven by a flurry of parsed headlines during earnings season. He expressed relief that this sort of disorganized trading only occurs four times a year, even as he acknowledged that this is a crucial period when a stock can become detached from the S&P 500.\n\nConcluding his thoughts, Cramer emphasized:\n\n“Yet, if you’re not a professional, you should not be involved in this process. There are so many people playing with so much money, professionals who pay people fortunes to figure this stuff out. Let them fight to set the price. For regular investors like you, trying to trade that initial post-earnings action is just an easy way to lose money, four times a year, like clockwork.”\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Cramer during lightning rounds of Mad Money’s episodes on October 14, 15, and 16. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Cramer On Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL): ‘I Like The Prospects’\n\nCramer On Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL): ‘I Like The Prospects’\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 93\n\nA caller referred to Jensen Huang’s, NVIDIA’s CEO, comment about the healthcare segment having a huge opportunity for AI and asked whether Cerner would be a needle mover for Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL). Here’s what Cramer said in response:\n\n“Cerner has not been a big payoff off yet…I think that Oracle is going to be working with Jensen. So I like the prospects, but you’re in it for the data center and data center business is excellent.”\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) offers a diverse portfolio of products and services designed to meet the needs of organizations worldwide. Its cloud offerings include various applications for enterprise resource planning (ERP), healthcare management, and supply chain logistics, alongside essential infrastructure technologies such as databases and middleware. In a significant move in 2021, the company announced its acquisition of Cerner Corporation, a leading digital information systems provider for hospitals and healthcare systems. The all-cash tender offer valued at approximately $28.3 billion aimed to integrate Cerner’s advanced capabilities into Oracle’s health solutions.\n\nThe company got an extension in its contract to modernize the electronic health records (EHR) system for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) across its 172 facilities. However, in June, Bloomberg reported challenges with the software’s effectiveness in improving patient care, particularly from the VA, which is its primary public client in the healthcare segment. This has raised concerns about the performance of the Cerner division, leading to expectations of revenue decline in the fiscal year.\n\nIt should be noted that Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) continues to innovate in the technology space, as demonstrated by its introduction of the world’s first zettascale cloud computing cluster powered by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs in September. The groundbreaking development allows Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to offer the largest AI supercomputer available in the cloud, capable of supporting an impressive 131,072 NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nIn October, the company revealed plans to invest over $6.5 billion in artificial intelligence and cloud computing in Malaysia. It will establish a cloud region that offers cutting-edge AI technologies, featuring the largest AI supercomputer available in the cloud. Out of the many services, users will have the option to choose configurations with up to 131,072 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, complemented by NVIDIA ConnectX-7 NICs for RoCEv2 networking, or opt for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack solutions that utilize liquid cooling and NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking.\n\nOverall, ORCL ranks 1st on our list of stocks discussed by Jim Cramer during the latest lightning round. While we acknowledge the potential of ORCL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ORCL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "FedEx founder says corporate data predicted the rise of Tesla and Nvidia—and can flag new trends",
        "content": "Long before Fred Smith was the billionaire founder of FedEx, he was a Vietnam veteran with a love of flying and a small fleet of planes for hire. “I would be flying these parts and pieces from Xerox in Rochester to Pittsburgh or wherever the case may be,” he told a gathering of 200 Goldman Sachs executives and entrepreneurs on Thursday. “And I would sort of sit in amazement there and say, 'They're hiring me and this whole damn airplane to carry this little part.'”\n\nIt didn’t take long for the likes of early tech giants Burroughs, Sperry, UNIVAC and IBM to hire him and his growing fleet to fly parts from the burgeoning Asian manufacturing market to the rest the world. “What I was actually seeing was the beginning of the automation of society,” he said.\n\nIt was the first time his logistics company found itself at the extreme forefront of tech trends that would change the world.\n\nSpeaking at Goldman's annual Builders and Innovators Summit in Healdsburg, California, Smith explained how data from the logistics giant that now moves about $2 trillion worth of goods a year in every industry in nearly every country predicted the rise of Tesla and Nvidia and is now seeing into the future of geopolitical tensions and more.\n\n“We just have this kaleidoscope of what's going on in the economy,\" he said. \"And so we're able to think we see trends.”\n\nSmith founded FedEx in 1971 in Little Rock, Arkansas to solve business logistics problems. Since those days when he personally made delivery runs, Smith says the company’s greatest technological breakthrough was software that let it track goods in motion.\n\n“We had gotten to the point where we were buying more PCs than any entity in the world,” said Smith. “And we were putting them in our customers' offices so the shipping managers could track and trace and prepare the shipping labels.”\n\nThe company now operates more than 700 aircraft and more than 200,000 motorized vehicles, generating $87.7 billion revenue in fiscal year 2024, and $21.6 billion last quarter. But it’s the data provided by that software that lets FedEx track goods that provides the company with the trend-spotting data.\n\nFor example, Smith says the company is currently shipping Nvidia chips from Guadalajara up the west coast of the United States and pallets from John Deere to Europe. Last year, FedEx added a Danone S.A. executive focused on Mexico to its board of directors, and earlier this year expanded service between the U.S. and Europe, specifically to open up opportunities to China.\n\nIn fact, Smith highlighted China obstacles and opportunities as another example of a trend FedEx data reveals. “What has happened, more than anything else,” he said, “is supply chains have regionalized on a China Plus One basis.” China Plus One is an increasingly popular business strategy which dictates that investors looking to capitalize on China’s booming economy should also invest in another market.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, he says FedEx is seeing spikes in activity in Eastern Europe, particularly in Hungary and Poland. In southern Mexico, there are 1,000 properties that are either manufacturing plants under construction or fulfillment and distribution centers where there's land in reserve—many of which are owned by Chinese entities.\n\nSuch interconnectedness that blurs the lines separating nations, complicated the whole idea of imposing sanctions on one nation or another. As a result, Smith is skeptical that the tariffs imposed on imports by both Biden and Trump before him will resolve the geopolitical tension. To support his skepticism, he cites research by the Financial Times that he says shows tariffs slow trade for everyone. Instead, he thinks properly recognizing the interconnectedness of global markets might lead to more measured solutions.\n\n“Everybody looks at China as a monolithic entity,\" he said. \"There's a business class in China that doesn't want to be wiped out either, as China has become more protectionist. And if you go into a FedEx hub today, you'll be amazed at the choreography of stuff going from every part in the world to every other part in the world.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- An Nvidia Corp.-backed cloud services firm wants to build a new data center in Japan, with one prerequisite: there should be nuclear power available nearby.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nInside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says How Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes\n\nTokyo-based Ubitus K.K. is looking to acquire land in Kyoto, Shimane or a prefecture in Japan’s southern island of Kyushu, primarily because of the availability of nuclear power in the region, Chief Executive Officer Wesley Kuo said in an interview on Thursday. The firm, which already has two data centers for gaming, plans to build a third to serve generative artificial intelligence, he said.\n\n“Unless we have other, better, efficient and cheap energy, nuclear is still the most competitive option in terms of cost and the scale of supply,” Kuo said, adding that renewables like solar and wind power are too intermittent. “For industrial use — especially AI — they need a constant, high-capacity supply.”\n\nUbitus, which received funding from Nvidia earlier this year, joins a growing list of tech companies at the forefront of a global revival in nuclear power, as use of AI and data centers drives up demand for emissions-free, stable electricity. Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. are among the giants that have recently made investments to gain access to atomic energy.\n\nHowever, securing nuclear power in Japan remains challenging given sensitivities over the 2011 Fukushima disaster and the strict regulatory framework put in place in its aftermath. The country now has 33 commercially operable reactors left, but many remain idle.\n\nUbitus aims to select a location for its new data center during the first quarter of next year, Kuo said, adding he has visited sites in Kyoto and Shimane, with plans to travel to Kyushu as well. The firm already operates two data centers for gaming in Japan, in partnership with Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp.\n\nSetting up a data center in these areas would allow access to a grid with cheap and stable electricity thanks to the nuclear facilities, said Kuo. That’s a slightly different approach from the US tech giants, which have been signing deals to directly purchase power from or build nuclear plants.\n\nJapanese regions with nuclear power plants, like the western Kansai area and Kyushu, generally have lower electricity rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nKyoto is close to several nuclear power plants operated by Kansai Electric Power Co., while Kyushu is home to four units managed by Kyushu Electric Power Co. Chugoku Electric Power Co. is scheduled to restart its Shimane No. 2 reactor in December.\n\nThe cloud-based gaming services provider was originally founded in Taiwan in 2007, and is now based in Tokyo, with partners including Nintendo Co. Its existing data centers are located in Tokyo and Osaka to be close to gaming clients. But for generative AI, the priority becomes more about the size of energy supply and electricity price, Kuo said.\n\nUbitus will aim for its new data center to have power-receiving capacity of 2-3 megawatts in the initial phase of the operation, with plans to potentially expand to up to 50 megawatts, he added.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nBYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs Neuralink Co-Founder’s New Startup Sells a Brain Computer Toolkit A Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work How Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium How Spindrift Broke Through the Cluttered Seltzer Craze\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds.\n\nAnother 50 bps Cut is Still Restrictive\n\nThe labor market has been more resilient than ever. On October 4, Gary Cohn, the IBM vice chairman, and former US National Economic Council director in the Trump administration, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the job report and the US economy.\n\nCohn suggests that the jobs data is the least scientific information the government puts out and therefore, it must be taken with a grain of salt. However, he emphasizes the importance of understanding trends. The number of people entering the workforce is expanding and jobs are being created, deducing that the market is in a neutral place.\n\nCohn believes that the US economy is normalizing. He reveals that we have not lived in a normal economy in over a decade, therefore, relative to history, the status quo is fairly reasonable. He adds that the Fed has orchestrated a soft landing and expects another 50 basis point cut before the end of 2024, which according to him is still restrictive.\n\nPortfolio Manager Highlights High Growth Sectors\n\nAs the AI flame starts to settle, the market may be up for a major shift. On October 7, Keith Buchanan, GLOBALT Investments senior portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his expectations of the market.\n\nExpectations for earnings have been revised from mid-single digits to mid-double digitals, promising robust growth as 2024 comes to a close. Buchanan suggests that most of the growth comes from artificial intelligence and the widening of earnings growth beyond traditional growth sectors like technology.\n\nThis year, the industrial and energy sectors have enjoyed greater returns capturing a large chunk of the market. Buchanan is highly bullish on AI plays and value stocks. He also adds that names in financials, industrials, and consumer discretionary are poised for growth ahead of 2024. He advises investors to consider geopolitical events before making any investment decisions.\n\nNow that we have assessed the future of the financial markets and possible sectors eyeing growth, let’s take a look at the 10 most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo find the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds, we went over multiple rankings over the internet to list long-term blue chip stocks. We then examined the analyst upside and the hedge fund sentiment of these stocks as of Q2 2024 and picked the most popular ones. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024 as a primary metric and analyst upside as of October 13, as a secondary metric.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nAnalyst Upside as of October 13, 2024: 11%\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), also referred to as the AI star, is one of the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds. The chip maker is also a provider of cloud services and gaming products.\n\nThe company is rapidly growing and garnering attention from across the globe to the point that it has the power to influence financial markets. Such can be attributed to its advancements in technology and its strategic partnerships. Recently the company closed a deal with Salesforce and also launched a new AI tool to meet the needs of the next generation of mobiles, robots, autonomous vehicles, and 5G. On October 8, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) partnered with TSMC to push the limits for the next generation of advanced semiconductor chips using Nvidia’s computational lithography platform.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to generate $32.5 billion in revenue during the fiscal third quarter of 2024. This revenue is likely to come from its rapidly growing Hopper architecture and its new and improved Blackwell Chips. By the end of this year, the company is also expected to ramp up production for the chips.\n\nThere is no denying that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a crucial role to play in the artificial intelligence industry, which explains why 179 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the close of Q2 2024. Analysts’ 12-month median price target of $150 points to a 111% upside from current levels.\n\nIthaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Oct. 19 Is Almost Here. Could Nvidia's AI PC Day Be a Game-Changer for Investors?",
        "content": "It's no secret that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is dominating the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, especially the massive data center segment -- think server farms built by companies like Amazon and Alphabet. Last quarter, the company brought in $26.5 billion in revenue from the lucrative segment. That's 10 times more than its biggest competitor, AMD, managed, but Nvidia isn't just selling more, it's doing so at a lower cost. In the same period, the company's net income here was a whopping 25 times that of AMD's.\n\nMedia attention has been focused almost entirely on this segment. It makes perfect sense; those numbers are insane. Make no mistake, data centers are the beating heart of Nvidia's explosive growth and that's not liable to change. But an exciting opportunity in AI exists outside of these colossal server farms. Your personal computer could play a crucial role in the near future.\n\nThat's why Nvidia is hosting its RTX AI PC Day this Oct. 19 and 20. The event will showcase how the company is incorporating AI and machine learning capabilities into its consumer-facing GPUs and the future it envisions for AI-powered PCs. What could this mean for investors?\n\nPushing AI to the edge can save time and money\n\nIn tech, the last two decades have been defined by the cloud. Advances in internet bandwidth allowed much of the actual work of computation and storage to move from your local device to sprawling server farms hidden away in mostly rural areas. Out of sight, out of mind, as they say. AI is, by and large, no different. ChatGPT doesn't run on your computer; it's likely running on Microsoft servers thousands of miles away. You're using your computer simply to communicate with it.\n\nHowever, that is beginning to change. In some cases, computing is moving back to the \"edge\" as the techies call it. In other words, more and more, a significant portion of computing will again happen locally on your device. Some believe this could be a big trend in AI. But why, you ask? Great question.\n\nSome AI applications are just too intensive to run anywhere but in a data center equipped with thousands of, say, Nvidia's H100s. At $25,000 a pop, the cost is enormous. That's why these data centers are built by companies that can invest billions of dollars to build them. However, not all AI applications need that much power. Some models, specific tools, or other limited applications of AI could run locally with a powerful enough GPU. But just because they could, does it mean they should? What advantages does edge computing have here?\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst, where edge computing lacks power, it makes up for it in speed. Cloud computing introduces latency into the equation -- a delay -- that crunching the numbers locally doesn't. Those milliseconds could make all the difference for some applications of the technology. Second, given the cost of building and operating large-scale data centers, using them is anything but cheap. Customers who opt for an edge approach may pay more upfront, but it could easily be the cheaper option over time. Another big one? If your internet connection isn't guaranteed or limited, you don't want to have to rely on the cloud.\n\nAI PCs will be used for everything from enhancing video game graphics and expanding what's possible for content creation to bringing a personal AI assistant to your car.\n\nAI PCs could be a big market for Nvidia\n\nThis could be a major leap for the whole PC industry. The CEO of Qualcomm called it \"as significant as Windows 95.\" No one wants to be left behind here and that means Nvidia has stiff competition from a host of other chipmakers all vying for a piece of the pie that research firm Canalys expects to grow at a 44% compound annual growth rate for the next four years. The firm believes that more than 200 million AI PCs will ship in 2028.\n\nGiven the competition, it may be unlikely that Nvidia will capture as much of this market as it has the data center market. Given the scale, however, it doesn't need to. A modest share of this market will still boost its bottom line significantly.\n\nNvidia's event will help raise the profile of AI PCs and could impact the stock price, but I wouldn't hold my breath for anything significant. The event won't move the needle in and of itself. What's important is what it represents: another massive opportunity for a company firing on all cylinders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The company cited strong smartphone and AI-related demand.\n\nOn its call, while not directly discussing NVIDIA, TSMC's CEO C.C. Wei said, \"[w]e continue to observe extremely robust AI related demand from our customers throughout the second half of 2024, leading to increasing overall capacity utilization rate for our leading 3 nanometer and 5 nanometer process technologies.\" They now forecast the revenue contribution from server AI processors to more than triple this year, and account for mid-teens percentage of our total revenue in 2024. As a result, TSMC now forecasts that its full-year revenue will increase by close to 30% in US dollar terms.\n\nWhen asked if the AI demand is real and sustainable, Wei said it is \"real.\"\n\n\"And why I say it's real? Because we have our real experience. We have used the AI and machine learning in our fab, in R&D operations. By using AI, we are able to create more value by driving greater productivity, efficiency, speed, qualities,\" Wei added.\n\nAs an example, the CEO highlighted that a productivity gain of just 1% would amount to $1 billion to TSMC.\n\n\"And think about it, let me use 1% productivity gain,\" Wei said answering a question about AI demand being sustainable. \"That was almost equal to about $1 billion to TSMC. And this is a tangible ROI benefit. And I believe we are -- we cannot be the only one company that have benefited from this AI application.

Third-quarter revenue was up 36% year over year in U.S. dollars, TSMC said, and was up 12.9% from the previous quarter. In New Taiwan dollars, net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) both rose 54.2%. TSMC was expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS).\n\n“Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” Wendell Huang, TSMC chief financial officer, said in a statement. “Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies.”\n\nTSMC, which counts Nvidia and Apple (AAPL) as its main customers, has seen its shares rise over 107% so far this year.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of Nvidia fell over 4% earlier this week after closing at a record high. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD), to countries in the Middle East, citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Bitcoin-Related Stocks to Gain From Crypto Rally",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is staging a solid comeback, with Bitcoin (BTC) on track to hit $70,000 after falling below $60,000 last month. The Federal Reserve’s jumbo rate cut announcement in September amid the upcoming U.S. election has raised optimism surrounding riskier assets, especially tech stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in Bitcoin-centric stocks such as Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and CME Group Inc. CME that have strong growth potential in the near term.\n\nBitcoin Rebounds From Recent Lows\n\nBitcoin was trading at $67,249.66 on Thursday. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency had reached $68,376 on Wednesday. It is now well on track to hit new highs with optimism building around riskier assets following the Fed’s 50-basis-point rate cut last month and the looming U.S. Presidential election, which is less than a month away.\n\nAlso, increased global liquidity and China’s economic stimulus have been fueling the ongoing rally. Bitcoin last traded above $70,000 in July after reaching an all-time high of $73,750 on March 14. The cryptocurrency is now up 11% for the week, the largest reading since April and a 10-week high.\n\nBitcoin-Related Stocks to Benefit\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been maintaining a dovish stance since it announced its first rate cut in more than four years last month. Market participants are hopeful about two more 25 basis point interest rate cuts this year, which is likely to further boost the crypto rally.\n\nLower interest rates favor growth assets such as cryptocurrencies because they decrease the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. In a low-interest-rate setting, investors often seek out assets that offer greater potential returns, even if they come with increased risks.\n\n3 Bitcoin-Related Stocks With Upside\n\nRobinhood Markets\n\nRobinhood Markets operates a financial services platform in the United States. Its platform allows users to invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options, gold, and cryptocurrencies. HOOD buys and sells Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies using its Robinhood Crypto platform.\n\nRobinhood Markets’ expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 38.2% over the past 90 days. Robinhood Markets currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.5% over the past 60 days. NVDA presently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCME Group\n\nCME Group Inc.’s options give the buyer of the call/put the right to buy/sell cryptocurrency futures contracts at a specific price at some future date. CME offers Bitcoin and ether options based on the exchange's cash-settled standard and micro-Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts.\n\nCME Group’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 7.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.2% over the last 90 days. CME presently has a Zacks Rank #2.

        "title": "Taiwan Semiconductor Earnings Reignites the AI Boom",
        "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) reported quarterly earnings this morning and did not disappoint shareholders. Earnings came in 8.9% above analysts' expectations and showed a 54.2% year-over-year (YoY) increase, while revenue beat estimates by 1.3% and grew an impressive 39% YoY.\n\nManagement offered encouraging comments as well, with Wendell Huang, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer saying, “Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies.” And that “Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies.”\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor stock has put on a stellar performance this year, doubling in just the last 10 months. With Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) as two of its largest customers, the semiconductor manufacturer has enjoyed the tailwinds of smart phone growth over the last decade and Artificial Intelligence more recently. Taiwan Semiconductor also boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating and sits in the Top 1% (1 out of 250) of the Zacks Industry Rank, both of which improve the near-term expectations of the stock. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCan TSM Earnings Revive the AI Trade?\n\nArtificial intelligence has been one of the primary forces driving the bull market in stocks over the last two years and many traders are constantly looking for something to end the trend. Earlier this week, ASML Holdings (ASML) reported a huge earnings miss, dragging down semiconductor stocks such as Nvidia and Broadcom. For the AI naysayers, it seemed like now may be the end of the AI trade.\n\nBut this morning’s report from Taiwan Semiconductor probably just reinvigorated the AI boom. Taking a step back, Taiwan Semiconductor and Nvidia have been two of the biggest beneficiaries of the emerging technological revolution, however trading in their stocks as well as broader technology sector has looked weary since summer.\n\nBut with TSM and now Nvidia pushing new all-time highs again, I think we can safely say that the boom is back.  TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nTSM and NVDA Still Trade at a Reasonable Valuations\n\nAlso encouraging is that Taiwan Semiconductor and Nvidia both are trading at reasonable valuations and with strong earnings growth forecasts.\n\nTSM is currently trading at 29.1x forward earnings, which is above its five-year median of 21.3x. And though that is above its historical median multiple, when discounted for growth, it seems more reasonable. Analysts are forecasting earnings to grow 26.5% annually over the next three to five years, which is an incredible growth rate for such a massive company.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 51.2x, which although seemingly high is still below its five-year median of 55.7x. Additionally, earnings are projected to grow 41.7% annually over the next three to five years, putting the high earnings multiple into context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShould Investors Buy Taiwan Semiconductor Shares?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor’s strong earnings performance, coupled with optimistic guidance, signals continued growth for the company as it rides the wave of AI and smartphone demand. The results have helped reinvigorate confidence in the broader AI trade, especially after recent concerns about the sector’s sustainability following ASML Holdings’ earnings miss.\n\nOverall, TSM remains a promising investment for those who believe in the potential of AI as well as the long-term demand for semiconductors. With the recent earnings beat and the AI trade seeming to pick up again, I think it’s likely that there is still more upside to be realized.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Apple's 3nm Push Boosts Taiwan Semi's Q3, AI Revenue Set To Triple: Analyst",
        "content": "Apple's 3nm Push Boosts Taiwan Semi's Q3, AI Revenue Set To Triple: Analyst\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) stock surged after upbeat quarterly print on Thursday.\n\nThe key Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) supplier reported third-quarter revenue of 759.69 billion New Taiwan dollar ($23.50 billion), up 39%, topping $22.4 billion-$23.2 billion guidance and the consensus estimate.\n\nThe contract chipmaker attributed the quarterly performance to robust smartphone and AI-related demand for its 3nm and 5nm technologies.\n\nAlso Read: Nokia Q3: Earnings Miss, CEO Cites Telecom Weakness And Anticipates India Demand Rebound\n\nIts gross margin is 57.8%, up from 54.3% a year ago. The operating margin grew to 47.5% from 41.7% a year ago. It expects fourth-quarter revenue of $26.1 billion-$26.9 billion, above the Street consensus of $24.86 billion.\n\nNeedham analyst Charles Shi reiterated Taiwan Semiconductor with a Buy and a $210 price target.\n\nNeedham: By node, relative to Shi’s estimates, Taiwan Semiconductor’s third-quarter print shows a much more robust performance of 3nm and a slightly weaker performance of 5nm.\n\nThe analyst noted the 3nm upside should be primarily due to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). In contrast, 5nm revenue is leveling off after six consecutive quarters of strong sequential growth.\n\nThe gross margin performance, which is now back in the high 50s range, is a positive sign as Taiwan Semiconductor overcomes several cost challenges anticipated by management earlier this year, including 3nm dilution, 5nm to 3nm conversion cost, and electricity cost increases, he said.\n\nInterestingly, the company had flagged 5nm and 3nm wafer prebuild as part of the reason for the gross margin upside, Shi added.\n\nThe analyst noted that Taiwan Semiconductor raised its full-year revenue growth target from “slightly above the mid-20s” to “close to 30%” while maintaining the 10% ex-memory semiconductor growth outlook.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor expects to triple AI revenue this year, which will account for mid-teens percent of its total revenue.\n\nBased on management commentary, Shi estimates Taiwan Semiconductor’s AI revenue was around $4 billion in 2023 and will likely reach $13 billion in 2024.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has guided AI to account for 20% of the total revenue by 2028, translating to ~$33 billion+ if the 15%+ total revenue CAGR continues through the next four years.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor’s reported revenue split between technology nodes suggests that the non-wafer revenue, the majority of which comes from packaging, saw a meaningful step up from $2.4 billion in the second quarter to $3.2 billion in the third quarter, a 36% increase sequentially.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis could be partially driven by Apple’s ramp that drives InFO revenue. Still, the magnitude of the sequential growth is above seasonality (~20% sequentially) and supports the rumor that Taiwan Semiconductor may have released 60%-80% more CoWoS capacity in the third quarter.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor expects 2024’s CapEx to be slightly above $30 billion, a $1 billion trim to 2024’s CapEx budget. Last quarter, it tightened the CapEx guidance range from $28 billion-$32 billion to $30 billion-$32 billion and effectively raised CapEx by about $1 billion.\n\nOn the bright side, with Taiwan Semiconductor reporting the quarterly CapEx for the first three quarters of the year to be only $6 billion per quarter, it needs to spend ~$12 billion CapEx in the fourth quarter. The magnitude of the step-up is likely driven by the initial 2nm buildout.\n\nPrice Action: TSM stock is up 11.7% at $209.41 at last check Thursday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nCitigroup Remains A Compelling Investment Opportunity: Analysts Take On Q3 Performance\n\nPhoto by wakamatsu.h via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for TSM\n\nDate Firm Action From To Jan 2022 Atlantic Equities Upgrades Neutral Overweight Oct 2021 Cowen & Co.

        "title": "State Street Corp's Strategic Acquisition of Wolfspeed Inc Shares",
        "content": "Overview of the Recent Transaction\n\nOn September 30, 2024, State Street Corp made a significant addition to its investment portfolio by acquiring 1,255,819 shares of Wolfspeed Inc (NYSE:WOLF), a key player in the semiconductor industry. This transaction increased State Street Corp's total holdings in Wolfspeed to 6,694,555 shares, marking a substantial investment in the company. Despite the large number of shares purchased, this move did not have a significant immediate impact on State Street Corps overall portfolio, which remains diverse and robust.\n\nProfile of State Street Corp\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with WOLF.\n\nState Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a prominent financial services provider with a strong focus on investment management. The firm manages a vast equity portfolio valued at approximately $2,285.63 trillion, predominantly in the technology and financial services sectors. State Street Corps top holdings include major corporations such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), reflecting its strategic focus on high-growth potential markets. State Street Corp's Strategic Acquisition of Wolfspeed Inc Shares\n\nIntroduction to Wolfspeed Inc\n\nWolfspeed Inc, trading under the symbol WOLF, specializes in the production of wide bandgap semiconductors, focusing on materials like silicon carbide and gallium nitride. These components are crucial for various applications including power supplies and wireless systems. Despite its innovative technology, Wolfspeed has faced financial challenges, as indicated by its current stock price of $16.09 and a market capitalization of $2.04 billion. The company's financial metrics suggest a cautious outlook, with a GF Value suggesting it is a possible value trap. State Street Corp's Strategic Acquisition of Wolfspeed Inc Shares\n\nAnalysis of the Trade Impact\n\nThe recent acquisition by State Street Corp represents a 23.09% increase in their holdings of Wolfspeed shares, reflecting a strategic decision despite the stock's challenging financial indicators. This move has not altered the firm's portfolio significantly in terms of percentage, maintaining a balance across various sectors and investments.\n\nMarket Performance and Investment Rationale\n\nWolfspeed's stock has experienced a significant decline of 62.79% year-to-date, yet it has seen a substantial gain of 65.88% since the transaction date. This volatility highlights the high-risk, high-reward nature of investing in the semiconductor sector. State Street Corps decision to increase its stake could be driven by the potential long-term growth in the semiconductor industry, despite the current financial instability indicated by Wolfspeeds GF Score of 58/100 and a Profitability Rank of 2/10.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroader Market Implications\n\nThis transaction aligns with broader trends in the semiconductor industry, which is seeing increased investment despite current market uncertainties. Other significant shareholders like Gotham Asset Management, LLC, and Jefferies Group (Trades, Portfolio) also maintain substantial positions in Wolfspeed, indicating a general market belief in the sector's recovery and growth potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nState Street Corp's recent acquisition of Wolfspeed shares highlights a calculated risk in a sector poised for future growth. While the immediate impact on State Streets portfolio is minimal, the long-term implications could be more significant, depending on how semiconductor technologies evolve and are adopted in various industries. Investors and market watchers will undoubtedly keep a close eye on Wolfspeed's performance and State Streets strategic moves going forward.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "Amazon Says New Nvidia-Based Systems Won’t Be Online Until 2025",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s Amazon Web Services, the world’s biggest cloud-computing provider, said that new systems running Nvidia Corp.’s Blackwell chips probably won’t be online until early next year, a later timeline than originally anticipated.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nInside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided How Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says Mexico Seeks to Halve Permitting Time to Attract More Factories\n\nWhen Nvidia introduced the new generation of processors in March, it said that partners like Amazon would have Blackwell-based products ready by the end of 2024. But after a production change — dubbed a respin — Amazon is still waiting to get major quantities of the chip to put into its data centers.\n\nNvidia’s timelines have “shifted,” AWS Chief Executive Officer Matt Garman said Thursday on Bloomberg Television. “Right now, we’re working with them and we have early samples, but as they get their yields up from the respin of the Blackwell chip, it’ll probably be early next year before we get production samples in real volume.”\n\nInvestors are keenly focused on when Nvidia’s latest product will get into the hands of customers and put to use. The chipmaker has become one of the world’s most valuable companies on the strength of runaway demand for its artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia has said that — even after production delays — it expects to get billions of dollars of revenue from the processor in the fourth quarter.\n\nAWS will be the first to deploy computers based on the new chip in significant quantities, Garman said, giving it a unique view into Blackwell’s progress. Dell Technologies Inc. also has said that Blackwell-based servers will be generally available at the beginning of 2025.\n\nNvidia products have become a prized commodity among data center operators, which use the chips to develop AI software and services. The Santa Clara, California-based company acknowledged in August that Blackwell proved more difficult to produce than anticipated. The company said that it was making changes to improve its manufacturing yield — the number of functioning chips that come out of factories.\n\nSupplies will be plentiful after manufacturing gains momentum, CEO Jensen Huang said in a Bloomberg Television interview at the time. “We’re going to have lots and lots of supply, and we will be able to ramp,” he said.\n\n--With assistance from Matt Day.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nBYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs A Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work How Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium The World’s Central Banks Aren’t Following the Fed’s Lead Anymore Why OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Chip stocks rally as TSMC forecasts strong AI demand for 'many years'",
        "content": "The optimism over AI demand in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSM) blowout third quarter earnings boosted chip stocks Thursday.\n\nTSMC posted a quarterly profit of $325.3 billion New Taiwan dollars ($10.1 billion), up 54% from the prior year, surpassing Wall Street’s forecasts. The company also raised its full-year sales outlook, with revenue rising 29% in 2024 compared to last year, bumping up the prior guidance in the mid-20s.\n\nHere’s what else the company reported:\n\nAdjusted earnings per share of 12.54 New Taiwan dollars ($0.39) versus NT$11.55 ($0.36) expected and NT$8.13 ($0.25) in Q3 2023 Revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.5 billion) versus NT$751.1 billion ($23.3 billion) expected and NT$546.7 billion ($17 billion) in Q3 2023\n\nThe positive outlook was largely driven by “extremely robust AI-related demand” cited by TSMC CEO C.C. Wei. The chip manufacturer expects AI revenue to more than triple in 2024.\n\nUS-listed TSMC shares jumped 13% on the news, pushing the company's market capitalization past the $1 trillion mark and fueling a rise in chip stocks across the board. Nvidia (NVDA) rose 2.6% Thursday, while Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped 1.3% before paring gains. Qualcomm (QCOM) ticked up 1.3%, and Broadcom (AVGO) surged 2.9%.\n\nAfter underperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC) earlier this week, the PHLX Semiconductor (^SOX) index gained 2% Thursday, outpacing the S&P 500's 0.13% increase.\n\nTSMC is one of three companies capable of manufacturing AI chips that have been crucial to the massive wave of AI innovation following the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2022. The Taiwanese company dominates rivals Samsung (005930.KS) and Intel (INTC) in the AI semiconductor market. TSMC makes the artificial intelligence chips designed by AI superpower Nvidia and its rival Advanced Micro Devices, and those chips are used in data centers to power AI software such as ChatGPT and other popular bots. Other major TSMC customers include Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm, and Broadcom.\n\nTSMC’s sunny third quarter earnings and full-year outlook are a welcome sign for angsty investors worried over the future of the AI space. Wall Street analysts have signaled concerns in recent months over the lack of a near-term return on investment for Big Tech firms spending massive sums on AI infrastructure. The worry is that tech companies could ease spending on AI hardware, causing a downturn in shares of companies like Nvidia and its supplier TSMC. The optimism over AI demand in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's blowout third quarter earnings boosted chip stocks. (REUTERS/Ann Wang/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nThose fears were on display earlier this week, when an AI equipment company’s woes prompted a rout in global chip stocks. Dutch tech giant ASML (ASME.DE) indicated in its third quarter earnings release this week that sales of its machines — which are used by TSMC to make Nvidia’s leading AI chips — would ease. Though ASML’s results were driven by geopolitical concerns and other factors unrelated to the AI chip market, easily spooked investors sold off shares of Nvidia, AMD, and AVGO, with the stocks suffering sharp declines.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC’s results helped those AI chip stocks partially recover from those losses.\n\nAnalysts, however, did put TSMC executives in the hot seat during a call Thursday, probing company leaders about whether there’s an AI bubble.\n\n“We believe the AI demand is real,” Wei responded, “and it will continue for many years.”\n\n“Almost every AI innovator is working with TSMC, and so we probably get the deepest and widest look of anyone in this industry,” he continued.\n\nThe AI chip market is set to grow 99% in 2024 and another 74% next year, according to consulting firm International Business Strategies, which tracks industry data. Meanwhile, the semiconductor market overall is projected to grow 18% this year and 12% in 2025. IBS data shows the AI chip market — also known as the accelerator chip market — outpacing the sector at large through 2030.\n\nWall Street analysts on Thursday reiterated their Buy ratings on TSM.\n\n“[W]e recommend TSMC stock as a core holding for investors who look to invest in semiconductors, which we view as the foundation of the expanding digital economy,” Needham analyst Charles Shi wrote in a note to investors Thursday.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), starts his day inspiringly. While many leaders are overwhelmed by endless to-do lists, Huang ensures his priorities are in check before his workday begins.\n\n“I begin each morning by doing my highest priority work first,” Huang says. “Before I even get to work, my day is already a success.”\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\nHuang's strategy is simple but powerful: get the most important tasks done first no matter what. This gives him a sense of completion even before his workday officially begins and he doesn’t get upset by disruptions during the day because of it.\n\nWhen people apologize for interrupting him, he tells them, “I have plenty of time.” He says it out of true courtesy, not merely to be nice. Because he sets priorities for his day and completes important tasks ahead of schedule, he has more time to assist others and handle unforeseen situations.\n\nTrending: ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\nHuang also prefers not to schedule one-on-one meetings with his direct reports but makes himself available whenever they need him. He shared at a Stanford University talk that his management team consists of 55 people reporting directly to him and the structure is meant to be agile and allow information to flow freely.\n\nHow Jensen Huang schedules meetings as CEO. pic.twitter.com/MnPJsdarCL\n\n— Jon Erlichman (@JonErlichman) June 11, 2024\n\nSee Also: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.\n\nInstead of holding regular meetings, Huang prioritizes availability when needed. “Unless they need me,” he said, “then I’ll drop everything for them.” He and his team maintain open communication throughout the day, which also means there are no formal performance reviews – just ongoing, real-time feedback.\n\nThis sense of clarity and resilience helped Huang and Nvidia defy early critics. In the company's early days, he was told that Nvidia would never grow larger than a billion dollars. But Huang didn't let this underestimation limit him. “A long time ago, I was told that Nvidia could never be larger than a billion dollars,” he recalls. “Obviously, that was an underestimation, underimagination of the size of the opportunity.”\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\n\nInstead of staying in its lane, Nvidia expanded far beyond graphics chips into AI, health care, autonomous vehicles and more, pushing its valuation to over three trillion dollars.\n\nHuang approaches his work with a combination of perseverance, discipline and generosity. He sets sensible priorities, finds time for others and focuses on the big picture.\n\nHis advice to everyone is to find a craft to which you want to dedicate yourself, be resilient in the face of setbacks and prioritize what matters most. “When you do that, you have plenty of time,” Huang says, reminding us that time is best spent on the things that matter.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

        "title": "Meet The Low-Cost Vanguard ETF That Has 20% Of Its Holdings in Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is surging once again, passing Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) to become the second most valuable U.S.-based company behind Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Nvidia's new Blackwell graphics processing unit architecture could deliver significant performance improvements and cost efficiency, which would be a win for Nvidia and its customers.\n\nFolks looking to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) could simply buy Nvidia stock as a catch-all way to play a rise in computing power demand. But there are also exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to consider.\n\nWith a more than 20% stake in Nvidia, Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), here's why the Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) stands out as an excellent way to invest in the semiconductor industry without racking up high fees. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe tech sector has evolved\n\nThe technology sector is, by far, the largest sector in the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) -- making up 31.7% of the index. One look at its top holdings and it is easy to see why.\n\nCompany Weight in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF Apple 16.2% Nvidia 14.1% Microsoft 13.9% Broadcom 4.4% Adobe 1.7% Salesforce 1.6% AMD 1.6% Oracle 1.6% Accenture 1.4% Cisco Systems 1.4%\n\nData source: Vanguard.\n\nApple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Broadcom have a combined market cap of over $10.5 trillion -- making the sector very top-heavy.\n\nAnd while the tech sector used to be dominated by software and hardware companies, semiconductors are now the largest industry within the sector, making up 28.9% of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF.\n\nSo, while investors could turn to pure-play semiconductor funds like the iShares Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SOXX), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may be a better long-term investment. For starters, the iShares Semiconductor ETF has a 0.35% expense ratio compared to just 0.1% for the Vanguard Information Technology ETF.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is also highly cyclical, making an ETF that focuses only on chip stocks volatile.\n\nWith the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, an investor gains access to the infrastructure and processing might that is powering AI, as well as AI-driven tools like those deployed by software companies Microsoft, Adobe, or Apple phones with AI chips.\n\nFactors to consider before buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a great way to invest in today's top tech companies. However, its greatest drawbacks are that it offers little exposure to smaller companies (given the size of the largest tech companies), and it leaves out some important names that you may think are in the tech sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Google's parent company, Alphabet, are in the communications sector. So you won't find these four names in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF.\n\nAmazon Web Services is the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure -- which is critical for running global AI models. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms has arguably been the single best example of a company investing heavily in AI (and buying a lot of Nvidia chips) and showing why those investments are paying off.\n\nVanguard offers a low-cost mega-cap growth fund that targets top growth stocks regardless of their sector. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF(NYSEMKT: MGK) may be a better fit for investors who want less exposure to tech stocks and better coverage of the largest growth stocks by market cap.\n\nLet ETFs work for you\n\nNvidia has captured the spotlight as the leader in AI innovation in the semiconductor space. Still, some investors may prefer AMD as an underdog that could take market share from Nvidia over time.\n\nMeanwhile, Broadcom offers a nice blend of value, growth, and income, given its diversified business and growing dividend.\n\nThe fact that the tech sector has a 20% weighting in these three stocks alone shows how valuable these companies have become. Buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a simple way to add to your exposure to these three names and the rest of the semiconductor industry. It's also an excellent way to avoid the risks of betting on a single company to invest in AI or another trend.\n\nThe best way to approach individual stocks and ETFs is to use them to suit your interests, investment objectives, and risk tolerance. Investors who closely follow the sector may prefer to build their tech portfolio around chip stocks and leave out the big software names. But folks looking for a low-cost passive approach may prefer the hands-off nature of simply buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and resting easy knowing it is chock-full of semiconductor stocks -- so they won't miss out if the industry continues to soar higher.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,139!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $44,239!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $380,729!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 14, 2024\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. posted a better-than-projected 54% rise in quarterly earnings after strong sales of Nvidia Corp. AI chips offset a sagging mobile industry.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nInside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City How Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Mexico Seeks to Halve Permitting Time to Attract More Factories Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says\n\nThe main chipmaker to Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. reported September-quarter net profit of NT$325.3 billion ($10.1 billion), versus an average estimate for NT$299.3 billion. That followed a previously reported 39% climb in revenue during the period.\n\nTSMC’s shares have surged more than 70% this year, outpacing many of Asia’s biggest tech firms in a reflection of outsized expectations around its AI business. Taiwan’s largest company raised its outlook for 2024 revenue in July, underscoring expectations for sustained spending on AI infrastructure from the likes of Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. Steady adoption of artificial intelligence should also help fuel sales of iPhones and other gadgets.\n\nWhile official trading of TSMC’s American depositary receipts won’t begin for a few hours, the ADRs are up about 4.5% on Robinhood’s overnight trading platform. TSMC is popular among US retail investors seeking to bet on the AI theme. Shares of Japanese chip gear makers including Lasertec Corp. pared losses in Tokyo after TSMC reported.\n\nFor a liveblog on TSMC’s earnings, click here.\n\nStill, investors will be watching for deviations in outlook after major supplier ASML Holding NV reported only half the orders analysts estimated. The chipmaking gear maker blamed slower-than-expected recovery in the automotive, mobile and PC markets, impacting expansion plans for chip plants. AI remains a bright spot, executives said.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC’s short- to medium-term revenue outlook remains solid despite the potential slowdown in global fabrication-capacity growth implied by ASML — its largest tool supplier — reporting a 3Q book at half the expected level. Strong demand for TSMC’s 2- and 3-nanometer technologies from Nvidia, AMD, Apple and Qualcomm provide an offset. TSMC’s superior production yields, improving EUV machine productivity and leadership in 2.5D and 3D packaging offer further sales support.\n\n- Charles Shum, analyst\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nEven before ASML, some investors have grown cautious about the sustainability of global AI spending. They question whether big tech firms like Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. will continue to splash out on AI chips and data centers without a truly killer AI application.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor now, TSMC appears to be pursuing a rapid international expansion.\n\nIt’s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That’s on top of construction underway in Japan, Arizona and Germany.\n\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov and Cindy Wang.\n\n(Updates with share action in the fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nBYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs A Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work How Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium The World’s Central Banks Aren’t Following the Fed’s Lead Anymore Why OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stock-Split Stocks That Offer Up to 111% Upside, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Although the two-year anniversary of Wall Street's bull market is largely due to excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), it'd be a mistake to overlook the key role stock-split euphoria has played in lifting select market leaders in 2024.\n\nA stock split is a tool available to publicly traded companies that allows them to cosmetically adjust their share price and outstanding share count by the same factor. These changes are surface-scratching in the sense that they don't alter a company's market cap or its operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhile splits come in two varieties -- forward and reverse -- investors overwhelmingly favor one over the other. Since reverse splits (the type designed to increase a company's share price) are usually conducted from a position of operating weakness, it's the type of split most investors avoid. Meanwhile, forward splits, which lower a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable for everyday investors, are typically undertaken by businesses with well-defined competitive advantages. This is the type of split investors flock to.\n\nOver the last nine months, more than a dozen brand-name businesses have completed a stock split. However, the outlook for these stock-split stocks differs quite a bit, based on the price targets issued by select Wall Street analysts.\n\nIn particular, three industry-leading stock-split stocks offer implied upside of up to 111%.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside of 45%\n\nPerhaps it comes as no surprise that one of the stock-split stocks with the most robust upside potential, based on the forecast of at least one Wall Street analyst, is the company leading the AI revolution, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia joined this elite club of stock-split stocks in June with a historic 10-for-1 forward split.\n\nAnalyst Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities foresees this transformational company reaching $200 per share, which would represent a 45% return from its closing price on Oct. 14 and make Nvidia a roughly $5 trillion business.\n\nNvidia's near-parabolic move higher is the result of its hardware becoming the \"brains\" of AI-accelerated data centers. Demand for the company's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) and successor Blackwell GPU architecture have been robust, which has left little room for external competitors.\n\nWhen an in-demand good or service is in short supply, the laws of economics state that the price of that good service will climb until demand levels off. Nvidia's H100 has been commanding anywhere from a 100% to 300% price premium over other AI-GPUs, which has helped push the company's adjusted gross margin notably higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia's CUDA software platform is doing its part to keep the company's customers loyal to its ecosystem. CUDA is the toolkit developers rely on to build large language models and squeeze as much computing power as possible out of their Nvidia GPUs.\n\nBut while Mosesmann's target of 45% additional upside appears reachable, there are also reasons to believe Nvidia's stock has peaked. For instance, no game-changing innovation, spanning three decades, has avoided a bubble-bursting event early in its expansion.\n\nFurthermore, internal competition is picking up in a big way. With Nvidia's four-largest customers developing AI-GPUs of their own, Nvidia may find that future order opportunities for its hardware are limited. Image source: Sirius XM.\n\nSirius XM Holdings: Implied upside of 60%\n\nA second stock-split stock that can skyrocket, according to the view of one Wall Street analyst, is satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI). Sirius XM is the only high-profile stock-split stock of 2024 that completed a reverse split (1-for-10).\n\nBenchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan believes shares of Sirius XM are headed to $43. If accurate, this would imply upside of 60%, based on where the company's stock closed out the Oct. 14 trading session.\n\nThough the company's subscriber figures have declined in back-to-back quarters, which is mostly a function of tepid auto sales, it nevertheless brings well-defined competitive advantages to the table.\n\nThe most obvious competitive edge for Sirius XM is that it's a legal monopoly. While being the only licensed satellite-radio operator doesn't mean the company is free of competition for listeners, it does afford Sirius XM substantial subscription pricing power.\n\nSirius XM's omnichannel presence is another source of strength. Most traditional radio operators generate almost all of their revenue from advertising. Though this strategy works great during long-winded economic expansions, it can lead to problems during inevitable recessions.\n\nThrough the first-half of 2024, Sirius XM generated less than 20% of its net sales from ads and close to 77% from subscriptions. A subscription-driven model leads to highly predictable cash flow and makes it less likely that Sirius XM will see wild fluctuations in revenue and profits during shifts in the economic cycle.\n\nThe final factor on Sirius XM's side is its historically cheap valuation. Even following a nice bounce from a recent decade-low closing price, shares of the company are valued at roughly 8 times forward-year earnings. This represents a bargain for long-term-minded investors.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied upside of 111%\n\nBut the stock-split stock that offers the most robust upside, according to the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is customizable rack server and storage solutions specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Super Micro completed its first-ever forward split, 10-for-1, following the close of trading on Sept. 30.\n\nWall Street's biggest Super Micro Computer bull is analyst Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Baruah's $100 price target, which has been split-adjusted down from $1,000, implies scorching-hot upside potential of up to 111%.\n\nAlthough Nvidia's AI-GPUs are the hottest thing since sliced bread, there's an opportunity for businesses throughout the data-center economy to thrive. Super Micro happens to be one of the go-to providers of customizable rack servers used in high-compute data centers. Its servers also incorporate the H100 GPU, which is presumably lifting demand for the company's infrastructure solutions.\n\nThe revenue acceleration for Super Micro has been eyepopping. Net sales surged 110% in fiscal 2024 (ended June 30) to $14.94 billion, with the company guiding net revenue to a range of $26 billion to $30 billion in fiscal 2025. The upper bound would represent back-to-back years of triple-digit growth.\n\nNevertheless, it's not all peaches and cream for this infrastructure colossus. Noted short-seller Hindenburg Research has alleged \"accounting manipulation\" at Super Micro, which the company has denied. Despite this denial, the U.S. Justice Department has reportedly opened an early stage probe into the company, and Super Micro has delayed the filing of its annual report. It's not the best look for an S&P 500 company.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that Super Micro Computer is somewhat at the mercy of its suppliers. Just as incorporating Nvidia's H100 GPUs has made its customizable rack servers a top choice for businesses building out their AI-accelerated data centers, the backlog of this in-demand GPU could put a low ceiling on Super Micro's upside.\n\nUntil the company's accounting questions are resolved and its annual report is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, triple-digit upside for its stock doesn't seem attainable.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia, chip stocks rally after TSMC's blowout earnings",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Chip stocks rose higher Thursday after a blowout earnings report by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), the world’s largest producer of advanced chips and a key player in the ongoing AI boom.\n\nShares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) climbed 2.5% in premarket trading, while AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) added 3% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\nMoreover, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares climbed 1%, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) rose 1.9%, and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) climbed 2.2%.\n\nTSMC reported a 54% increase in net profit, as global chipmakers continue to benefit from demand driven by AI applications.\n\nThe company's net income for the July-September quarter was 325.3 billion Taiwanese dollars ($10.1 billion), exceeding the LSEG estimate of 300.2 billion Taiwanese dollars cited by Reuters.\n\nNet revenue for the third quarter reached $23.5 billion, up 36% year-on-year. The company's gross margin improved to 57.8% over July-September, compared to 54.3% during the same period last year.\n\nIn a statement, TSMC said that in the third quarter, “our business was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” referencing its semiconductor nodes.\n\nDuring an earnings call, TSMC Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei emphasized that AI demand is “real” and noted that the company has experienced the “deepest and widest growth of anyone in this industry” as a result.\n\n“We have talked to our customers all the time, including our hyperscaler customers who are building their own chips. And almost every AI innovator is working with TSMC,” he said, according to a call transcript produced by FactSet.\n\nTSMC now expects its capital expenditure for this year to increase to slightly more than $30 billion, as mentioned during the earnings call. The firm's capital expenditures rose to $6.4 billion in the third quarter, up from $6.36 billion in the previous three months.\n\n“TSMC is a major gauge of how quickly the AI movement and hyper data centers can be built out and how healthy supply dynamics are in the space,” Paul Marino, Chief Revenue Officer at Themes ETFs told Investing.com.\n\nTSMC’s Taipei-listed shares have soared nearly 80% year-to-date, surpassing the broader market's gains of 28.57%.\n\nThe company’s solid Q3 print has helped improve investor sentiment following recent disappointing guidance and results by European chipmaker ASML (AS:ASML). The firm saw its shares tumbling after issuing a lower-than-expected forecast of net sales.\n\n“The fact that ASML guided so low put some doubt into investors as to whether or not this AI demand is as big as everyone is predicting. And it puts a spotlight on guidance for every other semiconductor company that reports moving forward,” Marino commented.\n\nStory continues\n\n“That said, I do believe there is a significant difference in demand from companies like AMD and Nvidia, and investors will look for robust guidance to justify current valuations when they report later in the quarter.”\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia, chip stocks rally after TSMC's blowout earnings\n\nMeta's oversight board seeks public comments on hate speech moderation\n\nUK stocks steady ahead of ECB rate decision; Rentokil caps ex-dividend pressure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia Stock vs. Arm Stock: Wall Street Says Buy One and Sell the Other",
        "content": "Grand View Research forecasts artificial intelligence (AI) chip sales will grow at 29% annually through 2030. Semiconductor companies Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) are major players in that market, and shares have rocketed 166% and 100%, respectivley, year to date. But most Wall Street analysts expect the stocks to move in opposite directions over the next year.\n\nNvidia has a median 12-month price target of $150 per share. That implies 15% upside from its current share price of $131. Arm has a median 12-month price target of $144 per share. That implies 5% downside from its current share price of $151.\n\nGoing forward, Nvidia and Arm should benefit as businesses continue to build out their AI infrastructure, but that does not necessarily make them good investments. Here are the important details.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia holds 98% market share in data center graphics processing units (GPU), chips used to accelerate computationally demanding workloads like training machine learning models and running artificial intelligence (AI) applications. That dominance is more than a decade in the making. In 2006, Nvidia introduced its CUDA programming model, which has evolved into an unmatched ecosystem of software development tools for GPU programmers.\n\nMore recently, Nvidia has added networking gear and central processing units (CPUs) to its hardware portfolio, and debuted software and cloud services that simplify AI application development. In that context, while many investors view Nvidia as a chipmaker, it is more accurately an accelerated computing company. And its ability to innovate across the entire data center computing stack -- from hardware to software to services -- affords Nvidia a competitive moat.\n\nNvidia beat estimates with its financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended July 2024). Revenue increased 122% to $30 billion due to strong demand for AI chips, networking, and enterprise software. And non-GAAP net income increased 152% to $0.68 per diluted share. Management also gave stronger guidance than Wall Street anticipated, such that revenue is forecast to jump 80% in the third quarter.\n\nIt goes without saying that Nvidia has a tremendous opportunity where AI is concerned, but the broader data center accelerator market is equally momentous. \"We are at the beginning of our journey to modernize $1 trillion worth of data centers from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing,\" CEO Jensen Huang recently told analysts. He expects that transition to play out over the next four to five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to increase at 35% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends January 2027). That makes current valuation of 59 times adjusted earnings look fair. Personally, I think Nvidia is a must-own stock given its level of participation in the AI economy, not to mention its leadership in the data center accelerator market. The current price is a reasonable entry point for patient investors.\n\n2. Arm Holdings\n\nArm develops central processing unit architectures and licenses the intellectual property (IP) to clients, who use the IP to build custom chips for a wide range of end markets, from mobile devices and industrial sensors to data center infrastructure. Arm also provides development tools that simplify the of writing and debugging of applications.\n\nArm CPUs are known for their energy efficient architecture, which has helped the company secure a leadership position in mobile devices. Most importantly, Arm has more than 99% market share in smartphone processors. However, the company is also gaining share in data centers and personal computers (PCs) because its chip are becoming increasingly powerful.\n\nArm is well positioned to benefit as the artificial intelligence boom progresses. Its CPUs are the foundation of Apple Intelligence; they handle simple AI tasks on devices like iPhones and more complex AI tasks on private data center servers. The major public clouds (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform) have designed Arm-based server CPUs. And several computer manufacturers have introduced AI PCs powered by Arm processors.\n\nArm reported solid financial results in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended June 2024), beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 39% to $939 million due to momentum in the smartphone and cloud computing markets, which itself was driven by strong adoption of Arm's latest architecture (Armv9). Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income increased 67% to $0.40 per diluted share.\n\nWall Street expects Arm's adjusted earnings to grow at 27% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends March 2027). That estimate makes the current valuation of 107 times adjusted earnings look outrageously expensive. So, I think prospective investors should stay on the sidelines right now, and present shareholders should consider trimming their positions, especially if those positions comprise a substantial portion of their portfolios.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.\n\nRising Market Volatility\n\nVolatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market.\n\nA report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds and David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy.\n\nWhile expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells.\n\nThe economist maintains we are marching on ice that’s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September.\n\n“It’s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,” he said. “That’s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.”\n\n“But there’s been some cracks in the business cycle,” he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at “super high” levels.\n\nA slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election.\n\nWhile the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Historically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,” Cohen said.\n\nAlthough there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows.\n\nAI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta’s share price surge due to strong sales growth.\n\nAnalysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst’s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 179\n\nAnalyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 15.32%\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is arguably one of the most promising future stocks, according to analysts, given the role it is playing in artificial intelligence, which is only starting. With so many companies relying on its chips to power next-generation technologies and software, its growth metrics and long-term prospects remain intact.\n\nGiven that artificial intelligence adoption is still in the early stages, it affirms Nvidia’s long-term prospects as a leading player in the supply of much-needed chips for AI. Given that graphic processing units are preferred for their flexibility and adaptability in the evolving AI applications, it also affirms the company’s growth metrics.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) financial statements show the company’s explosive growth in recent years. Its net income over the last four reported quarters has exceeded $53 billion. That’s almost twice as much as the $26.9 billion it made in fiscal 2022, which concluded on January 30, 2022, before all the AI hoopla started. It made $9.8 billion in profit during that fiscal year.\n\nThe enormous demand for Nvidia’s data center graphics processing units (GPUs), which aid in the execution and training of AI algorithms, caused the company’s second-quarter revenue to soar 122% year over year to $30 billion.\n\nThe company’s bottom line is likewise strong, with operating income rising 174% yearly to $18.6 million. In 2025 and beyond, management anticipates introducing new AI hardware products built on the quicker and more effective Blackwell architecture will boost customer demand.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s revenue base is poised to receive a significant boost later in the year with the launch of the Blackwell cap line. Given that the chipset is already eliciting sand demand, according to Coo Jensen Huang, it underscores why Nvidia is a top growth stock.\n\nThanks to robust revenue and earnings growth, the stock is currently trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 31, which is not high for a stock that has rallied by more than 26,000%. Analysts on Wall Street rate the stock as a buy with an average price target of $152.44, implying a 15.32% change from the last price of $132.19.\n\nAccording to our Insider Monkey database, at the close of Q2 2024, 179 investors were bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), with total stakes amounting to $53.7 billion.\n\nIthaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving.

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Energy Consumption Is Jumping At a Scary Pace: 2 Stocks That Could Surge Thanks to This Trend",
        "content": "The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) has increased the demand for more powerful chips that are being deployed in data centers to train complex large language models (LLMs), and also for moving those models into production through AI inference.\n\nHowever, clustering together multiple powerful chips that consume a lot of electricity and generate a lot of heat also means that data centers now have two new challenges to tackle. The first is to find a way to reduce electricity consumption. Market research firm IDC anticipates that energy consumption in AI data centers is set to increase at an incredible compound annual growth rate of 45% through 2027.\n\nThe firm predicts that overall data center electricity consumption could more than double between 2023 and 2028. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs forecasts that data center power demand could grow 160% by 2030, indicating that data center operators will have to shell out a lot of money on electricity.\n\nThe second problem that AI data centers are creating is that of higher heat generation. When multiple chips with high power consumption figures are deployed in AI server racks, it is inevitable for them to produce a lot of heat. Not surprisingly, there are concerns that AI data centers could have a negative impact on the climate and create more pressure on the electrical grid.\n\nHowever, there are two companies that are looking to solve these challenges -- Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) -- and check how their products could witness a nice jump in adoption to tackle the problem of rising heat and electricity generation in data centers.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been the chips of choice for AI training and inference. This is evident from the company's 85%-plus share of the AI chip market. Nvidia's chips have been deployed for training popular AI models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta Platforms' Llama, and cloud service providers have been increasingly looking to get their hands on the company's offerings to train even larger models.\n\nOne reason why that's happening is because Nvidia's AI chips are getting more powerful with each passing generation. For instance, the chip giant points out that its upcoming Blackwell AI processors allow organizations \"to build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.\"\n\nMore importantly, this remarkable reduction in energy consumption is accompanied by a 30 times increase in performance. So, AI models can not only be trained and deployed at a much faster pace now using Nvidia's chips but the same can now be done with much less power consumption. For example, Nvidia points out that its Blackwell processors can train OpenAI's GPT-4 LLM by consuming just 3 gigawatts of power as compared to a whopping 5,500 gigawatts which would have been required a decade ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs such, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia sustaining its lead in the market for AI chips as its processors are likely to be in high demand because of the cost and performance advantages. That's the reason why analysts at Japanese investment bank Mizuho are forecasting Nvidia's revenue to surpass $200 billion in 2027 (which will coincide with its fiscal year 2026).\n\nThat would be more than triple the company's fiscal 2024 revenue of $61 billion. More importantly, Mizuho's forecast indicates that Nvidia could easily surpass Wall Street's estimates of $178 billion in revenue for fiscal 2026. As a result, Nvidia stock's impressive surge seems sustainable, which is why investors would do well to buy it while it is still trading at a relatively attractive valuation.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nServer manufacturer Supermicro has received a lot of negative press of late. From a bearish report by short-seller Hindenburg Research alleging financial irregularities to a reported probe by the Department of Justice as claimed by the Wall Street Journal, investors have been panic-selling Supermicro stock. Additionally, the news of a delay in the filing of the company's annual 10-K seems to have added to the bearishness.\n\nHowever, investors should note that Hindenburg's allegations are likely to be biased as the short-seller would have an interest in seeing Supermicro fall, and it remains to be seen if their points have any credibility. Additionally, there is no confirmation from the Justice Department if it is indeed probing Supermicro. Of course, Supermicro has a history of \"improper accounting,\" which is probably why investors have been panicking.\n\nBut at the same time, investors should note that nothing has been proven yet, nor is it certain there is a probe by the Department of Justice into the company. However, what's worth noting is that Supermicro has been addressing the issue of higher heat generation in AI data centers with its liquid-cooled server solutions.\n\nThe stock popped significantly on Oct. 7 after it announced that it has shipped over 2,000 liquid-cooled server racks since June. Additionally, Supermicro points out that more than 100,000 GPUs are set to be deployed using its liquid cooling solutions on a quarterly basis. The company claims that its direct liquid-cooled server solutions can help achieve up to 40% energy savings and 80% space savings, which probably explains why its server racks are witnessing solid demand.\n\nEven better, Supermicro management pointed out last year that it can deliver 5,000 liquid-cooled server racks per month, and it won't be surprising to see its capacity utilization heading higher as data center operators look to reduce costs and energy consumption. After all, Supermicro says that the potential \"40% power reduction allows you to deploy more AI servers in a fixed power envelope to increase computing power and decrease LLM time to train, which are critical for these large CSPs and AI factories.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the overall demand for liquid-cooled data centers is forecast to grow at an annual rate of over 24% through 2033, generating annual revenue of almost $40 billion in 2033 as compared to $4.45 billion last year. Supermicro has already been growing at an impressive pace and this new opportunity attributable to the higher heat and electricity generation in data centers could give it an additional boost.\n\nOf course, investors would be looking for more clarity about the company's operations following the recent developments, but one shouldn't forget that Supermicro's earnings are forecast to increase at an annual rate of 62% for the next five years. So, this AI stock should be on the radar of investors looking to make the most of the opportunity presented by the AI-related challenges discussed in this article.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia is set to dominate another Big Tech earnings season",
        "content": "We’re rolling into what is expected to be another wild tech earnings season, and you can bet AI is going to be front and center. And if there’s one company that everyone is watching, it’s Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nShares of the chip giant are up more than 16% in the last month, and the stock is currently on pace to unseat Apple as the largest publicly traded company by market capitalization.\n\nThe jump comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for the company’s upcoming Blackwell chip is “insane” during an interview with CNBC on Oct. 3. Since then, shares of Nvidia have climbed roughly 18%, topping out at $130. But reports that the Biden administration will establish a cap on the number of AI chips that can be shipped to certain countries put the rally on hold Tuesday before recovering some ground Wednesday.\n\nNvidia’s incredible stock performance and meteoric rise in data center sales over the last year have put the company in a difficult position for its upcoming earnings announcement, which it has yet to officially schedule. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during his keynote address at Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif. on March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn the company’s fiscal Q3 2024, overall revenue soared 206% to $18.1 billion, while data center revenue rose a whopping 279% to $14.5 billion. And while Nvidia isn’t staring down a decline in revenue, its growth will likely slow versus the same period last year, which could spook investors.\n\nDon’t believe me? Just take a look at what happened after the company announced its Q2 earnings back in August. While the company beat on revenue and earnings per share, with data center revenue increasing 154% year over year to $26.3 billion, Nvidia shares still fell more than 6% immediately following the announcement. It took more than a month for the company’s stock price to recover.\n\nThe AI trade hasn’t raised all ships, either. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) jumped 59% year to date, outpacing the broader S&P 500 (GSPC), which rose 21%. Qualcomm (QCOM) climbed 19% and AMD (AMD) added just 6% to its stock price. Intel (INTC), meanwhile, fell a stunning 55%.\n\nBroadcom benefits from its involvement in AI infrastructure, connecting servers and the like, while Qualcomm is seen as a potential beneficiary of on-device AI growth via AI smartphones and AI PCs. AMD is facing off against Nvidia and serves as an alternative on both price and availability.\n\nThen there’s Intel, which is struggling amid its enormous turnaround effort that includes building out its third-party chip fabrication capabilities as well as trying to catch Nvidia and AMD in the AI processor space.\n\nBut Nvidia is still the hands-down star of the show this earnings season. Investors will be looking for signs of continued AI spending from hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN), which make up a huge portion of AI sales, to get a sense of how well Nvidia chips are selling.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey’ll also look at how other chip companies perform this quarter ahead of Nvidia’s announcement, which tends to be far later in the earnings cycle than its contemporaries.\n\nWall Street will similarly be on the lookout for information about Nvidia’s Blackwell rollout and whether the company is facing any supply constraints as it did with its Hopper chips. Either way, it’s going to be a wild few weeks. Buckle up. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. (yahoofinance)\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on the Magnificent Seven Stocks Plus Netflix.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other magnificent stocks in Jim Cramer's list.\n\nOn Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the ongoing success of major technology stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven. He noted that these companies are proving their resilience in the market, no matter the circumstances, likening their performance to having a unique \"Poltergeist 2 magic.\"\n\nCramer pointed out that this latest rally for the Magnificent Seven differs from previous ones, as it is not merely a zero-sum game where gains for one group come at the expense of another. Instead, other sectors are also thriving, likely due to the influx of capital into the market.\n\n“Unlike previous Mag 7 rallies, this one’s definitely not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can roar, too, in this market, perhaps because there’s just a lot of money going around.”\n\nHe noted that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts mean that cash is losing value, creating an environment ripe for growth. He mentioned that the staying power of the Magnificent Seven is truly unbelievable.\n\n“We know these stocks will once again be hit by endless worries, giving you more opportunities to buy and more weakness before they snap right back and start climbing all over again.”\n\nCramer highlighted that this week marks the beginning of a crucial four-week earnings season, emphasizing that these quarterly reports hold significant weight for investors and the broader stock market. He acknowledged the current climate of anxiety, especially following the market's impressive rally. He added:\n\n“Why stress about how quickly the Fed will cut rates, Oh? God, I'm sick of that. What matters is they're giving vast swaths of the economy a big boost and I doubt they'll stop anytime soon.”\n\nCramer also observed that investors often gravitate toward underdogs in the market, suggesting that banks could be the next promising sector. In addition to banks, Cramer also mentioned the potential in pharmaceutical stocks, suggesting that investors might want to consider major players in that sector as well.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of stocks that were discussed by Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nCramer has been highly bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and mentioned the growing demand for the super chip, Blackwell. Here is what he had to say:\n\n“Now initially, NVIDIA got clubbed along with the whole market when the yen carry trade imploded. Then it came right back because that was only a temporary problem. Then NVIDIA got smacked down after its quarter, although it didn't take out the blows from the previous sell-off. It's been working its way back ever since. As we learned that demand for its next-generation super chip Blackwell is ‘insane’, that's a technical term coined by Jensen, by the way. Next thing you know, the stock's coming all the way back, but back with very few people who sold the stock. And before this, right, I mean they're long gone and gone at much lower levels because they traded it, they sold it. Again, take this as a reminder that if you trade NVIDIA, you probably won't be able to sell it high and then get back in low. The ship would've left without you. It's too hard, people, it's just too hard.”\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has emerged as a dominant force in the technology sector, particularly in AI. Over recent years, investor interest in the company has surged, positioning it among the largest corporations globally. Additionally, on October 14, as reported by TipRanks, TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a target price of $165. He has designated the stock as a Top Pick and Buchalter noted a significant increase in the volumes of the Hopper architecture expected in the latter part of 2024, which could contribute to sustained growth and potentially better profit margins.\n\nWhile he acknowledged some short-term hurdles tied to the evolving supply chain of the Blackwell product line, the enduring demand for these platforms remains strong. Any production delays are anticipated to shift revenue expectations from the first quarter to later in the year, without diminishing the overall demand.\n\nMost importantly, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has reported that its Blackwell platforms are now fully operational, suggesting that prior production challenges have been effectively addressed. With units priced between $30,000 and $40,000, major corporations such as Microsoft and Meta are actively seeking these products to support their AI data centers.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on Jim Cramer's list of magnificent stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Bull Market Completes 2 Years on AI Surge; NVIDIA &amp; PLTR Stocks Shine",
        "content": "Wall Street celebrated the bull market’s second anniversary last week, with the S&P 500 ending at record highs. Since Oct. 12, 2022, the broader S&P 500 has soared more than 60% after hitting a closing low of 3,577.03, per the Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nThe bull market has hardly shown any sign of slowing down in the past two years, mostly due to a resilient U.S. economy and the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). The AI euphoria, in particular, is expected to drive the S&P 500 higher into the year-end and next year. The extensive adoption of AI is expected to boost real GDP growth, increase earnings per share (EPS), and improve the S&P 500’s fair value.\n\nAI boom is here to stay since it is based on practical applications. AI can be utilized to increase product efficiency and curtail costs. Two prominent S&P 500 stocks that made the most of the AI revolution are NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Palantir Technologies Inc PLTR.\n\nNVIDIA is known for providing technologies essential for AI applications. The company’s graphic processing unit (GPU) is integral to the computer server infrastructure for training large language models and functioning AI interfaces. Palantir’s AI software, on the other hand, is widely used, and its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has been a huge success.\n\nShares of NVIDIA and Palantir skyrocketed 1002% and 433.9%, respectively, over the past two years. Shares of these tech players are further expected to scale upward, banking on the AI jubilation and more. Let’s have a look – Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\n2 Bullish Reasons to Drive NVIDIA Stock\n\nThe Biden administration’s initiative to cap U.S. chip exports to certain countries is surely a dampener for NVIDIA, but the fierce demand for Blackwell chips would boost its share price.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang recently said that there is an insane demand for Blackwell chips, which are in full production. The high-end Blackwell B200 chip has more AI throughput than the present Hopper H100 chip, leading to increased demand from companies like Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Meta Platforms, Inc. META.\n\nDominance in the GPU market space is another tailwind for the NVIDIA stock. NVIDIA holds more than 80% of the GPU market, which is poised to reach $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion this year, per Precedence Research.\n\nDevelopers are more inclined toward NVIDIA’s more efficient CUDA software platform than Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s AMD ROCm software platform. Hence, the $2.81 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s earnings per share is up 72.4% from a year ago.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBullish Factor to Drive PLTR Stock\n\nPalantir is one of the hottest AI players and is largely associated with government contracts. The software company is known for helping the government aggregate its data to save costs and gain efficiency.\n\nHowever, lately, Palantir has gained interest from commercial customers due to the launch of AIP. In the company’s latest quarterly results, commercial revenues in the United States climbed 55% to $159 million, and customer count in the commercial space jumped 83% to almost 300, thanks to the demand for AIP. Notably, Palantir had only 14 U.S. commercial customers four years back.\n\nPalantir’s traditional government revenues also improved 23% in the quarter. Thus, persistent demand for Palantir’s AIP, which stands out from the pack, will propel its share prices upward. And with the AI market poised to hit $1 trillion in 10 years, Palantir’s shares stand to gain significantly in the long run. As a result, the $0.36 Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLTR’s earnings per share is up 33.3% from a year ago. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLower Interest Rates Are a Boon for NVDA & PLTR\n\nOne of the common factors that will drive the share prices of NVIDIA and Palantir is the Federal Reserve’s recent move to trim interest rates by 50 basis points in its latest monetary policy meeting. The Fed slashed interest rates after more than two years and penciled in more similar rate cuts soon amid tamed price pressures.\n\nNow, interest rate cuts bode well for tech players like NVIDIA and Palantir as they curtail the cost of borrowings and jack up profit margins. Similarly, rate cuts don’t hinder cash flows, which are essential for both the company’s growth initiatives.\n\nThus, the highest short-term price target offered by brokers for NVDA stock is $200, an upside of 44.9% from the last closing price of $138.07. Analysts’ highest short-term price target for PLTR stock is $50, up 15.2% from the last closing price of $43.40.\n\nNVIDIA stock currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Palantir has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "State Street Corp's Strategic Acquisition of Evergy Inc Shares",
        "content": "Overview of the Recent Transaction\n\nState Street Corp, a prominent investment firm, recently expanded its portfolio by acquiring an additional 10,955 shares of Evergy Inc, a regulated electric utility company. This transaction, executed on September 30, 2024, at a price of $62.01 per share, increased State Street Corp's total holdings in Evergy to 16,465,218 shares. Despite the significant number of shares purchased, this move had a minimal immediate impact on the firm's portfolio, representing a 0.04% position.\n\nProfile of State Street Corp\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with EVRG.\n\nHeadquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, State Street Corp is a global leader in asset management. With a vast portfolio of 4,172 stocks and a staggering equity value of $2,285.63 trillion, the firm's investment strategy is heavily weighted towards technology and financial services sectors. Its top holdings include giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). State Street Corp's Strategic Acquisition of Evergy Inc Shares\n\nIntroduction to Evergy Inc\n\nEvergy Inc, symbolized as EVRG, operates as a regulated electric utility primarily across eastern Kansas and western Missouri. With a market capitalization of $14.06 billion and a PE Ratio of 19.05, Evergy stands out as a significant player in the wind energy sector in the United States. The company's robust infrastructure supports a combined rate base of approximately $20 billion, distributed across various states and federal jurisdictions. State Street Corp's Strategic Acquisition of Evergy Inc Shares\n\nAnalysis of the Trade Impact and Financial Metrics\n\nThe recent acquisition by State Street Corp underscores a strategic investment in the utilities sector, particularly in a company that is fairly valued according to the GF Value of $60.74. Evergy's current stock price closely aligns with this valuation, indicating a balanced investment opportunity. The trade has bolstered State Street Corp's position in Evergy to 7.20%, highlighting a significant stake in the company's operational and financial future.\n\nSector and Market Analysis\n\nState Street Corp's investment in Evergy aligns with its broader strategy of focusing on technology and financial services, while also capitalizing on stable returns offered by the utilities sector. The utilities industry, particularly regulated electric utilities, offers a predictable revenue stream and growth, attributes that are appealing in the current economic climate where stability is prized.\n\nComparative Analysis with Other Investors\n\nOther notable investors in Evergy Inc include Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio) and GAMCO Investors, with the latter being the largest shareholder. State Street Corp's recent purchase positions it as a significant but not dominant investor in Evergy, suggesting a strategic rather than controlling interest in the company's operations and growth trajectory.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerformance Metrics and Future Outlook\n\nEvergy's GF Score of 77 indicates good potential for future performance. The company's financial strength and profitability, coupled with its growth and momentum, suggest a stable investment. Looking ahead, Evergy's focus on expanding its renewable energy offerings and enhancing grid reliability are expected to drive growth, aligning with State Street Corp's investment philosophy of prioritizing sustainable and stable returns.\n\nConclusion\n\nState Street Corp's acquisition of additional shares in Evergy Inc represents a calculated enhancement to its diverse and robust portfolio. This move not only reinforces the firm's commitment to the utilities sector but also positions it to benefit from the ongoing growth and stability of Evergy. As the energy sector continues to evolve, particularly with a shift towards sustainable resources, State Street Corp's stake in Evergy may yield significant returns, reflecting well on its strategic market positioning.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "ASML EPS Hits Semis: 5 Reasons to Buy the Dip",
        "content": "Semiconductors Slump After ASML Results Released\n\nYesterday, semiconductor stocks declined due to a surprise earnings release by Dutch semiconductor giant ASML Holding (ASML). ASML’s earnings were released yesterday on the company’s website due to an apparent technical error. ASML, which counts Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Intel (INTC), and Samsung Electronics as its largest clients, beat Wall Street expectations handily but provided weak forward earnings guidance, citing slower expected demand for AI-related chips. The news led to a 16% haircut for ASML shares as volume swelled to 5x the norm.\n\nHowever, the poor performance was not secluded to ASML; the weakness in ASML reverberated throughout the semiconductor industry, and the Semiconductor ETF (SMH) dove more than 5% on the news. Is the party finally over in semiconductors, or is it time to again buy the dip?\n\nNvidia Demand Remains Strong\n\nOne of my favorite metaphors for the stock market is from Wayne Gretzky, the greatest hockey player of all time. Gretzky once lamented that hockey players should “Skate to where the puck is going, not to where it has been.” The thought process “The Great One” used for hockey is the same one that savvy investors use and the one that the Zacks Rank is based on. Rather than trading off the past, stocks discount the future.\n\nThough ASML is an integral player in the AI realm, the best proxy for investors to consider is Nvidia (NVDA), the undisputed AI leader.\n\nSupply Problem, Not Demand\n\nThe Zacks Rank processes information from roughly 3,000 analysts at over 150 Wall Street firms. The latest Zacks Consensus Estimates for Nvidia shows that demand will not slow any time soon. Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest that NVDA’s earnings will more than double in 2025 and will increase ~33% in 2026. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeanwhile, NVDA CEO Jensen Huang confirmed that demand for its new Blackwell chip is “insane” in a recent interview on CNBC.\n\nBullish Technical Picture\n\nSemiconductors such as Arm Holdings (ARM) and NVDA were due for a retreat. For example, ARM jumped more than 25% in a single week after finding buyers off its 200-day moving average. After such a big run, some backing and filling is common, but this does not necessarily mean the run is over. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nFurthermore, ASML is not a good barometer for semiconductors. The stock’s price action has lagged for months, even before the company reported lackluster earnings. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBullish Options Positioning\n\nDeep-pocketed call buyers bought millions of dollars worth of the 2x Long NVDA ETF (NVDL) during yesterday’s dip, signaling bullish conviction by smart money investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nASML’s lackluster earnings report caused semiconductors to decline yesterday. Nevertheless, Wall Street’s expectations, technical factors, and the options market suggest that investors should buy the dip.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, Apple and Intel",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – October 16, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, Apple Inc. AAPL and Intel Corp. INTC.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTSM a Must-Buy Ahead of Earnings This Week\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. has become a new poster boy on the global artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy. The company is the largest manufacturer of AI-based chipsets for the world's best AI chipset developers.\n\nTSM provides a range of wafer fabrication processes, including processes to manufacture complementary metal- oxide-semiconductor logic, mixed-signal, radio frequency, embedded memory, bipolar CMOS mixed-signal, and others.\n\nSolid Q3 Outlook of TSM Stock\n\nOn Oct 9, Taiwan Semiconductor reported that its September revenues came in at around $7.82 billion. Added to its results for August and July, TSM is expected to report $23.6 billion in revenues for third-quarter 2024.\n\nIf this figure materializes, it will exceed the current Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the company's guidance given at the second-quarter 2024 earnings conference call. TSM said that solid adoption of AI and smartphones boosted the demand for its leading-edge process technologies.\n\nTSM has a strong clientele. The company is the largest manufacturer of NVIDIA Corp.'s chipsets. NVIDIA is globally the largest developer of generative AI-based chips. TSM also caters to Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Apple Inc. andIntel Corp., to name a few.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor will report third-quarter 2024 earnings results on Oct 17, before the opening bell. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nSolid Earnings Estimate Revisions for TSM Shares\n\nFor third-quarter 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate currently shows revenues of $22.72 billion, suggesting an improvement of 31.5% year over year and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.74, indicating an appreciation of 34.9% year over year. The company reported positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters with the average beat being 7.8%.\n\nMoreover, TSM has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions for full-year 2024 and full-year 2025 in the last 60 days. At present, the Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year increase of 23.6% and 24.5%, respectively, for revenues and EPS in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite this solid growth, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2025 revenues and EPS for TSM reflects an upside of 23.5% and 28.4%, respectively. In addition, TSM has a long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of 26.5%, significantly higher-than the broad-market index, S&P 500's growth rate 13.6%.\n\nTSM's Stock Price Soars Year to Date\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is experiencing solid demand for its advanced technologies, such as 3-nanometer (nm) and 5nm. The growing adoption of its multi-project wafer processing service, which allows customers to reduce mask costs, is driving its customer momentum.\n\nTSM's growing efforts to ramp up the production of 3nm and development of 2nm is a plus. Also, strength across its 7nm, 16nm and 28nm technologies is contributing well to its top-line growth. Consequently, the stock price of TSM has soared 84.8% year to date.\n\nMore Upside Left for TSM Shares\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is currently trading near its 52-week high level. Despite this, the average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 7.3% from the last closing price of $192.21. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $170-$250. This indicates a maximum upside of 30.1% and a maximum downside of 11.6%.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "'We Create Markets,' Says Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang – 'Everything That We Do Didn't Exist Before'",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang certainly has a unique approach to business. He focuses on creating brand-new markets that nobody has thought of before. Huang and Nvidia are creating something out of nothing, exploring new opportunities rather than competing with others in well-established businesses.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nAs Huang puts it, “I’d rather be a market maker, market creator than a market taker.” Because of his daring business plan, Nvidia has become the second most valuable corporation in the world.\n\nHuang calls these new spaces “zero-billion-dollar markets.” These are markets that have not yet attracted investors or rivals because no one has investigated or invested in them. Although it sounds risky, this is a wonderful strategy for staying one step ahead of the competition.\n\n“Everything that we do didn’t exist before,” Huang said in a conversation with Jim Cramer, emphasizing that Nvidia's mission is to create opportunities, not just follow existing trends.\n\nTrending: ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\nIn the early 2000s, Huang took a big risk by investing in “accelerated computing” with CUDA technology. Back then, nobody was buying GPUs for AI computing because AI, as we know it today, didn’t exist. But he saw the potential for GPUs to do more than just improve video games. That’s why Nvidia leads the AI chip market today – they took a chance when no one else did.\n\nHuang says you need to be patient and ready for the long haul if you want to be a “market maker” like Nvidia. Nvidia had to put in years of arduous work and money to get to the top. Failure is also a necessary part of the process; not every concept will pan out. However, there might be enormous rewards for those ready to take chances. As Huang said, “The market size is enormous. It’s measured in trillions,” Nvidia is well-positioned to take a sizable portion of it.\n\nTrending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the same interview, Huang also discussed making technology accessible to everyone, even those without technical backgrounds. “We are going to make computers smarter so people don’t have to learn computer science to program a computer. The computer should just understand what we want and intend,” he said. This reflects Nvidia's vision of making technology easier for people without specialized skills.\n\nWhen Cramer asked him why some people are so scared of AI and losing their jobs, Huang answered that it will create jobs. “It’s going to make companies more productive. When companies are more productive, their earnings improve. When that happens, they hire more people,” Huang pointed out.\n\nTrending:\n\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here’s how you can earn passive income with just $100.\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "content": "Unlikely S&P 500 Stock Leaves Nvidia Behind With 241% Gain In 2024\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nWhile Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to ride the AI wave, it's not the only S&P 500 stock cashing in on artificial intelligence.\n\nMeet Vistra Corp (NYSE:VST)—a Texas-based utility powerhouse that has quietly surged by 45.69% over the past month, leaving Nvidia's modest 12.43% monthly gain in the dust.\n\nThe real kicker? Vistra is leveraging AI in a whole new way.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Powell’s moves don’t have to doom your high yields. You can still make great returns in private credit. Find out how.\n\nPowering Up: How Vistra Is Tapping Into AI’s Energy Demand\n\nYou might not immediately associate a utility company with AI, but Vistra is a different breed. The company accounts for nearly one-fifth of Texas' electricity generation, and with its recent expansion into nuclear power, it’s now well-positioned to supply the massive energy needs of AI data centers.\n\nThese centers require enormous amounts of clean, reliable power, and Vistra’s strategic nuclear acquisitions in 2023 and 2024 have put it at the forefront of this emerging energy market.\n\nTrending: Interest rates are falling but you can still make high yields in real estate. Find out how.\n\nNuclear Moves: Vistra's Big Bet Pays Off\n\nWhen Vistra finalized the purchase of the remaining assets of its newly created nuclear entity earlier this year, the market responded enthusiastically. It's no wonder—nuclear power is set to play a critical role in AI infrastructure, and Vistra has positioned itself as a key player.\n\nVistra Stock Still Bullish Despite The Surge\n\nTechnically speaking, Vistra’s stock remains on a bullish tear.\n\nAt $129.60, the stock is well above its key moving averages, with the eight-day SMA at $129.13 and the 50-day SMA at $96.33, signaling continued buying pressure.\n\nEven after its rapid rise, Vistra's technicals suggest there's still room for upside.\n\nThe AI Utility Play You Didn’t See Coming\n\nWith a year-to-date gain of 241.48%, Vistra has not only outpaced Nvidia but has also shattered expectations in the utility sector.\n\nVistra’s rise indicates that AI is lifting not just tech stocks but utilities as well, riding high on the demand for power-hungry data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\n\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities.\n\nArrived Homes, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform, offers a Private Credit Fund. This fund provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target of 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg? Speak to a financial advisor today. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you up with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.\n\nThis article Unlikely S&P 500 Stock Leaves Nvidia Behind With 241% Gain In 2024 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThere's no doubt that Big Tech is in the bull market's driver's seat — but it's got company.\n\nThough the major indexes are narrowly in the green this October, they have been boosted by third quarter earnings from Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS), which reported a big beat on investment banking fees.\n\nMore significantly, the so-called \"fins\" have rallied alongside three others — tech, consumer discretionary, and industrials — to outperform the S&P 500 since the Japanese yen-induced panic of Aug. 5.All four sectors are up about 15%, with a slight edge to tech. (The low is important technically because it marks the bottom of the year's biggest decline — a quite normal 8.5%).\n\nIt might seem familiar — and perhaps a bit unnerving — that \"tech is leading\" once again after the concentration hand-wringing over the \"Magnificent Seven.\" But unlike other periods in this bull market — now two years old — tech has some company, thanks to money flowing, or rotating, into other sectors.\n\nIt's a process as old as public markets. As the godfather of technical analysis, Ralph Acampora, CMT, famously quipped, \"Sector rotation is the lifeblood of a bull market.\"\n\nRalph's nephew, Jay Woods, who is an executive NYSE floor governor and chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, recently joined Stocks In Translation to break down the concept.\n\n\"Money's not leaving the market, it's just going from one sector to the next to the next,\" said Woods, noting the strength in software stocks. He specifically highlighted cybersecurity plays like CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Cisco (CSCO) — both damaged stocks at one time that are now leading.\n\nWoods reflects on Cisco's round-trip journey right back to its dot-com bubble highs.\n\n\"I hate that I like Cisco right now,\" Woods said. \"I liked it in '99, and it's right where it was trading in 1999. That's amazing.\"\n\nIn fact, the tech sector leadership of today stands in stark contrast with earlier in the year, when the Mag Seven stocks dominated. Although perennial leader Nvidia (NVDA) is up 30% since the Aug. 5 low, IBM (IBM) is close on its heels — rising from its legacy tech ashes to fresh records.\n\nFor that matter, more than 20 stocks in the S&P 500 are doing better than Nvidia since the yen low, led by electric power company Vistra Corp. (VST) and United Airlines (UAL) — up 85% and 70%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany of these stocks are simply laggards that got beaten up in the 2022 bear market and left behind. But even among the overextended, there are still potential winners to be found.\n\n\"Put up a five-year weekly chart in utilities for me. Talk about a nice rounded base and then a breakout,\" Woods said, adding, \"[These are] not your grandparents' utilities anymore.\" StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nOn Yahoo Finance's podcast Stocks in Translation, Yahoo Finance editor Jared Blikre cuts through the market mayhem, noisy numbers, and hyperbole to bring you essential conversations and insights from across the investing landscape, providing you with the critical context needed to make the right decisions for your portfolio.

        "content": "ASML (ASML, ASML.AS)\n\nThe US-listed shares of ASML (ASML.AS), which manufactures lithorgraphy machines that are key to making chips, plunged 16% in Tuesday's session after the company cut sales forecast.\n\nASML's Amsterdam-listed shares were also down 4% on Wednesday morning, following the release of the third-quarter results. ASML posted net sales of €7.5bn (£6.3bn), which was better than previous guidance and said it expected full-year net sales of €28bn for the year, slightly above the €27.6bn it reported for 2023.\n\nHowever, the company said it expected net sales to rise to between €30bn and €35bn in 2025, which was the lower half of the range that it had provided back in 2022 at an investor day.\n\nChristophe Fouquet, CEO of ASML, said: \"While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover. It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.\"\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Stocks mixed as BoE interest rate cut odds jump after UK inflation falls below 2%\n\nASML also said its results were published earlier than expected on its website due to a \"technical error\".\n\nThe company's update led other stocks in the sector lower, with chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) both falling.\n\nDanni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said: “Whilst the AI boom seems to be continuing, demand for other semiconductors has been clobbered by the over exuberance of firms responding to a post-Covid chip shortage and higher borrowing costs which have forced some companies to think hard about their spending plans.\"\n\n\"ASML’s outlook will force investors to think hard about the potential earning power of other chip makers whilst consumers around the world, but especially in China, are still feeling the impact of an inflation scorcher,\" she added.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nHewson said that chip darling Nvidia was one of those stocks \"taking a kicking\" on the back of ASML's update, despite having closed Monday's session at a record high.\n\nShe said that Nvidia was \"already under pressure after reports the current US president is considering capping exports of advanced chips to some countries, in particular those in the Persian Gulf\".\n\nRead more: Pound, gold and oil prices in focus: commodity and currency check, 16 October\n\n“With the AI revolution expected to play such a huge part in upping productivity and enabling other technological advances it’s not surprising the US wants to do what it can to maintain its dominance,\" Hewson said. \"But with the election hurtling towards us, there will be plenty of debate about how any new administration might want to police this sector.”\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia closed Tuesday's session nearly 5% lower, denting its strong performance over the past week. The stock hit a share price high of over $138 (£106) on Monday, with its advanced putting it in contention to unseat Apple as the world's most valuable company.\n\nThere has been an abundance of good news around Nvidia, including the company saying last week that its Blackwell AI chips had already sold out for the next 12 months.\n\nLVMH (MC.PA) Actress Ana de Armas poses at the photocall of the Louis Vuitton fashion show at Park Güell in Barcelona, Catalonia (Spain).  (Kike Rincón, Associated Press)\n\nShares in French luxury group LVMH (MC.PA) fell after it reported a dip in sales in results released after the close of the market in Paris on Tuesday.\n\nLVMH was still down more than 4% on Wednesday morning, on the back of it publishing latest sales figures. The conglomerate, whose umbrella of brands includes Louis Vuitton and Dior, reported total revenues of €60.7bn in the first nine months of 2024, which was down 2% on the same period last year.\n\nThe company said sales in its wine and spirits business was down 11% to €4.2bn for the period, while revenues in the watches and jewellery segment were 5% lower at €7.5bn. Sales in its fashion and leather goods segment had fallen 3% to €29.9bn.\n\n\"In an uncertain economic and geopolitical environment, the group remains confident and will maintain a strategy focused on continuously enhancing the desirability of its brands,\" LVMH said.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nAarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that despite this latest dip in sales there were some \"diamonds in the rough\" in the figures.\n\n\"Demand for perfumes and cosmetics helped to mask the scent of a poor showing in other areas,\" he said. \"Brands like Givenchy and Christion Dior with the world’s leading fragrance, Sauvage, helped pick up some of the slack.\"\n\nChiekrie said this set LVMH apart from its peers: \"Its vast stable of blockbuster luxury brands means it’s more diversified and often better able to ride out some of the ups and downs in the market.\"\n\n\"And while it’s still too early to tell, it’s hoped that China’s ongoing stimulus blitz could market a turning point for luxury companies like LVMH,\" he added.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT)\n\nTrading of Trump Media (DJT) shares was briefly halted on Tuesday after the stock plummeted while former president Donald Trump was speaking about his economic policy proposals at the Economic Club of Chicago.\n\nThe stock ended the session nearly 10% down, but was up 3% in pre-market trading on Wednesday morning.\n\nRead more: Gold not glittering for UK investors despite price surge\n\nShares had been rallying after betting markets shifted in favour of a Trump victory in the November election, with prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showing Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nSeparately, Trump Media announced the web launch of its Truth+ streaming service on Monday, following on from the release of the streaming app for Android devices last week.\n\nWhitbread (WTB.L)\n\nPremier Inn-owner Whitbread (WTB.L) said that it was raising its dividend and announced another share buyback in results released on Wednesday.\n\nThe hotel and restaurant company announced an interim dividend of 36.4p per share in its first-half results, up from 34.1p for the same period last year. Whitbread also announced plans to launch a further £100m share buyback.\n\nThat's despite the company reporting a 13% fall in adjusted profits before tax in the first half of the year, at £340m.\n\nRead more: Interest rate cut in November near certain after inflation drops\n\nHowever, Whitbread said it was making progress on its five-year plan, including a growing presence of in Germany.\n\nAs result, the company said that it expected adjusted profits before tax to increase by at least £300m by its 2030 fiscal year versus its current 2025 financial year. In this period, Whitbread also said expected to generate more than £2bn in dividends, share buybacks and \"if suitable opportunities arise, additional high-returning investments\".\n\n“To Whitbread’s credit, it is still outperforming the mid-scale and economy hotel markets,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \"That is one reason why investors haven’t punished the company today. The shares are up as it is doing its best in a tough environment.\"\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Billionaire Steven Cohen Sold 87% of Point72's Stake in Nvidia and Is Piling Into This Supercharged Stock-Split Stock",
        "content": "Investors are never at a loss for data on Wall Street. With thousands of publicly traded companies reporting their operating results every three months, and economic data rolling out with regularity, it can be easy for something important to slip through the cracks.\n\nOn Aug. 14, arguably the most important data dump of the entire third quarter occurred -- and there's a possibility you missed it. This was the filing deadline for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides an easy-to-understand snapshot of which stocks Wall Street's most-successful asset managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter (in this case, the June-ended quarter). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlthough Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett is probably the most closely tracked money manager, billionaire Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management tends to generate a lot of buzz.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising aspect of Cohen's hedge fund, which contains thousands of positions and has more than $38 billion in AUM, has been his and his team's approach to Wall Street's artificial intelligence (AI) darling, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nCohen has dumped almost the entirety of Point72's stake in Nvidia\n\nAt the end of September 2023, Cohen's fund held 16,457,320 shares of Nvidia, which made it Point72's fifth-largest stock holding by market value (excluding options). I should also mention that this share count has been adjusted for Nvidia's historic 10-for-1 stock split, which was carried out in June 2024.\n\nBut over the next nine months, through June 30, Cohen oversaw an 87% reduction of this position to 2,115,018 shares.\n\nWith Nvidia's stock catapulting by 822% since the start of 2023, as of the closing bell on Oct. 11, Cohen's aggressive selling might represent nothing more than profit-taking and asset reallocation. Then again, there may be more to this story than meets the eye.\n\nFor example, it's a given that Nvidia is set to face growing competition. External competitors will be bringing new AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) to market with the hope that their hardware can dethrone Nvidia's ultra-popular H100 and successor AI-GPU architecture, Blackwell.\n\nBut the bigger issue for Nvidia might be internal competition. The company's four-largest customers by net sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- are all internally developing AI-GPUs for their data centers. Nvidia maintaining its computing advantage superiority won't matter much if ease of access to AI-GPUs and cost are more advantageous for these internally developed chips. In other words, this suggests Nvidia will lose out on future orders from its top customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nHistory is another factor that might be making Point72's brightest investment minds, including Steven Cohen, skittish about Nvidia. Every game-changing technology for the last three decades, including the internet, went through a bubble-bursting event early in its existence. Investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the uptake of new technologies, thus leading to eventual disappointment.\n\nNo market-leading business has benefited from the AI revolution more directly than Nvidia. If the AI bubble were to burst, Nvidia's stock would logically be hit harder than its peers.\n\nThe regulatory landscape hasn't done Nvidia any favors, either. In each of the previous two years, U.S. regulators restricted the export of Nvidia's high-powered AI-GPUs to China. Without access to the world's No. 2 economy, Nvidia could be missing out on billions of dollars in sales each quarter.\n\nBut while billionaire Steven Cohen and his team have been busy sending shares of Nvidia to the chopping block, they've absolutely piled into a high-flying stock-split stock with undeniable competitive advantages. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCohen's Point72 takes a big bite out of this outperforming stock-split stock\n\nAmong the numerous holdings that Cohen oversaw the addition to in the June-ended quarter, arguably none stands out more than fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). Chipotle completed its first-ever split after the close of trading on June 25. The magnitude of this split, 50-for-1, was one of the largest in the history of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nDuring the second quarter, Cohen's fund purchased 1,458,700 shares of Chipotle, which increased its March-ended stake by a whopping 446% to 1,785,950 shares. Similar to Nvidia, this share count has been adjusted to account for the company's split.\n\nThe lure that likely attracted Point72's brightest investment minds to take a big bite out of Chipotle's stock is its many well-defined competitive edges.\n\nDifferentiation has been a big reason Chipotle Mexican Grill has been able to stand out in the highly competitive restaurant landscape. Its pledge to use responsibly raised meats that are free of unnecessary antibiotics, as well as source vegetables locally, when possible, has resonated with consumers.\n\nJust as grocery stores capitalized on the organic/natural food trend two decades ago, Chipotle's management team quickly realized that its customers would gladly pay more for higher-quality food. Given that food costs have notably risen over the last couple of years, this pricing power has come in especially handy.\n\nThe company's limited menu also helps it stand out from the crowd. By keeping its menu relatively small, Chipotle ensures that its staff can quickly prep food and prepare meals to keep the lines in its stores moving. Further, a small menu leads to a bigger buzz when new items are introduced.\n\nThe lift Chipotle's business has enjoyed from the introduction of Chipotlanes -- drive-thru lanes devoted to fulfilling mobile orders -- needs to be recognized, too. Mobile ordering has added a new dimension to the company's sales channels, as well as helped introduce the brand to Generation Z.\n\nWhile there's no denying that Chipotle Mexican Grill has handily outperformed expectations since becoming a public company in January 2006, the one aspect that might leave a bad taste in the mouth of investors, including Steven Cohen, is its valuation. Though Chipotle is worthy of a premium to its peers, the company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 45, as of Oct. 11, is a bit excessive for a restaurant chain.\n\nWith some of its organic growth being driven by higher prices and not additional orders, it makes the company's outsized forward P/E ratio even more egregious. There is, after all, only so much innovation that can be expected from a restaurant chain.\n\nAlthough billionaire Steven Cohen has invested in a truly supercharged stock-split stock, its near-term upside looks to be limited.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) minted a lot of millionaires during the past decade as the growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market generated fierce tailwinds for the GPU maker's data center business. But with a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion, it could be tough for Nvidia to deliver more millionaire-making gains over the next few years.\n\nNvidia is still a solid investment, but investors seeking millionaire-making gains should probably focus on smaller companies that still have plenty of room to grow. Specifically, companies with top lines that can keep growing by at least 20% annually for the next few decades could deliver big multibagger gains for some patient investors. I believe these three AI-oriented stocks fit the bill: Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM), SentinelOne(NYSE: S), and IonQ(NYSE: IONQ). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI semiconductor play: Arm Holdings\n\nArm's chip designs are currently used in 99% of all premium smartphones and a broad range of connected cars, cloud-based devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets. Many leading chipmakers -- including Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Apple -- license its power-efficient designs.\n\nArm doesn't manufacture any chips on its own. It only licenses its chip designs to other chipmakers to generate royalties and licensing fees. That flexibility and scalability helped Arm-based chipmakers prevent x86 CPU makers like Intel and AMD from gaining a meaningful foothold in the mobile chip market.\n\nArm still generates most of its licensing and royalty revenue from the cyclical smartphone market. But it's also gradually expanding into the automotive and cloud markets to diversify its business, and it's rolling out more high-royalty AI-oriented designs to boost its gross margins. Many major chipmakers, including Apple and Qualcomm, have already adopted Arm's AI-optimized Armv9 architecture to produce their latest chips.\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 (which ends in March 2027), analysts expect Arm's revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 88%. Arm's stock isn't cheap at almost 100 times next year's earnings, but it could generate more multibagger gains over the next few decades if it remains the leading chip architecture for power-efficient mobile, cloud, automotive, and AI devices.\n\nThe AI cybersecurity play: SentinelOne\n\nMany cybersecurity companies added AI-powered features to their platforms in recent years, but they still depend on human analysts to tackle the major threats. However, SentinelOne's Singularity XDR (extended detection and response) platform aims to completely replace human analysts with its AI-powered tools. It claims that approach is faster, more efficient, and more accurate than human-driven responses.\n\nSentinelOne also provides its services via a mix of on-premise and cloud-based services, but it can still function without any internet access -- which gives it a distinct advantage against cloud-native platforms like CrowdStrike.\n\nSentinelOne's growth has cooled since its initial public offering (IPO) three years ago, but analysts still expect its revenue to increase at a CAGR of 27% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027). Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 8 times next fiscal year's sales, and its losses should gradually narrow as it scales up its business.\n\nSentinelOne is still a fairly small company with an enterprise value of $7.3 billion, which makes it a tempting takeover target for a bigger tech or cybersecurity company. But on its own, it could still be a great long-term play on the growing AI and cybersecurity markets. If it can keep its top line growing by 20% to 30% every year for the foreseeable future, it could evolve into a cybersecurity giant and generate some millionaire-making gains.\n\nThe quantum computing play: IonQ\n\nTraditional computers still process data in binary bits of zeros and ones. Quantum computers accelerate that process by storing zeros and ones simultaneously in \"qubits.\" That process will likely be used to accelerate AI tasks in the future, but three problems are still holding it back -- qubit processing units (QPUs) are too big and expensive, they consume too much energy, and they make a lot more errors than binary CPUs.\n\nOne company that aims to fix those issues is IonQ, a provider of cloud-based quantum computing services. It's using a proprietary \"trapped ion\" technology to shrink the average width of QPUs from a few feet to a few inches -- and that miniaturization process could make it much easier and cheaper to build large quantum computing systems. Those larger systems could also reduce the number of errors for each quantum calculation.\n\nIonQ only generated $22 million in revenue from a handful of government and research customers in 2023, but analysts expect its revenue to increase at a CAGR of 87% to $145 million in 2026 as it scales up its business, increases its computing power, and gains more commercial customers. It isn't profitable yet and its stock isn't cheap at 28 times next year's sales, but it could deliver some massive gains in the future as the quantum computing market expands.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Be in 1 Year?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is on the verge of something big. As of this writing, the company's market cap is $3.3 trillion, only $150 billion behind the world's largest company -- Apple.\n\nGranted, Nvidia has already claimed the top spot before -- this year, in fact. Yet, this time might be different. It's possible that Nvidia might stay put atop the list.\n\nSo, what's likely in store for this giant company over the next year? And is now the right time for investors to buy? Let's have a closer look. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's products remains through the roof\n\nThere's one simple reason why Nvidia's stock has surged by 1,000% over the last two years: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nSimply put, the skyrocketing demand for AI-powered applications has caught much of the world by surprise -- but not Nvidia. Indeed, the company spent years positioning itself for the AI revolution, and because of that, it's now reaping the benefits.\n\nThe company's top-of-the-line graphics processing units (GPUs) are the brains behind much of the world's best AI tools. What's more, the company is already hard at work developing the next cutting-edge GPUs that will power the next wave of AI-related innovation.\n\nThe company's new Blackwell GPUs are currently in production and expected to ship to clients in the fourth quarter. These chips, which reportedly sell for between $30,000 and $40,000, are perhaps the most sought-after technology on the planet. As Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said, \"Everyone wants to have the most [Blackwell GPUs], and everybody wants to be the first.\"\n\nNvidia's rock-solid fundamentals keep getting stronger\n\nAs a result of all that incredible demand for its GPUs, Nvidia's key fundamentals are only getting better. Consider this: In 2022, Nvidia's annual revenue was $27 billion. Over the last 12 months, Nvidia has reported $96 billion in revenue -- roughly four times its 2022 total. What's more, analysts expect the company to report $178 billion by 2026.\n\nNeedless to say, that's incredible growth, and it's the biggest reason Nvidia's stock is skyrocketing. However, it gets even better. Nvidia's profits are growing even more quickly.\n\nThe company reported $4.4 billion in net income in 2022. Over the last 12 months, that figure has jumped to $53 billion -- an increase of some 1,200%.\n\nWhere will Nvidia's stock be in one year?\n\nSimply put, it's difficult to know where Nvidia's stock will be, because Nvidia's revenue and earnings growth are so incredibly high. If the company meets or beats expectations, its stock will soar even higher; if it misses those expectations, its stock could plummet.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, long-term investors should do their best to put those considerations to one side. Ultimately, the key fact about Nvidia is that its products are the premier choice for developers who are leading humanity through its latest technological revolution.\n\nThere are likely to be ups and downs along the way, but Nvidia remains a solid long-term stock to own because of its key place within the ongoing AI revolution. So far, that has carried the company to within a whisper of being the world's most valuable company. Over the next year, I believe the stock will establish itself at the top of the list.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

This legislation, under the CHIPS Act, aims to prevent delays from additional federal reviews, ensuring projects comply with existing regulations. These efforts highlight the government’s commitment to bolstering the semiconductor supply chain and maintaining the U.S.’s competitive edge in the global market.\n\nStory continues\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

The Stoxx 600 index closed down 0.80%, with most major markets finishing in negative territory. Across European sectors, performance was mixed. Media stocks gained 1.46%, while oil and gas stocks fell 3.24%, following declines in the oil market.\n\nChina: Shares drop with weak export numbers\r\nChinese stocks declined as investors reacted to the absence of any new substantial stimulus measures, coupled with disappointing export data. Exports grew just 2.4% year-over-year in September, significantly below the anticipated 6%, according to figures released late Monday. The CSI 300 index, which represents the 300 largest companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, dropped 2.66%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 3.67%.\n\nJapan: Nvidia pulls up semiconductor shares\r\nThe Nikkei 225 climbed 0.77%, briefly reaching a three-month high, driven by gains in technology and financial stocks. Nvidia's strong performance lifted semiconductor-related companies such as Tokyo Electron and Advantest, which saw increases of 4.49% and 3.37% respectively. Softbank, the majority owner of chip giant Arm Holdings, surged 5.76%. Additionally, the weak yen, which benefits Japanese exporters, provided further support to Nikkei stocks.\n\nAnd earnings season continues… \r\nMorgan Stanley reports Wednesday; Netflix has its turn Thursday; and Friday features P&G and American Express.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Jim Cramer on NVIDIA (NVDA): ‘I Have Never Seen’ a Company With Such Demand for Its Products",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer during his October 14 program on CNBC looked excited as he celebrated the rebound of major tech stocks, saying these companies are showing their “staying power” despite the odds.\n\n“We’re back. That’s right. Whatever you want to call them, these big tech plays are demonstrating their staying power no matter what happens.”\n\nCramer said that the latest earnings season would be critical for the overall market and investor portfolios. He also pointed out the broadening of the rally, saying other groups besides the tech industry are also rebounding.\n\n“This rally is not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can work, too, in this market. There’s a lot of money going around, and we know there’s a lot of money coming into the market. The Fed is cutting rates, and friendly cash won’t be worth as much as it was. But the staying power of the Magnificent 7 is truly unbelievable.”\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 important stocks he’s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nTalking about Nvidia in a latest program on CNBC, Jim Cramer talked about the much-awaited Blackwell chips:\n\n“They are so powerful, so fast. These guys basically invented a chip that is so quick that it created the entire AI business out of thin air. It wasn’t possible before, but now it can do incredible things, and very soon it will be both faster and better.”\n\nCramer also talked about the demand NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is seeing:\n\n“I’ve never seen a company have such demand for its products, including demand from Tesla, which needs NVIDIA for self-driving cars.”\n\nNvidia’s declines after the Q2 results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\n\nAt Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\n\nOf course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\n\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Over the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA’s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA’s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Nvidia vs. Palantir: Which Is the Better Red-Hot AI Stock?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) have been two of 2024’s hottest stocks — Nvidia’s 179.6% year-to-date gain has made it the second-most valuable company in the world by market cap, while Palantir’s 153.3% gain has put it on the map as a mega-cap tech stock to be reckoned with, not to mention a new member of the S&P 500 (SPX).\n\nBoth stocks have benefitted from being key players in the AI revolution. Both companies have exciting futures ahead of them, but there is a key difference between the two that makes one the more compelling opportunity at this point in time. Which looks like the better choice for investors right now?\n\nMassive Gap in Valuation on a Price-to-Earnings Basis\n\nNvidia’s 2024 surge has taken it to a relatively high valuation multiple of 47.5 times January 2025 earnings estimates. The S&P 500 trades at 24.7 times earnings, meaning that Nvidia is nearly twice as expensive as the broader market.\n\nHowever, with consensus earnings per share projected to grow to $4.01 per share for the fiscal year ending in January 2026, Nvidia looks quite a bit more palatable at 33.6 times forward earnings. While this is still fairly expensive, it’s starting to look reasonable enough for a mega-cap powerhouse projected to grow earnings per share by over 40% for the year. While Nvidia sometimes catches flack from value-oriented investors for its above-average price-to-earnings multiple, Palantir is even more expensive.\n\nThe massive 153% YTD gain has pushed shares of Palantir to an incredible valuation of 122.4 times December 2024 earnings estimates. This is more than double Nvidia’s valuation and roughly five times the broader market. With the stock expected to grow earnings per share by 19.4% to $0.43 per share for December 2025, the stock’s valuation comes down a bit but is still trading at an exorbitant triple-digit multiple of 100.8 times forward earnings.\n\nLooking Beyond Price-to-Earnings\n\nPlus, it’s not just price-to-earnings that makes Palantir look significantly more expensive than Nvidia. When looking at the two stocks on a price-to-sales basis, a popular metric often used for evaluating high-growth names like technology stocks and software stocks, Palantir trades at an astronomical price-to-sales ratio of 35.3, while Nvidia trades for a high but comparatively cheaper 26.3 times sales.\n\nWhat About the PEG Ratio?\n\nLastly, it’s worth comparing the two stocks based on their PEG ratios (price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio), a popular valuation metric useful for evaluating growth stocks like Nvidia and Palantir by accounting for earnings growth. PEG ratio is calculated by taking a stock’s price-to-earnings ratio and dividing it by its earnings growth rate. The lower the PEG ratio, the better a stock looks by this measure. Investors and analysts who utilize this metric typically view a PEG ratio of 1.0x or less to be undervalued.\n\nSo, how do Nvidia and Palantir stack up on this basis? Nvidia’s PEG ratio of 1.8 is a bit higher than ideal but not prohibitive. On the other hand, Palantir trades at a significantly higher PEG ratio of 10.4, indicating that it is likely overvalued even when accounting for its earnings growth.\n\nPalantir is no doubt an exciting company, but it’s hard to sustain a valuation multiple like this, and it leaves little room for error — if the company falls short of analyst expectations or hits any speed bumps, shares could tumble quickly.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, NVDA earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months. The average NVDA stock price target of $152.86 implies 10.7% upside potential from current levels.\n\nSee more NVDA analyst ratings\n\nIs PLTR Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, PLTR earns a Hold consensus rating based on four Buys, six Holds, and six Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average PLTR stock price target of $27.67 implies 36.2% downside potential from current levels.\n\nSee more PLTR analyst ratings\n\nSmarten Up\n\nWall Street analysts are far more constructive on Nvidia, and so is TipRanks’ proprietary Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. Scores of eight, nine, or 10 are considered equivalent to an Outperform rating. Scores of four, five, six, or seven are considered Neutral, and scores of three or below are considered equivalent to an Underperform rating.\n\nNvidia boasts an Outperform-equivalent Smart Score of 9.\n\nMeanwhile, Palantir receives a far less favorable Neutral Smart Score of 4.\n\nNvidia Is the Clear Choice\n\nNVDA and PLTR are both high-flying AI stocks, and both are projected to grow earnings significantly in the year ahead. However, Nvidia is projected to grow earnings more than twice as much as Palantir. Despite this, Nvidia shares trade for a far cheaper valuation multiple. Nvidia is often criticized as an ‘expensive’ stock, but its forward earnings multiple is just a third of Palantir’s double-digit valuation, making it look downright cheap in comparison.\n\nPlus, sell-side analysts rate Nvidia a Strong Buy and see an upside of 10.7% over the next 12 months, while they are considerably more cautious towards Palantir, rating it a Hold and forecasting a potential downside of 36.4% from current levels. This disparity in analyst views is another strong point in favor of Nvidia.\n\nI’m bullish on Nvidia based on its significantly cheaper valuation and superior earnings growth, making it the clear-cut winner in this comparison of high-profile AI stocks. For investors looking to capitalize on the generative AI wave, Nvidia continues to look like a smart choice.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why AMD (AMD) Stock Is Down Today",
        "content": "Why AMD (AMD) Stock Is Down Today\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nShares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 5.5% in the morning session as semiconductor stocks fell after ASML, the biggest supplier of equipment used in making advanced chips, pre-announced weak earnings. ASML expects fiscal year 2025 sales to come in between 30 billion euros and 35 billion euros, at the lower half of the range it had previously provided. Similarly, bookings for the quarter are reportedly below expectations. Reuters noted that the quarterly earnings numbers were mistakenly published a day earlier than expected.\n\nManagement noted that while the potential in the AI (artificial intelligence) market remained strong, other markets were taking too long to recover, with the observed trend expected to continue into 2025.\n\nLastly, ASML's CFO Roger Dassen projected China's contribution to overall revenue to be around 20% (down from the recent estimate of 49%), hinting at potential weakness in the region.\n\nASML's technology is used by chipmakers like Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and Samsung to make advanced chips, including those specially designed for AI workloads. Given the company's critical role in the semiconductor manufacturing process, the weak earnings and outlook could signal a possible softening in the industry.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy AMD? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nAMD’s shares are very volatile and have had 21 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock dropped 5.1% on the news that the company announced new data center AI chips (AMD Instinct MI325X Accelerators), barely a day after executives of rival Nvidia announced to Wall Street analysts that the Blackwell GPU (designed for AI workloads) products are \"booked out 12 months.\"\n\nAlso, AMD's new AI chip won't begin shipping until the first quarter of 2025. AMD's CEO Lisa Su touts her company’s new platform as superior to Nvidia's Blackwell when specific inference benchmarks are used.\n\nAMD is up 13.3% since the beginning of the year, but at $156.93 per share, it is still trading 25.8% below its 52-week high of $211.38 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $5,108.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Why Nvidia (NVDA) Shares Are Sliding Today\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nShares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 6.8% in the morning session as semiconductor stocks fell after ASML, the biggest supplier of equipment used in making advanced chips, pre-announced weak earnings. ASML expects fiscal year 2025 sales to come in between 30 billion euros and 35 billion euros, at the lower half of the range it had previously provided. Similarly, bookings for the quarter are reportedly below expectations. Reuters noted that the quarterly earnings numbers were mistakenly published a day earlier than expected.\n\nManagement noted that while the potential in the AI (artificial intelligence) market remained strong, other markets were taking too long to recover, with the observed trend expected to continue into 2025.\n\nLastly, ASML's CFO Roger Dassen projected China's contribution to overall revenue to be around 20% (down from the recent estimate of 49%), hinting at potential weakness in the region.\n\nASML's technology is used by chipmakers like Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and Samsung to make advanced chips, including those specially designed for AI workloads. Given the company's critical role in the semiconductor manufacturing process, the weak earnings and outlook could signal a possible softening in the industry.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nNvidia’s shares are very volatile and have had 24 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 26 days ago when the stock gained 5.2% as markets roared back after an initially muted response to the Fed's rate cut, which sparked a renewed appetite for risk assets. While investors were expecting a reduction in rates from the US central bank, there was a bit of back and forth on whether the cut would be 25bps (a quarter percent) or 50bps (half a percent). The Fed ended up slashing its policy rate by 50bps (0.5%) to 4.75%-5.00%. This marks the first rate reduction in roughly four years.\n\nThe Fed--under Chair Jerome Powell--began raising rates to tackle inflation coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic when a confluence of supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending caused inflation to run hot. Looking forward, the Fed signaled that more cuts are possible in 2024/25.\n\nStory continues\n\nPutting it all together, the announcement and outlook provided a breath of fresh air and a clearer view of the Fed's monetary policy stance, which the market has been waiting for with bated breath. If there's anything the market doesn't like, it's uncertainty.\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. The result of lower interest rates, all else equal, is higher stock valuations. This is especially true for higher-growth stocks such as those in the technology sector, where the current value depends more on cash flows many years out in the future.\n\nNvidia is up 174% since the beginning of the year, and at $131.93 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $138.07 from October 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $26,870.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Dow and other major indexes experienced losses Tuesday afternoon as chipmakers struggled amid news of potential export caps.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 118 points, or 0.28%, to 42,939. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 shed 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively.\n\nShares of Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML (ASML) plummeted following the company’s disappointing third-quarter bookings and a downward revision of its 2025 guidance. During afternoon trading, ASML’s stock dropped by more than 16%, reflecting investors’ concerns about the company’s outlook.\n\n“While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover,” CEO Christophe Fouquet said in the company’s earnings report. “It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.”\n\nASML is the only company in the world that makes the equipment needed for advanced chip manufacturing, and nearly half of ASML’s revenue for the second quarter came from sales to China. However, due to export restrictions from the U.S. and the Netherlands, the company is now facing a more challenging business outlook in China.\n\nNvidia stock falls as the U.S. eyes AI chip export limits\n\nShares of Nvidia (NVDA) fell over 5% Tuesday, a day after after closing at a record high. The chipmaker’s stock was down less than 1% in pre-market trading, but had fallen by about 5% by midday.\n\nThe drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD), to countries in the Middle East, citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAmong major semiconductor stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell by 4.9%, Micron Technology (MU) declined by 3.5%, and Broadcom (AVGO) decreased by 3.5% on Tuesday.\n\n–Britney Nguyen contributed to this article\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Shares in Nvidia, the world’s second most valuable company worth $3.2 trillion (£2.45 trillion), dropped by more than 5pc - Tyrone Siu\n\nHundreds of billions of dollars have been wiped from the stocks of global chipmakers after a key supplier to the industry warned of a slow recovery in the market, despite booming demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nShares in Dutch technology business ASML, which manufactures advanced lithography machines used by the world’s chipmakers, plunged by 15pc after it published its results a day early, blaming a technical error.\n\nIn the announcement, ASML warned that it did not expect its sales to recover until 2025. “It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected. This is expected to continue in 2025,” said Christophe Fouquet, ASML’s chief executive.\n\nThe warning sent shockwaves through the company’s peers. ASML, which is listed in Amsterdam and New York, is seen as a bellwether of the microchip sector, with its advanced machines used to develop the world’s most powerful semiconductors.\n\nShares in Nvidia, the world’s second most valuable company worth $3.2 trillion (£2.45 trillion), dropped by more than 5pc, wiping roughly $160bn from its market capitalisation. Shares in Arm, the British semiconductor design company, fell by 7pc.\n\nSemiconductor stocks have been riding high on hopes of a glut of sales fuelled by interest in AI technology.\n\nHowever, while these cutting-edge microchips remain in high demand, the wider sector has experienced tepid sales, with weaker demand for consumer technology and electric vehicles, which rely on mass-produced semiconductor chips.\n\n“While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover,” Mr Fouquet said.\n\nASML said it expected total net sales in 2025 of between €30bn and  €35bn, at the lower end of Wall Street expectations.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:33 PM BST\n\nSigning off...\n\nThanks for joining us today.\n\nWe will be back on the Markets blog tomorrow morning but do keep up with all our latest business news, analysis and comment over the weekend here.\n\n06:03 PM BST\n\nSemiconductor stocks hit by supplier warning\n\nSemiconductor stocks have slumped after a warning from a crucial supplier, ASML.

even if at the slowest possible pace, but are unlikely to prevent the European Central Bank from delivering an interest rate cut, which is now almost fully priced in.\n\nIndustrial production rose by 1.8pc on the month in August, a touch ahead of expectations, and was up 0.1pc from a year earlier, driven by rising demand for capital and durable consumer goods, Eurostat said.\n\nOutput in Germany, the bloc’s biggest economy, surged more than 3pc on the month, the biggest rise among the bloc’s larger economies, even if the annualised figure was still deeply negative.\n\nHigh energy costs, lukewarm demand from China and increased competition from other producers have weakened Germany’s industry in recent years, prompting some soul searching over the viability of the country’s industry-focused economic model.\n\nIn another mildly hopeful sign for Germany, investor morale improved more than expected in October with the ZEW economic sentiment index rising to 13.1 points from 3.6 points in September.\n\nExpectations for low and stable inflation, bets on further rate cuts and some mild improvement in export demand all contributed to the better sentiment reading, the ZEW said.\n\n📈 Die #ZEWKonjunkturerwartungen verbessern sich im Oktober 2024. „Dazu beigetragen haben die Erwartung stabiler Inflationsraten und die damit verbundene Aussicht auf weitere #Zinssenkungen

growth\n\nThe pound has edged higher against the dollar as figures showed wages rose at the slowest pace in four years in the three months to August.\n\nSterling gained 0.1pc to $1.307 and was also up 0.1pc against the euro, which is worth 83.4p.\n\nTotal pay rose 3.8pc in the three months to August, the ONS said, which cemented bets that the Bank of England will cut interest rates as planned next month and deliver a boost to the economy.\n\n10:20 AM BST\n\nGlobal public debt to exceed $100 trillion for first time\n\nThe world’s total public debt is on track to exceed $100 trillion (£76.5 trillion) this year for the first time, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.\n\nThe Washington-based financial agency warned that global government debt could balloon more quickly than forecast amid slow growth and pressure for higher spending.\n\nThe IMF’s latest Fiscal Monitor report showed global public debt will reach 93pc of global gross domestic product by the end of 2024 and approach 100pc by 2030.\n\nIt peaked at 99pc during the pandemic.\n\nThe IMF’s concerns about rising debt levels comes three weeks before a US presidential election in which both candidates have promised new tax breaks and spending that could add trillions of dollars to federal deficits.\n\nThe UK’s public sector net debt excluding banks hit 100pc of GDP at the end of August, and stands at mroe than £2.5 trillion.\n\n10:06 AM BST\n\nBank note maker poised for break-up after sale of authentications business\n\nBank note producer De La Rue has agreed to sell its authentications business for £300m, paving the way for the wider group’s breakup and sale. \r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the London-listed company said it was selling the division to American rival NXT Crane and would use the proceeds to pay off debts and reduce its pension fund deficit. \r\n\r\nThe deal comes as the remaining rump of De La Rue, its currency business, is also up for sale - meaning that could also be snapped up imminently. \r\n\r\nShares in the company surged 26.6pc after the announcement.\n\n09:50 AM BST\n\nReeves ‘talking down’ property market ahead of Budget, says housebuilder\n\nRachel Reeves has been “talking down” Britain’s property market by raising fears about tax rises ahead of the Budget, the boss of housebuilder Bellway has said.\n\nJason Honeyman, chief executive of the FTSE 250 developer, said there is “hesitancy in the market at the moment” despite the Government’s pledge to build 1.5m homes over the next five years.\n\nHe said industry had faced “mixed messages” because the Government’s growth agenda has been “damped a bit by talking down the market”.\n\n“We have many customers who have got concerns about the October Budget . . . so they are delaying decisions,” he told the Financial Times.\n\nRachel Reeves is expected to raise taxes in the Budget on October 30 after repeatedly talking about the need to fill a £22bn “black hole” in the public finances. Bellway chief executive Jason Honeyman said Rachel Reeves has ‘talked down’ the UK property market ahead of the Budget - JOHN GILLENDER\n\n09:36 AM BST\n\nOil demand faces ‘sharp slowdown’, says IEA\n\nThe world faces a “sizeable surplus” of oil supply in the new year amid weak demand and surging production, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nDemand for oil faces a “sharp slowdown” from the period immediately after the pandemic as China’s economy struggles.\n\nThe world’s second largest economy accounted for about 20pc of global gains in demand both this year and next year, compared to almost 70pc in 2023.\n\nGlobal oil demand is expected to grow by just under 900,000 barrels per day in 2024 and by around 1m barrels per day in 2025, which is significantly lower than the 2m barrels per day seen in 2023.\n\nThe IEA said that exports from Iran and neighbouring countries have been “unaffected” by the conflict in the Middle East, but admitted the “market remains on tenterhooks, awaiting the next developments in the crisis”.\n\nIt said: “Heightened oil supply security concerns are set against a backdrop of a global market that – as we have been highlighting for some time – looks adequately supplied.”\n\nIt added: “For now, supply keeps flowing, and in the absence of a major disruption, the market is faced with a sizeable surplus in the new year.” The United States, Brazil, Guyana and Canada are set to account for most of the increase in oil production, according to the IEA - REUTERS/David McNew\n\n09:11 AM BST\n\nFTSE slumps amid falling oil prices\n\nThe FTSE 100 opened lower as heavyweight oil stocks were hit by a sharp drop in the price of Brent crude.\n\nThe UK’s blue chip index was down 0.4pc, while the mid-cap index FTSE 250 was flat.\n\nOil stocks lost as much as 3.2pc and were the worst performers across the two indexes. Crude prices slid on the back of weaker demand outlook and after a report that Israel has assured the US that it will not strike Iranian oil facilities.\n\nIndustrial metal miners shed as much as 2.6pc as copper prices were pressured by a firmer US dollar and uncertainty about top consumer China’s economic recovery.\n\nAmong stocks, Bellway rose to the top of the FTSE 250, gaining 8.3pc after the homebuilder said it expects to build more homes in the 2025 financial year, buoyed by prospects of further reductions in borrowing costs.\n\nParagon Banking Group lost as much as 7pc after Jefferies downgraded the stock to “hold” from “buy”.\n\n09:05 AM BST\n\nStarmer refuses to rule out raising employers’ NI contributions\n\nThe Prime Minister again declined to rule out increasing employers’ national insurance contributions but insisted the Government would keep its manifesto promises.\n\nSir Keir Starmer told the BBC: “We were very clear in the manifesto that we wouldn’t be increasing tax on working people and we expressly said that that was income tax, that was NICs etc.”\n\nHe added: “It wasn’t just the manifesto, we said it repeatedly in the campaign and we intend to keep the promises that we made in our manifesto.\n\n“So I’m not going to reveal to you the details of the Budget, you know that that’s not possible at this stage.\n\n“What I will say is where we made promises in our manifesto, we will be keeping those promises.” The Prime Minister speaks outside Downing Street - Hollie Adams/Bloomberg\n\n08:53 AM BST\n\nRobert Walters cuts 700 jobs as job vacancies fall\n\nOne of Britain’s largest recruitment companies has cut more than 700 jobs over the last year amid a dwindling number of job vacancies in the economy.\n\nRobert Walters revealed it has reduced its headcount by 159 people over the last three months to 3,466, taking its total number of job losses over the last year to 734.\n\nIt comes as official figures show job vacancies fell by 34,000 to 841,000 in the three months to September, which is the lowest level since March to May 2021.\n\nRobert Walters shares were down 2.3pc as it said net fee income was down 12pc to £79.9m in the third quarter compared to last year. It is down 13pc so far this year to 246m.\n\nChief executive Toby Fowlston said:\n\nGlobal hiring markets remained challenging during the third quarter, bringing the period of rebasing following the 2022 post-pandemic peak to around two years.\n\nAs set out at our half-year results in August, our assumption continues to be that material improvement in client and candidate confidence levels will be gradual and not likely to commence until 2025.\n\nThough market conditions mean second half fee income is unlikely to exceed that seen during the first half, the programme of actions underway mean we continue to aim for a profitable full-year outcome.\n\n08:25 AM BST\n\nOil prices drop as Israel ‘tells Biden it will avoid Iranian plants’\n\nOil prices have dropped at their sharpest pace in a month after reports that Benjamin Netanyahu had told Joe Biden he would not strike Iran’s crude or nuclear facilities in retaliation for a missile attack earlier this month.\n\nBrent crude has slumped 3.6pc towards $74 a barrel after the Washington Post reported that the Israeli Prime Minister had pledged to target Iran’s military rather than its oil and nuclear sector.\n\nUS-produced West Texas Intermediate was down 3.7pc towards $71.\n\nThe sell-off came as the commodity is also hit by worries about China’s economic outlook after Beijing failed to announce any new stimulus at a weekend briefing.\n\nKathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said:” The price of oil has been volatile in recent weeks, as it gets jostled around by news flow surrounding the Middle East crisis.\n\n“The latest news suggests that Israel will not directly target Iran, and so an escalation premium is being removed from the oil price right now.\n\n“This could hit the FTSE 100’s oil companies later today, and the energy sector could extend its decline after it was one of the weakest performers on Monday.”\n\n08:15 AM BST\n\nBellway surges as it expects to build more homes\n\nHousebuilder Bellway expects to complete more homes this year as falling mortgage rates boost demand.\n\nThe Newcastle-based developer’s shares jumped 6.4pc in early trading as it said its forward order book has increased to 5,144 homes from 4,411 homes at the same period of last year.\n\nAs a result, Bellway said it is targeting at least 8,500 house completions this financial year, which would be an 11pc rise on the previous one.\n\nThe company revealed profits tumbled by more than half over the last year after lower orders for new homes in the face of more expensive mortgage rates.\n\nRates rocketed after interest rates were hiked to a peak of 5.25pc - their highest for 15 years - and remained at this level until the first cut by the Bank of England in August this year.\n\nRevenues fell by 30.1pc to £2.4bn for the year to July 31, compared with the previous year.\n\nHouse constructions also dropped by 30.1pc to 7,654 homes for the year, driven by a weak order book at the start of the year.\n\nPre-tax profits plunged by 62pc to £183.7m for the year.\n\n08:06 AM BST\n\nUK markets flat as wage growth slumps\n\nThe FTSE 100 has opened flat despite weakening wage growth paving the way for the Bank of England to cut interest rates next month.\n\nThe UK’s blue chip index was little changed at 8,291.60 as trading began in London, while the midcap FTSE 250 was flat at 20,815.16.\n\n08:01 AM BST\n\nReeves could pull ‘wildcard’ that impacts rate cuts, warns Charles Stanley\n\nRob Morgan, chief investment analyst at wealth manager Charles Stanley, said:\n\nThe Chancellor could be about to throw a wildcard into the mix. Taxation policies could have a major influence on both wages and wider inflation, so all eyes are on the Budget later this month.\n\nIf rumours are to be believed surrounding an increase to employer national insurance, wage rises could be curtailed going forward as bosses attempt to limit the impact of paying higher staff costs.\n\nWith inflation still not entirely snuffed out this could ramp up the cost-of-living pressures on working families.\n\nHowever, the effects are not clear cut. Employers consider the total cost of an employee, which includes employer NICs and pension contributions. If these were to increase it could lead to businesses restricting new hires, limiting pay rises or scaling back pension payments.\n\nYet some may instead look to pass these costs on in terms of higher prices. This would be inflationary rather than disinflationary, but it may be difficult in a competitive market.\n\nOverall, a fiscally tight Budget is likely to dampen inflationary pressures by curbing household spending.\n\n07:50 AM BST\n\nWeaker wage growth ‘supports case for rate cuts’\n\nThe Bank of England is more likely to cut interest rates after the latest figures showed wages growing at their slowest pace in four years, economists have said.\n\nMoney markets are betting there is more than a 92pc chance that policymakers will cut the Bank Rate from 5pc to 4.75pc at the next meeting in November.\n\nAshley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: “The further fall in wage growth in August, together with some signs that the labour market continued to loosen gradually, adds further support to widespread expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates.”\n\nJake Finney, economist at PwC UK, said: “A quarter-point cut in November still seems most likely, given signs that wage growth is moderating and increasingly dovish commentary from governor Andrew Bailey.”\n\nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK said the “encouraging labour market data clears path for an interest rate cut”.\n\nShe added: “Today’s data will reassure the Bank of England that the risk of wage growth remaining persistent is receding.\n\n“With the economy set to slow in the coming months, this is likely to add further downward pressure on labour market activity.  We anticipate it will enable the MPC to cut interest rates in the upcoming November meeting.”\n\nA largely encouraging UK jobs report with regular pay growth back below 5% for the first time since mid-2022 -giving support to BoE committee members looking for evidence to support a second cut in Bank Rate in November.

        "title": "Why Nvidia, AMD, Arm Holdings, and Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Sank on Tuesday",
        "content": "Since early last year, investors have been bullish about the potential of artificial intelligence (AI), scooping up shares of companies best positioned to profit from this next-generation technology. However, as the bull market crosses the two-year mark, many are taking a step back to survey the landscape, and some are looking for any excuse to take profits.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, chip designer Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) slumped 6.7%, AI chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) tumbled 4.9%, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) sank 4.8%, semiconductor device supplier Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) fell 3.7%, and chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) dipped 2.6%, as of 12:50 p.m. ET on Tuesday.\n\nThe catalyst that sent these AI stocks lower were reports the U.S. government is considering new curbs on chip exports. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA curb on exports?\n\nThe Biden administration is considering limiting sales of advanced AI processors from Nvidia, AMD, and other companies, according to a report that first appeared in Bloomberg, citing \"people familiar with the matter.\" This would mark the most recent step by regulators to address concerns that advanced technology like AI could be used against the U.S. and its interests.\n\nThe government is discussing a cap on the number of export licenses for certain countries, citing national security as the reason for the potential move. It's worth noting that the U.S. already has strict limits on the level of AI chip technology it allows to be sold to some countries, including China and 40 other countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nCurrently, U.S. chipmakers are required to obtain government licenses to sell advanced semiconductors to customers in certain countries. The current deliberations would extend the existing curbs, which might be set on a country-by-country basis, with an emphasis on countries within the Persian Gulf region.\n\nThe considerations are still in the early stages, and no final decision has been reached, but the plans have been \"gaining traction in recent weeks,\" according to the report.\n\nThe potential implications\n\nLimiting the sales of advanced AI chips to certain countries has potential implications for all of these AI-centric stocks:\n\nNvidia is the leading provider of the graphics processing units (GPUs) used to facilitate AI systems. The company controls as much as 98% of the data center GPU market, according to semiconductor analyst firm TechInsights. As such, it has the most to lose. AMD has long battled with Nvidia for GPU supremacy and has recently decided to prioritize AI processors, with its legacy gaming chips taking a back seat. Curbs on advanced processors could dent those ambitions. Arm Holdings provides the intellectual property and chip designs used for some of the world's most advanced chips, including those used by Nvidia and AMD. If sales of these processors are severely curbed, Arm Holdings' revenue could take a hit. Broadcom provides a number of products that work side by side with GPUs in the data center, including Ethernet switching and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), to accelerate the movement of data. If sales of GPUs falter, sales of complementary products like Broadcom's could suffer as well. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, also called TSMC, is the world's leading foundry, responsible for 62% of the world's semiconductors and an estimated 90% of the advanced processors used for AI. Any curbs on the sale of processors would trickle down to TSMC, crimping its revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile investors fear a hit to Nvidia's (and others') sales, history suggests they may be overreacting. There were similar concerns on multiple other occasions when the U.S. government considered or announced curbs on chips to countries like China. Despite those fears, Nvidia went on to generate triple-digit growth for five consecutive quarters. Furthermore, recent reports suggest the company's Blackwell chips are sold out for the next 12 months. This suggests that, potential curbs aside, demand for AI chips remains robust.\n\nThen, there are valuations to consider. Arm Holdings, AMD, Nvidia, Broadcom, and TSMC are selling for 96 times, 46 times, 46 times, 36 times, and 28 times forward earnings, respectively. For those looking for a good value, TSMC is likely the only one worth buying, but this doesn't account for the accelerating growth trajectory resulting from AI. Using the more appropriate forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which factors in that growth -- reveals that each of the remaining stocks boasts a multiple of less than 1, the standard for undervalued stocks.\n\nIt's still early days for the adoption of generative AI, and while some experts peg the market value at $1.3 trillion, others believe the total could be much higher. For investors looking to profit from AI, the best strategy is to buy the best AI stocks you can find and hold tight for the long term.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "NVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA GB200 NVL72 Design Contributions and NVIDIA Spectrum-X to Help Accelerate Next Industrial Revolution\n\nNVIDIA GB200 NVL72 Rack NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 Rack\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  OCP Global Summit—To drive the development of open, efficient and scalable data center technologies, NVIDIA today announced that it has contributed foundational elements of its NVIDIA Blackwell accelerated computing platform design to the Open Compute Project (OCP) and broadened NVIDIA Spectrum-X™ support for OCP standards.\n\nAt this year’s OCP Global Summit, NVIDIA will be sharing key portions of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system electro-mechanical design with the OCP community — including the rack architecture, compute and switch tray mechanicals, liquid-cooling and thermal environment specifications, and NVIDIA NVLink™ cable cartridge volumetrics — to support higher compute density and networking bandwidth.\n\nNVIDIA has already made several official contributions to OCP across multiple hardware generations, including its NVIDIA HGX™ H100 baseboard design specification, to help provide the ecosystem with a wider choice of offerings from the world’s computer makers and expand the adoption of AI.\n\nIn addition, expanded NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform alignment with OCP Community-developed specifications enables companies to unlock the performance potential of AI factories deploying OCP-recognized equipment while preserving their investments and maintaining software consistency.\n\n“Building on a decade of collaboration with OCP, NVIDIA is working alongside industry leaders to shape specifications and designs that can be widely adopted across the entire data center,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “By advancing open standards, we’re helping organizations worldwide take advantage of the full potential of accelerated computing and create the AI factories of the future.”\n\nAccelerated Computing Platform for the Next Industrial Revolution\r\nNVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform was designed to power a new era of AI.\n\nGB200 NVL72 is based on the NVIDIA MGX™ modular architecture, which enables computer makers to quickly and cost-effectively build a vast array of data center infrastructure designs.\n\nThe liquid-cooled system connects 36 NVIDIA Grace™ CPUs and 72 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs in a rack-scale design. With a 72-GPU NVIDIA NVLink domain, it acts as a single, massive GPU and delivers 30x faster real-time trillion-parameter large language model inference than the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU.\n\nThe NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform, which now includes the next-generation NVIDIA ConnectX-8 SuperNIC™, supports OCP’s Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI) and Software for Open Networking in the Cloud (SONiC) standards. This allows customers to use Spectrum-X’s adaptive routing and telemetry-based congestion control to accelerate Ethernet performance for scale-out AI infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nConnectX-8 SuperNICs feature accelerated networking at speeds of up to 800Gb/s and programmable packet processing engines optimized for massive-scale AI workloads. ConnectX-8 SuperNICs for OCP 3.0 will be available next year, equipping organizations to build highly flexible networks.\n\nCritical Infrastructure for Data Centers\r\nAs the world transitions from general-purpose to accelerated and AI computing, data center infrastructure is becoming increasingly complex. To simplify the development process, NVIDIA is working closely with 40+ global electronics makers that provide key components to create AI factories.\n\nAdditionally, a broad array of partners are innovating and building on top of the Blackwell platform, including Meta, which plans to contribute its Catalina AI rack architecture based on GB200 NVL72 to OCP. This provides computer makers with flexible options to build high compute density systems and meet the growing performance and energy efficiency needs of data centers.\n\n“NVIDIA has been a significant contributor to open computing standards for years, including their high-performance computing platform that has been the foundation of our Grand Teton server for the past two years,” said Yee Jiun Song, vice president of engineering at Meta. “As we progress to meet the increasing computational demands of large-scale artificial intelligence, NVIDIA’s latest contributions in rack design and modular architecture will help speed up the development and implementation of AI infrastructure across the industry.”\n\nLearn more about NVIDIA’s contributions to the Open Compute Project at the 2024 OCP Global Summit, taking place at the San Jose Convention Center from Oct. 15-17.\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\n\nFor further information, contact:\r\nKristin Uchiyama\r\nNVIDIA Corporation\r\n+1-408-313-0448\r\nkuchiyama@nvidia.com\n\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, and performance of NVIDIA’s products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA Blackwell accelerated computing platform, NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform, NVIDIA GB200 NVL72, NVIDIA NVLink, NVIDIA HGX H100, NVIDIA MGX modular architecture, NVIDIA Grace CPUs, NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU, and NVIDIA ConnectX-8 SuperNIC; NVIDIA contributing foundational elements of its NVIDIA Blackwell accelerated computing platform design to the Open Compute Project (OCP) and broaden NVIDIA Spectrum-X support for OCP standards; the benefits and impact of NVIDIA’s collaboration with third parties; third parties using or adopting our products or technologies; NVIDIA working alongside industry leaders to shape specifications and designs that can be widely adopted across the entire data center; by advancing open standards, NVIDIA helping organizations worldwide take advantage of the full potential of accelerated computing and create the AI factories of the future; as the world transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated and AI computing, data center infrastructure becoming increasingly complex; and the timing and themes of the 2024 OCP Global Summit are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

        "content": "ASML Holding (AS:ASML) shares plunged more than 13% Tuesday after the semiconductor equipment maker reported third-quarter results that fell short of analyst expectations, while its guidance disappointed investors.\n\nMore specifically, the stock was impacted by the company's Q3 net bookings miss and FY revenue guidance.\n\nASML posted Q3 adjusted earnings of €5.28 per share, missing the consensus estimate of €5.40. Revenue came in at €7.47 billion, below the expected €7.9 billion but up 19.6% YoY. The company's quarterly net bookings of €2.6 billion significantly missed estimates of €5.39 billion.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, ASML expects revenue between €8.8 billion and €9.2 billion, with a gross margin of 49% to 50%. The company expects its full-year 2024 revenue forecast to be around €28 billion.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, ASML projects revenue of €30 billion to €35 billion, the lower half of its previous guidance range, with gross margins of 51% to 53%, below prior expectations.\n\nCEO Christophe Fouquet cited a more gradual market recovery than anticipated, stating, \"While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover.\"\n\nThe company noted slower ramps of new nodes at certain customers in the Logic segment, leading to fab push-outs and changes in lithography demand timing, particularly for EUV systems. In Memory, ASML sees limited capacity additions, with a focus on AI-related technology transitions.\n\nASML declared an interim dividend of €1.52 per share, payable on November 7, 2024.\n\nElsewhere, names such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) (-4%) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) (-4.2%) have also declined following the ASML release.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nASML shares plunge as Q3 net bookings miss estimates, outlook disappoints\n\nPoland stocks lower at close of trade; WIG30 down 0.16%\n\nDenmark stocks lower at close of trade; OMX Copenhagen 20 down 1.59%\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia stock falls over 4% on news that U.S. could cap exports",
        "content": "Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) fell over 4% on Tuesday morning a day after after closing at a record high.\n\nThe chipmaker’s stock was down less than 1% in pre-market trading, but fell by around 4.4% after the market open. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD), to countries in the Middle East, citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported.\n\nEarlier this year, U.S. officials started slowing down the issuing of licenses to Nvidia, AMD, and other U.S. chipmakers for shipping large-scale AI accelerators to the Middle East, Bloomberg reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Dell (DELL) plans to ship computer servers with Nvidia’s Blackwell AI chips to select customers starting next month, with general availability slated for the start of next year, Arthur Lewis, president of Dell’s infrastructure unit, told Bloomberg.\n\nDell’s rollout shows production of Nvidia’s highly-anticipated Blackwell chips is on track after reports of delays earlier this year.\n\nNvidia’s shares have experienced some turbulence in recent months. In August, the chipmaker’s shares fell about 13% in pre-market trading after a report that its Blackwell chips were delayed due to design flaws.\n\nStill, Nvidia’s stock is up around 173% so far this year, and it remains the second-most valuable public company after Apple (AAPL). The company’s shares climbed 2.4% and closed at a record $138.07 on Monday, beating its previous record close of $135.58 on June 18 — a week after it initiated a 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nDuring Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings in August, CEO Jensen Huang said the company had shipped samples of Blackwell chips to customers during the period and that Blackwell’s production will ramp up in the fourth quarter into fiscal year 2026.\n\nTo “improve production yield,” Nvidia made a change to Blackwell’s GPU mask, the chipmaker said. However, “there were no functional changes necessary,” Huang said on a call with analysts.\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia’s stock rose after chief executive Jensen Huang said demand for Blackwell is “insane.”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "'Resilience Matters In Success,' Says Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Claims Him Having Low Expectations Gives Him An Advantage\n\nJensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), has an important message for anyone who wants success – resilience is more important than you think. Huang gave a tip that helped him succeed when he spoke at the 2024 SIEPR Economic Summit – have low expectations.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nBeating the market through ethical real estate investing' — this platform aims to give tenants equity in the homes they live in while scoring 17.17% average annual returns for investors – here’s how to join with just $100 ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\n“One of my great advantages is that I have low expectations,” Huang said. It might sound strange, but Huang thinks having low expectations helps build resilience, which he says is crucial for success. “People with very high expectations have very low resilience – and, unfortunately, resilience matters in success.”\n\nJensen Huang is clearly one of my favorite founder / CEOs ever now. \r\n\r\nThis guy's interviews are top tier. pic.twitter.com/hWCZU5g8Ui\n\n— tyler hogge (@thogge) March 13, 2024\n\nSee Also: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\n\nHuang’s life shows how true this is. He moved from Taiwan to the U.S. when he was nine years old, faced bullying at his school in Kentucky and started working as a busser at Denny’s when he was 15. At Denny’s, the idea for Nvidia – a company now worth $3.3 trillion – began to take shape.\n\nFrom washing dishes to leading one of the most valuable tech companies in the world, Huang says his journey was shaped by the challenges he faced and his determination to keep going even when things got tough.\n\nTrending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\n“I don’t know how to teach it to you except for I hope suffering happens to you,” Huang told Stanford students earlier this year, showing that he believes hardship is necessary to build character. He explained, “Greatness comes from character and character isn’t formed out of smart people. It’s formed out of people who suffered.”\n\nStory continues\n\nHuang also said that resilience isn’t just a personal trait – it is a big part of Nvidia’s culture. He often jokes with his team about “pain and suffering,” saying that he wants to build character within the company.\n\nSee Also: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\n\nAnd that’s why he said to the auditorium: “For all of you Stanford students, I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering.”\n\nEven with Nvidia’s incredible growth – including a stock increase of almost 200% in the past year and $30 billion in revenue last quarter – Huang stays humble. He often jokes about how he started just trying to be the best dishwasher at Denny’s, calling his journey “the most extraordinary thing that a normal dishwasher busser could grow up to be this.”\n\nIn a world where many people aim high and expect fast rewards, Huang's story reminds us that our experiences mold who we are. Because those experiences are what really lead to greatness, Huang suggests people keep their expectations reasonable but also develop perseverance and embrace difficult moments.\n\nRead Next:\n\nGroundbreaking trading app with a ‘Buy-Now-Pay-Later' feature for stocks tackles the $644 billion margin lending market – here’s how to get equity in it with just $500 This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "title": "These Are the 4 Hottest Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 This Year -- and Only One Is In the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Are They Still Buys?",
        "content": "The broader benchmark S&P 500 has ripped all year and is now up nearly 22%. The index is a bellwether for the entire market and includes 500 larger companies in many industries. Technically, the S&P 500 has more than 500 stocks because some companies have multiple classes of shares. With such a wide sample size, many stocks in the S&P 500 have performed worse than the broader index and many have performed better.\n\nHere are the four hottest stocks in the S&P 500 so far this year, and believe it or not, only one is in the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Can you still buy these stocks after such a good run?\n\n1. Vistra Corp -- 224%\n\nUtility stocks have had a bang-up year, as lower interest rates have led investors to gravitate toward dividend-paying stocks. However, something else has been fueling Vistra(NYSE: VST), the largest competitive power generator in the U.S. That, of course, is artificial intelligence. Interestingly, Vistra looks to be a potential \"picks and shovels\" trade for the AI sector, but in a very different way than semiconductors. AI is powered by data and data centers, which are very energy-intensive. Tech companies believe a good alternative could be to connect data centers to nuclear plants. Vistra owns four nuclear reactors after acquiring Energy Harbor in 2023.\n\n2. Nvidia -- 172%\n\nInvestors shouldn't be surprised to see this name on the list, considering it's been arguably the most talked about ticker in the investing world. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the classic \"picks and shovels\" play on AI, designing chips that make AI possible. Nvidia's chips are used by some of the world's largest and most innovative tech companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Some analysts estimate that Nvidia's market share for the AI semiconductors that helped make ChatGPT technology possible is between 70% and 95%. Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's revenue and profits have grown like a weed. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nPalantir -- 153%\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) went public during the pandemic in 2020, and it's been quite the ride ever since, with the stock up almost 370%. What does Palantir do? You guessed it: AI. Palantir uses AI to help people and organizations analyze vast quantities of data in a user-friendly way that doesn't require them to learn some of the more complex languages and techniques at the core of AI.\n\nPalantir has constructed platforms that use AI to manipulate and manage data. The company then builds applications atop these platforms so humans with no AI expertise can analyze this data. The company's largest client is the U.S. government, and it has gotten large contracts with the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Army.\n\nStory continues\n\nConstellation Energy -- 127%\n\nConstellation Energy(NASDAQ: CEG) is the largest carbon-free energy producer in the U.S. It's based in Baltimore and owns sustainable energy assets, including wind and solar farms and hydropower plants. Roughly 90% of the energy from Constellation is carbon-free, and the company is responsible for 10% of all carbon-free energy in the U.S. Constellation also owns 21 nuclear reactors at 12 sites across the country, making it the largest operator of nuclear reactors in the U.S. Investors believe it could be a critical asset in the future powering of data centers and AI.\n\nEarlier this year, Constellation's CEO Joe Dominguez cited AI as one of the industries it is seeing demand from in terms of nuclear energy. Constellation is projecting that major tech companies will invest $1 trillion in data centers over the next five years.\n\nAre these AI stocks buys?\n\nAI has driven stocks to meteoric valuations, and this sentiment can be seen in the current price-to-earnings ratios of these four stocks. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nAll these companies are compelling given what they do and the potential for AI to fundamentally shift almost every aspect of our lives. I've never been a huge growth investor who buys companies at massive valuations. That's because the margin for error gets slim, and a simple miss on earnings or disappointing guidance can send the stock tumbling.\n\nBut for long-term investors who can handle some volatility, I think all of these stocks offer promise. Of these four, I like the utility names like Constellation and Vistra better right now. They've gotten expensive as a group, but pay dividends and are not entirely dependent on AI. So they can benefit from the AI boom, but also have other sources of business to fall back on if AI stumbles.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Hypergrowth Stocks That Will Run Circles Around Nvidia Through 2030",
        "content": "Last week, Wall Street's bull market celebrated its two-year anniversary. Although a resilient U.S. economy and stock-split euphoria have played important roles in lifting all three major stock indexes to record highs, arguably nothing has been more pivotal to the success of equities than the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nThe ability for AI-driven software and systems to learn and evolve without the need for human intervention gives this technology seemingly limitless potential. Last year, the analysts at PwC pegged this global opportunity at $15.7 trillion by 2030 in their report, Sizing the Prize. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nConsidering the addressable market for AI, it's not surprising to see semiconductor titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)delivering record-breaking returns to its shareholders. Since 2023 began, shares of the company have catapulted more than 820%, with its market cap expanding by close to $3 trillion.\n\nHowever, near-parabolic moves higher -- especially for market-leading businesses -- are rarely, if ever, sustainable. It's my prediction that two other hypergrowth stocks have the tools and intangibles needed to run circles around Nvidia in the return column through 2030.\n\nHistory suggests Nvidia's historic run will come to an abrupt halt\n\nNvidia's claim to fame is its hardware. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have rapidly become a staple in AI-accelerated data centers. The semiconductor analysts at TechInsights estimate Nvidia accounted for 98% of GPU shipments to enterprise data centers in 2022 and 2023.\n\nThere's strong reason to believe Wall Street's AI darling retained the lion's share of AI-GPU shipments this year, as well. Orders for the ultra-popular H100 are backlogged, and CEO Jensen Huang recently called demand for the successor Blackwell chip, \"insane.\"\n\nBut there are challenges Nvidia is set to face that simply don't justify the company sustaining a nearly $3 trillion increase in market cap, let alone a higher valuation.\n\nHistory might be the biggest hurdle Nvidia will have to overcome. Including the advent of the internet, there hasn't been a next-big-thing technology or innovation for three decades that's avoided an early stage bubble. Investors have consistently overestimated the adoption of game-changing innovations and technologies, and there's nothing to suggest this won't be the case with artificial intelligence. If the AI bubble does burst, Nvidia's stock would undoubtedly be hit hard.\n\nThere are also competitive pressures that need to be taken into account. While it's a well-known fact that rivals like Advanced Micro Devices are ramping production of AI-GPUs and introducing new chips, the bigger threat to Nvidia's bottom line is likely to come from within.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's four-largest customers by net sales are all internally developing AI-GPUs for their data centers. Despite these chips being inferior to the computing capabilities of Nvidia's GPUs, they're going to be significantly cheaper and easier to access. Remember, Nvidia's chips are backlogged due to high demand. Internal AI-GPU development from the company's core customers likely means it'll lose out on valuable data center real estate in the years to come.\n\nNvidia's stock is currently priced for perfection in a world where things are rarely perfect. Instead of wagering on Nvidia's stock to head higher, I predict the following two hypergrowth stocks will eventually leave Wall Street's AI darling in the dust. Image source: Pinterest.\n\nPinterest\n\nThe first high-octane growth stock that can run circles about Nvidia in the return column through 2030 is social media platform Pinterest(NYSE: PINS).\n\nEven though ad-driven operating models are cyclical, which would expose Pinterest's stock and operating performance to downside during recessions, the economic cycle isn't linear. Whereas recessions are often resolved in less than 12 months, most economic expansions stick around for multiple years, if not a full decade, on rare occasions. Lengthy periods of growth tend to fuel ad spending.\n\nIn addition to time being squarely on its side, Pinterest's global monthly active user (MAU) count has been steadily climbing over the long run. Pinterest recorded its highest active user count (522 million) during the June-ended quarter. There aren't many social sites with over a half-billion MAUs, which acts as a dangling carrot for businesses looking to advertise. The more MAUs Pinterest has, the likelier it'll possess strong ad-pricing power.\n\nWhat's arguably even more important than attracting active users has been Pinterest's ability to monetize the users it has. Following a challenging 2023, which was primarily bogged down by economic uncertainty, average revenue per user (ARPU) is strongly climbing, once again. The June-ended quarter saw global ARPU jump 8%, with the strongest growth in ARPU (16% on a year-over-year basis) coming from its most lucrative markets, the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThis is also a good time to mention that Pinterest has perfectly positioned its operating model to avoid app-developer headwinds, such as the ability to disable data tracking. The entire premise of Pinterest's platform is for its users to willingly and freely share the things, places, and services that interest them. This is invaluable information that can help businesses target Pinterest's users -- and it's another reason companies will pay a premium to advertise with Pinterest.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is Pinterest's pristine balance sheet. It has north of $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, with no debt. This gives it the financial flexibility to weather a recession, as well as deliver shareholder-friendly buybacks.\n\nSentinelOne\n\nThe second hypergrowth stock that looks to be on track to handily outperform AI juggernaut Nvidia through 2030 is cybersecurity up-and-comer SentinelOne(NYSE: S).\n\nThe beautiful thing about cybersecurity is that it's steadily evolved into a basic necessity service. With businesses shifting their data, and that of their customers, online and into the cloud at an accelerated pace, they're increasingly leaning on third-party providers like SentinelOne to protect this information. Regardless of how well or poorly the global economy is performing, hackers don't take time off. This means demand for cybersecurity solutions is constant in pretty much any economic climate.\n\nThe company's Singularity platform, which is focused on endpoint, cloud, identity, and data protection services, is what makes the company tick. Singularity relies on AI and machine learning to become more effective at recognizing and responding to potential threats over time.\n\nOne factor undeniably working in the company's favor is its subscription-driven model. A subscription-focused cybersecurity model tends to keep clients loyal to the brand, as well as generates highly predictable sales and operating cash flow year after year. Annual recurring revenue (ARR) for the company's fiscal second quarter (ended July 31) surged 32%, while adjusted gross margin jumped three percentage points to a delectable 80%.\n\nSentinelOne is also demonstrating a knack for landing bigger fish. The number of customers generating at least $100,000 in ARR jumped 24% to 1,233 from the prior-year period, while customers producing $1 million in ARR for the company grew at an even faster pace. Larger clients should lead to higher margins and steadier cash-flow generation.\n\nSimilar to Pinterest, SentinelOne is sitting on a hefty treasure chest. Inclusive of short- and long-term investments, it's sitting on more than $1.1 billion in cash, with no debt. It has more than enough capital to continue innovating, and has the ability to confidently navigate short-lived recessions.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that SentinelOne is expected to push into recurring profitability during the current fiscal year. Given Wall Street's forecast of 40% annualized earnings growth for the company through fiscal 2029, it has all the hallmarks of a no-brainer buy that can run circles around Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before Oct. 17?",
        "content": "There's no denying the growing chorus of experts suggesting that artificial intelligence (AI) will change just about everything. Some veteran analysts and tech aficionados have gone so far as to suggest we're in the throes of the fourth industrial revolution. These sophisticated algorithms have the potential to dramatically increase productivity by automating time-consuming processes and streamlining a great many tasks.\n\nThere are plenty of companies that have profited from the accelerating adoption of AI, but arguably none more than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that provide the computational horsepower that makes AI possible. Simply put, these computer chips can conduct lightning-fast mathematical calculations, which enables the creation and running of complex AI models.\n\nThere have been any number of catalysts that sent the chipmaker higher, and this Thursday could mark yet another. Let's look at what's coming down the pike and whether it could signal (another) big move for Nvidia stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe writing is on the wall\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), commonly referred to as TSMC, is the world's largest contract semiconductor foundry and is responsible for the vast majority of AI chips, producing an estimated 90% of the world's most advanced processors. Nvidia ranks among TSMC's biggest customers, accounting for about 11% of the company's sales in 2023 -- though that number is likely higher now. As such, TSMC's performance will likely be a canary in the coal mine, providing insight into the trajectory of Nvidia's results.\n\nTSMC is scheduled to release its third-quarter financial report on Thursday, and the available evidence suggests the results will be robust.\n\nThe company provides a monthly revenue report, so we already have a pretty fair idea of how things are going. For the three months ended Sept. 30, the company generated revenue of NT$759.7 million (roughly $23.6 million), which represents growth of roughly 39% year over year, based on current exchange rates. For context, that's slightly ahead of analysts' consensus estimates of $23.09 billion, or growth of about 35%. It's also ahead of TSMC's own forecast, which called for $22.8 billion at the midpoint of its guidance.\n\nThe fact that TSMC will likely surpass the high end of its own guidance suggests the demand for chips that process AI remains robust -- which bodes well for Nvidia.\n\nThere's more. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been making the rounds on financial media, providing updates regarding the company's next-generation Blackwell architecture. \"Blackwell is in full production, Blackwell is as planned, and demand for Blackwell is insane,\" the chief executive said in a recent interview. Analysts from Morgan Stanley are projecting that Nvidia will generate $10 billion from Blackwell chips during the company's fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, which ends in late January.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you buy Nvidia stock before Oct. 17?\n\nThe available evidence suggests that demand for AI remains robust, and depending on what TSMC executives have to say on Thursday, it could potentially act as a catalyst for Nvidia -- but should investors buy the stock before Oct. 17?\n\nTruth be told, it really doesn't matter much if you buy Nvidia stock before or after TSMC reports. The stock closed at a new record high on Monday, pushing Nvidia's market cap to $3.4 trillion, bringing its gains over the past year to more than 200% (as of this writing). Taking a step back, the stock is up 32,770% over the past decade, which helps illustrate the benefit of buying quality stocks and holding them for the long term.\n\nTo be clear, Nvidia already has plenty of growth built in. The stock is currently trading for 65 times earnings, which is enough to send some investors running for the exits. However, analysts' consensus estimates are calling for earnings per share of $4.04 in Nvidia's fiscal 2026, which kicks off in January. That works out to a forward multiple of 34, which suggests the valuation isn't as egregious as it first appears.\n\nFurthermore, most experts believe it's still early days for the adoption of AI. The market value of generative AI is expected to be between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually over the next few years. As new applications emerge and the technology advances, those estimates could well be conservative.\n\nGiven the company's pivotal position in the AI revolution and its robust growth prospects, it doesn't matter if you buy Nvidia stock before or after Oct. 17 -- as long as you buy it.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Bank of America is expected to report a fall in third-quarter profit, Goldman Sachs is expected to see higher fees from advisory and underwriting services, and Citigroup and brokerage firm Charles Schwab also report earnings.\n\nKey for Europe among a batch of jobs and inflation data releases is the European Central Bank's survey on bank lending to the euro zone economy, which should feed into expectations for Thursday's policy review. The ECB is set to deliver another quarter-point rate cut on Thursday, a move policymakers were reluctant to flag and traders had given less than a 25% chance when the bank met a month ago.\n\nKey developments that could influence markets on Tuesday:\n\nEarnings: Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Charles Schwab, Citi\n\nEconomic data: UK jobs, France CPI, Eurozone industrial production, German ZEW economic sentiment, ECB bank lending survey\n\nGovt debt: Reopening of UK 30-year government debt auction\n\n(By Vidya Ranganathan; Editing by Edmund Klamann)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Biden administration officials have discussed capping sales of advanced AI chips from Nvidia Corp. and other American companies on a country-specific basis, people familiar with the matter said, a move that would limit some nations’ artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts\n\nThe new approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said.\n\nDeliberations are in early stages and remain fluid, the people said, noting that the idea has gained traction in recent weeks. The policy would build on a new framework to ease the licensing process for AI chip shipments to data centers in places like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Commerce Department officials unveiled those regulations last month and said there are more rules coming.\n\nThe agency’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which oversees export controls, declined to comment. Nvidia, the market leader for AI chips, also declined to comment, as did Advanced Micro Devices Inc. A representative for Intel Corp., which also makes such processors, didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.”\n\nSetting country-based caps would tighten restrictions that originally targeted China’s ambitions in artificial intelligence, as Washington considers the security risks of AI development around the world. Already, the Biden administration has restricted AI chip shipments by companies like Nvidia and AMD to more than 40 countries across the Middle East, Africa and Asia over fears their products could be diverted to China.\n\nAt the same time, some US officials have come to view semiconductor export licenses, particularly for Nvidia chips, as a point of leverage to achieve broader diplomatic goals. That could include asking key companies to reduce ties with China to gain access to US technology — but the concerns extend beyond Beijing.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We will have to have a conversation with countries around the world about how they plan to use these capabilities,” Tarun Chhabra, senior director of technology at the National Security Council, said at a forum in June without naming specific nations. “If you’re talking about countries that have a really robust internal surveillance apparatus, then we have to think about: How exactly will they use these capabilities to supercharge that kind of surveillance, and what will that look like?”\n\nThere’s also the question of how global AI development could affect American intelligence operations, said Maher Bitar, another NSC official. “What are the risks not just on human rights grounds, but also in terms of the security and the counterintelligence risks to our personnel around the world?” Bitar said at the same event.\n\nIt’s unclear how leading AI chipmakers would react to additional US restrictions. When the Biden administration first issued sweeping chip regulations for China, Nvidia redesigned its AI offerings to ensure it can keep selling into that market.\n\nIf the administration moves forward with country-based caps, it may prove difficult to deliver a comprehensive new policy in the final months of President Joe Biden’s term. Such rules could be challenging to enforce and would be a major test of US diplomatic relationships.\n\nWATCH: Nvidia's Surprising AI Origin Story\n\nGovernments around the world are in a quest for so-called sovereign AI — the ability to build and run their own AI systems — and that pursuit has become a key driver of demand for advanced processors, according to Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang. Nvidia’s chips are the gold standard for data-center operators, making the company the world’s most valuable chipmaker and the top beneficiary of the AI boom.\n\nChina, meanwhile, is working to develop its own advanced semiconductors, though they still trail the best American chips. Still, there’s concern among US officials that if Huawei Technologies Co. or another foreign maker one day offers a viable alternative to Nvidia chips — presumably with fewer strings attached — that could weaken the US ability to shape the global AI landscape.\n\nSome US officials argue that’s only a distant possibility, and that the Washington should adopt a more restrictive approach to global AI chip exports given its current negotiating position. Others warn against making it too difficult for other countries to buy American technology, in the event China gains ground and captures those customers.\n\nWhile officials have debated the best approach, they’ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road.\n\n--With assistance from Ian King and Jenny Leonard.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man How Airbnb Hosts and Frustrated Neighbors Can Find Common Ground China Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space Inside the Companies That Set Sports Gambling Odds Jamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary: The Idea That Never Fades\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

TSMC (TSM) stock also closed at a record high Monday.\n\nAll in all, the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) is up 4.7% over the past five days, outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which rose 3% over the same time frame.\n\nThe upward trajectory of AI chip stocks is a positive sign for AI hardware spending that assuages Wall Street’s concerns of a near-term slowdown on investment.\n\n\"While Phase 2 stocks [i.e. AI-infrastructure related stocks such as Arm, TSMC, and SMCI] appear modestly expensive relative to history, it is possible that the demand for AI leads the mega-cap tech stocks to spend even more on AI-related capex than investors and analysts currently expect,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in their report on Oct. 10.\n\nGoogle (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) have all indicated that they will continue to spend large sums on AI infrastructure through next year, to the benefit of AI hardware companies, led by Nvidia. As a whole, mega-cap tech stocks are set to spend $215 billion on AI capital expenditures in 2024 and $250 billion in 2025, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nOpenAI’s recent $6.6 billion funding round is also expected to put cash in the hands of hardware companies — namely Nvidia — as it continues evolving its AI models.

(Photo credit should read LONG WEI / Feature China/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (Feature China via Getty Images)\n\nJPMorgan (JPM) analyst Harlan Sur sees revenues for the semiconductor industry growing 6% to 8% in 2024. “We remain positive on semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks,” he said in a recent note to investors, “as we believe stocks should continue to move higher in anticipation of better supply/demand in 2H24/25 and stable/rising earnings power trends in CY24/25.”\n\nA slowdown in investment will eventually come, though. The question is when.\n\nWhereas AI software is typically offered on a subscription basis, hardware is a one-time sale. Analysts have warned that AI chip stocks are in a bubble that will eventually burst once Big Tech’s massive spending on AI infrastructure eases.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, tech giants' most recent earnings reports put on display a widening gap between their hefty spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure and their return on investment — and tested Wall Street’s thinning patience. The stocks of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon all fell late this summer following their quarterly financial reports, which showed billions in AI spending.\n\n“We continue to believe that spending on data center infrastructure will be strong this year and possibly into next year,” DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an email, “but that there is an eventual peak of capex spending by the hyperscalers, as early as next [calendar] year.”\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 1 Year?",
        "content": "The roller coaster doesn't seem to be stopping as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The centerpiece of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has also been the main driver of the S&P 500 index's performance since late 2022. This year alone, roughly a quarter of the index's 20% rise can be attributed to the chipmaker.\n\nThat's a lot of weight on Nvidia's shoulders. Investors are hyperfocused on its every move, seeing it as a bellwether for the market at large. The good news for investors, then, is that the AI giant is charging full steam ahead. It will face challenges and overcome obstacles, but Nvidia has several catalysts that could boost its bottom line in the not-too-distant future. What will the next year bring for Nvidia?\n\nDemand is still extremely high for its bread and butter\n\nThe uber-powerful chips the company designs and sells are the backbone of its success. That's why investors were spooked when the company announced its first real snafu since the AI boom took off. Production issues were discovered in the newest version of its AI chips originally set to begin rolling out in the third quarter. These chips, dubbed Blackwell, are now expected to hit the market a quarter later in Q4. Luckily, this delay is shorter than some feared, and the company assured investors that the delay had been accounted for in its guidance.\n\nCritically, any loss from Blackwell chips in the short term is being compensated for by the still extremely high demand for its current-generation Hopper chips. When Blackwell does begin rolling out, the company expects the demand to be even stronger. As CEO Jensen Huang put it, \"The anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.\"\n\nNow, while Nvidia has generally delivered on its promises in the past, it's a good idea to take a company's promises with a grain of salt. Company brass was a little light on details around the delay, and there is always a chance that things won't go as planned. If more delays are announced, it could spell trouble for Nvidia. Still, I don't see any reason to believe that will happen here or that this will develop into a major problem.\n\nNvidia makes more than its flagship chips\n\nNvidia's data center segment, under which its AI chips fall, is by far its most lucrative. I think the chart below puts into perspective just how important the segment is for the company. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nSee that incredible inflection point in 2023? That is almost entirely coming from its data center growth.\n\nNow, its chips are undoubtedly the heart of this, but it's not the only product the company offers in this segment. Nvidia aims to be a full-service provider of data center hardware and software. Nvidia has a platform called Spectrum-X that, although launched as recently as last year, has already seen a big uptick in sales.\n\nThe platform is a networking solution that allows customers to keep up with the intensive networking demands of AI computing without abandoning ethernet. Ethernet -- a networking technology -- has been the standard for decades and is used in almost every data center in the world. As Nvidia continues to build ever more powerful chips, existing ethernet networks are struggling to keep up with the flow of data, creating a bottleneck.\n\nThis could mean having to retrofit a data center, removing the miles and miles of ethernet cables and associated hardware, and replacing it with faster technology. Remember, these data centers are massive -- we're talking the size of multiple football fields in some cases -- so you can imagine this would be incredibly costly. Spectrum-X allows the bones of these networks to remain, upgrading only critical parts of the network infrastructure. This is a huge cost saver for data centers.\n\nNvidia leadership was excited by Spectrum-X in the company's latest earnings call. CFO, Colette Kress reported that Nvidia's \"Ethernet for AI\" -- of which Spectrum-X is a primary part -- revenue \"doubled sequentially with hundreds of customers adopting our Ethernet offerings\" and that the platform \"has broad market support from OEM and ODM partners.\" The company expects Spectrum to be a multibillion-dollar product line in a year.\n\nBeyond this, Nvidia is rolling out new software to help companies build custom AI solutions and is pushing further into the automotive industry, a segment that could be massive in a few years' time once driverless technology matures. In the short term, however, this will still be a significant revenue source as AI is integrated into car \"infotainment\" systems. This is already happening, but expect to see more car companies advertise this system in the coming year.\n\nNvidia is on the right path\n\nWithout getting specific about a price target, I think Nvidia will outperform the market over the coming year. Yes, at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 56.07, it does carry a premium, but this is pretty much at or below where it has been trading since the beginning of 2020. Furthermore, its forward P/E is currently sitting at 34.2, slightly below its average since the AI boom took off. These figures look fine to me considering Nvidia's growth potential.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "(Reuters) -Shares of Nvidia closed at their highest ever on Monday, putting the heavyweight AI chipmaker on the brink of dethroning Apple as the world's most valuable company.\n\nWith investors betting on strong demand for its current and next-generation AI processors, the Santa Clara, California company's stock climbed 2.4% to end the day at $138.07.\n\nIn June, Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company. It was overtaken by Microsoft, and the tech trio's market capitalizations have been neck-and-neck for several months.\n\nThe latest gains lifted Nvidia's market value to $3.39 trillion, just below Apple's $3.52 trillion value and above Microsoft's $3.12 trillion.\n\nNvidia has been Wall Street's biggest winner from a race between Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and other major tech companies to dominate emerging AI technology.\n\n\"We believe the major companies in AI ... face an investment environment characterized by a Prisoner's Dilemma — each is individually incentivized to continue spending, as the costs of not doing so are (potentially) devastating,\" TD Cowen analysts wrote in a report on Sunday.\n\nTD Cowen reiterated its $165 price target for Nvidia, which it called its \"Top Pick\", and it said demand for the company's current generation of AI chips remained strong.\n\nNvidia in August confirmed reports that a ramp-up in production of its upcoming Blackwell chips was delayed until the fourth quarter, but downplayed the impact, saying customers were snapping up existing chips.\n\nAs investors gear up for quarterly reporting season, Apple rose almost 2% and Microsoft added 0.7%, helping propel the S&P 500 up 0.8% to its own record high close.\n\nNvidia, Apple and Microsoft account for about a fifth of the S&P 500's weight, giving them a hefty influence in the index's day-to-day gains and losses.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the contract manufacturer that produces Nvidia's processors, is expected to report a 40% leap in quarterly profit on Thursday, thanks to soaring demand.\n\nAnalysts expect spending to build out AI data centers will help Nvidia's annual revenue more than double to nearly $126 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nWhile Nvidia's rally has lifted the S&P 500 to record highs, investors worry optimism about AI could evaporate if signs emerge of a slowdown in spending on the technology.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by David Gregorio)",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 8 Most Profitable New Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we will look at where Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) ranks among the most profitable stocks to invest in.\n\nIPO Market to Bounce Back in 2025\n\nConvergence of significant macroeconomic events anywhere around the globe usually ends up triggering market volatility. Last week was marked by critical factors, including a potential port strike and major jobs reports, and created a perfect storm for short-term fluctuations. Of course, that means that these developments influence investor sentiment and market dynamics significantly.\n\nBut even before the heightened uncertainty from last week, geopolitical tensions and recent political debates were already and are still influencing market reactions. Bond prices have fluctuated due to uncertainties. With elections approaching, further market fluctuations are expected. Investors should reassess their portfolios, especially those heavily concentrated in equities. As October began, Tiffany McGhee, CEO and CIO at Pivotal Advisors highlighted the macro events that may spark market volatility at this time. With the potential port strike and major job reports scheduled for release, Tiffany’s opinion was covered in our article on the 7 Cheap New Stocks To Invest In Now. Here’s an excerpt from it:\n\n“Tiffany pointed out that the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the recent vice presidential debate are critical factors influencing market reactions. She observed that bond prices experienced a sell-off earlier in the week but stabilized as investors sought safety amid rising geopolitical tensions. As the election approaches, she anticipates further short-term volatility due to these developments. In terms of strategy, Tiffany encouraged investors to reassess their portfolios, particularly those with a heavy concentration in equities. With the S&P 500 up 20% year-to-date and sectors like technology and consumer discretionary having performed well, she suggested that now is an opportune time to take some profits off the table and consider reallocating those funds into different areas of the market.”\n\nIn short, Tiffany emphasizes strategic asset allocation and proactive management in capital markets to make informed investment decisions. Later on October 4, Ashley MacNeill, Vista Equity’s head of equity capital markets, joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ to discuss her opinion on the IPO market’s potential to bounce back in 2025, given all the market volatility for the rest of 2024.\n\nAshley McNeill explained that her responsibilities at Vista include not only taking companies private but also re-IPOing them and engaging with public investors to understand their preferences and concerns. McNeill acknowledged that the market has yet to see a significant number of IPOs. For the IPO market to regain momentum, she emphasized 3 critical factors: a lack of market volatility, stable market conditions, and a risk-on appetite from investors. Most importantly, she highlighted the need for corporations to provide consistency and clarity regarding their business plans and execution strategies. This clarity emerged in 2023, leading her to believe that 2025 could be a promising year for IPOs.\n\nMcNeill also discussed the current status of private markets, noting that many companies are choosing to remain private longer due to the availability of capital. She pointed out that approximately 45% of US venture capital-backed firms are poised to go public, which translates to over 350 firms potentially looking to tap into the market. This backlog suggests that if the market returns to normalcy, it could take a decade to clear.\n\nWhen asked about Vista’s portfolio companies, McNeill noted their resilience in the current high-cost capital environment. The implementation of GenAI has been transformative for many of these companies, positioning software firms to leverage this technology effectively. She characterized the sentiment around software versus AI as one where software is expected to benefit from AI advancements. However, she cautioned that it takes time to realize the measurable impacts of GenAI. She thinks investors need to be patient and look for tangible improvements in business performance attributable to GenAI technology. Growth areas, according to McNeill, include enhancing margins and efficiency and forming partnerships that integrate AI into existing operations. Many software companies are beginning to collaborate more closely to harness this technology effectively.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe used the Finviz to compile an initial list of the top stocks that went public in the last 2 years.

The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM)\n\nTTM Net Income: $424 million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 38\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is a British semiconductor company that designs and licenses the architecture for microprocessors used in electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, and computers. Its technology is widely adopted by chip manufacturers due to its energy efficiency and performance. It has recently been gaining market share in automotive and cloud services.\n\nThe company’s partnership with Apple on the iPhone 16 has significantly boosted its stock price. Its leadership in mobile and AI technology is demonstrated by its Axion processor, Ethos-U85, and Windows on Arm. With a strong developer network and growing market presence, it is well-positioned as a foundational compute platform across various sectors. Its recent addition to the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index reflects its rapid growth and diversification.\n\nIts FQ1 2025 revenue reached a record $939 million, up 39% from the previous year. Licensing revenue grew 72%, and royalty revenue increased 17%. The adoption of Armv9 architecture and a recovering smartphone market drove royalty revenue growth. Smartphone royalty revenue increased over 50% compared to the prior year, even though unit sales only grew slightly. It has a dominant position in mobile applications, with a 99% market share.\n\nThe company is integrating its Kleidi AI acceleration technology with PyTorch and ExecuTorch to bring AI and machine learning workloads to Arm-based hardware, enabling Arm CPUs to run LLMs. Its latest processor design, v9, features significant upgrades that have doubled its take rate. Its strong market position, innovative technology, and strategic partnerships position it for continued growth.\n\nOverall ARM ranks 3rd on our list of the most profitable stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the growth potential of ARM, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ARM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 8 Most Profitable Tech Stocks Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other most profitable tech stocks right now.\n\nTechnology Sector’s ‘High Bar’\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on October 10, Drew Pettit, Director of US Equity Strategy at Citi Research, shared his thoughts about the upcoming earnings season and its potential impact on the market. With the Dow and S&P 500 reaching new closing highs, Pettit raised the question of whether earnings would justify the current valuations. The technology sector has been on a tear, with many software names running up significantly in recent weeks. However, Pettit’s warning suggests that investors should be cautious about getting too caught up in the hype. He noted that when there’s a high bar, investors should be prepared for potential disappointments.\n\nPettit sounded a note of caution when it came to the tech sector, particularly software stocks. He noted that software has the highest bar within tech, not just in terms of growth expectations but also in terms of monetization. Many software companies are not seeing the expected growth in the next three years, which is already priced into their valuations. This mismatch between expectations and reality could create volatility in the sector.\n\nIn terms of specific guidance, Pettit expects companies to use the current uncertainty as an excuse to walk down expectations for Q4. This is a typical trend in US markets, where companies tend to set low expectations and then beat them. Pettit advises investors to focus on companies that can deliver on their promises.\n\nOverall, Pettit’s comments suggest that investors should be cautious about the tech sector, particularly software stocks, and focus on companies that can deliver on their promises. He also emphasizes the importance of looking beyond the current quarter and focusing on long-term growth prospects.\n\nTech Sector Will Thrive Despite Short-term Challenges\n\nDan Flax, Senior Research Analyst at Neuberger Berman is bullish on the technology sector, with a focus on companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on the next generation of workloads and are executing well on their product cycles. Flax expects concerns about cyclical headwinds to remain a factor but also sees select opportunities in the sector. He also noted that enterprise customers are looking to adjust to changes in the landscape cyclically and invest in transforming their organizations, which will drive technology spending in the second half of the decade.\n\nAs investors navigate the current market landscape, it is essential to approach the tech sector with a sense of caution. While the sector has been experiencing a significant upswing, investors should focus on companies that have a proven track record of delivering on their promises, rather than getting caught up in the hype surrounding certain stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 8 most profitable tech stocks right now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 40 largest technology companies by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to companies with positive TTM net income and 5-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 5-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income. Then we sorted the stocks in ascending order, according to their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from our database of 912 elite hedge funds, as of Q2 of 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). NVIDIA (NVDA): Dominating Among the Most Profitable Tech Stocks Right Now\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nTTM Net Income: $53.00 Billion\n\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 80.81%\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) and has been at the forefront of AI, gaming, and data center technology. The company’s GPUs are widely used in gaming, deep learning, and high-performance computing. NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI and machine learning solutions have also been adopted across various industries such as healthcare, automotive, and finance. NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) customers include Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Tesla.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is poised for continued growth and success, driven by its strong position in the data center market and its upcoming Blackwell chip. Blackwell is high in demand from companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and other firms building AI data centers to power products. Blackwell is expected to cost between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit. The Blackwell GPUs are already being released to data centers and industrial customers for artificial intelligence applications and will be available for consumers in 2025.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, CEO Jensen Huang said that “Blackwell is in full production and demand for Blackwell is insane” and that “Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first”. NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) leadership in the field of accelerated computing and generative AI is also a major driver of its growth prospects. Management has emphasized the importance of these two computing transitions, which are expected to drive long-term sustainability in capital expenditure spending.\n\nAdditionally, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has growing opportunities in the enterprise AI wave, automotive, and healthcare segments are expected to drive further growth, as the company’s products and solutions become increasingly adopted in these industries.\n\nIn Q2, global spending on cloud infrastructure grew 19% year over year to $78.2 billion, according to Canalys. Hyperscalers are expected to spend about $160 billion in 2024 on AI infrastructure. Analysts forecast the company’s earnings will increase by 81.88% this year and have a consensus Buy rating at a target price of $148.23, which implies a 9.48% increase from its current levels. With its strong position in the data center market and its growing opportunities in new industries, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and drive further growth.\n\nOverall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of most profitable tech stocks right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Snowflake SNOW shares have appreciated 9.9% in the past month, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 4.8% and the Zacks Internet Software industry’s return of 8.9%. \r\n\r\nSnowflake’s prospects are robust, driven by a strong portfolio and an expanding partner base. It has introduced capabilities, including Marketplace Listing Auto-Fulfillment & Monetization, account replication & failover, Query Acceleration Service, geospatial analytics, and Snowpipe Streaming. \r\n\r\nIceberg tables, Hybrid tables and Cortex Large Language Model (LLM) and machine learning-powered functions strengthen SNOW’s offerings. These capabilities are expected to become generally available in fiscal 2025.\r\n\r\nSnowflake’s Polaris Catalog — a vendor-neutral, open catalog implementation for Apache Iceberg — the open standard of choice for implementing data lakehouses, data lakes and other modern architectures is supported by Iceberg’s open-source REST protocol.\n\nSNOW Beats Sector in the Past Month Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPolaris Catalog offers Apache Iceberg interoperability with Amazon’s AMZN cloud division Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Confluent, Dremio, Google Cloud, Microsoft MSFT Azure, Salesforce and more.\n\nSNOW’s Strong Partner Base: A Key Catalyst\n\nSNOW is benefiting from an expanding partner base that includes Amazon, Microsoft, NVIDIA NVDA, Fiserv, EY, Deloitte, LTIMindtree, Next Pathway and S&P Global, among others.\r\n\r\nIts collaboration with NVIDIA will help customers and partners build customized AI data applications in its platform powered by NVIDIA AI. \r\n\r\nSnowflake has adopted NVIDIA AI Enterprise software to integrate NeMo Retriever microservices into Snowflake Cortex AI, its fully managed LLM and vector search service. The integration will help enterprises to smoothly connect custom models to diverse business data and deliver highly accurate responses.\r\n\r\nExpanded Snowflake and Microsoft partnership plans to offer an interoperability experience between Snowflake and Microsoft Fabric OneLake. The interoperability is possible due to their support for the industry’s leading open standards for analytical storage formats, Apache Iceberg and Apache Parquet.\r\n\r\nSnowflake also announced Snowflake Data Clean Rooms to customers in AWS East, AWS West and Azure West. SNOW leveraged its acquisition of data clean room technology provider Samooha to launch the solution.\n\nSNOW Shares Suffer From Lower 2025 Margin View\n\nSnowflake shares have declined 37.6% year to date. It has been suffering from stiff competition from the likes of Databricks, as well as increasing pricing pressure and growing GPU-related costs as it aggressively invests in AI initiatives. This has hurt gross margin prospects, with Snowflake lowering its fiscal 2025 margin guidance. \r\n\r\nFor fiscal 2025, SNOW expects a non-GAAP product gross margin of 75% (down from previous guidance of 76%) and a non-GAAP operating margin of 3% (down from previous guidance of 6%).\r\n\r\nSlowing top-line growth is a concern. Snowflake expects fiscal 2025 product revenues of roughly $3.3 billion, indicating 24% year-over-year growth, much slower than the 38% year-over-year growth it reported in fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nSnowflake’s Earnings Estimate Trending Up\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 is currently pegged at 58 cents per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days but indicates a 40.82% year-over-year decline. \r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 is currently pegged at 88 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days and indicating a 51.08% year-over-year decline.\n\nSnowflake Inc. Price and Consensus Snowflake Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nSnowflake Inc. price-consensus-chart | Snowflake Inc. Quote\n\nThe consensus mark for fiscal 2025 revenues is currently pegged at $3.53 billion, suggesting 25.74% growth over fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2026, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.32 billion, indicating 22.3% over fiscal 2025.\n\nSNOW Shares are Overvalued\n\nSnowflake’s near-term prospects remain foggy. The stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\r\n\r\nSnowflake shares are trading at a significant premium compared to the broader sector. Its forward 12-month Price/Sales of 10.18X is higher than the broader sector’s 6.14X.\n\nPrice/Sales Ratio (F12M) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSNOW shares are trading below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.\n\nSNOW Shares Trade Below 200-day SMA Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSnowflake Shares – Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nSnowflake is a risky bet in the near term, given its modest growth prospect and a stretched valuation. However, investors who already own the stock may expect the company's growth prospects to be rewarding, given its strong portfolio and partner base over the long term.\r\n\r\nSNOW currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

        "title": "Nvidia notches record high, looks to unseat Apple as world's most valuable company",
        "content": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) notched a record high closing price as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom, placing the chipmaker in contention for the top spot as Wall Street's most valuable company.\n\nShares rose 2.4% Monday to above $138. Nvidia previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June.\n\nNvidia stock has risen sharply in October, at one point posting six consecutive days of gains.\n\nThe stock’s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Much of that funding will be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips.\n\nNvidia shares continued their upward trajectory, fueled by an abundance of good news for the AI chipmaker. Wall Street analysts last week reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs “remains extremely robust.” A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia’s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday.\n\nNvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in Washington, D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan’s largest supercomputer during Foxconn’s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a megafactory it’s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia’s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions.\n\nNvidia's gains on Monday also put it closer to unseating Apple as the world's most valuable company. The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.4 trillion Monday after market close, while Apple's was $3.5 trillion. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year. Deepu Talla, Nvidia's vice president for AI and robotics makes a speech at Foxconn's annual tech day in Taiwan on Oct. 8, 2024. (REUTERS/Ann Wang) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nNvidia’s ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company’s second quarter earnings.\n\nShares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China due to rising trade tensions with the US had also driven shares down. Nvidia’s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June.\n\nOther recent positive news in the semiconductor sector could aid Nvidia's rise. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations — another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term.\n\nStory continues\n\n“AI is hot,” Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, “I see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.”\n\nThe chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech’s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished, despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown.\n\nSemiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia’s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that the company is boosting capacity to meet “crazy” demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips has been “insane.”\n\nNvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Outperforming with Software Optimizations and AI",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Stocks On the Rise: 8 Best Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best rising stocks to invest In now.\n\nThe market experts believe that Q3 2024 saw stocks experience increased volatility, witnessing rapid declines and then rebounding. As per the US Bank, a significant Q3 2024 trend is the rotation away from the tech sectors. All the investors continue to ask the same question: Will the rally in mega-cap stocks continue? JP Morgan believes that their outperformance has been noteworthy for quite some time. The investment firm stated that, from a research perspective, the valuations of the biggest stocks appear historically expensive, not just in the US but throughout the developed markets. Therefore, the investment firm’s expected return signals now favour the smaller market cap cohorts.\n\nThat being said, fundamentals for mega-cap stocks remain outstanding. Such giants have much higher profitability, lower debt, and improved earnings momentum. The bank believes that for investors who are worried about a slowdown, pivoting to mid/small caps remains difficult. On the other hand, investors seeing AI enthusiasm entering the speculative phase will find it easier to liquidate the winners. Therefore, the firm believes that the case for building mid/small cap exposure remains reasonable but not compelling.\n\nGoldman Sachs increased its year-end target for the S&P 500 and expects more gains for the benchmark in 2025. These gains stem from the stocks, which continue to increase on the back of strong economic growth, lower Federal Reserve interest rates, and expansion of corporate earnings. The US stocks are expected to be aided by numerous tailwinds in the final months of the year, after the Fed’s pivot to rate cuts and the new fiscal stimulus from China. Both these measures improved the risk sentiments. Market experts believe that stocks should see support from the Q3 earnings season and expansion of corporate profits in the final 3 months as the economy continues to surpass expectations.\n\nLSEG data demonstrates that collective S&P 500 earnings for Q3 2024 should grow 5% as compared to the previous year to ~$5.11 billion. This reflects a decline from the earlier projections of a $5.19 billion tally. Nonetheless, it still indicates strong momentum for this year and next, with Q4 profits anticipated to increase by ~12.5%.\n\nRecently, Goldman trimmed its 2024 earnings growth forecast to 8.2% from 8.4%. However, the investment firm expects that earnings momentum will continue to build in the next year. The firm increased its profit growth projection by 5 percentage points to 11%. This upward revision to its 2025 EPS estimate revolves around increased margin expansion. The firm added that the broader macroeconomic backdrop is conducive to slight margin expansion.\n\nMoreover, the firm increased its year-end S&P 500 target to 6,000 points, exhibiting a rise from the prior forecast of 5,600. The investment firm expects a P/E multiple of ~22x for the S&P 500, which remains in line with the company’s macro model of fair value. This will largely remain unchanged over the upcoming 3 months. For 2025, the bank expects the S&P 500 to increase by another ~300 points, to reach the year-end target of 6,300.\n\nMarket strategists believe that the momentum in the broader equities is likely to be aided by a blowout September 2024 jobs report, the start of the US Fed’s rate-cutting cycle, and China’s economic stimulus.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo make a list of 8 Best Stocks to Invest in Now, we used stock screeners to find quality stocks that have gained at least 30% on a YTD basis, as of October 7. We also made sure that these stocks were popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Such outperformance stems from software optimizations and acceleration libraries which are updated constantly. Moving forward, intangible assets associated with its graphics processing units, and switching costs involved around its proprietary software should continue to act as tailwinds.\n\nMarket experts opine that, just like iOS, which locks customers into the iPhone since developers are making applications for the iPhone, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also working on the same thing. The AI engineers have been learning the CUDA platform to program GPUs. This should assist in locking the people. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expects further growth, anticipating Q3 2024 revenue to touch $32.5 billion. The company expects continued expansion in its Hopper architecture and Blackwell products.\n\nThe company anticipates to ship several billion dollars in revenue from its Blackwell platform in Q4 2024. Also, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expects robust growth in the data center business next year. The company sees a strong opportunity in sovereign AI, with countries planning their own generative AI systems. Its strategic focus on Gen AI and enterprise AI should help create additional revenue streams.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. increased its price target from $115.00 to $155.00, giving an “Overweight” rating on 29th August. Vltava Fund, an investment management company, recently released its third-quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Over the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA’s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA’s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.”\n\nOverall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of Best Stocks to Invest in Now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Most Profitable Cheap Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) stands against the other most profitable cheap stocks to invest in.\n\nInsights on Small Caps, Tech, and More\n\nSherry Paul, Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management managing director, joined CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on October 8, to discuss her investment strategy amidst the current market trends. Despite the Russell 2000 being down a percent, Paul believes it’s the right time to strategically add to small caps, as they are ripe for M&A and have been teased out due to their dependence on domestic consumption.\n\nPaul emphasizes that the key to navigating this market is to be selective and strategic, recommending a broadening out of investments across sectors in the S&P, with a focus on large caps, particularly in areas such as industrials, financials, and staples. She believes that the rates going lower, combined with the productivity-enhancing cost reduction kicker, will benefit these sectors. Paul also highlights the importance of dividend yields, which can add lower volatility to a portfolio.\n\nRegarding large-cap tech stocks, Paul remains bullish, viewing it as a theme rather than an idea. She believes that corporations will invest in software and hardware upgrades, driven by their enormous cash balances and the need to cut costs as rates go lower. This will be a boost for the sector, although it’s a longer-term game, with a time horizon of 12-24 months.\n\nDespite the S&P 500 near record levels, Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat, an independent equity research firm, remains bullish, citing a strong economic backdrop, the Fed’s decision to cut rates, and stimulus policies in China as tailwinds that will support the market. He believes that the economy is resilient and that the Fed’s easing will lead to a continued bull market, with the S&P 500 potentially reaching 5700 or higher by the end of the year.\n\nLee acknowledges that there are some headwinds, including the looming election and rising oil prices, but believes that they will be offset by the tailwinds. He also notes that small caps, which have been the weakest area of the market since the Fed hike, are due for a rebound.\n\nAs the market continues to navigate through economic trends and global challenges, expert insights help provide valuable insights to make informed investment decisions.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 7 most profitable cheap stocks to invest in, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 40 largest companies by market cap that are trading at a forward P/E ratio of under 20 as of October 7. From that list, we narrowed our choices to 7 stocks with positive TTM net income and 5-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 5-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income. Then we sorted the stocks in ascending order, according to their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from our database of 912 elite hedge funds as of Q2 of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of IT experts discussing the latest network security trends over a laptop screen.\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 88\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of October 7: 15.31\n\nTTM Net Income: $3.97 Billion\n\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 9.41%\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is a major player in the global technology sector, providing computing hardware, software, and IT services.\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is focusing on AI deployment for communications service providers (CSPs) by bringing together its AI expertise, infrastructure, and services. The need for AI adoption in the telecommunications industry is evident, with a recent MeriTalk study finding that 48% of telecom executives see AI as the industry’s most transformative technology in the next five years. The Dell AI for Telecom program addresses these challenges by providing CSPs with on-premises AI solutions that can enhance network performance, improve customer service, and provide greater value.\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is collaborating with NVIDIA to transform telecom networks with AI solutions. The two companies are co-creating and validating telecom AI solutions for CSPs. These solutions use Dell PowerEdge servers, NVIDIA GPUs, and enterprise-grade AI software to help CSPs use AI to enhance customer care, improve network maintenance, and automate call center scripts and customer care operations.\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) and NVIDIA are also working together to facilitate AI deployments with the PowerEdge XR8000 server, which is now available with NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPUs. This server is designed for telecom and edge use cases and features a compact, modular design that simplifies deployment and maintenance.\n\nFurthermore, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is helping CSPs design and deploy GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS) offerings, which allows them to provide on-demand NVIDIA GPU capacity for enterprise customers. This enables enterprises to scale AI deployments and resources as needed while maintaining data ownership and governance.\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is already partnering with CSPs in the Dell Telecom Open Ecosystem Labs to develop AI solutions with Dell AI Factory infrastructure and ecosystem partners to enhance customer experiences and improve network performance. For example, Lintasarta, an Indonesian information and communication technology company, is using GPU Merdeka, a GPUaaS, to provide AI infrastructure, including NVIDIA GPUs with Dell PowerEdge XE9680 servers.\n\nDell Technologies’ (NYSE:DELL) AI growth is supported by its core server business, which has demonstrated a growing backlog that reached $3.8 billion in Q2. Management emphasized that it recorded $3.2 billion in AI server orders “driven by tier-2 CSPs.” The company’s ability to transition its current enterprise customers to its AI-optimized portfolio is still in the early stages, and management is confident that the growing adoption will result in favorable outcomes for the company.\n\nDell Technologies’ (NYSE:DELL) diversified ISG portfolio which includes products in its storage, server, and networking segments, has continued to gain market share and has also made progress with tier-2 cloud service providers.\n\nDell Technologies’ (NYSE:DELL) margins are expected to remain solid, and the market seems increasingly confident in the company’s capabilities to overcome its past growth rates. The stock’s forward P/E ratio of 15.31 indicates a 36.35% discount compared to the sector median of 24.06. Analysts expect Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) to increase its earnings by 9.73% this year, and have a a consensus Buy rating at a target price of $146.58, which implies a 20.08% increase from its current levels. For the twelve months ending July 31, Dell Technologies’ (NYSE:DELL) net income was $3.97 billion, a 108.61% increase year-over-year.\n\nOverall DELL ranks 4th on our list of most profitable cheap stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of DELL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DELL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A Hedge Fund Favorite with Unmatched Potential",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For The Next Decade. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other best stocks to buy and hold for the next decade.\n\nIs Nuclear Energy Making a Comeback?\n\nNuclear plants continue to re-open, but the question stands, will the global supply be able to meet the ever-growing demand for clean energy? On October 1, Aniket Shah, Jefferies’ global head of sustainability and transition strategy, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his stance on nuclear energy making a comeback amid the AI boom.\n\nShah shares that the nuclear energy boom is not surprising. Looking back, the United States signed significant partnerships to boost the supply of nuclear energy years ago, indicating that the value this sector holds is not unknown or recent.\n\nHe adds that the big tech companies are going to be primary catalysts and will influence the entire market. These companies will invest millions and billions in nuclear energy, making the transition easier for other companies to follow. According to Shah, some key investment areas would be small modular reactors and nuclear fusion.\n\nShah also acknowledged that the United States held a bipartisan view of the nuclear boom, explaining why regulations and acts in favor of nuclear energy are being passed at notoriously high speeds. While the building blocks of nuclear energy are coming together, Shah remains concerned over the execution. He highlights that the United States does not have enough skilled labor and resources to make the nuclear energy boom a reality and must work extremely hard to make it happen.\n\nNuclear Energy is Poised for Growth Amid AI Boom\n\nOne of the most opportunistic investment themes in 2024 is AI, the other is electrification, and both require a lot of power. The surge in power demand is in turn driving utility stocks. On October 4, Durgesh Chopra, Evercore ISI managing director, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss how utilities could benefit from AI-driven power demand.\n\nChopra highlights the biggest catalyst for companies like Vistra and Constellation Energy is data centers’ needs for a 24/7 source of clean energy. Therefore, nuclear companies must grab the opportunity and enter into long-term contracts to lock in future growth as soon as possible.\n\nThere are multiple projects in the pipeline in the United States, that add up to roughly 1.5 gigawatts of energy, positioning nuclear plants as the next big thing in energy. On the flip side, balancing supply and demand will be a key challenge for companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the challenges, he believes that the market is well-positioned for growth in utilities. Utilities have not seen demand growth in the past decade, but things are finally changing for the sector. Overall, with inflation going down, the sector may experience significant tailwinds. Chopra also emphasized that growth in this sector will yield results in five to seven years.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for the next decade, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the most influential stocks at the moment. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. Such can be attributed to its rapid advancements in technology and strategic partnerships. The company’s networking platform for AI, Spectrum X, is projected to become a multi-billion dollar entity in a year.\n\nMoreover, the company just closed a deal with Salesforce allowing organizations to benefit from advanced AI and data capabilities. Two weeks ago, NVIDIA launched a new AI tool, Aerial, to optimize wireless networks that will meet the needs of the next generation on mobile, robots, autonomous vehicles, and 5G.\n\nThe company expects to log $32.5 billion in revenue in the fiscal third quarter of 2025. The revenue is likely to be driven by its growing Hopper architecture and sampling of its Blackwell chips. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2025, the company will pace up the production of its Blackwell chips, hinting towards a successful financial year for NVIDIA.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on NVDA and their 12-month median price target of $150 points to a 13% upside from current levels. According to our Insider Monkey database, at the close of Q2 2024, 179 investors were bullish on NVDA, with total stakes amounting to $53.7 billion.\n\nIthaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall, NVDA ranks 3rd among the 10 stocks to buy and hold for the next decade. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s shares are roaring back after the company successfully calmed investor concerns about product delays and its long-term growth prospects.\n\nThe stock is up 11% so far this month and is less than 1% below a closing record hit in June. It’s the second-best performer in the S&P 500 Index this year.\n\nRecent strength came after CEO Jensen Huang said Nvidia’s Blackwell chip “is in full production,” and that demand for it “is insane,” comments that came after Blackwell was delayed due to engineering snags, prompting a selloff that has now been erased. In addition, a report last week from Morgan Stanley analysts who met management said that Blackwell orders “are booked out 12 months or so,” with “every indication that business remains robust with very high forward visibility.”\n\nThe comments cement the view that Nvidia is still a favored way to invest in artificial intelligence, especially as major companies remain committed to their AI initiatives. Microsoft Corp., for example, is projected to boost capex spending by nearly a third in fiscal 2025 to about $58 billion, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n“There had been questions about the impact production delays could have, so these updates are reassuring,” said Zehrid Osmani, portfolio manager at Martin Currie Investment Management.\n\nBeyond the Blackwell optimism, recent sales from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. showed strong AI demand, while a funding round for OpenAI resulted in a $157 billion valuation. OpenAI recently released an AI model with reasoning capabilities, something Alphabet Inc. is also working on.\n\nThese events “have driven a reinvigoration of interest in the space, and people are really getting excited about the use cases for reasoning-based AI,” said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. “Reasoning represents a new area for Nvidia, and when you consider how compute-intensive it is, this could be a huge new product category.”\n\nBelton views Nvidia as a core holding and sees AI offering “a steady drumbeat of demand” for years. “It’s not an undiscovered stock, but the valuation is still reasonable if it can deliver the numbers that are expected.”\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia’s revenue to more than double in its current fiscal year, and rise another 44% the following one, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Street has continually raised estimates for Nvidia’s earnings and profit over the past quarter.\n\nNvidia’s strong growth prospects have kept its valuation in check, helping bulls support their case to keep buying. It trades around 37 times estimated earnings, which represents a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, but is below its five-year average and under a June peak of more than 44 times.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Nvidia still looks formidable,” said Osmani, of Martin Currie. “It remains really well positioned to harness the AI opportunity.”\n\nSigns of optimism have also been flashing in the options market. On Thursday, there was a wave of purchases in calls that allow holders to buy more than 30 million shares at levels from $150 to $189 through March. Nvidia closed at $134.80 on Friday.\n\nThe cost of calls relative to bearish put options — known as the skew — has fallen, making it cheaper to bet on a further rally. The contracts won’t expire until after Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings release, expected in late February.\n\n“The stock will remain volatile and orders will be lumpy,” said Dan Flax, managing director and senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman. “But so long as Nvidia executes on its product road map, that will drive the kind of healthy growth that keeps the stock attractive.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nTesla Inc. shares fell 8.8% on Friday in the wake of its Robotaxi event, with the stock dropping near a key technical level. The shares closed only slightly above their 100-day moving average, a level it has held above since June. Breaking under it would be a negative sign for medium-term momentum trends.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official, as the chipmaker expands its global footprint. TPG Telecom Ltd. agreed to sell its fiber assets and the company’s fixed business serving enterprise, government and wholesale customers to Vocus Group Ltd. in a deal valued at A$5.25 billion ($3.5 billion). South Korea’s exports of technology products slowed for a second straight month in an indication global demand may be peaking out, according to government data that also showed memory-chip shipments and prices losing momentum. Apple Inc. is finally preparing to compete for the smart home market after falling behind Amazon and Google. For years, Apple has sold the go-to devices for our pockets, wrists, backpacks and desks. But it has struggled to achieve that kind of success in other key areas: the car, the face and the home.\n\n--With assistance from David Marino.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside the Companies That Set Sports Gambling Odds Jamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary: The Idea That Never Fades Lina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes) The Robotaxi Verdict Is In—And Wall Street Is Taking the Train Why Is It So Hard for Clothing Resale Platforms to Make Money?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – October 14, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Coca-Cola KO and Nvidia NVDA.\n\n3 Simple Tips to Keep Your Portfolio in Shape\n\nKeeping your portfolio in shape is undoubtedly challenging, as things evolve rapidly within the investment landscape.\n\nBut the task can be more straightforward than some believe, as investors just need to demonstrate some initiative. For those looking to keep their portfolios in shape, let's look at a few pointers.\n\nManage Portfolio Beta\n\nBeta is a measure of a stock's systematic risk or volatility in comparison to the overall market. The S&P 500 is often used as the benchmark, with a beta of 1.0 representing the market average.\n\nA beta greater than 1.0 indicates that a stock is more volatile than the market, while a beta less than 1.0 suggests the opposite. Essentially, low-beta stocks provide a higher level of 'defense,' whereas high-beta stocks are known for their higher returns, or 'offense.'\n\nInvestors can use beta to help balance out their risk profile, helping during intense volatility spikes. A classic example of a low-beta stock is Coca-Cola, whereas high-flying tech stocks are commonly high beta.\n\nStay Updated\n\nRegularly reviewing earnings reports is a crucial part of staying informed as an investor. These reports provide a wealth of information, from revenues and expenses to profits. By keeping up with this data, you gain a deeper understanding of the business and can spot any potential 'red flags.'\n\nIn addition, quarterly reports provide deeper insights into a company's strategy and plans. For example, the report may detail new products or services planned to launch or discuss plans for tapping into new markets.\n\nBy understanding a company's strategy, investors can evaluate its long-term growth potential with a higher level of ease. Nvidia's quarterly releases have been a great example of why investors can't fall asleep behind the wheel.\n\nLet Winners Run\n\nThe \"Let Winners Run\" and \"Cut Losers\" strategy is simple: Investors should hold onto stocks that are performing well to benefit from their continued growth and compounding returns while selling underperforming stocks to prevent further downside.\n\nOf course, selling losers also frees up capital for better opportunities. The approach helps provide a portfolio that grows steadily over time by leveraging the strengths of successful stocks while minimizing the impact of the 'bad apples.'\n\nBottom Line\n\nKeeping a portfolio in shape can be challenging, but it's certainly not as difficult when implementing some guard rails.\n\nStory continues\n\nManaging volatility, staying up to date, and letting winners run are all a recipe for portfolio success.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – October 14, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Intel INTC and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nAre Intel Shares Worth Another Look?\n\nIntel shares have largely been disappointing in 2024, unable to fully join the semiconductor trade and down more than 50%. Quarterly results have added fuel to the fire sale, with the stock unable to find any meaningful traction post-earnings.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the YTD performance of Intel shares relative to the S&P 500, with its quarterly releases illustrated by the circled arrows.\n\nGiven the steep decline from highs, could it finally be time to go on the offensive and pick up some shares? Let's take a closer look.\n\nIntel Maintains Bearish Outlook\n\nCurrently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish earnings estimate revisions from analysts. Expectations for its current fiscal year have been notably negative, with the $0.27 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down 85% over the last year.\n\nThe negative revisions, caused by unfavorable quarterly results, bode poorly for near-term share performance.\n\nStill, it's worth noting that CEO Pat Gelsinger remains confident, buying 12.5k shares at a total transaction value of roughly $250k in early August following the latest quarterly print. He noted that second-half trends are more challenging than anticipated but still expects the company to restrengthen its position in the market.\n\nCost-cutting measures have also been a huge focus for the company over recent periods after margin pressures, as we can see in the chart below. In fact, Intel announced a $10 billion cost-savings target earlier in August.\n\nAre Intel Shares a Buy?\n\nInvestors should stay on the sidelines until positive earnings estimate revisions roll in, which would signal a meaningful change in sentiment. Earnings expectations for its upcoming release expected on October 24th have already been slashed, with the company now expected to post a loss of -$0.03 per share.\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nIt's worth noting that INTC shares have been red-hot over the last month, gaining nearly 20%. While the positive price action has been inspiring, the bulk of the move has likely been fueled by a short squeeze following rumors of buyouts.\n\nFor those seeking semiconductor exposure, there are many more positive stories, a list that obviously includes beloved AI-favorite Nvidia. Nvidia currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook shifting higher across the board following unbelievable quarterly results.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd concerning the top line, Nvidia's sales are forecasted to more than double in its current fiscal year.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "The 3 Best-Performing Stock-Split Stocks of 2024 So Far -- and Nvidia Doesn't Top the List",
        "content": "Everyone knows that slicing a pizza into six or eight pieces doesn't provide more food than slicing it into four pieces. Such slicing is basically what stock splits do.\n\nHowever, stock splits can sometimes attract new investors who otherwise wouldn't have bought the stock. And this can drive the share price higher. We've perhaps seen this phenomenon in effect this year with several high-profile stock splits. Here are the three best-performing stock-split stocks of 2024 so far.\n\n1. AGBA Group Holding Ltd.\n\nHong Kong-based online financial services and healthcare platform operator AGBA Group Holding Ltd.(NASDAQ: AGBA) might win the award for the most unusual stock split of the year. On Oct. 2, 2024, the company conducted a 122-for-63 stock split earlier this month with shares beginning trading on a split-adjusted basis on Oct. 2. AGBA shareholders also voted on Sept. 19, 2024, to authorize the company's board of directors to conduct a reverse stock split in the range of 1-for-1.5 to 1-for-20.\n\nIt's debatable whether or not AGBA's stock-split strategy has provided a major catalyst for the stock. However, AGBA's share price has skyrocketed more than 340% for another reason: the company's pending merger with privately held Triller.\n\nTriller operates a technology platform powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that enables online content creation. Large customers including Meta Platforms, PepsiCo, and The Walt Disney Company use Triller's platform to improve online engagement with users.\n\nAGBA's merger with Triller isn't a done deal yet, though. The two companies must first win approval from regulators. Assuming there are no roadblocks, AGBA plans to change its name to Triller Group.\n\n2. MicroStrategy\n\nBitcoin development company MicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR) conducted a 10-for-1 stock split of its class A and class B common shares on Aug. 7, 2024. MicroStrategy's shares jumped after the announcement of the planned stock split on July 11 and after the stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on Aug. 8.\n\nHowever, most of MicroStrategy's 190%-plus year-to-date gain came before the stock split was announced. The stock took off in February in lockstep with a surge in the price of Bitcoin. Since MicroStrategy revealed in its 2023 fourth-quarter update on Feb. 6, 2024, that it owned 190,000 Bitcoins, this big move was understandable.\n\nAlthough MicroStrategy's share price has soared, its underlying business hasn't performed as well. In the second quarter of 2024, the company's revenue fell 7.4% year over year to $111.4 million. MicroStrategy also posted a hefty net loss of $102.6 million compared to a profit of $22.2 million in the prior-year period.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) arguably claims the most anticipated stock split of the year. The GPU maker has been one of the hottest stocks on the market and conducted a 10-for-1 stock split effective June 7.\n\nDespite investors' excitement about Nvidia's stock split, Nvidia ranks only in third place among the best-performing stock-split stocks of 2024. Its shares have vaulted more than 170% higher so far this year.\n\nVirtually all of Nvidia's impressive year-to-date gains came in the first half of 2024. The stock has swung up and down during the second half of the year, partly as a result of concerns about the delayed shipment of Nvidia's new chips based on its Blackwell GPU architecture.\n\nBest pick going forward\n\nWhich of these top stock-split stocks of 2024 so far is likely to be the biggest winner over the next 12 months and beyond? My vote goes to Nvidia.\n\nThe new Blackwell chips should fuel continued growth for the company. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently told CNBC that the demand for the chip is \"insane.\" I'm not surprised. Even better, the company is now on a pace to introduce new technology on a yearly basis. This high-flying stock still has room to run, in my opinion.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $826,069!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "How to Play China’s New Stimulus Package at a 17% Discount",
        "content": "When I show you a chart like the one below, your first thought might be that we’re looking at, say, the recent stock performance of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)—or maybe a biopharma firm that just dropped a breakthrough treatment:\n\nNot a Tech Stock—Just a “Boring” Index Fund\n\nBut you’d be wrong. What we’re looking at here is the iShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ:MCHI), an index fund tracking the Chinese stock market, up to its peak early last week.\n\nThat jump is the direct result of the Chinese Communist Party’s recently announced stimulus package.\n\nThe gains have attracted the attention of Chinese day traders and speculators, as well as those in the West. But—as is often the case with China’s economic moves—there’s still a lot of uncertainty here, as the Chinese government has given few details on what, exactly, it will do. That lack of detail caused a reversal late last week that has dented, but not shattered, the bullish view.\n\nSo how do us non-day traders profit from this situation? The obvious way is to buy Chinese stocks—but there’s a big risk here, since foreigners can’t do this directly.\n\nThere are ways around this, such as buying US-listed firms like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). But that adds risk, since stocks like these don’t actually give you ownership in Chinese companies.\n\nThis all may sound surprising if you don’t follow Chinese stocks regularly, but Alibaba and other US-listed Chinese stocks are actually tied to something called a variable interest entity that’s registered in the Cayman Islands. So buying Alibaba isn’t just a bet on Chinese stimulus but also on Chinese regulators respecting international law and recognizing foreign investors’ real claim in Chinese firms.\n\nAnother way to buy in is through an ETF like MCHI, which invests broadly in Chinese assets, and hope you can get out before this short-term frenzy stops. However, MCHI and ETFs like it aren’t your only option, nor are they even a particularly good one.\n\nThe CEF Way to Invest in China’s New Stimulus Package\n\nThe real problem with Chinese stocks is that, while short-term wins on a frenzy like this are possible, the Chinese market’s long-term performance has been, to put it frankly, dreadful.\n\nChinese Stocks Trail (Far) Behind the US\n\nChinese stocks have returned around a tenth of the S&P 500’s gains, so an investor who bought $10,000 of US stocks in 2011 would have $56,120 as of this writing, while the same amount in Chinese stocks would now be $13,026, leaving over $40,000 on the table.\n\nThe key takeaway here is that if you want to play this frenzy, don’t stick around long, or you’ll miss bigger returns elsewhere.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut if you’re still determined to give it a try, MCHI isn’t the best way to do so. To explain this, let’s look at the Morgan Stanley China A Share Fund (NYSE:CAF), a closed-end fund (CEF) that, like MCHI, invests in Chinese companies.\n\nCAF Lags the Laggards (for Now)\n\nAs you can see, CAF is underperforming MCHI this year, and the pullback in the wake of the big spike we talked about off the top has been much worse for the CEF than it has been for the ETF. So why would an investor looking to profit off the Chinese stimulus package pick CAF?\n\nThe answer is in the question itself. The frenzy has pushed up MCHI, the largest ETF by market cap tracking the Chinese stock market, but it still hasn’t spread to smaller, less-popular Chinese funds. And since CAF, with just a $275-million market cap, is about one-twentieth the size of MCHI, it’s probably going to remain a hidden gem of Chinese stock-market frenzy for a while longer.\n\nThat may sound speculative. After all, how can I know that CAF isn’t getting as much attention as MCHI? Well, beyond its lagging performance, there’s the discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of CAF’s underlying portfolio):\n\nDeep Discount Makes CAF a Better Value Than Its ETF Cousin\n\nLet’s start with the purple line above: MCHI trades at a 0.6% premium to NAV as of this writing. That shouldn’t happen. Typically, market pros look for opportunities to sell an ETF trading at a premium and buy the fund’s underlying assets, as doing so gives them instant profit. This is why big index funds, like S&P 500 ETFs, always trade close to par.\n\nThis premium tells us that the difficulty of getting real shares in Chinese companies has made this arbitrage opportunity tough for all but the biggest investors.\n\nThat should encourage more speculators to buy CAF, with its 17.2% discount (discounts to NAV are common with CEFs, since their shares are mostly fixed in number, while the value of the assets their shares represent fluctuates during trading hours).\n\nBear in mind, too, that CAF is trading at a similar discount to where it was before the trading frenzy. That means CAF doesn’t have the big China stimulus–driven recovery priced in, while MCHI does.\n\nOf course, buying CAF means you’ll need to be active, vigilant and ready to sell at a moment’s notice. But that’s all part of day trading.\n\nThis is also why we prefer a longer-term, dividend-focused approach at my CEF Insider service (as well as downplaying or avoiding Chinese stocks). After all, when there are CEFs from across the economy (and the world) yielding 8%+ on average, there’s just no need to take on the stress and workload of day trading.\n\nForget Trying to Time China’s Skittish Market. Do This for Steady 9.8% Payouts.\n\nCEFs are perfect for building the diverse portfolio and income stream we need to fund a low-stress lifestyle, whether we’re in retirement or working to get there.\n\nWhich is where the 4 other CEFs I’m recommending today come in. They kick out an outsized 9.8% dividend on average, and I see plenty of upside as their undeserved discounts vanish.\n\nI’ve put together a special investor bulletin that gives you the inside scoop on CEF investing, including how CEFs pay massive yields and how buying a discounted CEF can lead to some truly game-changing upside.\n\nIt’s exactly the kind of low-drama, high-dividend approach we need in these uncertain (to say the least!) times.\n\nDisclosure: Brett Owens and Michael Foster are contrarian income investors who look for undervalued stocks/funds across the U.S. markets.

        "title": "Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Just Gave Magnificent News to AI Chip Investors",
        "content": "How long will the strong artificial intelligence buildout last? The market appears optimistic, with AI chip leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) trading at 34 times forward earnings estimates and challenger Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) trading at 30 times.\n\nHowever, there is a considerable debate among investors as to whether this hypergrowth is sustainable, or whether the AI buildout is going to pop like the dot-com bust.\n\nThis week, CEOs of AI chip leaders Nvidia and AMD made announcements, each of which gave even greater weight to the bull case for their stocks and AI chips stocks generally.\n\nBulls vs. bears on AI\n\nAI stocks pulled back hard over the summer after a strong 18 months or so of performance, as skepticism worked its way into the story. After the Magnificent Seven, who are the main buyers of AI chips, reported good but not blowout earnings in July, investors appeared concerned that these big chip buyers weren't seeing a requisite return on their investments in Nvidia chips. Most big tech stocks and AI chip plays sank in response.\n\nGiant hedge fund Elliott Management piled onto the skepticism, giving especially bearish commentary on what it perceives as an AI \"bubble.\" Elliott wrote in its latest letter to investors that AI stocks were overhyped, declaring AI applications aren't, \"ever going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.\" Elliott dismissed the technology as only good for a few things such as summarizing reports and helping with computer coding.\n\nThat's certainly a point of view that should be considered. It may even be true of the current models that are out today. However, virtually everyone participating in the technology industry believes in the benefits. If benefits weren't likely going to be there, it seems unlikely every major technology company would be greatly expanding its AI investments today as they are.\n\nFor his part, Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison dismissed these concerns, declaring the race for AI supremacy \"goes on forever, to build a better and better neural network.\" Ellison believes that AI capabilities will improve with more compute and better models, and that the large tech companies can't afford to cede the AI lead to competitors. With big tech armed with a ton of cash, he doesn't see the buildout ending for five to 10 years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nJensen Huang and Lisa Su just dropped the mic\n\nThis week then saw two massive announcements from the number one and two AI chip companies that should allay near-term fears about the durability of the AI trade. At the beginning of the month, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang said demand for its next generation chip Blackwell was \"insane.\" Fast forward to last week, and analysts at Morgan Stanley revealed Blackwell is already sold out for the next 12 months, after the firm hosted Nvidia executives at their offices.\n\nStory continues\n\nThen on Thursday, AMD held its \"Advancing AI\" event during which it unveiled its new EPYC 9005 CPUs and Instinct MI325X GPUs. During the presentation, CEO Lisa Su increased her projection for the market size for AI accelerators. Last year, Su surprised investors by forecasting the AI accelerator market would increase from $45 billion in 2023 to a whopping $400 billion in 2027.\n\nSo, has the past year made her more skeptical or anxious about all that spend, as Elliott surmises?\n\nJust the opposite, in fact. During the conference, Su raised her guidance for the AI accelerator market to reach a whopping $500 billion by 2028, saying, \"Since [last year], AI demand has continued to take off and exceed expectations. It's clear that the rate of investment is continuing to grow everywhere, driven by more powerful models, new use cases, and actually just a wider adoption of AI use cases.\"\n\nIf Su's and Huang's projections hold, more companies will benefit than just Nvidia and AMD. Any company with a strong competitive position in the related foundry, semicap equipment, server, or AI-integrated software industries should also see a benefit from this medium-term demand. Additionally, electricity and transmission providers should also see strong growth, as AI data centers consume a huge amount of energy.\n\nBubble brewing? Not just yet\n\nWhile the dot-com bubble burst in the year 2000, remember that there was a five-year \"boom\" that preceded it. The boom coincided with the period after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates between 1995 through 1998. Looking at today's situation, the AI boom is only about two years old, and the Fed similarly just began a rate-cutting cycle in September.\n\nTo this investor, it appears we may be more in the \"mid-90s\" analogy rather than the precipice of an enormous bubble bursting. There's also a case for the boom to go on for a longer time than the internet boom did, as the companies investing AI, the Mag Seven, are all extremely strong financially -- much stronger than a lot of the newer start-up tech companies of the mid-1990s. In addition, for all their success, the Mag Seven really don't trade at the crazy valuations seen by big tech in the late 1990s.\n\nThat doesn't mean the AI buildout couldn't become a bubble -- it could. But it still seems early, and AI stocks are too reasonably priced for a huge fall, barring any outside exogenous shocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Israel Englander Is Selling Nvidia and Palantir and Piling Into a Historically Cheap, Yet Potentially Troubled, Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock",
        "content": "In mid-August, Wall Street received its most important data dump of the third quarter -- and I'm not talking about an inflation report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAugust 14 marked the deadline for institutional investors and money managers with at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F offers an under-the-hood look at which stocks Wall Street's smartest and most-successful money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter (in this instance, the June-ended quarter). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlthough 13Fs have their flaws -- e.g., they're usually 45 days old when filed, which can lead to stale data for active funds -- they're invaluable when it comes to helping investors figure out which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends are piquing the interest of Wall Street's top asset managers.\n\nBillionaire Israel Englander of Millennium Management is one of the prominent money managers that investors tend to pay very close attention to. Based on Millennium's latest 13F, Englander and his team are overseeing close to $216 billion in managed securities, which is spread out across thousands of positions, including various put and call options.\n\nBut what stands out most about Englander's trading activity during the June-ended quarter is how he approached artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Englander showed shares of two of Wall Street's favorite high-flying AI stocks to the door, while absolutely piling into another historically cheap AI company that's encountering some serious headwinds.\n\nEnglander's Millennium sends shares of Nvidia and Palantir to the chopping block\n\nThe two ultra-popular artificial intelligence stocks in question that Englander's Millennium Management pared down during the second quarter are semiconductor colossus Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and cloud-based data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR).\n\nMillennium has held shares of Nvidia since 2008, so it's certainly been a prime beneficiary of the AI revolution. But during the June-ended quarter, Englander's fund reduced its position in Nvidia by 676,242 shares.\n\nIt's certainly possible that this represents nothing more than simple profit-taking and asset reallocation. Nvidia has grown from a $360 billion company to end 2022 into a $3.25 trillion business, as of the closing bell on Oct. 9, 2024. Locking in gains following a nearly parabolic move higher would seem to be a prudent move.\n\nBut there are other concerns that may be compelling Englander to reduce Millennium's stake in Nvidia. For instance, even though Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) are the undisputed top choice as the \"brains\" of AI-accelerated data centers, external and internal competition are picking up. In particular, Nvidia's four-largest customers by net sales are internally developing AI-GPUs for use in their data centers. This suggests future opportunities to win valuable data center real estate will be limited for the AI hardware kingpin.\n\nStory continues\n\nHistory has also been incredibly unkind to leading businesses of next-big-thing innovations. Investors have overestimated the utility and uptake of every game-changing technology for the last 30 years, and AI seems unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nIn addition to selling shares of Nvidia, Englander's fund slashed its stake in Palantir Technologies by 7,074,815 shares. Millennium has been a continuous holder of Palantir's stock since its initial public offering in 2020.\n\nOn one hand, Palantir is riding the wave of irreplaceability to astronomical gains. The company's AI-driven Gotham platform, which collects data and helps with mission planning for federal governments, coupled with its enterprise-focused Foundry platform, have no competitors at scale. Wall Street often rewards companies that have sustainable moats with premium valuations.\n\nBut at some point, a nosebleed valuation, even with a sustainable moat, can become a tough pill to swallow. As of Oct. 9, Palantir is valued at 100 times forward-year earnings per share (EPS) and a jaw-dropping 35 times forecast revenue for the current year. It's almost impossible to justify this valuation given annual sales growth of around 20%.\n\nFurthermore, the long-term potential of Palantir's Gotham segment is naturally limited. This is a platform that Palantir's leaders will only allow the U.S. and its allies to access. This means future growth and profits will be heavily reliant on Foundry. Though this isn't a bad thing, Foundry is still in its very early stages of expansion, which makes Palantir's $96.6 billion market cap an eyesore. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHere's the historically inexpensive AI stock Israel Englander can't stop buying\n\nWhile Englander was a busy seller of two of Wall Street's top artificial intelligence stocks, he was also an avid buyer of a jaw-droppingly cheap AI stock whose path forward has become clouded in recent months. I'm talking about customizable rack server and storage solutions specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI).\n\nWhen adjusted for the 10-for-1 stock split Super Micro completed two weeks ago, Englander's Millennium Management purchased 5,533,230 shares during the second quarter, which increased the fund's existing stake in the company by more than 800% since the end of March.\n\nJust as Nvidia has become the go-to provider of AI-GPUs for high-compute data centers, Super Micro Computer has been a top infrastructure player for businesses looking to build out their AI data centers. Super Micro incorporates Nvidia's ultra-popular H100 GPU into its customizable rack servers, which is enhancing the desirability of its solutions.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, which ended on June 30, the company delivered net sales growth of 110% to $14.94 billion. For fiscal 2025, the midpoint of Super Micro's revenue forecast calls for $28 billion. Despite a forecast annualized earnings growth rate of 62% through fiscal 2029, shares of the company are currently trading at less than 11 times EPS for fiscal 2026.\n\nThe reason Super Micro Computer's stock isn't trading at a more aggressive premium given its lofty growth projections is because of mounting headwinds. For example, it was the target of a short-seller report from Hindenburg Research in late August. Hindenburg has alleged \"accounting manipulation\" at Super Micro. Although the company has denied these allegations, it's also delayed the filing of its annual report and is reportedly facing an early stage probe from the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nThere's also concern that supply chains may hamper Super Micro Computer's ability to meet its clients' needs. Nvidia's H100 GPUs are in such high demand that Super Micro's rack servers may fall victim to supply backlogs.\n\nSuffice it to say that, despite its relative cheapness, Super Micro Computer is a risky wager for Englander and Millennium Management.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- The backdrop for US equities remains constructive heading into the third-quarter earnings season, according to analysts at UBS.\n\nIn a note to clients, the bank's strategists said stocks on Wall Street have been bolstered by a \"healthy\" economic picture and solid profit growth.\n\nSigns of cooling inflationary pressures, which have partly prompted the Federal Reserve to begin slashing interest rates down from more than two-decade highs, were also cited as a factor underpinning in results.\n\nThe outlook for corporate spending on artificial intelligence -- a key topic for markets for much of this year -- and monetization of the nascent technology both remain strong as well, the UBS analysts argued.\n\nFrothy valuations have proven to be one point of concern for some investors despite the stable economic background. The benchmark S&P 500's has a forward price to earnings ratio of 21.5, based on earnings estimates over the next 12 months.\n\nHowever, the UBS analysts said they believe valuations are still \"reasonable\", noting that \"things like earnings trends are much more important, and we think those will remain supportive.\"\n\n\"Overall, we think earnings results will confirm that the outlook for corporate profit growth remains healthy,\" the analysts wrote. \"This would be consistent with the recent easing in bank lending standards, which tends to be a good leading indicator for profit growth.\"\n\nEarnings per share growth for the S&P 500 is tipped to be between 5% to 7% in the third quarter, the UBS analysts predicted. Excluding energy stocks, which have been hit by weaker oil and gas prices, the figure is seen at 8% to 10%.\n\nProfit expansion is seen broadening out beyond the mega-cap growth stocks known as the \"Magnificent 7\", although these companies -- which include tech titans like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) -- remain on track to post over a 20% increase in income in the third quarter, the analysts said.\n\nMeanwhile, they reiterated their price targets for the S&P 500 of 5,900 and 6,200 for December 2024 and June 2025, respectively. The average closed at 5,815.03 on Friday.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBackdrop for US equities \"constructive\" ahead of latest earnings season - UBS\n\nMoon race, private competition in focus as space powers gather in Milan\n\nBASF downgraded to 'neutral' by UBS amid earnings growth concerns for 2025\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Where Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) Leader Nvidia Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "Chip and data center specialist Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has emerged as the king of the artificial intelligence (AI) realm. Quarter after quarter, the company continues to defy expectations, set revenue and profit records, and provide investors with a laundry list of such good news that it's hard to keep track of it all.\n\nIf you've held Nvidia stock at any point during the last two years, congratulations. You've probably made a lot of money.\n\nBut as I often express in my pieces, investors need to think long term. Can Nvidia's rocket ship keep climbing higher?\n\nBelow, I'll outline catalysts and risk factors facing Nvidia. Moreover, I'll detail how I think these points can impact the stock and assess how Nvidia shares may hold up over the next five years.\n\nThe next couple of years look great, but...\n\nOne of Nvidia's best-selling products at the moment is its H100 graphics processing unit (GPU). Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have both specifically referenced the importance of the H100 technology for their respective businesses' generative AI development.\n\nYet, despite the unrelenting demand for the H100, Nvidia is already on the brink of a successor chipset. The company's new Blackwell GPUs are set to launch later this year, and both Wall Street and Nvidia's own management are forecasting billions of additional dollars in sales by the end of the year.\n\nFurthermore, continued heavy spending on capital expenditures (capex) from the likes of Meta, Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet should serve as a nice tailwind for Nvidia's compute and networking business.\n\nWith all that in mind, Nvidia stock could be poised to see further gains over the next couple of years once Blackwell really hits its stride. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe longer-term picture is cloudy\n\nOne important detail to call out regarding more capex spending from big tech is that not all of this will be allocated toward Nvidia's products. Rather, each of the \"Magnificent Seven\" members highlighted above is working on their own in-house custom chip designs. In other words, Nvidia's own customers are looking to compete with the company and move away from a sweeping overreliance on its IT infrastructure.\n\nSuch a dynamic will likely be a headwind for Nvidia in terms of its pricing power. I suspect lower prices for Nvidia's GPUs will begin eating away at its revenue growth and gross profit margins. As revenue growth begins to normalize and margins start to shrink, Nvidia's profitability profile will tighten.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, rising competition could be the catalyst that ultimately leads to a plateau across Nvidia's entire business. For these reasons, I think the stock has a good chance of selling off in the long run.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nI'd like to make one thing abundantly clear: Nvidia stock likely has a solid runway ahead. However, as I've expressed before, I think timing will become a more important factor when assessing whether or not to buy or sell Nvidia shares. NVDA Chart\n\nIn other words, I do not think Nvidia stock will gain another 2,800% over the next five years. While the stock will go up at times, it's highly unlikely that shares will soar upwards in a straight line and experience minimal sell-offs.\n\nCandidly, I think these dynamics have been at the center of Nvidia's selling activity from several high-profile billionaires lately.\n\nWill Blackwell and whatever else Nvidia releases over the next five years be successful products? Probably. But will they be so successful that Nvidia will remain the king of the AI realm, with the rest of the tech world lucky just to get their hands on the company's products? In my opinion, I don't think that will be the case.\n\nFor these reasons, I think Nvidia's valuation will normalize over the next five years, and the stock may very well underperform its peers and the technology sector at large. I think there are more compelling opportunities in the chip industry and AI space more broadly. I would think long and hard before doubling down on a position in Nvidia over the next several years.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other profitable NASDAQ stocks.\n\nIs the Market Sentiment Still Bullish?\n\nRecent analysis indicates that an anticipated tech rally may be delayed until year-end, despite the S&P 500 achieving a remarkable 20% increase year-to-date. As September closed, the index rose by 1.6%, defying its historical volatility and showcasing market resilience. Positive macroeconomic indicators are emerging, with upward revisions to Q3 growth estimates and low jobless claims, suggesting a stable economic foundation.\n\nHowever, concerns about sustaining market momentum without new catalysts persist. Historically, stock prices and price-to-earnings multiples rise together unless disrupted by negative events. As the market approaches traditionally strong months following elections, expectations for a potential year-end rally are building. Despite elevated volatility and geopolitical tensions, investor caution remains. The NASDAQ 100 has surged significantly over the past two years, but this performance does not yet indicate speculative excess. In the last days of September, DataTrek Research co-founder, Nick Colas, joined CNBC to discuss the trading day and highlighted his outlook on the NASDAQ during the conversation. We covered his views in our article on the 10 Best Performing NASDAQ Stocks in 2024. Here's an excerpt from it:\n\n“...Over the past two years, the NASDAQ 100 has surged approximately 67%, marking a significant recovery since its lows in October two years ago. This performance is substantially above the historical average return of around 25%. Colas emphasized that while such returns are impressive, they do not yet indicate speculative excess; historically, a doubling of the NASDAQ over two years would signal potential trouble for investors.\n\nLooking back further, Colas noted that since peaking before the bear market in November 2021, the NASDAQ 100 has only risen about 20% over three years. This suggests that there may still be room for growth compared to prior bubbles when returns were much more pronounced within shorter time frames.”\n\nIn a recent discussion on October 9,  Jason Snipe, Odyssey Capital Advisors principal, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss the tech sector's mega-cap momentum, particularly in light of recent mega-cap stock downgrades and significant investor outflows. Despite these challenges, Jason Snipe noted that the tech sector is having a positive day, attributing this to a combination of improved earnings estimates across various sectors and substantial investments in AI-related capital expenditures. He emphasized that ~40% of operating cash flow is being allocated to AI, raising questions about when these investments will start to yield returns. This focus on AI has contributed to some recent downgrades but also suggests continued upside potential for select names within the sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nSnipe further defended the tech space by highlighting the profit margins of mega-cap stocks, which average over 23%, compared to just over 8.5% for other sectors. This discrepancy indicates a strong reason for ongoing capital inflows into tech and software companies that demonstrate earnings strength. He acknowledged that while there may be some consolidation and a slowdown in growth, he believes that investors' muscle memory will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.\n\nWhen discussing NVIDIA's recent performance, Snipe pointed to comments made by the CEO regarding the endless demand for their Blackwell chip as a significant catalyst for the stock's movement. He expressed confidence that it would exceed earnings expectations when they report later in the earnings season. However, Snipe also addressed concerns regarding Amazon, which has seen its stock decline for 8 of the last 9 days. He noted that its retail business appears to be struggling, with retail making up 62% of its operations. Despite this, he highlighted AWS as a bright spot, which reported a 19% year-over-year acceleration. He suggested that competition from other retailers could pressure its retail margins but remained optimistic about the company's diverse revenue streams, including advertising and subscription services.\n\nSnipe's analysis underscores the complexities facing the tech sector amid market volatility and evolving economic conditions. While challenges persist, particularly with mega-cap stocks experiencing downgrades, there are also significant opportunities driven by innovation and strong profit margins that could support continued growth in this space. As expert sentiments shift regarding MAG7 and other big tech stocks, other profitable tech companies are maintaining their positive momentum in the market.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe sifted through Finviz to compile an initial list of the top NASDAQ stocks. From that list, we narrowed our choices to 20 companies with positive TTM net income and 5-year net income compound annual growth rates. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nTTM Net Income: $53 billion\n\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 80.81%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are applied in gaming, artificial intelligence, data centers, and professional visualization. It's known for its innovative technology and its role in driving advancements in fields like machine learning and deep learning.\n\nImpax Asset Management, a $50 billion asset manager, has increased its stake in NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) after underestimating the company's potential. The firm believes the company is currently undervalued, considering the growing demand for its chips driven by the AI boom. Impax also sees the focus on energy efficiency as a positive factor from a climate perspective.\n\nThe company achieved significant growth in FQ2 2025, with revenue surging 122.40% from a year-ago period. The data center segment was the primary driver of this growth, with revenue increasing 54% due to strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers accounted for a significant portion of data center revenue, contributing to the company's impressive financial performance. Partnerships with healthcare institutions and increasing demand for AI-powered diagnostic solutions also played a role.\n\nIts technology is used by various companies, including NetApp, which recently unveiled a new AI-powered data solution in late September. Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, is also utilizing NVIDIA's H100 GPUs for its Colossal AI training system. Its focus on AI monetization and sustainability initiatives positions the company for long-term success. While the stock may seem expensive, its valuation is reasonable considering its growth prospects.\n\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Over the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA’s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA’s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the most profitable NASDAQ stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Invest In.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other profitable blue chip stocks.\n\nThe September inflation report came in hotter than expected and showed that it remains sticky. Headline inflation rose by 2.4%, slightly above the anticipated 2.3%, and down from 2.5% in August. Month-over-month, CPI increased by 0.2%, exceeding the forecast of 0.1%.\n\nCore inflation, excluding food and energy, also came in higher than expected at 3.3%, compared to the anticipated 3.2%, marking a slight increase from August. On a monthly basis, core CPI rose by 0.3%, which matched August’s figures but was above expectations of 0.2%.\n\nFollowing the report, the market is expecting a 25 basis points rate cut to no rate cuts in the upcoming Fed meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, 79.9% of interest rate traders expect the rate cuts to be at 450-475 bps at the coming Fed meeting while 20.1% expect the rate cut to stay the same. At the beginning of the month, 32.1% expected a 50 bps rate cut, while 67.9% anticipated a 25 bps cut.\n\nUnderstanding Inflation Trends and Federal Reserve Strategy\n\nDespite the sticky inflation, IBM's vice chair, Gary Cohn believes that the Fed will cut rates by 100 bps this year. In an interview at CNBC's ‘Money Movers',he suggested that the U.S. is experiencing what a soft landing looks like, with inflation decreasing but not steadily. He indicated that reaching the Fed's 2% target will be challenging, as inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around this level.\n\nCohn noted that for the first time in nearly two decades, the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate, employment, and price stability, after focusing primarily on one at a time. He believes the Fed is making the right decisions and is currently in a delicate position as it missed meeting opportunities this year.\n\nCohn expects that the Fed will implement a total of 100 basis points in rate cuts this year, likely consisting of 25 basis point reductions over the next couple of months. When asked about inflation targets, he expressed a preference for slightly exceeding the target inflation rate, suggesting that a rate of around 2.2% would be more acceptable in a growing economy than undershooting the target.\n\nCohn also highlighted concerns about geopolitical risks and said that global tensions could lead to inflationary pressures by disrupting supply chains and increasing shipping costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we use stock screeners to identify nearly 30 stocks above $100 billion market cap and $10 billion TTM net income. Next, we narrowed our list to 8 stocks that had a 5-year net income compound annual growth rate of above 10% and were most widely held by institutional investors. The most profitable blue chip stocks are listed in ascending order of the hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of 912 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nMarket Cap: $3.254 Trillion\n\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 80.81%\n\nTTM Net Income: $53.009 billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) focuses on graphics, computing, and networking solutions. It gained prominence with its breakthrough graphics processing units (GPUs), known for their ability to handle multiple tasks at once. While initially a significant player in the gaming industry, the company has since expanded into professional visualization, data centers, and automotive sectors. It is one of the most profitable blue chip stock.\n\nIt is one of the best stocks to buy and hold for the next decade. Its AI networking platform, Spectrum X, is projected to generate billions in revenue within a year. The company recently secured a deal with Salesforce, improving AI and data services for businesses. Additionally, the company launched Aerial, an AI tool designed to optimize wireless networks for next-gen technologies like 5G and autonomous systems.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) will announce its earnings in November and expects $32.5 billion in revenue for the fiscal third quarter of 2025, driven by its Hopper architecture and Blackwell chips. The company’s CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC that demand for the company's upcoming AI chip is “insane” with companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta eager to obtain it.\n\nOn October 10, The Fly reported that after a three-day roadshow with the CEO and CFO of the company, Morgan Stanley revealed that Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell NVL36/72 systems are in high demand and are sold out for the next year. The firm highlighted the long-term potential of accelerated computing and noted that the AI investment cycle is still in its early stages.\n\nMorgan Stanley maintained its Overweight rating on the company and set a $150 price target as the firm referenced strong market conditions and continued momentum for the company.\n\nIthaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the most profitable blue chip stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 2025?",
        "content": "The red-hot rally that started in shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) toward the end of 2022 is now almost two years old, and the chip giant has delivered 11x gains during this two-year period.\n\nSo, an investment of just $100 made in Nvidia stock a couple of years ago is now worth more than $1,100. More importantly, it appears that the company's phenomenal run could be sustainable in 2025 as well, thanks to the developments in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\n\nHere, we will take a closer look at the reasons why Nvidia's stunning run may continue next year.\n\nStrong Blackwell demand and improving supply will be tailwinds for Nvidia next year\n\nConsensus estimates forecast Nvidia to end the ongoing fiscal year 2025 with $125.5 billion in revenue, which would be a 125% increase from the previous year. However, analysts at KeyBanc are forecasting the company's revenue to come in at $130.6 billion in the current fiscal year (which will end in January 2025).\n\nKeyBanc points out that Nvidia is on track to deliver stronger growth this year thanks to the sales ramp of its new Blackwell AI processors. That's not surprising, as Nvidia management pointed out on the recent earnings conference call that it expects \"to get several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue\" in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nAt the same time, Nvidia believes that the sales of its current-generation Hopper chips, the H100 and H200 processors, are on track to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025 on the back of strong demand and improved supply. KeyBanc analysts also point out that the demand for these Hopper chips is extremely strong.\n\nEven better, Nvidia's suppliers are taking steps to ensure that the chip giant is able to fulfill more orders. For instance, contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn has announced that it is building the world's largest production facility for Nvidia's GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip. This particular chip consists of two of Nvidia's B200 Tensor Core GPUs (graphics processing units) that are connected to its Grace CPU (central processing unit).\n\nEach Nvidia GB200 Superchip is expected to be priced between $60,000 to $70,000. More importantly, the server systems manufactured using multiple GB200 Superchips are in robust demand. Nvidia reportedly increased its orders for the Blackwell GPUs by 25% in July this year, and Foxconn's announcement suggests that demand remains robust.\n\nMarket research firm TrendForce estimates that Nvidia could ship 60,000 units of GB200 NVL36 servers next year, and this particular configuration reportedly commands an average selling price of $1.8 million. What that means is that Nvidia may be able to sell $108 billion worth of its GB200 NVL36 servers next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Japanese investment bank Mizuho is forecasting sales of 6.5 million to 7 million units of Nvidia's AI graphics cards next year, suggesting that the company could pull in close to $200 billion in data center revenue in calendar 2025 (which will coincide with the majority of its fiscal 2026). If that indeed happens, Nvidia could be well on its way to smashing analysts' revenue expectations for the next fiscal year.\n\nThe stock seems built for more upside in 2025\n\nAs the chart shows us, analysts are expecting Nvidia to clock $177 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe estimate has moved substantially higher as the year has progressed. So, there is a good chance that it could indeed breach the $200 billion mark going forward, considering the potential revenue that Nvidia is expected to generate from sales of its data center chips alone. That healthy jump in Nvidia's revenue is set to translate into impressive earnings growth as well.\n\nAnalysts are expecting Nvidia to post $4.02 in earnings in fiscal 2026, up 41% from this year's projected earnings of $2.84 per share. However, next year's earnings estimate has moved up significantly in the past 90 days. Three months ago, consensus estimates were projecting $3.69 per share in earnings from Nvidia for the next fiscal year.\n\nIn all, Nvidia seems well placed to sustain its healthy growth next year as well. The stock has a median 12-month price target of $150, per 65 analysts covering it, pointing toward a 13% upside from current levels. However, the Street-high 12-month price target of $203 would translate into 53% gains from where this AI stock is right now, and it won't be surprising to see Nvidia approaching that mark in 2025 thanks to the points discussed.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe investor appetite for big food stocks is as thin as I was back in the mid-1980s.\n\nNote in that time period I was about five years old.\n\n\"From a generalist investor standpoint, I would say it has been pretty quiet [around packaged food names]. Your typical kind of institutional money has been quieter in the space,\" youthful, energetic packaged food analyst at Bank of America Peter Galbo said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nThe way Galbo explained it to me, investors are in search of faster-growth stocks ahead of a prolonged stretch of Fed rate cuts. Think of the desire to devour Nvidia (NVDA) shares on any dip, as opposed to eating up General Mills (GIS) on a pullback.\n\nYou can easily see that in some Yahoo Finance-sourced data.\n\nNvidia's stock is up a sizzling 168% year to date. General Mills is only up 10%. PepsiCo (PEP) and Conagra Brands (CAG) are both up roughly 2%. Hormel (HRL) is down 4%.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up 21% this year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) 13%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) 20%.\n\nBut as I digested (pun intended) my in-depth chat with Galbo, I think there are a few other fundamental reasons that are keeping these companies out of investor shopping baskets (pun also intended).\n\nYour shopping list of explanations:\n\nThe companies are still too big inside an investing world that's no longer rewarding the conglomerate model. Investors want focused strategies executing at the highest level. For instance, does Conagra Brands need to be selling frozen food and also hawking Slim Jim and Duke's meat snacks? Should Spam maker Hormel have purchased the Planters nut business from Kraft Heinz (KHC) a few years ago? The companies want to get even bigger despite investors not rewarding the play! Conagra Brands just purchased the Fatty meat snacks line. The company now has the meat snacks market cornered with Slim Jim, Duke's, and Fatty. Galbo tells me meat snacks are a growth category in snacking. Fair, but I question why one must own three meat snack brands! The companies are slow to slim down their slower-growth businesses. Only recently did General Mills sell off its North American yogurt business for $2 billion. Campbell Soup is hunting for a buyer for the Noosa yogurt business it got with its Rao's business. I didn't get the sense from Hormel's latest earnings call it's going to sell the Planters business amid signs the deal may not be working out as planned. Consumers are pissed off at Big Food for its pricing strategies and are voicing their views by purchasing less. You saw that in PepsiCo's volumes this week. The cumulative effects of four years of inflation continue to pressure so many households. Buying snacks is now a luxury. Traffic at convenience store stores has really trailed off the past year for economic reasons, but shopping has also shifted to club stores such as Costco (COST). Convenience store channels need to be doing well for a lot of food players to do well. The Ozempic threat on the long-term health of Big Food earnings power is rising every single day as new users of these drugs enter the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nBonus reason: The stocks aren't valued for the realities listed above. They are still being seen as defensive value plays since the companies sell food.\n\nThat's the wrong way to think about it, I believe — it's hard to defend Hormel trading at almost 19 times forward earnings, which isn't too far removed from the S&P 500's forward multiple around 21 times. An old rule of thumb in investing is that a 15 times forward P/E multiple is on the attractive side (I caution this is not always the case and each company is unique, so don't use my line as gospel).\n\nThen, there is raw commentary that I would argue is weighing on the sector's multiples.\n\nFirst up: These companies have become political punching bags this election season. Vice President Kamala Harris has vowed to tackle price gouging by Big Food if she wins the White House in November.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren has been making the rounds talking about shrinkflation and taking food companies to task for it.\n\nAll of this rhetoric doesn't exactly embolden investors to go search for diamonds in the rough in the food space.\n\nThere is also what we are hearing from consumer company executives, which suggests a strong rebound in sales and earnings isn't guaranteed in 2025.\n\n\"We see that [the] consumer is very challenged, and that the consumer is making a lot of decisions. They're optimizing their full budget, so they might be cutting on food to pay for their subscriptions, or they might be cutting on food to go to see movies on the weekend. Really, there is a lot of trade-offs they're making when it comes to food.\" PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta told me this past week moments after earnings hit the wires.\n\nThe company trimmed its full-year sales outlook.\n\nThis aligns with what Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon told me last week at the retailer's Bentonville, Ark., HQ.\n\n\"People at lower income levels are always more challenged. They have to make trade-off decisions, and that's been, I think, more acute since this inflationary cycle on the heels of the pandemic. So, a household income below $100,000 feels pressure in a way that they might not have a few years ago, and you can see that in their behavior. And we are trying to get prices down ... some of the more stubborn inflation has been in the prepared foods, dry grocery type, consumable categories, like paper goods, cleaning supplies,\" McMillon said.\n\nI wish Big Food well in regaining the hunger of investors. After all, these companies do feed the planet. It will be tough, however.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Morgan Stanley Highlights Strong AI Investment Cycle, Blackwell Systems Sold Out for 12 Months",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nAs the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHoward Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Morgan Stanley has an Overweight rating and $150 price target on the stock. After having hosted NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress and other members of the management team for a three day non-deal roadshow, Morgan Stanley said the meetings highlighted both the magnitude and length of the accelerated computing runway and every indication from management is that we are still early in a long term AI investment cycle. Blackwell systems NVL36/72 remain the best solution for inference interactions requiring substantially more computation and the Blackwell ramp is progressing on schedule with that product sold out for the next 12 months, pointing to continued strong conditions, said the advisory.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "What's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy if Trump Wins in November?",
        "content": "Only once in U.S. history has a former president who lost reelection after his first term managed to become president again. The last time it happened was in 1892 when Grover Cleveland became the first -- and, so far, only -- president elected for two non-consecutive terms.\n\nBut Cleveland might soon have company. Former President Donald Trump is running neck-and-neck with Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race. If elected, his policies could impact the businesses of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" companies: Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). What's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump wins in November? Former President Donald Trump. Image source: Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead.\n\nTrump's proposals that could impact the Magnificent Seven\n\nThree major Trump proposals could impact the Magnificent Seven the most. The GOP presidential nominee's proposed corporate tax cuts arguably belong at the top of the list.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump signed legislation that overhauled the federal corporate tax rate structure. Previously, large corporations paid federal taxes of 15% to 35%. After the Trump tax cuts, these businesses paid a flat tax of 21%. The former president wants to slash this rate to 15% if he's elected again.\n\nAnother key part of Trump's economic policy for a potential second term is the implementation of across-the-board tariffs. He promises to impose tariffs of up to 20% on all imported products. Trump, who has referred to himself as \"Tariff Man,\" wants to impose tariffs of 60% on goods imported from China. He has also threatened to enact tariffs of 100% on products made in Mexico.\n\nWhen Trump was president before, he was a fan of deregulation. Reducing federal regulations is likely to be a major focus again if he returns to the White House. Trump wants to eliminate 10 existing regulations for every new regulation. One promise that's especially relevant to the Magnificent Seven is his pledge to repeal an executive order signed by President Biden that regulates artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nHow the Magnificent Seven could be affected\n\nPaying less in federal taxes should be good for all the Magnificent Seven. However, the impact of Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts perhaps won't be as great as it might seem. As the following table shows, none of these giant companies pay the 21% federal tax rate in place now.\n\nCompany Effective Tax Rate in the Last Fiscal Year Alphabet 13.9% Amazon 9.7% Apple 14.7% Meta Platforms 17.6% Microsoft 18.0% Nvidia 12.0% Tesla (50% Tax Benefit)\n\nData sources: Company 10-K filings. *Tesla received more tax benefits than it paid in taxes in 2023.\n\nSteeper tariffs could especially impact the Magnificent Seven companies that rely on imported products and components. Although the companies would probably pass the increased costs along to consumers, the higher prices could negatively impact sales.\n\nApple would likely be the hardest hit by tariffs because of its global supply chain. All the others could also feel some effects of higher tariffs. The Magnificent Seven members that generate more revenue from services, particularly Alphabet and Meta, would probably be the least impacted by Trump's proposed tariffs.\n\nWhat about Trump's deregulation focus? I think the major cloud service providers -- Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- could be helped by reduced AI regulations. So would Nvidia and, perhaps to a lesser extent, Meta and Tesla.\n\nHowever, Trump has specifically criticized Alphabet, telling Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo in a recent interview, \"Google has been very bad. They've been very irresponsible. And I have a feeling that Google's going to be close to shut down, because I don't think Congress is going to take it.\" The former president has also called Meta's Facebook \"a true enemy of the people\" in a social media post.\n\nAnd while Tesla CEO Elon Musk supports Trump for president, Trump's proposed policies could hurt Tesla. The GOP presidential nominee has railed against federal incentives for electric vehicles in the past. On the other hand, he told an audience at one of his rallies, \"I'm for electric cars. I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\"\n\nThe best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump wins\n\nSo, what's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump wins in November? I think it's a close contest between Microsoft and Nvidia.\n\nMicrosoft might be helped more by Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts because it pays the highest effective tax rate of the Magnificent Seven companies. Both Microsoft and Nvidia could be hurt to some extent by the former president's tariffs but helped by his regulatory stance. Neither has been singled out for attacks by Trump as Alphabet and Meta have nor have the industries in which they operate been the target of his ire like Tesla.\n\nI believe Nvidia has stronger growth prospects than Microsoft, though. If I had to pick just one Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump returns to the White House, I would buy Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Microsoft, Amazon rating cuts; Robotaxi day disappoints",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nMicrosoft downgraded at Oppenheimer\n\nOppenheimer analysts downgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock from Outperform to Perform on Tuesday, citing concerns about elevated consensus expectations for both revenue and earnings.\n\nA key issue raised by the firm’s analysts is potential losses stemming from Microsoft's AI partner, OpenAI, which is expected to post a loss of around $5 billion this year. With Microsoft holding a 49% stake, the company could face significant financial impact as a result.\n\nThe downgrade also highlighted slower-than-expected enterprise adoption of AI technologies, which could lead to lower-than-anticipated revenue from AI-related services.\n\nIn addition, Oppenheimer pointed to rising capital expenditures (CapEx), particularly in high-performance computing, such as GPUs and data centers. The firm estimates that Microsoft's CapEx will hit $63 billion by 2025, a 14% year-over-year increase and double what it spent in 2023. Depreciation is also expected to rise by 28%, reaching $29 billion.\n\nThe analysts mentioned that the Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point interest rate cut in September, will likely have a modest effect on Microsoft’s net interest income from its $76 billion cash reserve.\n\nOppenheimer also expressed concerns over Microsoft’s gross and EBITDA margins, which are expected to decline due to rising depreciation and operational costs linked to AI investments.\n\n“This will translate into 3% EPS growth in 1Q25 and we expect weakish guidance for 2025. We also think the Street estimates for EPS growth are ~200bps too high in FY26 and FY27,” analysts said in a note.\n\nFurther risks include potential bottlenecks in data center capacity to meet anticipated GPU shipments and growing competition in the AI space, with other companies narrowing the gap on Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft’s stock currently trades in the middle of its five-year price-to-earnings range of 25x-35x, though Oppenheimer suggests it could drift toward the lower end of that spectrum.\n\nGoldman hikes Nvidia price target after meeting with leadership\n\nGoldman Sachs raised its price target for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $150 from $135 on Friday, reflecting an 11% potential upside.\n\nFollowing a recent investor meeting with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress, and IR representative Stewart Stecker, Goldman Sachs analysts expressed stronger confidence in Nvidia's competitive positioning, particularly as inference workloads become more complex.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We came away from the NDR with a better appreciation of the company's competitive moat and, importantly, the projected increase in Inference workload complexity as well as its implications for future compute demand,\" the bank noted.\n\nGoldman Sachs highlighted several factors underpinning Nvidia’s competitive advantage, including its large installed base, innovation at both the chip and data center levels, and its expanding software offerings.\n\nThe report specifically mentioned domain-specific libraries like Nvidia Parabricks, used for genomics analysis, and Nvidia AI Aerial, which supports cloud-native 5G networks.\n\nThe firm also raised its revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates for FY2026/27 by 7% and 8%, respectively. This adjustment reflects higher cloud capex, strong AI server orders, and an improved outlook for chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) at TSMC.\n\nWells Fargo cuts Amazon rating, price target\n\nWells Fargo cut Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rating to Equal Weight from Overweight earlier in the week, pointing out several challenges that could halt the company’s positive earnings revision momentum.\n\nThe bank also reduced its price target for Amazon to $183 from $225.\n\nAlthough Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains a strong performer, Wells Fargo stated it is \"not enough\" to drive upward estimate revisions in the near term.\n\nKey concerns include Amazon's investments in Project Kuiper, pressure from Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fees, and slowing growth from its advertising business.\n\nThe firm also warned that \"margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well\" and suggested that positive revisions may not return until Amazon issues guidance in July 2025.\n\n“While the market is more prepared for pressure on 4Q OI, we caution that margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well. As such, we move to Equal Weight until visibility into margin expansion resumes,” Wells Fargo’s team wrote.\n\nMoreover, Wells Fargo cut its operating income (OI) estimates for Amazon by $5.4 billion, $4.5 billion, and $5.5 billion for 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively, attributing the reductions to slower monetization of its merchant services and advertising businesses.\n\n\"Amazon remains a margin expansion story,\" according to the bank, but it noted that the rate of this expansion will likely be slower than what the market currently anticipates.\n\nThe note also highlighted rising competition from Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which has priced its fulfillment services 15% lower than Amazon's FBA, adding pressure to Amazon’s market share.\n\nMorgan Stanley disappointed with Robotaxi event\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts voiced disappointment following Tesla's much-anticipated \"We, Robot\" event this week, citing a lack of key information about Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, ride-sharing economics, and a clear go-to-market strategy for autonomous vehicles.\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares dropped nearly 9% Friday, as several analysts pointed to the absence of detailed updates during the event.\n\nTesla did reveal its upcoming \"Cybercab,\" but Morgan Stanley remarked that the presentation lacked meaningful new insights. \"We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation,\" analysts said in a note.\n\nAhead of the event, Morgan Stanley had anticipated significant updates on Tesla’s FSD technology, such as measurable improvements in miles driven without disengagements, but these specifics were not provided.\n\nThe Wall Street firm also expected details on the strategy behind the company's supervised and unsupervised ride-sharing services, including economic analysis and estimates for the total addressable market (TAM).\n\n\"We had expected at least some incremental information around the 'rate of change' of the FSD system,\" it explained.\n\nFurthermore, the event did not provide any meaningful discussion on Tesla’s collaboration with xAI or updates on Tesla’s \"Master Plan 4,\" leaving Morgan Stanley analysts to conclude that the event failed to significantly move forward Tesla’s narrative as an AI-focused company.\n\nGeopolitical tensions could ‘prick the AI bubble’\n\nCapital Economics warned in a Friday note that escalating trade disputes between the US and China, or a sharp rise in tensions between China and Taiwan, represent significant geopolitical risks that could “prick the AI bubble.”\n\nWhile tech stocks have seen strong performance this year, the firm cautioned that the rally could stall as geopolitical risks intensify, especially with the US presidential election approaching.\n\nA central concern is Taiwan’s critical role in the AI supply chain. Taiwanese companies control around 90% of the market for advanced chips and AI servers, key drivers of the AI capital expenditure boom among major tech firms.\n\nAccording to Capital Economics, any disruption in this supply chain due to geopolitical conflict could have severe consequences.\n\n\"China could restrict the flow of highly advanced semiconductor chips and AI servers from Taiwan to the US, thereby breaking the 'AI supply chain,'\" the firm emphasized in a note.\n\nOn the US-China trade front, the report points to potential risks of heightened tensions after the 2024 US presidential election.\n\nIf Donald Trump returns to office, strategists anticipate \"a significant increase in tariffs on Chinese goods\" and a broader shift away from free trade, which would raise costs for tech companies. Even under a Harris administration, which is expected to maintain current export controls, there is still considerable risk to the tech sector.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Microsoft, Amazon rating cuts; Robotaxi day disappoints\n\nMoon race, private competition in focus as space powers gather in Milan\n\nBASF downgraded to 'neutral' by UBS amid earnings growth concerns for 2025\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in October",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market has created some monster growth stocks already, but companies involved in enabling this technological revolution are still seeing growing opportunities. Here are two AI leaders that could be profitable investments over the next year and beyond.\n\n1. C3.ai\n\nC3.ai's (NYSE: AI) recent growth has been overshadowed by the stellar performance at Palantir Technologies, but investors shouldn't overlook C3. It recently reported accelerating revenue increases for the sixth consecutive quarter, which could set the stage for excellent returns over the next year.\n\nC3.ai continues to expand its sales in North America and Europe. In the latest fiscal quarter, it closed 71 agreements. New deals were forged with several clients, including GSK (formerly GlaxoSmithKline), Dolce & Gabbana, and the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nIt's also expanding its footprint across state and local governments, with 25 agreements across several states, including Texas, California, and Florida.\n\nAll these deals are clear signs that C3.ai's momentum is real. Customers are seeing cost savings using generative AI, and its customer service could solidify long-term relationships with these clients.\n\nDespite the momentum, the stock has drifted down for most of the year. One factor hurting it is C3.ai's weak profitability. Management's guidance calls for a full-year adjusted loss from operations between $95 million and $125 million, which is a lot compared to its revenue guidance of $370 million to $395 million.\n\nStill, the stock appears poised to rebound. The company's net loss is improving year over year, and it's reasonable to expect a profit down the road as the business continues to grow. If investors give the company credit for strong revenue growth, as they did for Palantir over a year ago, C3.ai's share price could rocket higher over the next year.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best ways to invest in the AI boom in recent years. It is a pure-play on the growing demand for AI-optimized computing hardware. With data centers still in the early stages of upgrading components for AI workloads, Nvidia is still a solid buy.\n\nThomas Siebel, the CEO of C3.ai, made a comment on his company's last earnings call that speaks to the opportunity for Nvidia. Siebel said that it is very difficult to model the demand trends happening in the AI market right now. He said his company is seeing interest in enterprise AI from organizations it didn't anticipate, including law firms and medical diagnostic companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is seeing similar trends. While cloud service providers generated nearly half of its $26 billion in data center revenue last quarter, it is also experiencing strong demand from AI start-ups building generative AI applications for consumers, healthcare, education, and advertising.\n\nAI developers want to use Nvidia because it is the largest supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs), and its chips are used to power every cloud service. There are 4.7 million developers using Nvidia's CUDA computing platform, which provides access to software development kits and other tools designed to work with its GPUs.\n\nThe stock is trading at an attractive forward price-to-earnings ratio of 34 based next year's consensus earnings estimate. That is a steal for a company expected to grow earnings by 36% on an annualized basis.\n\nOne factor holding down the valuation of the stock is that semiconductor companies can experience pauses in demand, which happened to Nvidia in 2018 and 2022. But investors who buy its stock with the intention of holding for the long term should see market-beating returns.\n\nThe demand for AI technology in data centers will continue to grow over the next decade. This should benefit Nvidia, since it controls over 70% of the AI chip market, and it has expanding revenue opportunities in data-center networking hardware and software.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,266!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $43,047!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $389,794!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 7, 2024\n\nJohn Ballard has positions in Nvidia.

        "title": "Should You Buy or Sell Nvidia Stock?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best-performing stocks on the market over the past two years, and the catalysts that drove it higher are still present. But after its strong run-up, is Nvidia stock still a smart buy at its current level, or would those who hold shares be advised to sell and take some profits?\n\nThere are valid arguments for both views.\n\nThe sell argument: How long will this demand wave last?\n\nNvidia's rise has been directly tied to the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race. Its primary products are graphics processing units (GPUs) -- parallel processors that excel at handling large and complex computing tasks that are easily broken down into many smaller ones that can be handled independently and simultaneously. Connect GPUs in clusters and you end up with a computing platform that can process certain types of incredibly complex workloads at blistering speeds -- and these are just the sorts of workloads that AI systems create.\n\nAs AI companies and cloud computing providers rushed to get in front of the emerging demand for processing power, Nvidia's sales went through the roof. In the past couple of years, quarterly revenues have often tripled on a year-over-year basis. However, its stellar growth is starting to slow slightly due to tougher annualized comparisons. This growth slowdown makes sense, but the bigger question is, can Nvidia maintain its overall sales at these levels?\n\nBecause companies are buying these GPUs to rapidly build their AI computing capacity, there is going to be a time when the demand will be satisfied. At that point, Nvidia's sales may crater, as companies will only be buying replacement GPUs or making gradual capacity increases. This could be a huge problem for Nvidia, as its revenue levels in its latest quarters are far above where they have been in the past. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis also highlights the cyclical nature of the chip business. Nvidia has gone through multiple boom-and-bust cycles in its life as a company. If AI-related demand wanes, investors could be in a rough spot.\n\nBut has Nvidia built up enough of a sales base to compensate for that cyclicality?\n\nThe buy argument: New technology will spur further demand past 2025\n\nGPUs don't last forever. They generally need to be replaced after about three to five years, which means that if the companies that have been building out their computing infrastructure recently want to maintain that processing power over the long term, they will have to regularly fork out massive chunks of money on new hardware.\n\nWe're two years into the AI build-out already, and many companies are still scaling up their AI computing power, so 2025 will be another year of strong demand. That gets investors to 2026, at which point the natural replacement cycle starts for the GPUs that were purchased at the start of the generative AI era. But there could also be more reasons for companies to upgrade.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst, the semiconductor chips within these Nvidia GPUs are produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). Taiwan Semi is always innovating on the process node front, allowing chip designers like Nvidia to create denser, higher-performance chips.\n\nTSMC expects that its chips built using its next-generation N2 process node will be 25% to 30% more power efficient than prior-generation chips when configured at the same speeds. Energy costs are a huge operating expense for server farms, so some customers may choose to upgrade for that reason, regardless of whether they need more computing power or not. The N2 manufacturing lines aren't expected to start production until 2025, which likely means Nvidia GPUs built on them won't make their way to its customers in quantity until 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia is just launching its Blackwell architecture GPUs, which will replace the Hopper architecture upon which it has built its current top-of-the-line chips, and the improvements are astounding. Blackwell's architecture is four times faster than Hopper's, allowing AI companies to create more complex models faster.\n\nThe combination of all these factors points to demand remaining strong well past 2026. In other words, the market probably isn't peaking any time soon. This is key, as Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio has already reached levels that are starting to look reasonable, at least relative to how fast it's growing. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nTrading at 45 times forward earnings, Nvidia stock is far from cheap, but it's putting up strong growth, so this valuation is acceptable.\n\nInvestors' decisions about whether to buy or sell Nvidia stock today should be based on how they expect the company's business to be faring in 2026 and beyond. There are enough catalysts out there that Nvidia's growth should last far beyond 2026, and with the upgrade cycle, it should be able to maintain its newfound revenue levels.\n\nAs a result, I think Nvidia's buy case is greater than its sell case today.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Nvidia's stock value has ballooned by an incredible $400 billion in just five days, causing quite the stir in tech and investment circles.\n\nNow at a staggering $3.26 trillion, as per Business Insider Africa, Nvidia has soared past many competitors, though it remains behind Apple and Microsoft in terms of global market capitalization. That $400 billion increase alone surpasses the entire market value of Costco, which is roughly $250 billion, even though the retail giant posted an impressive $254 billion in revenue last year.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare? This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\n\nThe massive surge is largely thanks to Nvidia's AI-focused chips. The newly launched Blackwell chip, designed specifically for artificial intelligence, has been dubbed a game-changer. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called it “the engine to power this new industrial revolution.” Major tech players like Microsoft, Oracle and Google seem to be on the same page, pouring their support into Nvidia's technology and betting on its future impact.\n\nTrending: ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\nIn 2024 alone, Nvidia's stock jumped by 170% and since early 2023, its growth has been nothing short of explosive – up 800%, as per Reuters. The financial numbers are jaw-dropping. While Costco generated $7.4 billion in net income last year, Nvidia boasted a whopping $30 billion in profit from $61 billion in revenue. This speaks volumes about how profitable the tech space has become, especially compared to traditional powerhouses like Costco.\n\nJensen Huang, now worth $106 billion, is at the heart of Nvidia's extraordinary run. With his focus on AI chip development, Nvidia has cemented itself as a key player in the ongoing AI revolution.\n\nTrending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\nBeth Kindig from I/O Fund speculated that Nvidia could hit a valuation of $10 trillion by 2030 thanks to its then-anticipated Blackwell GPU chip, supported by its CUDA software platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ripple effects of Nvidia's success are hard to miss. The “Magnificent Seven” tech giants – Meta, Alphabet, Apple, among others – are all riding the AI wave, with Nvidia's technology fueling their stock's demand by 1%. AI integration is becoming a major part of daily life and Nvidia's chips are a crucial piece of that puzzle, pushing the tech market to even greater heights.\n\nBut not everyone is cheering. Some experts have voiced concerns about the growing reliance on Nvidia in the chip industry. The worry is that if Nvidia becomes too dominant, it could lead to supply bottlenecks and increased prices, ultimately hurting competition.\n\nRead Next:\n\nBeating the market through ethical real estate investing' — this platform aims to give tenants equity in the homes they live in while scoring 17.17% average annual returns for investors – here’s how to join with just $100 This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "title": "The Newest Artificial Intelligence Stock Has Arrived -- and It Claims to Make Chips That Are 20x Faster Than Nvidia",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has amassed close to a $3.2 trillion market cap, making it one of the world's largest chipmakers. It now consumes more than 6% of the broader benchmark S&P 500 index. Over the last five years, Nvidia has grown annual revenue by 458% and the stock is up an incredible 2,009%. Given the potential for AI to disrupt life as we know it, it's understandable that investors are so excited about the stock.\n\nBut the lure of these kinds of gains is naturally going to attract competition. Now, one of Nvidia's competitors is planning an initial public offering (IPO) and claiming to manufacture chips that can vastly outperform Nvidia at a fraction of the price. Let's take a look.\n\n20x better than Nvidia?\n\nLast week, the AI chipmaker Cerebras filed its registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with the intent to go public. In a press release from 2021, Cerebras said it had a valuation of $4 billion after a $250 million series F financing round. The company is targeting a $1 billion IPO at a $7 billion to $8 billion valuation.\n\nIn its registration statement, Cerebras cites Nvidia as a competitor, as well as other large AI companies such as Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Here is a description of what Cerebras does:\n\nWe design processors for AI training and inference. We build AI systems to power, cool, and feed the processors data. We develop software to link these systems together into industry-leading supercomputers that are simple to use, even for the most complicated AI work, using familiar ML frameworks like PyTorch. Customers use our supercomputers to train industry-leading models. We use these supercomputers to run inference at speeds unobtainable on alternative commercial technologies.\n\nCerebras' pitch is that bigger is better. That's because the company has designed a chip that is the size of a full silicon wafer, and the largest ever sold. The company believes that the size advantage leads to less time moving data. Furthermore, Cerebras has a flexible business model in which clients can buy Cerebras products to have at their facilities or through a consumption-based subscription through the company's cloud infrastructure.\n\nCerebras clearly wants investors to compare, or at least associate, the company with Nvidia. Nvidia is mentioned 12 times in the registration statement. Cerebras also provides a side-by-side comparison of its Wafer-Scale Engine-3 chip versus Nvidia's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU), which is considered the most powerful GPU on the market.\n\nStory continues Image source: Cerebras registration statement.\n\nCerebras CEO Andrew Feldman publicly said the company's inference offering is 20 times faster than Nvidia's at a fraction of the price. In 2023, Cerebras generated about $78.7 million of revenue, up 220% year over year. Through the first half of 2024, Cerebras has grown revenue to $136.4 million. The company still hasn't earned a profit, having reported a nearly $67 million loss through the first half of 2024. These numbers also pale in comparison to Nvidia, which recently reported second-quarter revenue of $30 billion and a profit of roughly $16.6 billion.\n\nWill Cerebras make a splash?\n\nWith big publicity from news publications and claims of being 20 times faster than Nvidia, I think it's safe to say that Cerebras already has and will continue to make a splash.\n\nDepending on the excitement investment bankers can drum up during the company's road show and market conditions, I wouldn't be surprised to see Cerebras go public at a higher valuation than expected. AI has been all the buzz and the IPO market has been flat for a few years now, so there could be pent-up demand on Wall Street.\n\nWill Cerebras overtake Nvidia? Only time will tell. Its product offerings are impressive, but it still has a ways to go to get its financial profile in line with Nvidia. Furthermore, there may be some advantages to Nvidia having smaller chips and it remains to be seen whether Cerebras can compete with Nvidia's software language CUDA -- although the company does say that its software program \"eliminates the need for low-level programming in CUDA.\"\n\nWhile everything sounds great, there is likely still a \"show me\" component to this story. After all, the bulk of Cerebras' revenue comes from one customer. Nvidia also has a leading market share in the AI chip space and relationships with many large clients. Who's to say Nvidia couldn't use its size -- and likely resource -- advantage to develop a similar large wafer chip? There's a lot left to play out, but this could be one of the more interesting developments for market watchers to pay attention to.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other Most Promising Growth Stock According to Hedge Funds.\n\nBull Market and Investor Sentiment\n\nInvestors had been anxiously anticipating the start of a bull market, which the S&P 500 confirmed earlier this year. The bull run has seen the market continue to rise to new record highs, supporting revenue and earnings growth across the board.\n\nFast forward, the upward momentum appears to have peaked, with market indices at record highs. While it was highly expected that stocks would explode on the Federal Reserve offering support to a struggling economy with interest rate cuts, that has not been the case.\n\nREAD ALSO: David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy and 7 Best Nanotech Penny Stocks to Buy.\n\nIt’s become increasingly clear that investors have become more sensitive to growth scares as the global economy faces many issues. Top on the list is the rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that threaten to disrupt supply chain networks. Energy prices rising owing to the escalation of a full-blown war could trigger higher inflation, something that is unsettling the markets.\n\nAnalysts at UBS are already warning investors that they should get overweight on defensive names as global growth slows at the back of deteriorating fundamentals. While UBS doesn’t anticipate a severe downturn, the bank is cautious, advising its clients to focus on important sectors like utilities and pharmaceuticals, which always outperform in a downturn.\n\nWhile investors are increasingly rotating into defensive plays amid concerns about geopolitical tensions and the slowing global economy, Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s Andrew Slimmon recommends against this strategy.\n\n“Now is the time to just be cautious. Don’t chase the defensives that are working because I think when we get to the fourth quarter, that won’t work,” the portfolio manager told CNBC’s “The Exchange.\n\n“While our expectation is for October to remain choppy, we don’t view the overall market action to be bearish and encourage investors to maintain perspective on the longer-term trends,” Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, wrote to clients.\n\nThe sentiments echo the need to focus on high-growth companies. Investors who diversify their portfolio into high-growth companies eventually earn great returns regardless of how much a stock rises or falls in the short term.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts project that S&P 500 stocks will grow at a median annual EPS rate of 8.5% over the next five years. On the other hand, the best growth stocks are well poised to outperform this benchmark by a factor of two to three or more.\n\nFor starters, companies exposed to artificial intelligence spectacles or those leveraging technology continue to deliver record earnings and revenue growth, thus dominating most hedge fund portfolios. Additionally, the most promising growth stocks, according to hedge funds, are those whose core business would be positively impacted by improving consumer purchasing power. As the Fed steers the economy into a soft landing, consumer purchasing is expected to improve, benefiting consumer cyclical stocks. Moreover, the rate cuts will likely benefit growth and tech stocks as well.\n\nMarket fluctuations are inevitable, but the secret to a growth stock’s success lies in the robustness of its core operations. Regardless of whether a stock is rising or falling in the short term, if you consistently invest in a competitively solid business, you’ll eventually reap substantial rewards.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the most promising growth stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to find 30 popular growth stocks. Then we selected the 10 that were the most widely held by hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nWhen it comes to artificial intelligence, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stays ahead of the pack owing to the strong demand for its graphic processing units used to power various AI models. The artificial intelligence frenzy has powered the company to become the most valuable company in the world on the back of record-breaking revenues and earnings.\n\nRevenue in the second quarter was up 122% to $30 billion as net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion. The company expects Q3 revenue to increase 80% to $32.5 billion. Given the rate at which the company’s earnings and revenues are growing while the artificial intelligence frenzy is all but starting, underlines why it is one of the most promising growth stocks according to hedge funds.\n\nWhile NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has gained significantly over the past year, causing the stock to trade at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 34, there is still room for more gains. The stock could hit another all-time high due to the ‘insane’ demand for the company’s new Blackwell chip.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang said “It [Blackwell] gives us an opportunity to triple down, to really drive the innovation cycle so that we can increase capabilities, increase our throughput, decrease our costs, and decrease our energy consumption.”\n\nGiven that the company has delivered five straight quarters of triple-digit percentage revenue growth, the trend is not expected to change. The Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 50 basis points and hinting at further cuts should make it easy for companies investing in AI, fueling additional demand for Nvidia chips.\n\nThe market experienced a strong tailwind for AI chips, and the expansion of data centers translates to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s booming business. The company’s own guidance calls for 79% in revenue growth in the current quarter, affirming the tremendous opportunities in the market.\n\nWith NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s board approving an additional $50 billion in share buybacks last summer, there’s a strong belief that the stock is worth considering. It is one of the stocks rated as a buy with an average price target of $152.44, implying a 14.60% upside potential.\n\nBased on our Insider Monkey database, by the end of Q2 2024, 179 investors held a positive outlook on NVDA, collectively holding stakes worth $53.7 billion.\n\nIthaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefited from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang recently made a big statement about the future of AI in the United States. Speaking at a Bipartisan Policy Center event, Huang told U.S. government groups, like the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Defense (DOD), that they need to get serious about artificial intelligence. His main point? The U.S. shouldn't just be making rules about AI – it should be leading the way in making and using it. Huang wants the government to build an AI supercomputer as an important step to boost innovation.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.

He believes that the DOE and DOD should not just be setting policies for AI, but actively participating in its advancement. “Don’t just be a governor of AI, be a practitioner of AI,” he stressed.\n\nAccording to Huang, a powerful AI supercomputer would revolutionize science and engineering by enabling the creation of novel algorithms that would increase American competitiveness abroad. The AI supercomputer has the potential to help with anything from national security to scientific progress.\n\nTrending: ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\nHe explained that intelligence – both natural and artificial – is a critical resource that no country should outsource or limit. “No country in the world would say we should outsource our intelligence to anybody else. No country in the world would say we have an abundance of intelligence; let’s put a lid on this,” Huang pointed out.\n\nIn other words, the United States must continue to advance its AI capabilities if it wants to maintain its global leadership position.

        "title": "Could Buying SoundHound AI Now Be Like Buying Nvidia in 2023?",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been an absolutely incredible performer recently. Since the start of 2023, it rose by more than 800%. Most investors would be thrilled to own a stock that delivered returns like that, but not every company has the potential. It requires a massive growth catalyst to justify such gains.\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) is one company that could have this potential. It's a key player in one niche of the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, and has a massive backlog for its products.\n\nSoundHound's product is gaining momentum\n\nSoundHound AI's technology can parse human speech and perform various tasks based on what it hears. Among the ways it's already being used most are in processing restaurant orders and improving digital assistants in vehicles, but its capabilities extend far beyond those two use cases.\n\nIn the automotive segment, SoundHound partnered with Stellantis; the giant automaker will integrate SoundHound's tech into its vehicles across Europe and Japan. This will give people access to generative AI functions while they're driving -- an improvement from the voice assistants that are available on vehicles today. If SoundHound can win business with other automakers and break into other regions, this segment of its business alone could provide it with a huge amount of growth.\n\nSoundHound also worked with several companies in the restaurant sector to automate telephone and drive-thru orders, which saves restaurants on wages. According to the company, these AI assistants actually outperform humans in terms of order speed and accuracy, so the customer doesn't feel like the experience declined. Some of SoundHound's restaurant customers, among them White Castle and Jersey Mike's, are fairly big, but there's serious room for it to grow if it can capture some of the largest fast-food businesses.\n\nSoundHound AI could achieve even greater success if its solutions are utilized in new applications.\n\nBut is that potential enough to make its stock the next Nvidia?\n\nNvidia has one key advantage that SoundHound does not\n\nIn the second quarter, SoundHound generated $13.5 million in revenue, which was up 54% year over year. That's quite small compared to other AI businesses.\n\nHowever, the key figure investors should focus on is SoundHound's backlog, which totals $723 million. This figure doubled from a year ago, showing that rising demand has outpaced SoundHound's capability to integrate its product with its customers' systems.\n\nThis is factoring into SoundHound's current valuation, as Wall Street has high hopes for the company.\n\nStory continues SOUN PS Ratio Chart\n\nTrading at 23 times sales, SoundHound stock already carries a premium valuation. By contrast, Nvidia traded for around 15 times forward earnings at the start of 2023. That was a dirt-cheap price, and also a far cry from the forward earnings ratio of 47 it trades at today.\n\nSoundHound already has a premium price tag, which detracts from its growth potential from here. But if it can mature into a business that generates $100 million in revenue per quarter, Nvidia-like performance for the stock is still possible.\n\nIf SoundHound achieved that and carried a valuation of 20 times sales, it would be worth $8 billion, up 370% from its market cap today. That would be a solid return, but still far less than what Nvidia produced.\n\nSoundHound stock's premium price tag may prevent it from delivering Nvidia-like returns from here, but that doesn't mean it won't be a great investment. However, it's a bit of a long shot considering the niche use cases for its product and the company's small size. It could make investors some serious money, but don't expect Nvidia-like returns.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nTwo years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAmid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Citi analyst Atif Malik recently maintained a Buy rating and $150 price target on the stock, stating that while the investment firm is bullish on the company registering another strong 40% cloud data center capex growth next year, it also sees the stock remaining range-bound through Consumer Electronics Show in January. Longer term, the advisory sees AI adoption remaining in 3rd/4th innings while noting that Blackwell driven sales and gross margin inflection will be coming in the April 2025 quarter.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Nvidia\n\nThe poster child of the AI infrastructure buildout, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), is the primary company that designs the graphics processing units (GPUs) that provide the computing power needed to train large language models (LLMs) and run AI inference. The chipmaker gained its dominant position in the market through its CUDA software platform, which long ago became the standard on which developers were trained to program GPUs, before AI was the next big thing.\n\nWhile demand for its GPUs has been insatiable, there is no sign that this demand is going to wane anytime soon. A plethora of large tech companies and AI start-ups continue to pour money into AI infrastructure, while LLMs need more and more compute power to be trained on as they become more sophisticated. This recently led Citigroup to predict that the big four cloud computing companies will increase their data center capital expenditures (capex) by 40% to 50% next year. A nice percentage of that undoubtedly will be directed toward Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nDespite the huge opportunity still in front of it, Nvidia's stock trades at a relatively attractive valuation given its growth. It currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of about 33.5 based on next year's analyst estimates, and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of 0.93. A PEG under 1 is usually typically considered undervalued, and growth stocks will often have PEGs well above 1. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. AppLovin\n\nAppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) is another attractively valued stock that has been a big beneficiary of AI, but instead of hardware, it's been through its advertising software platform.\n\nWhile the company owns some mobile games, its primary business has been offering an adtech solution to mobile gaming companies to help them draw in new customers and better monetize their games. With the introduction of its Axon 2 AI-based advertising technology, AppLovin's revenue has soared and the company has taken tremendous share in the space. This can be seen in its second-quarter (ended June 30) results, where platform revenue surged by 75% to $711 million. By comparison, rival Unity Software's mobile gaming ad business (called Grow Solutions) revenue sank 9% in the same quarter to $296 million.\n\nMeanwhile, AppLovin has said that given Axon 2's more predictive nature and increased use of automation, it is able to move beyond gaming customers and expand the number of advertisers with whom it works. The company is planning to move into the larger web-based marketing and e-commerce verticals, which should help continue to drive growth.\n\nTrading at a forward P/E ratio of 25 based on next year's analyst estimates and a PEG under 0.5, the stock is attractively priced despite the strong gains it has seen this year.\n\n3. SentinelOne\n\nSentinelOne (NYSE: S) is a fast-growing cybersecurity company that trades at a nice price-to-sales (P/S) discount to its larger peers CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, despite expected faster revenue growth this fiscal year. S PS Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nIn addition to its relatively attractive valuation, the company has a couple of nice growth opportunities in front of it. It competes directly with CrowdStrike in endpoint security through its Singularity Platform, which uses AI agents to monitor and eliminate threats. The company is well positioned to benefit from any fallout from the global IT outage that CrowdStrike's failed software update caused. Given its much smaller size, any business that heads its way will only help drive growth.\n\nIn addition, the company recently signed a deal with enterprise personal computer (PC) vendor Lenovo to provide endpoint security to all its new PCs through its Singularity Platform. Lenovo PC owners will also be able to upgrade their security to the Singularity Platform. In addition, Lenovo plans to build a new managed detection and response (MDR) service based on the Singularity Platform. This should be a meaningful revenue driver for SentinelOne next year.\n\nAll in all, SentinelOne is an attractively valued stock with solid growth opportunities ahead.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Recursion’s All-Stock Acquisition of Exscientia plc (EXAI): NVIDIA-Backed Merger to Revolutionize AI-Driven Drug Discovery",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exscientia plc (NASDAQ:EXAI) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nTwo years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAmid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nStocks\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA data scientist standing in front of a large monitor presenting a drug discovery analysis.\n\nExscientia plc (NASDAQ:EXAI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 6\n\nExscientia plc (NASDAQ:EXAI) is an AI-driven pharma-tech company that engages in design and development of differentiated medicines for diseases with high unmet patient needs. Back in August, NVIDIA-backed biotech firm Recursion had announced that it would be purchasing rival Exscientia in an all-stock deal. NVIDIA, one of the largest AI firms in the world, has invested close to $50 million in Recursion over the past year. Latest reports suggest that the two biotech companies are now soliciting shareholder support for their proposed merger agreement at upcoming investor meetings next month. David Hallett, the CEO of Exscientia, had earlier said that by merging the two companies, the duo would be able to discover better drugs for patients faster and at a lower cost.\n\nOverall EXAI ranks 35th among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of EXAI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EXAI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer on Super Micro Computer and Other Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stands against the other super micro computer stocks.\n\nAs earnings season kicks off, Mad Money's host, Jim Cramer reminds investors that bad news can often be factored into a stock's price ahead of an earnings report. He cited the recent example of PepsiCo, which saw its shares decline before rebounding despite reporting a revenue miss.\n\nCramer highlighted that when a stock has already faced significant sell-offs leading into a quarter, it is challenging for it to drop further unless the results are exceptionally poor. “This is something you need to keep in mind as we head into earnings season,” he advised, emphasizing the market dynamics at play.\n\nCramer also expressed his disagreement with the Department of Justice's exploration of a potential breakup of Google. He argued that such companies play a vital role for consumers, businesses, and the U.S. economy. Acknowledging the power of major tech firms, Cramer pointed out that their substantial customer bases and immense financial resources provide them with advantages that are essential for success.\n\nHe went on to say that these companies have become the envy of nations, especially considering that many countries invest heavily in nurturing their own national champions. In contrast, Cramer questioned the approach taken in the U.S., emphasizing the need for capital to foster growth.\n\n“The best companies we have, the best companies in the world, we're dealing with companies that have done amazing things for the American people, and yet they're vilified by the Justice Department's antitrust division, [and] of course, the Federal Trade Commission. Think about it.”\n\nHe warned that if the courts side with the DOJ and the FTC, consumers might not benefit as expected. Cramer explained that undermining these companies could open the door for foreign entities, particularly those backed by government subsidies, to fill any gaps left in the market.\n\n“Believe me, if the courts agree with the Justice [Department] and the FTC, let me tell you something. Here's what's going to happen. Your prices ain't coming down, they're going up. We hurt these companies too much and we don't have to worry, the PRC will come in with something subsidized by their government that will happily step in the void.”\n\nHe challenged the perception that wealth generated by these tech giants is solely hoarded by executives, asserting that investors also stand to gain. He stated:\n\nStory continues\n\n“You could own the stocks right alongside them. In fact, as I tell CNBC Investing Club members daily, you should...I don't know what will happen when the Biden administration runs its course, but I gotta tell you, I certainly won't miss the ruthless prosecution and hectoring of Big Tech...The American government [is] so upset at the power of these companies that it's insisting the tech titans should simply be less good. To which I say, good for who? Good for what? Certainly not us...Bottom line, I find this endless string of government investigations wrong-headed, pointless, and frankly, even anti-American.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were mentioned by Jim Cramer during the lightning round of his episode of Mad Money on October 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of data experts gathered around a computer monitor analyzing customer data.\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 68\n\nRecently, during a lightning round, Cramer highlighted the company praising their strong relationship and effective integration services. He believes the stock is a great investment opportunity at this time.\n\n“That's one of Jensen Huang's go-to. Nvidia and Accenture are having a fantastic relationship, doing a terrific job. A lot of companies, indeed, they call Accenture and say how do we get integrated? And then they do it. They just really are good. I think Accenture is a great buy here.”\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is a global professional services firm that specializes in strategy and consulting, technology, and operations. The company has a range of offerings, including but not limited to, application services and intelligent automation.\n\nOn October 2, Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and NVIDIA announced an expanded partnership, which will include Accenture’s formation of a new NVIDIA Business Group aimed at accelerating AI adoption among enterprises.\n\nThe partnership is particularly significant given the surging demand for generative AI, which contributed to $3 billion in the company's bookings for the last fiscal year. The new group will support clients in establishing foundational capabilities for agentic AI through its AI Refinery, leveraging the complete NVIDIA AI stack to innovate in areas like process transformation and AI-driven simulations.\n\nAdditionally, Accenture (NYSE:ACN) is set to introduce the NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprint, a tool designed for simulating virtual robot fleets. The blueprint incorporates NVIDIA's Omniverse, Isaac, and Metropolis software, empowering industrial firms to develop autonomous, robot-operated facilities.\n\nThe company plans to implement these advanced capabilities at Eclipse Automation, a manufacturing automation subsidiary. The initiative is expected to advance operational efficiency, achieving design timelines that are up to 50% faster and reducing cycle times by 30% for its clients.\n\nOverall ACN ranks 1st on Jim Cramer's list of super micro computer and other stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of ACN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Warren Buffett has infamously said that after he is gone, he wishes for his wife’s investments to be put in simple indexes, like the S&P 500.\n\nWhile HE may be able to “beat” the returns of the S&P 500, other mere investing mortals may not be so lucky.\n\nHow “Easy” is it to Beat the S&P 500 in 2024?\n\nBut in 2024, it seems like there have been a lot of hot stocks. After all, thanks to the AI Revolution, NVIDIA has soared 174% year-to-date. That is easily outperforming even the red-hot S&P 500, which is up 23.2% year-to-date.\n\nLeaving aside NVIDIA, how easy is it to beat the S&P 500 return by owning individual stocks?\n\nYou might think you can just buy the other Mag 7’s and easily do it. But Microsoft, for example, is up just 13% year-to-date. Even Alphabet is not beating the S&P 500. It’s up 19.4%.\n\nIf even some of the Mag 7’s aren’t beating it, what is?\n\nTracey picked some random stocks that she knew were red hot to find out.\n\n5 Hot Stocks: Are They Beating the S&P 500 in 2024?\n\n1.      Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST)\n\nCostco has been a retail favorite and an investor favorite for years. Shares continue to outperform, adding another 36.2% in 2024. That is easily beating the S&P 500, which is up 23.2%.\n\nBut investors won’t get Costco on the cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 49.\n\nShould you make a bet on Costco continuing to rally in 2024?\n\n2. CAVA Group, Inc. (CAVA)\n\nCAVA Group operates fast casual restaurants with Mediterranean food. It is often called the “Chipotle” of Mediterranean food. CAVA Group went public in June of 2023, so it is a relatively new publicly-traded company.\n\nShares of CAVA Group have exploded higher in 2024, hitting new all-time highs. It is up 216.5% year-to-date. That is outperforming even NVIDIA.\n\nEarnings are expected to rise 104.7% this year and another 18.9% next year.\n\nIs CAVA Group too hot to handle?\n\n3. Eli Lilly & Company (LLY)\n\nEli Lilly is one of the drug companies with weight loss drugs. Shares of Eli Lilly have been soaring, adding another 47.2% this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings are soaring too. Analysts expect Eli Lilly’s 2024 earnings to jump 160.9% and another 45.4% in 2025. Shares of Eli Lilly are trading at “just” 55x forward earnings.\n\nIs it too late to get on the Eli Lilly bandwagon?\n\n4. Toll Brothers (TOL)\n\nToll Brothers is the largest publicly traded luxury homebuilder in America. With the Federal Reserve now cutting interest rates, many believe mortgage rates will soon follow. That’s going to be a plus for homebuilder earnings as many were offering rate buydown programs.\n\nShares of Toll Brothers are up 49.4% this year and are hitting new highs. Analysts are bullish on the earnings, with earnings expected to rise another 17.5% in fiscal 2024. Toll Brothers is still cheap, with a forward P/E of 10.4.\n\nShould Toll Brothers be on your short list?\n\n5. Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG)\n\nConstellation Energy provides power and energy to more than 20 million homes and businesses in the United States. It operates the nation’s largest carbon-free nuclear fleet. This makes Constellation Energy a player in the alternative energy space.\n\nShares of Constellation Energy are up 125.7% year-to-date. But earnings are on the rise too. Analysts expect Constellation Energy’s earnings to jump 58.7% this year. It trades with a forward P/E of 33.\n\nIf you are interested in nuclear energy, should Constellation Energy be on your watch list?\n\nWhat else do you need to know about stocks beating the S&P 500 this year?\n\nTune into this week’s video podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of TOL in her personal portfolio and in Zacks Value Investor portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing.com -- In a note Friday, Bank of America analysts highlighted Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)'s promising position in the AI space, projecting a significant long-term opportunity.\n\nDuring a meeting with Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan, CFO Kirsten Spears, and IR head Ji Yoo, BofA reaffirmed its Buy rating on the stock and raised its price target to $215, citing a “multi-year $100-$125bn AI opportunity.”\n\nAccording to the BofA report, Broadcom’s AI opportunity is growing rapidly, with AI-related revenues expected to make up $12 billion or 24% of the company’s sales in FY24.\n\nThe total addressable market (TAM) for Broadcom is projected to reach between $100-$125 billion, largely driven by internal workloads at top hyperscale customers.\n\nThe bank said the customers are expected to deploy large clusters of custom chips, with estimates of 1 million XPU clusters over time.\n\nBofA noted that Broadcom is well-positioned in AI, particularly in networking, which is projected to grow from 15-20% of AI spending to 20-25% in the coming years.\n\n\"Connecting XPUs captures a larger part of the pie,\" the analysts explained, adding that Broadcom is also working on co-packaged optics, though deployment is still a few years away.\n\nIn addition to AI, the bank highlighted Broadcom's software division, particularly VMWare, which is transitioning to a subscription model.\n\nThey explained that VMWare is expected to contribute significantly to Broadcom's long-term growth, with an estimated 5-10% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).\n\nOverall, BofA views Broadcom as a top pick, alongside Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and KLA, emphasizing its strong combination of AI compute, networking, recurring software, and consistent cash returns through dividends.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThis chip company has a 'multi-year $100-$125bn AI opportunity': BofA\n\nVolkswagen's deliveries drop, highlighting Europe's car industry challenges\n\nU.K. stocks higher at close of trade; Investing.com United Kingdom 100 up 0.18%\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Are Intel (INTC) Shares Worth Another Look?",
        "content": "Intel INTC shares have largely been disappointing in 2024, unable to fully join the semiconductor trade and down more than 50%. Quarterly results have added fuel to the fire sale, with the stock unable to find any meaningful traction post-earnings.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the YTD performance of Intel shares relative to the S&P 500, with its quarterly releases illustrated by the circled arrows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGiven the steep decline from highs, could it finally be time to go on the offensive and pick up some shares? Let’s take a closer look.\n\nIntel Maintains Bearish Outlook\n\nCurrently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish earnings estimate revisions from analysts. Expectations for its current fiscal year have been notably negative, with the $0.27 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down 85% over the last year.\n\nThe negative revisions, caused by unfavorable quarterly results, bode poorly for near-term share performance.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStill, it’s worth noting that CEO Pat Gelsinger remains confident, buying 12.5k shares at a total transaction value of roughly $250k in early August following the latest quarterly print. He noted that second-half trends are more challenging than anticipated but still expects the company to restrengthen its position in the market.\n\nCost-cutting measures have also been a huge focus for the company over recent periods after margin pressures, as we can see in the chart below. In fact, Intel announced a $10 billion cost-savings target earlier in August.\n\nPlease note that the chart below is on a trailing twelve-month basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAre Intel Shares a Buy?\n\nInvestors should stay on the sidelines until positive earnings estimate revisions roll in, which would signal a meaningful change in sentiment. Earnings expectations for its upcoming release expected on October 24th have already been slashed, with the company now expected to post a loss of -$0.03 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nIt’s worth noting that INTC shares have been red-hot over the last month, gaining nearly 20%. While the positive price action has been inspiring, the bulk of the move has likely been fueled by a short squeeze following rumors of buyouts.\n\nFor those seeking semiconductor exposure, there are many more positive stories, a list that obviously includes beloved AI-favorite Nvidia NVDA. Nvidia currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook shifting higher across the board following unbelievable quarterly results.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd concerning the top line, Nvidia’s sales are forecasted to more than double in its current fiscal year.

Broadcom: Who Will Be The Next Trillion-Dollar AI Giant?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) are currently competing for a seat at an elite table: The exclusive trillion-dollar club.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor’s market cap first crossed the trillion-dollar threshold in July. It has since contracted to roughly $820 billion — a stone’s throw away from Broadcom’s $867 billion.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are among the club’s current members after their market caps exceeded a trillion dollars, fueled by AI advancements.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.

Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\nWith TSM and Broadcom both driving critical innovations in AI semiconductors, we ask: Which company’s market cap will attain nine zeros next?\n\nTSMC: AI-Driven Chipmaker Poised For Growth\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor stands as the world's largest contract chipmaker, leading the market with its 3nm and 5nm technology. These chips are integral for AI workloads, fueling AI giants like Nvidia and Apple.\n\nThis has propelled TSM's stock by over 83.3% year-to-date and 105.39% in the past year.\n\nAnalysts from Needham and Susquehanna maintain Overweight ratings, with an average price target of $236.67, implying 27.15% upside. A price at that level would push TSM's market cap to over $1.23 trillion, positioning it to re-join the trillion-dollar club.\n\nTechnically, TSMC is also in a bullish trend with buying pressure across its eight, 20, 50 and 200-day moving averages, all signaling continued upward momentum.\n\nTSM’s stock currently trades at $186.33, supported by a simple moving average, or SMA, (50-day) of $170.55 and a SMA (200-day) of $149.54, indicating positive technical indicators.\n\nRead Also:This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom: AI Infrastructure Play With Solid Momentum\n\nBroadcom is capitalizing on the AI boom through its extensive semiconductor solutions for data centers, networking infrastructure, and real-time analytics.\n\nIts stock is up 69.28% year-to-date and 114.05% in the past year. Despite bullish ratings, its projected upside falls short of TSM. Analysts from Cantor Fitzgerald, Truist Securities, and UBS see AVGO reaching $200, implying an 8.80% upside, which would push its market cap to $934 billion.\n\nTechnically, Broadcom is also trending positively, with its current price of $184.40 supported by moving averages, such as its 50-day SMA of $161.82 and 200-day SMA of $142.55. However, it still lags behind TSM's stronger growth trajectory.\n\nTSMC Could Outpace Broadcom In the Trillion-Dollar Race\n\nWhile both stocks are positioned to benefit from AI, TSMC has the edge, with superior technical indicators and greater market cap potential.\n\nWith an imminent leap toward $1.23 trillion in market cap if it meets analysts’ upside potential, TSM appears more likely to reach the trillion-dollar club before Broadcom.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

        "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nWhat Risk Does Debt Bring?\n\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n\nSee our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nWhat Is NVIDIA's Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that NVIDIA had US$8.46b of debt in July 2024, down from US$9.71b, one year before. But on the other hand it also has US$34.8b in cash, leading to a US$26.3b net cash position. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Healthy Is NVIDIA's Balance Sheet?\n\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$14.0b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$13.1b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$34.8b and US$14.1b worth of receivables due within a year. So it actually has US$21.9b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\n\nHaving regard to NVIDIA's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$3.25t company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. Succinctly put, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nBetter yet, NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 459% last year, which is an impressive improvement. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, NVIDIA produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 79% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that NVIDIA has net cash of US$26.3b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And we liked the look of last year's 459% year-on-year EBIT growth. So we don't think NVIDIA's use of debt is risky. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should learn about the  2 warning signs  we've spotted with NVIDIA (including 1 which can't be ignored) .\n\nOf course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Here is what analysts had to say after AMD's AI event",
        "content": "Investing.com -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) announced on Thursday that it will begin mass production of its new MI325X AI chip in Q4, as it looks to expand its footprint in a market dominated by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nAt an event in San Francisco, CEO Lisa Su said AMD's next-generation MI350 chips will launch in the second half of 2025, offering more memory and a new architecture designed to significantly boost performance compared to the MI300X and MI250X models.\n\nDespite the announcements aligning with previous disclosures, AMD shares dropped 4% as investors reacted to the lack of major cloud-computing customers. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares rose 1.6%, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell 1%.\n\nAMD confirmed that vendors, including Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), will start shipping the MI325X AI chip in early 2025. The chip uses the same architecture as the MI300X but introduces a new memory type to accelerate AI computations. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker aims to challenge Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture with the MI325X.\n\nIn addition to the AI chips, AMD revealed new networking chips for data centers and three new laptop processors based on the Zen 5 architecture, optimized for AI tasks. The laptop chips will support Microsoft’s Copilot+ software.\n\nSu also stated that AMD will continue to rely on Taiwan’s TSMC for advanced chip manufacturing.\n\nAnalysts’ reaction to AMD's AI event\n\nBernstein: “The stock sold off during and following the event in a typical sell-the-news response, perhaps understandable given some modest excitement into the day, lack of huge surprises, and MI325X performance specs that we believe were likely somewhat disappointing relative to NVIDIA’s impending Blackwell launch. While we don’t want to minimize things we didn’t really hear anything to suggest we should anticipate substantial upside to current expectations, and would rather own NVDA at this point in front of Blackwell.”\n\nDeutsche Bank: “We view the event as a successful continuation of AMD's impressive execution in delivering high-quality Data Center innovations. The increase in its Accelerator TAM from $400b in 2027 to $500b in 2028 suggests continued confidence in the strong growth and share gain opportunities in an important market.”\n\n“Overall, we continue to expect AMD's Data Center segment to be a strong growth driver in 2025 via both share gains in CPUs and the potential for a near doubling of Instinct revenue.”\n\nBank of America: “New MI325X performance generally remains a full year behind NVDA’s latest Blackwell, with no near-term catalyst to change the dynamic. However, we highlight AMD’s multi-vector growth opportunities across data center CPUs and GPUs remain unchanged, with the current 5-7% AI accelerator share consensus outlook presenting a minimum $25bn+ opportunity by CY28E, and a bull-case scenario of 10% AI share over the long-term still on the table, given continued hardware, software stack, and networking improvements.”\n\nStory continues\n\nTruist Securities: “We see this as a product evolution rather than a revolution, which reinforced our longer-term concerns with the stock:(1) we see AMD's position in AI as likely confined vs. NVDA's (Buy) full-stack semis/hardware/software/services solutions, and (2) we expect the X86 market will slowly come under pressure from new CPU competitors. No change to our estimates or $156 PT. Hold.”\n\nMorgan Stanley: “AMD launched the new Zen 5 server architecture, the mid-life kicker for MI300, and previewed the MI350. The bull case that MI350 lands them in a leadership position is very compelling, but in the interim MI300 seems likely to drive less upside than we see elsewhere in AI.”\n\nRelated Articles\n\nHere is what analysts had to say after AMD's AI event\n\nJFrog shares gain on report of takeover interest\n\nBNY beats Q3 profit estimates as assets under custody and administration top $50 trillion\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) held its AI Day at its Wisconsin facility, where the company showcased its abilities in liquid cooling technology and outlined its growth strategy in the AI market.\n\nAccording to Barclays, the event highlighted HPE's differentiation through their 100% fanless direct liquid cooling system, which could play a crucial role in AI server wins and margins as the demand for efficient cooling solutions rises.\n\nThey noted that HPE has already shipped over 200,000 liquid-cooled servers, positioning it ahead of competitors. Barclays explained that HPE estimates the AI total addressable market (TAM) to grow at a 25% CAGR through 2027, with liquid-cooled servers projected to reach $35 billion by 2027, up from $4-5 billion today. The bank also said the company's broad offerings across compute, storage, and networking further boost its competitive edge.\n\nMorgan Stanley added that HPE's expertise in liquid cooling, built over 50 years with Cray, positions the company to capture a larger share of the AI market. They stated that HPE's new 100% fanless Direct Liquid Cooling Systems Architecture was introduced as a key innovation, with the company targeting $171 billion AI opportunities, particularly in tier-2 and three service providers and sovereigns.\n\nAccording to Evercore ISI, HPE's AI strategy, co-engineered with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), simplifies AI deployment for enterprises and includes fully integrated, turn-key systems. Overall, the firm said the event left them \"with newfound appreciation of HPE's systems level manufacturing, assembly, and testing capabilities – particularly their 100% direct liquid cooled Exascale datacenter systems.\"\n\nBank of America said its takeaway from the event is that \"HPE has a rich engineering legacy around supercomputing and 100% direct liquid cooling (DLC) that can serve as a differentiator as data centers increasingly rely on liquid cooling to enable higher power efficiency and higher density solutions.\" The bank maintained a Buy rating on the stock as it sees upside from Juniper synergies, structurally higher margins and upside from AI.\n\nFinally, Bernstein analysts stated that \"HPE's AI strategy makes eminent sense.\" However, the firm continues to see \"AI storage and networking as relatively small, and struggle with the rationale of buying Juniper, which historically has had low growth, and will limit HPE's financial flexibility going forward.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nHere are the key takeaways from HPE's AI Day\n\nStory continues\n\nFastenal marginally beats quarterly profit estimates on demand for safety products\n\nTesla's robotaxi event was long on Musk promises.

        "title": "AI 'Godfather' Yoshua Bengio: We're 'creating monsters more powerful than us'",
        "content": "Whether you think artificial intelligence will save the world or end it — there’s no question we’re in a moment of great enthusiasm. AI, as we know, may not have existed without Yoshua Bengio.\n\nCalled the “Godfather of Artificial Intelligence,\" Bengio, 60, is a Canadian computer scientist who has devoted his research to neural networks and deep learning algorithms. His pioneering work has led the way for the AI models we use today — such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude.\n\n\"Intelligence gives power and whoever controls that power — if it's human level or above — is going to be very, very powerful,\" Bengio said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. \"Technology in general, is used by people who want more power: economic dominance, military dominance, political dominance. So before we create technology that could concentrate power in dangerous ways — we need to be very careful.\"\n\nIn 2018, Bengio and two colleagues — former Google (GOOG) VP Geoffrey Hinton (winner of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics), and Meta (META)’s chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun — won the Turing Award (known as the Noble Prize of computing). In 2022, Bengio was the most cited computer scientist in the world. And Time magazine has named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nDespite helping to invent the technology, Bengio has now become a voice of caution in the AI world. That caution comes as investors continue to show a great deal of enthusiasm on the space — bidding up shares of AI plays to fresh records this year.\n\nAI chip darling Nvidia's (NVDA) stock is up 162% year to date, for example, compared to the S&P 500's 21% gain.\n\nThe company is now valued at a staggering $3.25 trillion according to Yahoo Finance data, trailing Apple (AAPL) slightly for the title of most valuable company in the world.\n\nI interviewed Bengio on the possible threats of AI and which tech companies are getting it right.\n\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhy should we be concerned about human-level intelligence?\n\n\"If this falls in the wrong hands, whatever that means, that could be very dangerous. These tools could help terrorists pretty soon, and they could help state actors that wish to destroy our democracies. And then there is the issue that many scientists have been pointing out, which is the way that we're training them now — we don't see clearly how we could avoid these systems becoming autonomous and have their own preservation goals, and we could lose control of these systems. So we're on a path to maybe creating monsters that could be more powerful than us.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOpenAI, Meta, Google, Amazon — Which big AI player is getting it right?\n\n\"Morally, I would say the company that's behaving the best is Anthropic [major investors include Amazon and Google]. But I think they all have biases because of the economic structure in which their survival depends on being among the leading companies, and ideally being the first to arrive at AGI. And that means a race — an arms race between corporations, where the public safety is likely to be the losing objective.\n\nAnthropic is giving a lot of signs that they care a lot about avoiding catastrophic outcomes. They were the first to propose a safety policy where there's a commitment that if the AI ends up having capabilities that could be dangerous, then they would stop that effort. They are also the only ones along with Elon Musk who've been supporting SB 1047. In other words, saying 'yes, with some improvements we agree that having more transparency of the safety procedures and results and liability if we cause major harm'.\n\nThought on the huge run up on AI stocks, like Nvidia?\n\n\"What I think is very certain is the long term trajectory. So if you're in it for the long term, it's a fairly safe bet, except if we don't manage to protect the public... [Then] the reaction could be such that everything could crash right? Either because there's a backlash from societies against AI in general or because really catastrophic things happen and our economic structure crumbles.\n\nEither way, it would be bad for investors. So I think investors, if they were smart, would understand that we need to move cautiously and avoid the kind of mistakes and catastrophes that could harm our future collectively.\"\n\nThought on the AI chips race?\n\n\"I think the chips clearly are becoming an important piece of the puzzle, and of course, it's a bottleneck. It's very likely that the need for humongous amounts of computation is not going to disappear with the kinds of events, the scientific advances I can envision in the coming years, and so it's going to be a strategic value to have high end AI chips capabilities — and all the steps in the supply chain will matter. There are very few companies able to do it right now, so I expect to see a lot more investments going on and hopefully a bit of a diversification.\"\n\nWhat do you think about Salesforce introducing 1 billion autonomous agents by 2026?\n\n\"Autonomy is one of the goals for these companies, and it's a good reason for it economically, commercially, this is going to be a huge breakthrough in terms of the number of applications that this opens up. Think about all the personal assistant applications. It requires a lot more autonomy than what current state of the art systems can provide. So it's understandable they would aim for something like this. The fact that Salesforce (CRM) is thinking they can reach it in two years, for me, is concerning. We need to have guardrails, both in terms of governments and technologically, before that happens.\"\n\nGovernor Newsom vetoed California's SB 1047 — Was that a mistake?\n\n\"He didn't give reasons that made sense to me, like wanting to regulate not only the big systems but all the small ones... There's a possibility that things can move quickly — we talked about a few years. And maybe even if it's a small possibility, like 10% [chance of disaster] we need to be ready. We need to have regulation. We need to have companies already going through the moves of documenting what they're doing in a way that's going to be consistent across the industry.\n\nThe other thing is the companies were worried about lawsuits. I talked to a lot of these companies, but there's already tort law, so there could be lawsuits anytime, if they create harm. And what the bill was doing about liability is reducing the scope of lawsuits... There were 10 conditions, you need to have all of these conditions for the law to support the lawsuit. So I think it was actually helping. But there's an ideological resistance against any involvement — anything that's not the status quo, any more involvement of the state into the affairs of these AI labs.\"\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Goldman Sachs raised its price target for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $150 from $135 per share in a note Friday, reflecting an 11% potential upside.\n\nThe investment bank said that in a recent investor meeting with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress, and IR representative Stewart Stecker, its analysts came away with a stronger conviction about Nvidia's competitive position, particularly in relation to the increasing complexity of inference workloads.\n\n\"We came away from the NDR with a better appreciation of the company's competitive moat and, importantly, the projected increase in Inference workload complexity as well as its implications for future compute demand,\" Goldman Sachs stated.\n\nThe bank also said Nvidia's competitive moat rests on various factors such as the company's large installed base, its ability to innovate not just at the chip level but at the data center level, and its robust and growing software offerings, including domain-specific libraries such as Nvidia Parabricks (i.e. genomics analysis) and Nvidia AI Aerial (i.e. software-defined and cloud-native 5G networks).\n\nThe firm also increased its FY2026/27 revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates by 7% and 8%, respectively, as they factored in higher cloud capex, robust order trends for AI servers, and improvements in the CoWoS outlook at TSMC.\n\n\"Our updated FY2026 non-GAAP EPS (excl. SBC) of $4.63 sitting 14% above FactSet Street consensus,\" said the analysts, who maintain a Buy rating on Nvidia and keep it on their Americas Conviction List.\n\nGoldman Sachs views Nvidia as well-positioned to capture ongoing demand in AI and cloud computing sectors, reinforcing its bullish stance on the stock.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia: Goldman Sachs lifts target, sees 11% potential upside\n\nEndesa shares rise as RBC says 'guidance extremely conservative'\n\nIn France's Cognac, Beijing and Brussels' EV spat spells disaster\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) may be the world's largest company, with a $3.4 trillion market cap, but that doesn't mean it will retain that place forever. Some cracks in Apple's armor could make it vulnerable, allowing other companies to pass Apple in market cap.\n\nHere are three stocks that could be worth more than Apple five years from now.\n\nWhat's wrong with Apple?\n\nApple isn't the company it used to be. It used to be at the forefront of innovation and consistently released game-changing products. It hasn't done that for some time, and even the latest iPhone (iPhone 16) seems to be struggling despite its much-hyped Apple Intelligence features.\n\nAll of this adds up to a business that hasn't grown its sales since 2022. AAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nDespite that, Apple's stock fetches a premium valuation, trading for 30.5 times forward earnings.\n\nThat's a premium price tag for a company that hasn't grown at all, leaving it susceptible to other stocks surpassing it. If it doesn't show growth soon, the premium will not be maintained.\n\nPlenty of other stocks could surpass Apple if this happens, and all of them are likely better investments right now.\n\nNvidia and Alphabet are within striking distance\n\nFive years from now, the three companies that I think can pass Apple are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). These three are obvious choices, as they round out the rest of the top four largest companies in the world.\n\nUnderstanding why these three could surpass Apple is key, as they all have different reasons.\n\nStarting with the second-largest company, Nvidia, it is nipping at Apple's heels. It's only 5% away from dethroning Apple, and with the massive demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used for artificial intelligence (AI) model creation, it's nearly a surefire bet to be larger than Apple.\n\nDespite its incredible growth this year, Wall Street still expects 42% revenue growth for fiscal year 2026 (ending January 2026). That far exceeds anything Apple will put up, but Nvidia trades for 47 times forward earnings -- a far greater price tag than investors are paying for Apple.\n\nIt will take some time for this premium to come down, but I think it's possible over the course of five years.\n\nMicrosoft is next in line, only 11% away from the top spot. Microsoft has been a stalwart, growing revenue by more than 15% over the past year. It also rides on the back of AI, with its cloud computing division, Azure, leading the way for the company. It trades for 31.5 times forward earnings, nearly identical to Apple's price tag.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Microsoft actually has the growth to support this valuation. So, as the market comes to its senses with Apple stock, don't be surprised to see Microsoft pass Apple in market cap.\n\nWhile Nvidia and Microsoft could easily surpass Apple in the next few years, Alphabet's chances are slightly lower.\n\nAlphabet needs help from a valuation standpoint to pass Apple\n\nAlphabet's case rests on its premium increase and Apple's decrease. Alphabet's revenue growth has been in the low teens for the past year, which places it far above Apple.\n\nHowever, Alphabet doesn't fetch the premium Apple does and trades for 21.5 times forward earnings. That's cheaper than the S&P 500, which trades at 23.5 times forward earnings. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIf Alphabet were to fetch the same premium as Apple (30.5 times forward earnings), it would have 42% upside. That would give it a $2.88 trillion market cap, only 19% away from Apple. If Alphabet continues its pattern of growth and Apple continues its pattern of stagnation, that would be an easy gap to close over five years, allowing Alphabet to surpass Apple.\n\nAdditionally, Apple's premium could decrease to the market average, which would provide a similar effect to Alphabet's rise.\n\nI think there is a strong chance Apple is worth less than these three if it doesn't start growing sales soon. If it launches a new product that's a hit, then these projections likely won't hold true.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before the Blackwell Launch? 1 Incredibly Important Detail May Give You the Answer.",
        "content": "One of the most important pieces of generative artificial intelligence (AI) development is sophisticated chipsets called graphics processing units (GPUs). Right now, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) absolutely dominates the GPU realm thanks to its A100 and H100 chipsets.\n\nWhile these products contributed to record revenue and profit growth for Nvidia over the last couple of years, the company's new Blackwell series GPUs could wind up being its biggest product yet.\n\nWith Blackwell set to launch later this year, is now a good time to buy Nvidia stock? Below, I'll reveal one clue that could help in making your decision.\n\nJensen is a great marketer\n\nCEOs are more than just executives who sit atop the organizational structure. They are often masters at marketing, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is no exception.\n\nDuring a recent interview on CNBC, Huang said that demand for Blackwell is \"insane\" and that \"everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first.\"\n\nAll things considered, early signs indicate that Nvidia will have no problem selling its Blackwell GPUs. But with so much potential on the horizon, I just can't help but fixate on one peculiar statistic. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat are Nvidia insiders doing with the stock?\n\nThe term \"insider\" is applied to people such as members of a company's board of directors or senior executives. Entities or investors owning over 10% of the company are also considered insiders.\n\nMany of Nvidia's insiders have been selling the stock throughout 2024. Granted, much of the activity stems from terms of automatic sales protocols agreed upon in the past. However, there's one thing surrounding Nvidia's insider activity that I can't seem to get over.\n\nAccording to public records, the last time an insider at Nvidia bought stock was back in December 2020, when the company's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, bought 200 shares on the open market.\n\nShould you buy Nvidia stock right now?\n\nI fully understand that rules set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pertaining to insider buying and selling are stringent. Right now, it's highly likely that Nvidia's insiders know a lot of details surrounding Blackwell that are not yet public.\n\nThis could include production volumes, purchase orders, backlog trends, and more. For this reason, it would look a little nefarious if an insider made a massive purchase of the stock as the Blackwell launch looms.\n\nHowever, let's zoom out and think about the bigger idea here.\n\nThe prospects of AI have been the primary pillar of Nvidia's bull thesis for a couple of years now. Moreover, developing a successor product to the H100 was not an overnight project. Considering those points, insiders had the opportunity to scoop up shares in anticipation that Nvidia's research and development (R&D) investments would bear fruit at some point down the road.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooked at from another perspective, insiders may be cashing out because they think Nvidia's share price is unlikely to be an outsize multibagger again over the next couple or even several years. When you layer on top that big-name hedge funds run by Ken Griffin, David Shaw, and David Tepper have also been offloading Nvidia stock, I'm hard-pressed to see a reason to buy shares at the moment.\n\nI believe Blackwell will serve as a near-term catalyst for Nvidia's growth. After the launch, I'd keep a keen eye out to see whether insiders continue selling or if someone finally buys shares after so many years without doing so. Should that happen, it could signal that insiders think Nvidia stock is attractively valued and has significant upside.\n\nAt the end of the day, I am sort of thinking that Blackwell will ignite some short-lived pops in Nvidia stock, making it a lucrative trading opportunity. But as a long-term investor, I'd encourage shying away from trading or buying into momentum and instead seeking steady, gradual winners that can last several years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Mobileye shares dipped in after-hours trading and is down 1.55% premarket Friday following a downgrade by Mizuho analysts, who lowered the stock to Neutral with a reduced price target of $13 from $30.\n\nMizuho cited concerns over slowing auto sales and increasing competition in key markets as the main reasons for the downgrade.\n\n\"Three key reasons for our downgrade: 1) EV/Autos sales are slowing in MBLY's key US/EU growth markets (~50-60% of revs), 2) Rising competition and share loss in China (~30% revs), and 3) SV ramp is slowing at key customer Zeekr, as SV ASP at ~$1000-1500 is 20-30x higher than EyeQ ~$50 and drives rev/EPS upside,\" said Mizuho analysts.\n\nThe firm said Mobileye, a leader in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), is facing slower-than-expected growth in its SuperVision product.\n\nMizuho analysts noted that SuperVision's ASP of $1,000-$1,500 is significantly higher than EyeQ's ASP of ~$50, which has historically driven revenue.\n\nHowever, with Zeekr possibly shifting to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Chinese ADAS suppliers, Mizuho said Mobileye's revenue outlook could be impacted further in 2024-2026.\n\n\"We are lowering our ADAS penetration estimates for 2024/25/26E to 26%/36%/40% from 29%/39%/45%,\" said Mizuho, highlighting concerns over slower growth in the EV/ADAS market and a potential inventory buildup due to weakening auto sales.\n\nAdditionally, Mizuho pointed to rising competition in China from domestic OEMs such as Horizon and Black Sesame, which threatens Mobileye's market share. They also raised concerns about Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p)'s slower-than-expected ramp with Mobileye's products.\n\nGiven the challenges, Mizuho adjusted their earnings estimates for 2025 and 2026, now expecting lower top-line growth and reduced revenue contributions from SuperVision. As a result, they downgraded the stock, saying it is \"fairly valued\" compared to peers.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMobileye dips after Mizuho downgrade\n\nPivotal Research begins Amazon coverage, sees strong growth with $260 PT\n\nWells Fargo&Co earnings beat by $0.14, revenue fell short of estimates\n\nView comments",

        "title": "These 2 Words Could Make Nvidia the First $4 Trillion Company",
        "content": "All eyes are on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) this week as the company is hosting its AI Summit in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe three-day event will give Nvidia its latest opportunity to show off its AI innovations, including its brand-new Blackwell platform, which is now in production.\n\nThe event will feature live demos and hands-on workshops in areas like generative AI, robotics, and industrial digitalization.\n\nThe event also seems likely to focus on Nvidia's vision for the future, which centers around \"AI Factories,\" the phrase CEO Jensen Huang likes to use in his vision of the data center of the future, and Nvidia's key role in running those AI factories. Nvidia laid out its plans in a recent investor presentation ahead of the AI Summit.\n\nWith Nvidia's market cap now at $3.1 trillion, selling the market on his vision for AI factories and making that transition happen could drive the AI chip star to a valuation of $4 trillion, making it the first company ever to achieve that milestone.\n\nLet's take a closer look at Nvidia's plan to get there. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nWhat are AI factories?\n\nNvidia envisions a new, more advanced form of data center it calls AI factories, the purpose of which is to take data, process it, convert it into models, and finally convert it into usable pieces of information Nvidia calls \"tokens.\" These AI factories will run on Nvidia's accelerated-computing platform.\n\nIn this evolving paradigm, companies will produce digital intelligence that serves needs such as customer-service agents, drug discovery, autonomous vehicles, and weather predictions.\n\nAdditionally, sovereign AI is becoming another large market for Nvidia, and nations are producing their own artificial intelligence to improve infrastructure, security, and communications.\n\nNvidia thinks these AI factories will have a significant impact on all industries, from manufacturing to education to financial services. If this turns out to be true, the company is all but set to stay on top.\n\nWhy Nvidia can dominate the AI era\n\nNvidia has a dominant share of the data-center graphics processing unit (GPU) market at an estimated 98% in 2023.\n\nWhile competition is heating up in that market as AMD launched its Mi300 accelerator and Intel recently introduced the Gaudi 3, Nvidia continues to think expansively with its new Blackwell platform. This platform is four times faster and also decreases power consumption by four times, versus the previous Hopper generation.\n\nNvidia is also the only chip company that offers a full-stack solution for AI and accelerated computing thanks to its CUDA library of pre-built functions and software that runs on its GPUs. Finally, it's built the leading inference platform, which is accelerated by OpenAI's new o1, the newly released advanced model from the AI start-up.\n\nStory continues\n\nCan Nvidia keep gaining?\n\nUnrelated to its AI summit this week, Nvidia got some good news from close partner-server provider Super Micro Computer, which said it's currently shipping more than 100,000 GPUs per quarter and noted that its ultradense servers include 8 Nvidia HGX GPUs. It also said its highly regarded liquid-cooling solution can hold up to 96 Nvidia B200 GPUs per rack.\n\nNvidia shares rose on the news as it reaffirmed that demand for its products remains strong.\n\nWhile there's been concern among some investors that the cloud-infrastructure giants like Microsoft and Alphabet are overspending on AI, the facts on the ground continue to indicate otherwise, and innovations and tech accelerations like Blackwell should continue to incentivize AI investment.\n\nOpenAI, the leading generative AI start-up, also just nearly doubled its valuation to $157 billion in its latest funding round, in which Nvidia participated, which also shows that the market for AI technology continues to grow.\n\nHuang's vision of AI factories is becoming a reality as companies like OpenAI race to build artificial general intelligence. The AI chip maker could reach a $4 trillion valuation faster than you think.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Morgan Stanley Thinks Blackwell Chips Could Generate $10 Billion in Sales for Nvidia by Q4. Here's 1 Other Figure I'm More Interested to See.",
        "content": "Over the last couple of years, investors have listened to countless executives explain how Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) H100 and H200 graphics processing units (GPUs) were helping power a new wave of artificial intelligence (AI) development. Those chips, built on its Hopper architecture, have been in heavy demand.\n\nToday, though, Nvidia is inching closer to the release of GPU using its next-generation architecture -- dubbed Blackwell. Early demand trends -- and some estimates published by investment bank Morgan Stanley -- suggest that Blackwell will rapidly become a monster seller for Nvidia. Yet as interesting as its early sales results may be, there's another metric for Nvidia that I'm more interested in seeing by year's end.\n\nThe Blackwell launch could be huge\n\nThere's been a lot of hype surrounding the Blackwell launch. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that demand for Blackwell is \"insane,\" while CFO Colette Kress stated on the latest earnings call that the new chips should generate billions in sales by the fourth quarter.\n\nMorgan Stanley's analysts have attempted to quantify more specifically just how much of a tailwind Blackwell sales will be for Nvidia in the near term. The analysts estimate that it will produce 450,000 Blackwell GPUs during the fourth quarter and sell them for about $22,000 apiece. Assuming that all those chips are snapped up immediately at that price, that would amount to roughly $10 billion in sales.\n\nThat would certainly be a successful launch. However, while Blackwell looks poised to help Nvidia continue shattering earnings expectations and generate record growth, I'm not going to let those forecasts distract me from another number that I think will be more important to shareholders in the long run. Image Source: Getty Images\n\nThe other number I'm keeping an eye on\n\nIn August, in conjunction with its fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings report, Nvidia's board of directors approved a $50 billion share buyback program. Although that authorization does not have an expiration date, I will be curious to see if Nvidia has repurchased any stock under it by the end of its fiscal year in late January. At that point, the new buyback program will have been in effect for two full quarters. NVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nAlthough Nvidia's valuation has risen remarkably over the past year, the stock is less expensive today on both a price-to-earnings basis and a price-to-free-cash-flow basis than it was a year ago -- and by a wide margin to boot. Demand for Nvidia's GPUs is so high that the growth these products are contributing to the company's profits exceeds the pace at which the stock has risen.\n\nSo here's my question: If management believes Nvidia stock is attractively valued, will it repurchase shares before the company's Blackwell sales show up in earnings later this year and potentially send the stock price even higher?\n\nThe bottom line\n\nBy the time Nvidia releases its fiscal fourth-quarter results early next year, I will be on the lookout for the following pieces of information:\n\n1. Has the company managed to repurchase a significant amount worth of stock under the new buyback authorization?\n\n2. If not, have any Nvidia insiders continued to sell stock?\n\nI think if the answer to the first question is \"no\" while the answer to the second question is \"yes,\" it will be a telling signal about how management really regards the stock.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- I believe that Blackwell will provide a new tailwind for Nvidia's business and probably the stock price, too. However, if the company continues to post record profits and trades at a reasonable earnings multiple, I'd find it peculiar if insiders continue cashing out, but the company doesn't progress on the buyback program.\n\nSo, while I'm just as interested as any other investor in seeing just how much Blackwell impacts the business, I would caution investors from becoming overly enamored by the hype, and instead suggest they observe the actions of those who are most closely involved with Nvidia.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock? Evidence Is Piling Up That Provides a Compelling Answer.",
        "content": "There are no two ways about it: The dawn of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in early 2023 has been a windfall for chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that have become the gold standard for a variety of use cases by providing the computational horsepower needed to underpin video games, data centers, and even earlier versions of AI.\n\nGenerative AI went viral early last year, with Nvidia at the heart of what many are calling the next industrial revolution. The results have been striking: Nvidia stock is up more than 800% since the start of 2023 and hovers less than 2% off its all-time high (as of this writing) -- but it's been a bumpy ride. Nvidia stock lost as much as 27% during the four weeks starting in early July but has rebounded vigorously, gaining nearly all that back over the past month.\n\nCausing the recent decline were fears that demand for AI could dwindle, and a great deal of future growth was already baked into the stock price. That said, there's mounting evidence that answers the question: Is it too late to buy Nvidia stock? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFaltering demand, or the calm before the storm?\n\nWhat distinguishes generative AI from its predecessors is the need for not only massive amounts of data, but also the corresponding computational horsepower needed to parse the data. When it comes to AI-centric processors, Nvidia is without equal, controlling an estimated 98% of the market in 2023, similar to its share in 2022, according to semiconductor analyst company TechInsights. This dominance put Nvidia in pole position when generative AI burst on the scene.\n\nThe unprecedented demand fueled triple-digit revenue and profit growth for Nvidia for five successive quarters. So, when the company forecast only 79% growth for its fiscal 2025 third quarter (which ends in late October), some investors saw the writing on the wall. They concluded that demand was ebbing and they headed for the exits, but that move was likely premature -- and costly. The evidence is growing that demand for AI continues unabated.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, commonly called Supermicro, provided one piece to the demand puzzle on Monday. In a press release, the company revealed that it had delivered more than 2,000 direct liquid-cooling (DLC) rack systems since June and was currently shipping more than 100,000 GPUs per quarter. Shipments of that magnitude suggest that demand for Nvidia's GPUs remains robust.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang provided some boots-on-the-ground commentary as well. In an interview late last week, the chief executive said that demand for Blackwell -- the company's next-generation AI platform -- is \"insane.\" He called this the \"first wave of AI,\" which started with the modernization of $1 trillion worth of existing data centers, upgrading them with chips capable of processing generative AI. Huang went on to say that the next phase -- the \"biggest wave of AI\" -- will involve \"companies using AI to be more productive.\" These comments suggest that the AI boom has only just begun.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia recently expanded its partnership with global IT consultancy company Accenture to help enterprise companies \"rapidly scale their AI adoption.\" To that end, Accenture launched the new Accenture Nvidia Business Group, which will be staffed by 30,000 business professionals to help customers with \"process reinvention, AI-powered simulation, and sovereign AI.\" Accenture noted in the press release that generative AI drove $3 billion in bookings in its recently completed fiscal year and shows no signs of slowing.\n\nFinally, data provided on Wednesday by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, commonly called TSMC, left no question about the ongoing demand for AI. The company released its September Revenue Report, which reported quarterly revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($24.6 billion), increasing 39% year over year and coasting past Wall Street's consensus estimate of NT$748. Nvidia is one of TSMC's largest customers, accounting for roughly 11% of sales last year. This suggests that AI-related demand remains strong for Nvidia as well.\n\nThe evidence is clear\n\nNvidia investors have been on a non-stop thrill ride since early last year. The company's fiscal 2025 second-quarter results help illustrate its success. For the fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), Nvidia delivered record revenue that grew 122% year over year to $30 billion, fueled by record data center revenue of $26.3 billion, up 154%. Profits also soared as diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.67 surged 168%.\n\nNvidia won't report its fiscal third-quarter results until late November, so we won't know for sure until then. However, if the latest developments are any indication, Nvidia should have another strong showing in the works.\n\nThe company's forecast is calling for revenue of $32.5 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 79%, with a corresponding increase in profitability. While that's slower than the triple-digit growth investors had become accustomed to, it's remarkable nonetheless.\n\nThen there's the matter of Nvidia's valuation. At 62 times earnings, it certainly appears expensive -- at least at first glance. However, Wall Street is forecasting EPS of $4.02 for Nvidia's fiscal year that begins in January. That works out a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33, which is only slightly higher than the multiple of 30 for the S&P 500.\n\nFor me, the evidence is clear: Nvidia stock is still a buy.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "1 Stock-Split Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Up 2,890% in 5 Years to Buy Now, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the last five years, with shares soaring 2,890%. The company completed two stock splits during that period. The first was the 4-for-1 stock split in July 2021, and the second was the 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024.\n\nMonster gains notwithstanding, Wall Street is still bullish on the semiconductor company. Of the 65 analysts who follow Nvidia, 92% give the stock a buy rating and the remaining 8% give the stock a hold rating. Moreover, Nvidia's median price target of $150 per share implies 14% upside from its current share price of $132.\n\nHere's what investors should know about this artificial intelligence stock.\n\nNvidia is the foundation of the artificial intelligence movement\n\nNvidia designs the most coveted graphics processing units (GPUs) in the computing industry. GPUs perform technical calculations faster and more efficiently than central processing units (CPUs), which lets them speed up complex workloads like artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia has more than 80% market share in data center AI processors, and its leadership is rooted in CUDA.\n\nNvidia introduced its CUDA programming model in 2006. It turned GPUs (originally designed for computer graphics) into general-purpose chips capable of accelerating all sorts of applications. The CUDA ecosystem now includes hundreds of software libraries that streamline development workflows across a range of disciplines, from data analytics and machine learning to scientific simulation and computational chemistry.\n\nNo other chipmaker offers comparable developer tools, so Nvidia GPUs have become the gold standard. \"Year after year, Nvidia responded to the needs of software developers by pumping out specialized libraries of code, allowing a huge array of tasks to be performed on its GPUs at speeds that were impossible with conventional, general-purpose processors like those made by Intel and AMD,\" according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMore recently, Nvidia has pushed further into software and services with AI Foundry and AI Enterprise. The former lets businesses customize pre-trained large language models on Nvidia supercomputing infrastructure, and the latter simplifies AI application development across use cases like content generation, robotics, and predictive analytics. \"Nvidia software will exit the year at a $2 billion run rate,\" CEO Jensen Huang recently told analysts.\n\nFinally, Nvidia has further reinforced its leadership and augmented its ability to monetize AI by expanding into new data center hardware verticals. \"We literally build the entire data center, and we can monitor everything, measure everything, and optimize across everything,\" explained Huang. Importantly, Nvidia has secured a leadership position in generative AI networking gear, and demand for its first data center server CPU (Grace) is very strong among supercomputing clients.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere's the bottom line: Nvidia is more than a chipmaker. It's a full-stack accelerated computing company with products that span hardware, software, and services. The breadth of its portfolio, coupled with the best-in-class performance of its GPUs, affords Nvidia a competitive moat that rival chipmakers will find it difficult to overcome.\n\nNvidia's stock trades at a reasonable valuation compared to Wall Street's forecast\n\nNvidia reported second-quarter financial results that beat expectations. Revenue soared 122% to $30 billion driven by particularly strong growth in the data center segment, and non-GAAP earnings increased 152% to $0.68 per diluted share.\n\n\"Nvidia achieved record revenues as global data centers are in full throttle to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI,\" said Huang. The chart below shows Nvidia's revenue growth across its four primary business segments.\n\nSegment Q2 2024 Q2 2025 Change Data Center $10.3 billion $26.3 billion 154% Gaming and AI PC $2.5 billion $2.9 billion 16% Professional Visualization $379 million $454 million 20% Automotive and Robotics $253 million $346 million 37% Total $13.5 billion $30 billion 122%\n\nData source: Nvidia. Note: Q2 2025 ended July 2024.\n\nIn the near term, Nvidia has a major catalyst in the upcoming launch of its Blackwell GPU. The next-generation chip can handle AI training and inference tasks four times faster and 30 times faster, respectively, compared to the previous Hopper architecture. The Blackwell production ramp will begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending January 2025). CEO Jensen Huang says it will likely be the most successful product in the history of the computing industry.\n\nLooking further ahead, Grand View Research says AI accelerator sales will increase at 29% annually through 2030, while spending across AI hardware, software, and services increases at 36% annually during the same period. Nvidia is one of the companies best positioned to benefit. Indeed, Angelo Zino at CFRA says Nvidia \"will be the most important company to our civilization over the next decade as the world becomes more AI-driven.\"\n\nWall Street estimates Nvidia's earnings will grow at 37% annually over the next three years. That consensus makes the current valuation of 62 times earnings look reasonable. Those figures give Nvidia a PEG ratio of 1.7, a discount to the three-year average of 3.1. Patient investors can confidently buy a small position in Nvidia today, and they should plan to add a few more shares if the stock suffers a pullback of 10% or more.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be Nvidia's Biggest Move Yet.",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is known for inventing, staying ahead of the curve, and surprising the market with its latest innovations. This has helped the company dominate the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, seizing 80% share, and become a general AI powerhouse.\n\nNvidia isn't about just AI chips anymore. The company sells an entire suite of products and services, from networking to enterprise software, to serve customers with AI projects.\n\nAll of this has helped Nvidia stock to soar in the quadruple digits over the past five years, and just this year, it's heading for a gain of more than 160%. Nvidia shares may not rise in a straight line forever and have dipped at certain points this year -- but the company still has plenty of fuel in the tank to power spectacular share performance over the long haul.\n\nThe stock could get a boost from news Nvidia announced just recently. My prediction is that this will be the company's biggest move yet. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe ideal chip for AI tasks\n\nLet's review Nvidia's path so far, just to get an idea of how powerful this company has become in the AI world. Nvidia started out primarily serving the video game market with its graphics processing units (GPUs) but progressively expanded the reach of these chips into other areas, including AI. The GPU's ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously make it the ideal chip for key AI tasks such as the training and inferencing of models.\n\nNvidia's chips are the fastest around. Even though they're also the most expensive, customers have flocked to the company. Part of the reason may be that customers, eager to win in the AI market, see working with the strongest products right from the start as the best way to reach that goal.\n\nThey also may agree with Nvidia's Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang on the following point: Nvidia's chips, due to their high performance, will save customers time and make workflows more efficient, resulting in lower total cost of ownership over time. In the long run, Nvidia's chips may represent the best bargain.\n\nHere's an anecdote to illustrate just how eager big companies are to get in on Nvidia. Recently, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said that he and Tesla chief Elon Musk \"begged\" Nvidia's Huang to sell them more chips. Nvidia has struggled to meet the needs of these companies because demand for its chips has exceeded supply.\n\nNow let's consider Nvidia's recent move, one that I predict could be its biggest. The tech giant expanded its partnership with Accenture(NYSE: ACN) -- and as part of this, the latter formed the Accenture Nvidia Business Group. This is a team of 30,000 who will help clients jump-start their AI projects and scale the adoption of enterprise AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nUsing the full Nvidia AI stack\n\nAs part of this, Accenture AI Refinery -- using the complete Nvidia AI stack -- will help clients reimagine their processes and even develop areas such as sovereign AI. The refinery will be found on all public and private clouds, making it easily accessible.\n\nThis can be particularly big for Nvidia because it expands the reach of this AI powerhouse even further. And this is in the context of soaring demand for AI from Accenture customers.\n\nThe consulting and professional services company said in its recently closed fiscal year that generative AI demand drove $3 billion in bookings, and $1 billion of that came in the most recent quarter. It's also important to keep in mind that Accenture is a huge player, with clients in more than 120 countries -- so it has significant reach.\n\nThis offers Nvidia yet another opportunity to grow its AI market share and further strengthen its reputation as the \"go-to\" company for AI products and services. All of this should equal another big wave of revenue growth.\n\nThat's why I think this expanded partnership with Accenture will be Nvidia's biggest move yet. It also makes this top AI stock a great player to buy now and hold onto for the long term to potentially benefit from gains to come.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Why AMD (AMD) Shares Are Getting Obliterated Today",
        "content": "Why AMD (AMD) Shares Are Getting Obliterated Today\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nShares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 5.1% in the afternoon session after the company announced new data center AI chips (AMD Instinct MI325X Accelerators), barely a day after executives of rival Nvidia announced to Wall Street analysts that the Blackwell GPU (designed for AI workloads) products are \"booked out 12 months.\" Also, AMD's new AI chip won't begin shipping until the first quarter of 2025. AMD's CEO Lisa Su touts her company’s new platform as superior to Nvidia's Blackwell when specific inference benchmarks are used.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy AMD? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nAMD’s shares are very volatile and have had 21 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 21 days ago when the stock gained 6.8% as markets roared back after an initially muted response to the Fed's rate cut, which sparked a renewed appetite for risk assets. While investors were expecting a reduction in rates from the US central bank, there was a bit of back and forth on whether the cut would be 25bps (a quarter percent) or 50bps (half a percent). The Fed ended up slashing its policy rate by 50bps (0.5%) to 4.75%-5.00%. This marks the first rate reduction in roughly four years.\n\nThe Fed--under Chair Jerome Powell--began raising rates to tackle inflation coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic when a confluence of supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending caused inflation to run hot. Looking forward, the Fed signaled that more cuts are possible in 2024/25.\n\nPutting it all together, the announcement and outlook provided a breath of fresh air and a clearer view of the Fed's monetary policy stance, which the market has been waiting for with bated breath. If there's anything the market doesn't like, it's uncertainty.\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. The result of lower interest rates, all else equal, is higher stock valuations. This is especially true for higher-growth stocks such as those in the technology sector, where the current value depends more on cash flows many years out in the future.\n\nAMD is up 18.5% since the beginning of the year, but at $164.27 per share, it is still trading 22.3% below its 52-week high of $211.38 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $5,788.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) and Nvidia Forge AI Partnership to Drive Enterprise Innovation\n\nRawpixel.com/Shutterstock.com\n\nAccenture Plc (NYSE:ACN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 68\n\nAccenture made news after the company expanded its AI partnership with Nvidia.  The deal includes launching a new Accenture division called Nvidia Business Group.\n\nNVDA CEO Jensen Huang also commented on the deal.\n\n“AI will supercharge enterprises to scale innovation faster. Nvidia’s platform, Accenture’s AI Refinery, and our combined expertise will help businesses and nations accelerate transformation for greater productivity and growth.”\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said the deal is setting the stage for AI’s impact on the enterprise. “This major partnership will drive corporate AI adoption and signals the next phase of the AI revolution,” Ives wrote in a note to clients. He highlighted the ripple effects expected across the tech sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccenture also impressed Wall Street with strong quarterly results. The key news here was $20.1 billion in new bookings, up 21% from Q4 2023. Management highlighted strong demand for its generative AI tools, signaling growth potential into 2025 and beyond. AI-related services now make up over 5% of the business after just one year.\n\nHigher profitability followed, with the Q4 operating margin reaching 15%, up 10 basis points from last year, thanks to cost efficiencies and tech investments. The company expects further margin growth.\n\nAt 28 times its fiscal 2025 EPS estimate of $12.77, Accenture looks attractive. This forward P/E ratio is below its 5-year average, suggesting the stock may be undervalued given its strong momentum.\n\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The largest detractors for the quarter were Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) and CDW Corp, which both fell by around 14%. Accenture and CDW are currently experiencing flattish years in terms of revenue and earnings growth. This follows a period of post-pandemic elevated demand. We believe both companies continue to gain market share.\n\nAccenture is the world’s largest IT outsourcing and consulting company. While earnings in its quarter ended May was essentially flat, we were very encouraged by underlying demand. This demand strength is reflected in a 22% year-on-year increase in client bookings for the quarter. Further, the number of $100m+ contracts signed in the nine months to May was 92, up from 85 in the same period a year earlier. All this bodes well for Accenture’s revenue and earnings in the next few years.”\n\nOverall, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) ranks 10th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October. While we acknowledge the potential of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA): Leading AI Chip Demand Despite Blackwell Delay\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives has yet again reiterated that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will be among the top beneficiaries of the huge AI spending.\n\n“The supply chain is seeing unparalleled demand for AI chips led by the Godfather of AI Jensen and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and ultimately leading to this tidal wave of enterprise spending as AI use cases explode across the enterprise,” analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients. “We believe the overall AI infrastructure market opportunity could grow 10x from today through 2027 as this next generation AI foundation gets built, with our estimates [showing] a $1 trillion of AI cap-ex spending is on the horizon [over] the next 3 years.”\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s declines after the Q2 results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\n\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\n\nAt Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\n\nOf course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\n\nGeneration Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Recent net performance is behind market averages. However since the fund’s inception, we have spent only about 8% of the time underperforming on a rolling five-year basis.1 We do not enjoy these spells. A number of different factors has contributed to the current period of underperformance. The fact that we do not own NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one. That single company accounted for roughly 25% of returns in the benchmark so far this year, meaning almost everyone who does not own Nvidia has lost out. Year-to-date, not owning Nvidia explains about a third of our relative underperformance.\n\nNvidia is, clearly, an earnings juggernaut. In the past year its revenue has more than tripled, as cloud companies load up on hardware to power AI models. So while its earnings multiple has increased, we are not seeing a repeat of the dotcom mania of the late 1990s. This company’s valuation is backed by cold, hard cash…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October.

(NYSE:BLK) is one of the most essential forerunners in the global asset space. When its billionaire CEO Larry Fink speaks, his insights often have greater application to the overall investing landscape.\n\nBloomberg's Francine Lacqua spoke with Fink at the Berlin Global Dialogue 2024 event on Oct. 1, BlackRock's 25th anniversary on the stock market. Fink pointed out that BlackRock stock has risen by 11,000% over that time, which he said is \"actually 20 times greater than the S&P 500.\"\n\nWhen asked to forecast what the next several years may bring, Fink said he sees an overall movement toward capital markets. \"A great economy has a strong capital market and banking system.\" Fink attributed the growth of the U.S. economy to the expansion of its capital markets over the past 25 years.\n\nDon’t Miss Out:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\nOn Oct. 1, BlackRock closed its acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). Fink sees massive opportunities for infrastructure across the equity, debt and solutions markets. GIP currently has approximately $170 billion in assets under management. The portfolio includes more than 300 active investments across over 100 countries.\n\nHe also highlighted the company's announcement of a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to create a new $30 billion fund, the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP). The fund will invest in power infrastructure and data centers and plans to raise between $100 billion and $120 billion in debt.\n\nTrending: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nStory continues\n\nFink sees inadequacies in almost every country regarding infrastructure. He believes that focusing on infrastructure is a major component of stimulating growth worldwide. BlackRock is the world's largest retirement investor and Fink said that BlackRock's job is to find investments on behalf of its retirees that deliver safe outcomes over a long period. Data centers represent this type of opportunity because they can deliver stable returns for 15 to 20 years.\n\n\"There's Nothing Systemic About It\"\n\nFink is not concerned about the current state of commercial real estate. He sees less systemic risk in the overall market than in the past. Money is always in motion. \"You may lose money on one building, but you’re moving into other destinations, like data centers,\" he added. He noted that you can't fight demographics. Some cities are shrinking while others are growing and commercial real estate in declining areas is a concern. Overall, however, his impression is that the risk is relatively contained.\n\nRegarding the U.S. Presidential election, Fink stated BlackRock is apolitical and wants to work with governments on infrastructure. He said he's less focused on the day-to-day and stressed that his and BlackRock's belief is centered on the U.S. being a great place to invest. Despite ongoing geopolitical turmoil, he said that he doesn't see anything that will disrupt global momentum. \"The amount of trillions of dollars that are going to be necessary for infrastructure investing is going to be vital to uplift the economies worldwide.\"\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

        "title": "AMD debuts latest AI chips as it battles rivals Nvidia, Intel",
        "content": "AMD (AMD) debuted its latest artificial intelligence chips during its Advancing AI 2024 event in San Francisco, Calif., on Thursday.\n\nThe flurry of announcements comes as AMD continues to battle AI market leader Nvidia (NVDA) and looks to take greater market share from longtime rival Intel (INTC) in the server CPU space.\n\nThe company showed off its new 5th Gen AMD EPYC central processing units (CPU) for servers, provided details on its Instinct MI325X AI accelerator, and showed off its Ryzen AI PRO 300 processors for AI PCs for enterprise customers.\n\nAMD contended that its top-of-the-line 5th Gen EPYC 9965 chips, which cost $14,813, beat out Intel’s fifth-generation Xeon server chips — with servers running AMD’s processors offering 4x faster video transcoding times; 3.9x improvements in time to insights, the time it takes to turn data into useable information for science and high-performance computing applications; and 1.6x performance per core in virtualized infrastructure.\n\nIn other words: AMD wants you to know its chip can outpace Intel’s in certain scenarios.\n\nIntel debuted its next-generation Xeon 6 chip in September, but AMD says it hasn’t been able to get its hands on the processor to test it against its EPYC chip. AMD, on Thursday, debuted its latest EPYC AI processor during its AI event in California. (Image: AMD) (AMD)\n\nOn the AI accelerator side, AMD offered more details about its MI325X chip. The company says the data center processor beasts out Nvidia’s popular H200 AI chip when it comes to memory bandwidth and capacity, with the MI325X providing 256GB of HBM3E, a form of high-bandwidth memory used in AI processors.\n\nAMD said the MI325X features 1.8x higher memory capacity than Nvidia’s H200 and 1.3x more bandwidth. According to the chipmaker, companies including Dell (DELL), Eviden, Gigabyte, HPE (HPE), Lenovo (LNVGF), and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) will begin offering MI325-based platforms in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe company also said it’s gearing up for its MI350X, the follow-up to the MI325X, which will debut in the second half of next year. Nvidia, meanwhile, is working with customers to deploy its next-generation Blackwell-based AI servers. StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nThe data center has become the new battlefield for AMD, Nvidia, and Intel, as the companies seek to take advantage of the ongoing AI gold rush and grab as many customers as possible.\n\nAnd that’s translated to some big time cash for AMD and Nvidia. In its most recent quarter, AMD reported record Data Center sales of $2.8 billion, up 115% year over year. Still, that’s a far cry from Nvidia’s Data Center business, which reported revenue of $26.3 billion, jumping 154% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel, on the other hand, is contending with a massive turnaround effort as it looks to regain its footing in the data center space. In its most recent quarter, the company reported that its Data Center revenue fell 3% year over year, dropping to $3 billion. The decline is part of a broader trend for Intel, which saw its full-year 2023 Data Center revenue fall a staggering 20% compared to 2022. AMD also showed off its RYZEN chip for AI PCs. (Image: AMD) (AMD)\n\nIn addition to its data center offerings, AMD showed off its new Ryzen AI PRO 300 processors for enterprise PCs. The company says its high-end version of the PRO 300, the Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 375, gets 40% better performance and 14% faster productivity performance than Intel’s Core Ultra 7 165U chip.\n\nBut the 165U is one of Intel’s first-generation Core Ultra processors, and the company has already announced its second-generation Core Ultra chips, which Intel says offer both better performance and battery life than its first-generation offerings.\n\nBoth AMD and Intel are chasing the hope that AI PCs will goose PC sales, as enterprise and commercial customers look to replace the aging PCs they bought at the onset of the pandemic. So far, however, those efforts aren’t bearing much fruit.\n\nAccording to Gartner, PC shipments fell in the third quarter, despite the hype around AI PCs. Still, with the holiday season around the corner, there’s ample opportunity for the companies to pitch consumers on the benefits of AI PCs. Whether customers will listen is another story.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer stock continues wild ride as investors weigh AI hype against alleged DOJ probe",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock fell 2.5% Thursday after rallying as much as 9% the day before, continuing its rollercoaster ride of a week as investors swing between optimism over the company’s strong financials and cautiousness over its regulatory risks.\n\nSuper Micro is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice over allegations of shady business practices outlined in a scathing report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research in late August. That has pressured the stock, which has hovered under $50 per share since then.\n\nThis week, SMCI climbed on positive reports from the AI server maker. Super Micro surged 16% Monday after the company released numbers showing strong demand for its products. The stock was up 12% on Thursday from the prior week.\n\nSuper Micro makes servers using Nvidia's (NVDA) AI chips for data centers that power artificial intelligence software. The company said it’s shipping servers containing over 100,000 Nvidia GPUs per quarter “for some of the largest AI factories ever built.”\n\nThen on Tuesday, shares of SMCI fell 5% after a promising premarket rally that saw the stock jump as much as 7%. Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, said investors’ euphoria over the company’s shipment data faded against the backdrop of Super Micro’s regulatory risk.\n\n“I think one piece of good news hardly undoes multiple months of significant financial and regulatory scrutiny around a company like this,” Newman said.\n\nThe Hindenburg report in August accused Super Micro of shoddy accounting, undisclosed relationships between its CEO and companies it does business with, and violations of US export bans. For example, Hindenburg said Super Micro has shipped servers to sanctioned Russian firms through shell companies, some of which were likely used by its military for its war against Ukraine.\n\nThe day after Hindenburg released its report, Super Micro shares dropped 20%. The company also delayed filing its annual 10-K report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Super Micro’s woes continued with a Wall Street Journal report of an alleged DOJ probe, which sent shares tumbling in late September.\n\nSuper Micro CEO Charles Liang said the Hindenburg report contained “false or inaccurate statements” and “misleading presentations of information that we have previously shared publicly.” Liang said the company’s delayed 10-K filing would not affect the company’s fourth quarter financial results, adding that Super Micro would address Hindenburg’s allegations “in due course.” (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nSuper Micro’s stock climb this week displays the tension between its potential as a key player in the AI boom and its regulatory hurdles.\n\nStory continues\n\n“This is a high-risk reward,” Newman said. “If they get absolved of all of this, there's a very good chance it's going to see a pretty nice move to the upside.” Of the Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg who are covering the stock, seven have a Buy rating on the stock, while 11 maintain a Hold rating. Only one analyst recommends selling the stock.\n\nAnalysts see shares rising to $66 over the next 12 months.\n\nThe company reported mixed results in its last earnings report. Super Micro’s most recent quarterly revenue of $5.3 billion for the three months ended June 30 barely missed Wall Street’s expectations, but was 143% higher than the prior year. On the other hand, Super Micro earnings per share for the company’s fiscal fourth quarter of $0.63 were far lower than analysts’ consensus forecast of $0.83, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nArgus Research analyst Jim Kelleher told investors in a note on Oct. 3 to buy the dip, noting that Super Micro “has been growing sales and earnings much more rapidly than the Tech industry in recent years.” Wall Street expects Super Micro to report revenues of $6.5 billion for the period ended Sept. 30, up 206% from the previous year. The company has not yet confirmed a date for its next earnings release.\n\n“At this point, we are assuming that any accounting irregularities should they exist are minor and can be addressed while requiring re-issued financial documents,” Kelleher said, adding that Super Micro’s recent 10-for-1 stock split on Oct. 1 “broadens the potential investor pool and should be a long-term positive.”\n\nDespite his long-term optimism, Kelleher lowered his 12-month price target for the stock from $100 to $70.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Bank of Nova Scotia's Strategic Acquisition of Captivision Inc Shares",
        "content": "Overview of the Recent Transaction\n\nOn December 29, 2023, Bank of Nova Scotia marked a significant portfolio addition by acquiring 12,227 shares of Captivision Inc (NASDAQ:CAPT), a company based in the Republic of Korea. This transaction, categorized as \"New Holdings,\" was executed at a price of $3.72 per share. Despite the substantial number of shares purchased, this new holding represents a modest 0.04% of the firm's total portfolio, reflecting a strategic yet cautious investment approach.\n\nBank of Nova Scotia: A Profile\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CAPT.\n\nBank of Nova Scotia, headquartered at 44 King Street West, Toronto, is a prominent financial institution known for its diversified investment portfolio. The firm manages an equity portfolio worth $50.51 billion, with significant positions in technology and financial services sectors. Its top holdings include major corporations like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm's investment philosophy focuses on leveraging growth in these sectors to ensure robust returns. Bank of Nova Scotia's Strategic Acquisition of Captivision Inc Shares\n\nIntroduction to Captivision Inc\n\nFounded recently with its IPO on November 16, 2023, Captivision Inc, formerly known as Glaam Co Ltd, operates in the building materials industry. The company specializes in the innovative G-Glass technology, a transparent glass that can display media images, integrating ICT solutions with traditional building materials. Despite its groundbreaking product, the company's market capitalization stands at a modest $62.871 million. Bank of Nova Scotia's Strategic Acquisition of Captivision Inc Shares\n\nFinancial Health and Stock Performance\n\nCaptivision's financial metrics present a challenging picture. The company has a Return on Assets (ROA) of -271.95% and a concerning Altman Z score of -20.93, indicating significant distress. The stock's performance has been equally troubling, with a year-to-date price decline of 47.53%, and a GF Score of 11/100, suggesting poor future performance potential.\n\nMarket Context and Strategic Implications\n\nThe timing of Bank of Nova Scotia's investment coincides with a nearly 45.7% decline in Captivision's stock price since the transaction date, which might suggest a value-oriented purchase strategy aiming to capitalize on potential future recoveries. This acquisition aligns with the firm's history of investing in technology-driven companies, albeit at a notably cautious scale, possibly due to the high-risk profile of Captivision.\n\nFuture Outlook and Implications\n\nLooking ahead, Captivision Inc's innovative product line could position it for recovery and growth, particularly if it successfully capitalizes on the burgeoning market for smart building materials. For Bank of Nova Scotia, this investment, although small, could either represent a strategic foothold in an emerging market or a speculative play on Captivision's recovery potential. Investors and market watchers will undoubtedly keep a close eye on how this plays out in the evolving landscape of technology-integrated building solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe transaction's impact on Bank of Nova Scotia's portfolio is minimal at present, but its future implications could be more significant, depending on Captivision's operational turnaround and market penetration efforts. This move by Bank of Nova Scotia may well be a precursor to more substantial investments in similar technologies, reflecting a broader strategic shift towards innovative building materials.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc., looking to catch up with Nvidia Corp. in the lucrative market for artificial intelligence processors, said that its latest chips are rolling out to data centers and will exceed some of the capabilities of its rival.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSan Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters?\n\nComputer systems based on AMD’s MI325X processors will be available soon and have an edge over machines running Nvidia’s H100, Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said at a company event in San Francisco Thursday. The MI325X’s use of a new type of memory chip will give it better performance at running AI software — a process known as inference — she said.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company is trying to crack Nvidia’s dominance in so-called AI accelerators — chips that have become essential to the development of artificial intelligence systems. Like Nvidia, AMD has committed to bringing out new accelerators every year, stepping up its pace of innovation.\n\nStill, AMD has a long way to go to match Nvidia. And investors were underwhelmed by Thursday’s presentation. The stock fell more than 2% to $166.08 as of 12:43 p.m. in New York.\n\nUnder Su, who just marked her 10th anniversary in the top job at AMD, the company has eclipsed its longtime nemesis Intel Corp. in market valuation. But both companies were caught off guard by how ferociously the industry embraced AI accelerators.\n\nOf the two, AMD has responded far more quickly and established itself as the closest rival to Nvidia. AMD, which is expected to report quarterly results in the coming weeks, has set a target of $4.5 billion of revenue from the new type of chips for this year, a rapid increase. Su has said the overall market for such chips will hit $400 billion in 2027. On Thursday, she said that the company expects that number to reach $500 billion in 2028.\n\nAt the event, Su also said the company is releasing a new line of server processors based on its “Turin” technology, making a fresh push into a market once dominated by Intel.\n\nComputers are going on sale with AMD’s fifth-generation EPYC central processing units, or CPUs, she said. The chips have as many as 192 processor cores and can outperform the latest Intel products, she said.\n\nThe company said that it now has 34% of the market for this category of chips when measured by revenue. Though Intel still dominates the segment, it once had a 99% share.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes) Why Is It So Hard for Clothing Resale Platforms to Make Money?

        "title": "PC shipments fall in Q3 despite AI push by Microsoft, chipmakers",
        "content": "The global PC industry hit a snag in the third quarter, as worldwide shipments declined for the first time in three quarters — despite hype around so-called artificial intelligence PCs and growth in the US and Japan.\n\nAccording to Gartner, third quarter PC shipments, or devices sent out to retailers for sale, fell 1.3% year over year to 62.9 million units from 63.8 million units in the same period in 2023. Shipments dropped the most in China, with Gartner reporting a 10% collapse in demand in the country as government and state-affiliated entities sought out fewer desktops.\n\nShipments in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa took a less dramatic hit than China, dropping 1.5% due to a flurry of events that Gartner says distracted consumers, including elections in the UK and France and sporting events like the Olympics. The US, meanwhile, saw a 5.6% increase in shipments, while Japan saw double-digit growth in the quarter.\n\nStill, the PC industry is in the midst of a broader comeback after years of declines and the massive amount of growth it experienced at the onset of the pandemic. At the time, consumers and enterprises bought up virtually as many PCs as they could get their hands on to ensure they had the means to work and stay entertained while stuck in their homes for months on end.

With so many customers outfitted with new PCs, demand crumbled, leading to an extended slump that lasted roughly two years, including the worst decline in 17 years in 2023. The slump hit companies ranging from PC manufacturers for Microsoft (MSFT) to chipmakers Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nIn Q2 2023, as sales struggled, Microsoft reported that its Windows OEM sales, or sales of its Windows operating system to laptop and desktop manufacturers, fell 39% year over year. Intel and AMD saw similar declines, with Intel reporting that its first quarter 2023 Client Computing Group revenue, the organization responsible for PC chip sales, dropped an incredible 38% compared to Q1 2022. AMD reported a 65% year-over-year drop in net revenue in its Client group in 2023 from $2.1 billion to $739 million.\n\nThe shipment declines come as the PC industry is pushing the concept of AI PCs, or computers outfitted with neural processing units (NPUs) or high-powered graphics cards that can run AI applications locally rather than via the cloud.\n\nMicrosoft is pushing its own version of AI PCs it refers to as Copilot+ PCs, which meet certain hardware requirements such as powerful NPUs. But the marketing doesn’t seem to be paying off.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa, AI PCs “did not boost the demand for PCs since buyers have yet to see their clear benefits or business value.” AI pushers: In New York City. (Photo by Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nWhat’s more, she said, the end of Windows 10 support in 2025 didn’t drive updates in areas like China.\n\nThere’s still plenty of debate about whether AI will become a huge selling point for consumer electronics, whether that’s PCs or smartphones. So far, Microsoft has shown off a number of potentially useful AI features for Windows 11, including its Click to Do option that provides you with a context-sensitive set of options to take action on what you’re viewing on your screen.\n\nMicrosoft says you can do things like remove or blur the background in a photo or perform a visual search using Bing, allowing the search engine to search for content based on images rather than words.\n\nBut it’s not clear yet if AI is a major selling point for consumers. Jefferies recently downgraded Apple’s stock saying that expectations for AI-powered iPhones are overblown. And if that holds true, you can bet it’ll be the same for PCs.\n\nRegardless of the declines in Q3 or whether AI proves to be the kind of catalyst the industry needs, Kitagawa says PC shipments should improve for the year as a whole and blow up in 2025.\n\n“At the worldwide level, PC demand will see more uptake toward the end of 2024 and more robust growth in 2025, when the PC refresh will be at its peak,” said Kitagawa.

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) the Best Quality Stock to Buy According to Analysts?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Quality Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the best-quality stocks to buy.\n\nIncome-Focused Investing\n\nThe stock market has seen a notable 20% increase year-to-date, but as it approaches the seasonally volatile months leading up to Election Day, potential volatility is expected. The S&P 500 has historically pulled back 5% to 10% around election time but tends to recover afterward.\n\nInstead of cashing out, investors are encouraged to take advantage of any market pullbacks. Historically, when the Fed cuts rates without an impending recession, it creates a favorable environment for broader market performance. Mona Mahajan, Edward Jones senior investment strategist, recently appeared on CNBC to discuss her similar sentiment on these latest market trends, and where investors can find opportunities right now. We talked about this in our article about the 10 Best WallStreetBets Stocks To Buy Right Now, here’s an excerpt from it:\n\n“When asked if investors should consider cashing out and taking a holiday for the remainder of the year, Mahajan advised against such a move. Instead, she suggested that if there are pullbacks or corrections in the market, it would be prudent to lean into those opportunities… Additionally, rate cuts typically lead to expanded valuations, particularly for sectors that have lagged behind in this regard. She emphasized that lower borrowing costs from Fed rate cuts would benefit both consumers and corporations. In terms of investment strategies during potential downturns, she recommended focusing on cyclical sectors such as utilities and industrials while also maintaining exposure to technology and the artificial intelligence sectors. Mahajan underscored that diversification would be key over the next 12 to 18 months.”\n\nGlobal Investment Strategist at ProShares Advisors, Simeon Hyman, appeared on CNBC on October 2 to emphasize ‘income’ as a key focus, highlighting the opportunity in fixed-income markets, which could provide 10-15% returns if geopolitical tensions worsen. He thinks that the US economy is stronger than the rest of the world despite tensions.\n\nSimeon Hyman emphasized the importance of the term ‘income’ in the context of current market conditions, noting that the market was just 1% off its all-time highs. This situation presents a salary cut for income-oriented investors, highlighting the challenges they face. However, the fixed-income market offers a silver lining; it currently provides enough yield to cushion against worsening geopolitical tensions. For instance, the yield on the 10-year bond is nearly 4%, and there is potential for it to drop to 3% or lower if significant negative events occur. This scenario presents an opportunity for investors to realize gains of 10% or 15% on bonds in a tumultuous environment, a situation not seen in over a decade.\n\nDespite the current market being down by 3.7%, which is slightly less than 4%, Hyman insisted that rounding was at play. He expressed surprise at this performance given ongoing geopolitical tensions but pointed out that positive economic news in the US persists. Specifically, there has been a 50-basis point cut and indications of a soft landing for the economy. A month-over-month increase of just 0.1% suggests that if one can overlook geopolitical issues, the US economy is faring better than many others globally and remains on solid economic footing.\n\nAdditionally, Hyman proposed a covered call strategy focused on the Russell 2000 index, which has been underperforming compared to the S&P 500. He described this strategy as beneficial because it allows investors to generate income that could offset recent losses while maintaining a bullish position in small caps. Historically, rate cuts have positively impacted small-cap stocks, and this strategy enables investors to capitalize on that trend while also generating income through covered calls.\n\nFor risk-averse investors, the current emphasis on fixed-income markets as a viable investment option aligns well with the insights shared by Simeon Hyman, who highlighted the potential for 10-15% returns in bonds amid geopolitical tensions. Additionally, they may also explore quality stocks with reliable growth histories, which can provide stability in uncertain market conditions, similar to the defensive strategies Hyman suggested.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list, we first sifted through Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF holdings to find the ones with an upside potential of over 15% as of October 4, 2024. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their analysts’ upside potential.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 22.10%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is known for its high-performance GPUs, which are widely used in gaming, artificial intelligence, data centers, and professional visualization. Its GPUs are essential for powering advanced graphics and computing tasks, and they are a key component in many modern technologies, such as self-driving cars, virtual reality, and supercomputers.\n\nThe company recently partnered with Accenture. Management recently talked about this partnership and its new AI chip, Blackwell. Blackwell is now being made in large numbers, and there is a lot of demand for it. AI will help businesses innovate faster through the partnership with Accenture. In late August, management also approved a $50 billion share buyback program.\n\nNetApp released a new AI tool on September 25 that uses NVIDIA technology to help businesses manage their data. Elon Musk’s company, xAI, is using 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for its AI project, Colossal. Colossal may grow to use H200 GPUs and Blackwell chips in the future.\n\nIts networking platform for AI, Spectrum X, is expected to be worth billions of dollars within a year. The company recently partnered with Salesforce to help businesses use AI and data better. In September, the company also introduced a new AI tool called Aerial to improve wireless networks for mobile devices, robots, self-driving cars, and 5G.\n\nIts software called CUDA gives it an advantage over competitors. However, the company’s future depends on continuing to innovate and find ways to make money from AI. CUDA is a tool that helps developers use GPUs for different kinds of computing. Experts think the company should focus more on robotics to grow.\n\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) – Following the release of first-quarter earnings in May featuring record revenue growth of 262% year over year, NVIDIA continued its upward march. On June 10, shares of the company began trading on a split-adjusted basis following a 10-for-1 forward stock split, making stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors alike. Just one week later, the company officially surpassed Microsoft in market cap to become the most valuable publicly traded company (although it would relinquish the title not long after). While other companies have also stood to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) trend this year, NVIDIA stands out as the unquestionable leader in the space and that is unlikely to be challenged for many years ahead. NVIDIA continues to see extremely strong levels of demand and the recent introduction of the Blackwell system looks to be an exciting next phase of growth for the stock.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the best-quality stocks. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "AMD's AI product event likely to be 'a fade-the-news event' says analyst",
        "content": "Investing.com -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is set to host its \"Advancing AI\" event this week, where analysts expect to hear about new product announcements that could lift sales and drive the chipmaker’s stock price.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts at Lynx Equity Strategies believe this will be “a fade-the-news event.”\n\n“AMD stock has had a modest run-up over the past week on investor expectations for clarity on MI325X and its follow-ons. We think investors are likely to be disappointed,” they emphasized.\n\nLynx’s team is skeptical about AMD's ability to close the gap with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), noting that the latter continues to dominate the market. Despite AMD’s ambitious claims at the MI300X launch nearly a year ago, it has made minimal progress in challenging NVIDIA’s stronghold.\n\n\"We do not expect MI325X to change the narrative meaningfully,\" the analysts state, suggesting that AMD is likely to “remain a distant second” to its rival.\n\nWhile AMD is expected to highlight developments in data center CPUs and AI PCs, Lynx believes investor attention will remain firmly on the MI-series. The analysts warn that unless AMD can demonstrate a clear driver for market share gains, the stock could potentially retest its yearly lows.\n\nAfter AMD’s Computex presentation a few months ago, there was some optimism around the company’s next-gen data center GPUs, especially given the higher HBM density on AMD's MI325X—288GB compared to NVIDIA's 141GB on the H200.\n\nHowever, Lynx notes that customer traction has been weak in the months since. Although AMD management may boast superior benchmark results compared to NVIDIA’s Hopper series, the firm’s analysts remain unconvinced, noting that \"while running real workloads in the field, we think MI300X continues to trail NVDA’s H100.\"\n\n“We do not expect MI325X to change the narrative meaningfully. Superior HBM density is merely one of the factors at work; the software stack, backplane networking and power consumption matter just as much,” analysts continued.\n\nThey believe AMD has high hopes for the MI325X and is expanding its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity in anticipation of future demand. Notably, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s strong guidance for its ethernet connectivity business at GPU-based AI data centers next year could indicate growing demand from AMD AI servers. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also appears to be a key customer, though Lynx remains uncertain about “who the needle-movers are.”\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which endorsed AMD’s launch of MI300X last year, may have seen its commitment to AMD diminish recently.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We believe META may have firmed up its plans for internally developed silicon as a future alternative to NVDA. And Amazon/AWS too, we doubt if AMD is seen as a viable alternative to NVDA,” Lynx explains.\n\nThe firm also mentions Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) as a potential customer, along with interest from enterprises, but it cautions that the MI-series, along with its software stack, may not be the plug-and-play solution AMD has marketed it as.\n\n“Outside of MSFT we do not believe end customers are likely to spend resources to help bridge the gap as it is unclear what would be the payoff,” said the analysts.\n\n“We expect the stock to trade down after the event today and likely to revisit the lows of the year.”\n\nAs for potential surprises at the event, Lynx suggests that while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) might be announced as new customers, this would likely be limited to externally facing cloud instances.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAMD's AI product event likely to be 'a fade-the-news event' says analyst\n\nUS futures extend losses after higher-than-expected inflation data\n\nUBS downgrades Nutrien to 'neutral' on weak Ag outlook, lowers PT to $51\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nHalloween is approaching, but ghosts and goblins aren’t October’s biggest nightmare on Wall Street.\n\nLooming reinflation is.\n\n“The underpriced risk right now is a reacceleration in inflation,” Kathryn Rooney Vera, chief markets strategist for StoneX, explained to Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nCiting recent spikes in oil prices amid rising Middle East tensions as one of the potential stumbling blocks, she added, “It’s the risk of an overstimulated economy.”\n\nFor the better part of September, investors had warmed to the notion that inflation was under control, setting the stage for rate cuts out of the Federal Reserve.\n\nInflation in August dropped to its lowest level since February 2021 as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. For the month, inflation rose 0.2%. The result placed inflation for the last 12 months at 2.5%, down 0.4% from July.\n\nThe report set up the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates by a surprise 50 basis points on Sept. 18. It was the central bank's first rate cut in four years. Monster masks like these, shown on July 31, 2022, in Long Beach, Calif., aren't the only things markets have to be concerned about. (Michael Tullberg/Getty Images) (Michael Tullberg via Getty Images)\n\nThe consensus among Fed officials at the meeting was that they see two more 25 basis point cuts this year, followed by four more cuts next year and two more cuts in 2026.\n\nRead more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\nFor the September CPI report, due on Thursday, forecasters anticipate a meager 0.1% rise in prices for the month, which could go a long way in solidifying a 25 basis point cut at its early November meeting.\n\nSince the Fed's rate cut, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has logged a 2.6% gain.\n\nLarge-cap tech stocks — which tend to perform well in periods of lower interest rates — have rallied impressively. Netflix stock (NFLX) just touched a record high since the Fed decision, while market darling Nvidia (NVDA) has surged 15%.\n\nAs the markets go, the proverbial pendulum is likely to change its direction at some point, especially given the climb in oil prices and what it means to the inflation outlook.\n\nCrude oil is up about 8% since Oct. 1 alone.\n\n\"While the development of the [Middle East] conflict remains uncertain, we see $10-$20/a barrel of upside to brent crude oil at the peak in the case of disruptions in Iranian production,\" warned Goldman Sachs analyst Yulia Zhestkova Grigsby in a client note.\n\nIf inflation picks back up, it could easily dent the now-consensus view that the market will get a steady dose of rate cuts into 2025. In turn, investors could dial back their expectations for equity returns.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The Fed wants to get inflation down, and it wants to see a slowdown in the labor market,\" Rooney Vera said. \"They're gaming the not-too-hot, not-too-cold scenario, and we're just not there yet.\"\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Nvidia Bet Millions on This AI Stock. It's Up 165%.",
        "content": "Earlier this year, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) revealed that it invested capital in several promising artificial intelligence (AI) companies. Management clearly believed the investments would pay off, but it also positioned the company as a direct enabler of its end markets.\n\nAfter all, Nvidia isn't an AI company itself. Rather, it supplies the AI industry with critical components like graphics processing units, or GPUs. By investing in the overall growth of AI, Nvidia can not only book a potential investment profit, but also spur long-term demand for its own products.\n\nNo matter how excited Nvidia management was about its capital allocation decisions, few likely predicted what would happen with one of the investments. Following Nvidia's $3.7 million investment in February, SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) saw its valuation soar by 165%. And there could be even more upside to go.\n\nNvidia has already made millions on this small AI stock\n\nWithin weeks after Nvidia disclosed its investment in SoundHound, the two companies revealed a partnership that will see their respective products packaged together, including an in-vehicle voice assistant that \"uses a large language model (LLM) completely on the edge while running on the Nvidia Drive platform,\" SoundHound announced in May.\n\nIn a nutshell, vehicles that run Nvidia's Drive platform will be able to tap into SoundHound's voice recognition platform to provide the driver and passengers with AI capabilities even without an internet connection. The use cases are exciting. You can pull up a song playlist from your favorite streaming provider, ask about the news or current events, or even chat with your car about its maintenance history and potential repair needs in the future. With SoundHound, you car essentially becomes an AI agent, able to converse and consider almost anything you throw at it -- with everything running locally, no connection needed.\n\nSoundHound has acquired a reputation for services like this. All, unsurprisingly, deal with the intersection of AI and sound.\n\nSeveral fast-food restaurants are testing its products for drive-thru windows -- a clever way to potentially increase order efficiencies and reduce operating costs. Tech companies have integrated its software into their applications, allowing users to better interact with their services through natural voice commands. And a host of other businesses -- from Block to Oracle -- are already using SoundHound to operate their customer service lines.\n\nThere's no doubt that Nvidia's investment spurred a spike in SoundHound's valuation. It's a strong vote of confidence, and a promising sign that SoundHound will continue to be able to source the critical components necessary to operate and improve its technology. Wall Street analysts expect the company to grow sales by roughly 84% over the next year, from $83 million to more than $150 million.\n\nStory continues SOUN Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nShould you buy shares of SoundHound today?\n\nThere's a lot to like about SoundHound. It operates in the AI space -- arguably the biggest growth opportunity in a generation -- and has the backing of major industry suppliers like Nvidia, who put their money where their mouth is. But should you join Nvidia and buy SoundHound shares for your portfolio?\n\nAccording to data from Grand View Research, the voice AI market is projected to grow by nearly 30% annually from 2024 to 2030. Thus far, SoundHound has actually been able to outpace those growth estimates. But now trading at 23 times sales, these high growth rates have arguably already been priced into the stock. That's especially true considering the company will face mounting competitive pressures from global tech giants, nearly all of which are investing billions into their own voice AI platforms. For comparison, SoundHound's total research and development budget is only around $56 million.\n\nSoundHound is off to a promising start, but Nvidia's investment put it on the map for many growth investors. If it can fend off rising competition, an investment case could be made for this exciting AI company.\n\nBut the steep valuation should cause most investors to look elsewhere.

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices is expected to announce several new artificial intelligence processors and other chips at an event in San Francisco on Thursday, as it grows as a supplier of AI chips in a market dominated by Nvidia.\n\nAMD will likely detail its MI325X chip and the next generation MI350 chip that it promised for this year and next year respectively when it unveiled them at the Computex treade show in Taiwan in June.\n\nThe MI350 series features increased computing horsepower and memory, according to the company’s presentation in June. The AMD design aims to compete with Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture.\n\nAMD is also likely to announce new server central processing units (CPUs) and PC chips that feature more AI computing horsepower.\n\nThe current MI300X AI chip launched late last year and AMD has quickly ramped up production to meet demand.\n\nIn July, the company raised its AI chip forecast to $4.5 billion for the year from its previous target of $4 billion. Demand for its MI300X chips has surged because of the frenzy around building and deploying generative AI products.\n\nAMD's launch on Thursday is unlikely to impact Nvidia’s data center revenue as the demand for such chips vastly exceeds the availability.\n\nThis year analysts expect AMD to report data center revenue of $12.83 billion, according to LSEG estimates.

        "title": "Tesla gambles on ‘black box’ AI tech for robotaxis",
        "content": "By Norihiko Shirouzu and Chris Kirkham\n\n(Reuters) - Tesla aims to stun investors Thursday night with its long-awaited “robotaxi unveil,\" a potential milestone after a decade of Elon Musk’s unfulfilled promises to deliver self-driving vehicles.\n\nThe automaker is widely expected to showcase a prototype called the \"Cybercab\" rather than a road-ready driverless taxi.\n\nConvincing regulators and passengers of the vehicle’s safety could prove much harder and take much longer — while its main competitors, such as Alphabet’s Waymo, expand robotaxi fleets they're already operating in select cities today.\n\nTesla has to date pursued a different technological path than all of its major self-driving rivals - one with potentially higher rewards but also higher risks to both its business and its passengers, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen executives, consultants and academics specializing in self-driving technology and three former Tesla autonomous-vehicle engineers.\n\nTesla's strategy relies solely on a combination of “computer vision,” which aims to use cameras the way humans use eyes, with an artificial-intelligence technology called end-to-end machine learning that instantly translates the images into driving decisions.\n\nThat technology already underpins its \"Full Self-Driving\" driver-assistance feature that, despite its name, can't be operated safely without a human driver. Musk has said Tesla is using the same approach to develop fully autonomous robotaxis.\n\nTesla’s competitors - including Waymo, Amazon’s Zoox, General Motors’ Cruise and a host of Chinese firms - use the same technology but typically layer on redundant systems and sensors such as radar, lidar and sophisticated mapping to ensure safety and win regulatory approval for their driverless vehicles.\n\nTesla's strategy is simpler, and much cheaper, but has two critical weaknesses, industry executives, autonomous-vehicle experts and one of the Tesla engineers told Reuters. Without the layered technologies used by its peers, Tesla's system struggles more with so-called \"edge cases\" — rare driving scenarios that self-driving systems and their human engineers struggle to anticipate.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe other major challenge: The end-to-end AI technology is a “black box,” the Tesla engineer said, making it “nearly impossible” to “see what went wrong when it misbehaves and causes an accident.” The inability to precisely identify such failures, he said, makes it difficult to safeguard against them.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment on its technology.\n\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang used the same “black box” description in an interview to describe the weaknesses of end-to-end technology, without specifically addressing Tesla's system. End-to-end artificial intelligence involves training a computer to make decisions directly from raw data, with no intermediate steps requiring additional engineering or programming.\n\nNvidia, the world’s leading producer of AI-computing chips, also uses end-to-end technology in autonomous-driving systems it's developing and plans to sell to automakers. But Nvidia, Huang told Reuters, combines that approach with more conventional computing systems and additional sensors such as radar and lidar.\n\nThe end-to-end technology usually — but not always — makes the best driving decisions, said Huang, which is why Nvidia takes a more conservative approach. “We have to build the future step-by-step,” he said. “We cannot go directly to the future. It's too unsafe.”\n\nROBOTAXI PIVOT\n\nTesla's ability to deliver robotaxis has taken on heightened importance this year as its sales and profits have declined amid softening electric-vehicle demand globally and fierce competition from rising Chinese EV makers.\n\nIf Tesla can overcome the technical challenges of its autonomous strategy, the payoff could be enormous. While competitors like Waymo already have robotaxis on the road, they're operating far more expensive vehicles in relatively small, comprehensively mapped zones.\n\nTesla aims to sell affordable robotaxis that can drive themselves anywhere.\n\nMusk has a long history of bold promises about self-driving cars. In 2016, he predicted drivers would be able to summon their vehicles from across the country within two years. In 2019, Musk predicted Tesla would produce operational robotaxis by 2020.\n\nThe announcement of this week's robotaxi reveal came on April 5, the day Reuters exclusively reported that Tesla had abandoned plans to build a $25,000 electric vehicle for the masses known informally as the Model 2, initially sending Tesla shares down. Musk responded by posting later that day on his X social-media platform: “Robotaxi unveil on 8/8,” sparking intense investor speculation. Tesla later delayed the event until this week.\n\nThat April day marked a fundamental shift in Musk’s stated priorities. He had previously promised to make Tesla a Toyota-sized EV giant, an expectation that underpinned Tesla’s soaring stock price, making it the world’s most valuable automaker. Now he vowed to dominate self-driving tech.\n\nAbrupt cost-cutting measures followed, including mass layoffs, as Musk diverted investment away from EV-manufacturing priorities such as battery development, gigacasting, and expansion of the automaker’s Supercharger network.\n\nThe retreat from mass-market EVs only intensified investor pressure on Tesla’s autonomous-vehicle development. Musk leaned into the scrutiny, saying in April that anyone doubting Tesla will “solve autonomy” shouldn’t invest in the company.\n\nNicholas Mersch, portfolio manager at Purpose Investments, a Tesla investor, said Musk \"has a lot of convincing to do.\"\n\nStill, Mersch called Musk's autonomy strategy a \"really bold bet\" with a potentially immense payoff, even if it takes Tesla substantially more time to crack the code. \"You have to keep the big picture in mind, in terms of how much iterative innovation is happening\" at Tesla, he said. \"I wouldn't discount them.\"\n\nDATA DRIVEN\n\nFor now, unlike its robotaxi competitors, Tesla only offers semi-autonomous solutions in its \"Autopilot\" and \"Full Self-Driving\" features. The naming and marketing of those systems have sparked investigations and lawsuits over whether Tesla has put drivers at risk by overstating its vehicles' self-driving capabilities.\n\nA U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigation published in April found that 542 crashes, including 14 with fatalities, had occurred in Tesla vehicles with Autopilot or FSD engaged between January 2018 and August 2023.\n\nPutting Autopilot and FSD into high-volume models, however, does give Tesla a distinct competitive advantage: A massive trove of data, collected by cameras on millions of vehicles, that it can analyze and use to develop self-driving tech.\n\nTwo of the former Tesla engineers said the relatively low cost of its technology enables the massive scale of its data collection, compared with relatively tiny fleets of competitors like Waymo. One of the engineers said Tesla's high-resolution cameras cost far less than lidar and could eventually allow the automaker to produce fully autonomous vehicles customers can afford.\n\nLidar uses lasers to produce three-dimensional images of a vehicle's surroundings as it navigates around obstacles.\n\nSpeaking to analysts and investors this summer, Musk boasted of “exponential” improvement and predicted Tesla might achieve unsupervised driving “by the end of this year,” adding that he would be “shocked if we cannot do it next year.”\n\nSasha Ostojic - a former driverless car engineer and software-development executive at Nvidia, Cruise and Zoox - said he believes it will take Tesla at least “three-plus years” just to match the level of autonomous driving Waymo achieves today. Ostojic now advises a Palo Alto venture capital firm, Playground Global, on technology investments.\n\n“I don’t see Tesla converging toward truly ‘eyes off, brain off’” autonomous driving, he said, “on the timelines Elon Musk has been promising.”\n\nERROR RATES AND EDGE CASES\n\nTesla once dabbled in multiple autonomous-driving technologies, too, but it started removing radar from its vehicles in 2021 and 2022 and by last year removed ultrasonic sensors designed to detect objects with sound waves.\n\nThe company’s sole reliance on AI-enabled computer vision leaves it with the challenge of eliminating a small but unacceptable error rate that could result in injuries and deaths if left unchecked, with no human driver, said specialists in autonomous-driving technology.\n\nMissy Cummings, a robotics and AI professor at George Mason University and a former advisor to NHTSA, cited several studies that have shown computer vision is highly accurate but still fails to recognize objects about 3% of the time.\n\n“What happens if it doesn’t see a pedestrian crossing the road or on the sidewalk?” she asked.\n\nJohn Krafcik, Waymo's former CEO, told Reuters the company’s use of additional sensors including radar and lidar make it “orders of magnitude more capable than Tesla” in perceiving objects. It’s technology is also more transparent when something goes wrong: The inability of end-to-end machine learning systems to pinpoint dangerous glitches “may be an intractable one for a company serious about safety,” Krafcik said.\n\n“If one of your cars has a significant at-fault crash,” he said, “one should be able to explain why it happened.”\n\nWaymo did not comment.\n\nThe former Tesla engineer who called its technology a “black box” said it’s never clear how the automaker’s system arrives at driving decisions. And that makes it hard to tell whether Tesla is close — and, if so, how close — to producing safe and fully autonomous vehicles. The engineer called it “impossible” for AI systems or their human engineers to anticipate every “edge case,” no matter how much data it analyzes.\n\n“You could argue there are an infinite number of crazy things happening on the road,” the engineer said.\n\n(Reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu in Austin, Texas and Chris Kirkham in Los Angeles; editing by Anna Driver and Brian Thevenot)",

        "title": "Jensen Huang Just Delivered Incredible News for Nvidia Stock Investors",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) supplies the most powerful graphics processing chips (GPUs) for developing artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company has an impressive list of customers who are spending truckloads of money to fill their data centers with those chips as they battle for AI supremacy.\n\nIn fact, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI infrastructure spending will top $1 trillion over the next five years, and his company is likely to be the biggest winner because it has a dominant market share in the GPU space.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC last week, Huang made a series of positive comments about Nvidia's new Blackwell GPU architecture. Here's why every investor in Nvidia stock should be excited.\n\nBlackwell will be transformative for Nvidia and AI developers alike\n\nLast year, Nvidia's H100 data center GPU set the benchmark for AI development. It's still in hot demand today, but it was superseded by the H200, which is capable of performing AI inference (ingesting live data into AI models to make predictions) at twice the speed.\n\nBut Nvidia's Blackwell architecture delivers a major leap in performance. The new Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system is capable of performing AI inference at a staggering 30 times the speed of the equivalent H100 system. Plus, each individual GB200 GPU is expected to sell for between $30,000 and $40,000, which is in the ballpark of what many data center operators originally paid for their H100 GPUs.\n\nIn other words, Blackwell is going to deliver an incredible improvement in cost efficiency. That's really important because most AI developers rent data center computing capacity by the minute from tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon. Blackwell will bring down the cost of deploying more powerful large language models (LLMs), which will make advanced AI applications affordable for a wider group of consumers and businesses.\n\nDuring its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), Nvidia generated a record $26.3 billion in data center revenue, up 154% from the year-ago period. The company -- along with most Wall Street analysts -- expects data center revenue to continue surging higher for the foreseeable future.\n\nHowever, there have been questions about how long tech giants can continue spending so much money on their AI infrastructure. Microsoft, for example, reported $55.7 billion in capital expenditures (capex) during its fiscal 2024 (ended June 30), much of which went toward data centers and chips. The company plans to spend even more in fiscal 2025. How sustainable is this level of investment across the tech industry?\n\nStory continues Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNot anytime soon, according to Huang's latest comments\n\nIn September, Oracle founder Larry Ellison told analysts about a dinner he attended with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Jensen Huang. He recalled Musk and himself begging Huang for more GPUs so they could bring their AI aspirations to life, but the chip giant simply can't keep up with demand.\n\nIn a CNBC interview last week, Huang said, \"Blackwell is in full production, Blackwell is as planned, and demand for Blackwell is insane.\"\n\nHe also said, \"Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first\" when it comes to Blackwell, which really highlights the existence of an AI arms race in the tech industry.\n\nBesides Microsoft, Amazon is on track to pour over $60 billion into capex, including AI-related investments, in calendar 2024. Alphabet will spend around $50 billion, and Meta Platforms plans to spend up to $40 billion. Oracle's capex totaled $6.9 billion in its fiscal 2024 (ended May 31), and it intends to double that number in fiscal 2025.\n\nIf AI infrastructure spending tops $1 trillion in the coming years, as Huang expects, then Nvidia's data center revenue likely has years' worth of growth left in the tank.\n\nNvidia stock is currently trading about 11% below its all-time high. Wall Street is forecasting $4.02 in earnings per share for the company's fiscal 2026 (which begins at the end of Jan. 2025), giving the stock a forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 31.8.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 technology index sports a similar forward P/E ratio of 29.8, so investors who are willing to hold Nvidia stock for at least the next couple of years are buying in at a compelling price, despite the stock's incredible ascent since early 2023.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is currently a Zacks #2 Rank as EPS growth surges over 25% this year and is projected to jump another 50%+ in 2025. Next year's revenues are also forecast to rise over 25% to cross $30 billion.\r\n\r\nAMD is also #2 in another way: next to NVIDIA (NVDA) it is the only other manufacturer of advanced GPU semiconductor systems for accelerated high-performance computing (HPC).\r\n\r\nLisa Su Steals Intel's Lunch Money\r\n\r\nBefore we discuss how AMD chief Lisa Su is taking on NVIDIA in the GPU market with its new line of Instinct processors, let's review her revitalization of AMD in the past 5 years from a company with only $5 billion on the top line.\r\n\r\nI always thought AMD was a bargain compared to NVIDIA, but in 2020 the rising of a new force was becoming clearer to more investors. I wrote about it here...\r\n\r\nRelease the Ryzen! AMD Roars in the Nanometer Wars\r\n\r\nAdvanced Micro Devices has strengthened its position in the semiconductor market on the back of its evolution as an enterprise-focus company from a pure-bred consumer-PC chip provider. AMD has emerged as a strong challenger to NVIDIA's dominance in the graphic processing unit or GPU market based on its Radeon chips.\r\n\r\nIn consumer-PC market, AMD has become a key challenger to Intel courtesy AMD Ryzen desktop processor family. The company's desktop-based processor offerings include Ryzen and high-end Ryzen Threadripper processors, among others. AMD Athlon and AMD PRO series of processors cater to commercial and consumer desktop PC market.\r\n\r\nAMD's processors are primarily powered by the company's proprietary \"Zen\" CPU and \"Vega\" GPU architectures. The company’s acquisition of Xilinx has helped in expanding into multiple embedded markets. AMD now offers Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\r\n\r\nThe $1.9 billion acquisition of Pensando in 2022 expanded AMD’s footprint into the data center market, where it now offers high-performance data processing units (DPUs) and a software stack.\r\n\r\nEPYC as the Datacenter AI Foundation\r\n\r\nAMD has spent the last seven years developing AMD EPYC™ Series processors, a family of server CPUs that cater to every level of business and to a wide range of needs.\r\n\r\nAMD EPYC™ processors are trusted to power a third of the world’s servers, and for good reason. Offering the world’s best data center CPU to enterprise customers, general-purpose AMD EPYC processors provide up to 96 core options that deliver up to 1.75x the performance per CPU watt.\r\n\r\nToday, the lineup offers a wide range of options, supporting customers who are just starting to develop their own infrastructure as well as large enterprises looking to scale cloud and datacenter to new heights.\r\n\r\nInstinct as the AI Factory Accelerator\r\n\r\nMany AI workloads and use cases require more than what AMD EPYC CPUs can do alone. Large language models continue to grow into the hundreds of billions -- even trillions -- of parameters.\r\n\r\nExtending the set of AI workloads managed effectively by AMD EPYC processors, comes the power of GPU acceleration, thanks to AMD Instinct™ accelerators.\r\n\r\nWhere AMD server CPUs manage small to medium models and mixed workload inference deployments, AMD accelerators facilitate high-volume, real-time AI training, dedicated AI deployments, medium to large models, and large-scale real-time inference, accelerating AI results for enterprises looking to make the most of new technologies.\r\n\r\nAMD Instinct™ MI300 Series accelerators are uniquely well-suited to power even the most demanding AI and HPC workloads, offering exceptional compute performance, large memory density, high bandwidth memory, and support for specialized data formats.\r\n\r\nThe Path Ahead for the AI Duopoly\r\n\r\nWe recently heard NVIDIA's Jensen Huang state that demand for his company's new Blackwell GPU is \"insane.\" Just another confirmation that this AI revolution is far from over as the build-out will extend the rest of this decade.\r\n\r\nI often call NVIDIA and AMD the \"AI Duopoly\" because of their running head-start with GPU accelerators and datacenter infrastructure expertise. They will both be offering new generations of their best ideas every 18 months, just like iPhones.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago after Oracle earnings, founder and chairman Larry Ellison made some comments about the AI revolution that were startling. He said they currently had 162 datacenters but expected that to grow to between 1,000 and 2,000 over the next decade.\r\n\r\nSince NVIDIA's Jensen Huang already has his eyes on helping a $1 trillion installed based of CPU-driven datacenters make the upgrade to GPU-accelerated designs, it only makes sense by logical extension that AMD will be participating in hundreds of billions worth of that transformation.\r\n\r\nLearn more at today's AMD event Advancing AI. One thing I'll be listening for Lisa to talk about is the integration of the 1,000 engineers she \"acquire-hired\" in her $5 billion buyout of datacenter builder ZT Systems.

        "title": "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Sold 88% of Duquesne's Stake in Nvidia and Is Piling Into 2 Unstoppable Stocks",
        "content": "Important data releases aren't hard to come by on Wall Street. Monthly employment and inflation reports, coupled with earnings season (i.e., six weeks packed full of operating results from public companies), can make it easy for important data to fly under the radar.\n\nWhile most investors were focused on the heart of earnings season in mid-August, as well as the release of the July inflation report, they may have missed the deadline for Wall Street's smartest and most-successful money managers to file their Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a clear snapshot of which stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) the top money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat's particularly noteworthy about the latest round of 13Fs is that Wall Street's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stock, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), was sent to the chopping block by at least seven billionaire asset managers for the third consecutive quarter.\n\nPerhaps the most prominent seller was billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office.\n\nStanley Druckenmiller slashed his fund's stake in Nvidia\n\nDruckenmiller tends to minimize risks when investing and attempts to align his portfolio with the health of the U.S. and global economy. During the second quarter, a number of tech stocks were pared down or sold in their entirety by Duquesne's investment team, including Nvidia. The 1,545.370 shares sold by Druckenmiller reduced his fund's stake in Wall Street's AI darling by roughly 88% to just 214,060 shares.\n\nOn the bright side, Nvidia has maintained its monopoly like status as the preferred provider of AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) used in high-compute data centers. The analysts at TechInsights pegged Nvidia's share of GPUs shipped to enterprise data centers at 98% in 2022 and 2023. Given the persistently strong demand for the H100 and next-generation Blackwell chip, Nvidia seems unlikely to cede its top spot anytime soon.\n\nBut there's another side to Nvidia's growth story that unabashed optimists and Wall Street may be overlooking.\n\nTo begin with, there hasn't been a game-changing innovation for three decades that's avoided a bubble-bursting event early in its existence. In simpler terms, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technology or innovation would become mainstream with consumers and/or businesses. The fact that most companies lack a well-defined game plan to generate a positive return on their AI investments is a strong clue that we're in the early stages of what's likely another bubble-bursting event.\n\nDruckenmiller might also be anticipating competitive pressures weighing on Nvidia's margins and, eventually, its bottom line. While new chips coming to market from competitors is expected, the bigger concern might be that all four of Nvidia's largest customers by net sales are developing AI-GPUs of their own. Even if Nvidia's chips are faster and more energy efficient, the ease of access and cost advantages of internally developed chips will lead to fewer opportunities for Nvidia in the future.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that no insiders have purchased shares of Nvidia on the open market since December 2020. This looks to be a clear signal that shares of Nvidia aren't the bargain they once were.\n\nBut while Druckenmiller was dumping most of Duquesne's stake in Nvidia during the June-ended quarter, he was piling into two unstoppable companies. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPhilip Morris International\n\nThe first smoking-hot deal that billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller found irresistible in the second quarter is tobacco goliath Philip Morris International(NYSE: PM). His fund purchased 889,355 shares of Philip Morris (worth around $90.1 million, as of the midpoint of 2024), as well as call options that give Duquesne the right to purchase up to 963,000 additional shares.\n\nFor years, tobacco stocks have been yesterday's news. Some developed countries have restricted the ability of tobacco companies to advertise, and consumers are now more aware of the potential dangers to their health of using tobacco products. Despite these challenges, Philip Morris's stock hit an all-time closing high in September.\n\nOne catalyst that's seemingly always in the corner of tobacco stocks is their pricing power. Tobacco contains nicotine, which is an addictive chemical. This addictive quality allows tobacco companies to raise the price on their products -- especially premium brands, such as Marlboro -- without chasing away their customers. Thus, even with cigarette shipments declining in developed markets, revenue continues to climb.\n\nPhilip Morris also enjoys unparalleled geographic diversity. This is a company with operations in 180 countries. If regulations for the tobacco industry become unfavorable in certain developed markets, Philip Morris can simply lean on emerging markets, where tobacco may still be considered a luxury item, to pick up the slack.\n\nAdditionally, Philip Morris is investing for a smokeless future. The company's smoke-free business accounted for 38% of net sales during the June-ended quarter, with its IQOS heated tobacco units leading the charge. The total number of IQOS users reached 30.8 million in the second quarter (up 1.9 million from the end of 2023), with its IQOS device commanding a greater than 8% share of the heated tobacco market in countries where IQOS is sold.\n\nAlthough Philip Morris's stock is at the high end of its valuation range over the last decade -- currently 17 times forward-year earnings -- Druckenmiller's fund is likely already up between 20% and 30% on its stake.\n\nKinder Morgan\n\nThe other unstoppable stock that billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller piled into during the June-ended quarter is energy goliath Kinder Morgan(NYSE: KMI). Duquesne's 13F shows that 2,872,665 shares of Kinder Morgan were purchased, which increased the fund's existing stake by 74% to 6,753,165 shares.\n\nInvestor sentiment toward oil and gas stocks has been mixed since the COVID-19 pandemic. The historic demand cliff observed during the early stages of the pandemic clobbered drillers. However, Kinder Morgan's operations have been largely unfazed.\n\nThe reason Kinder Morgan has thrived is because it's a midstream energy company. It's effectively a middleman that's responsible for transporting, storing, processing, and treating natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as petroleum products.\n\nThe beautiful thing about midstream energy companies (and Kinder Morgan is no exception) is that they primarily operate on fixed-fee contracts. Cementing long-term fixed-fee deals with drilling companies ensures that energy commodity spot-price volatility and inflation are non-factors. This leads to highly predictable operating cash flow year after year, which comes in especially handy for midstream providers.\n\nBeing able to accurately forecast operating cash flow a year or more in advance is what gives Kinder Morgan's board the confidence to dole out what's currently a nearly 5% dividend yield. Further, it affords management the ability to make bolt-on acquisitions that can rapidly expand its infrastructure and add to its cash flow.\n\nInterestingly enough, the three-year stretch during the pandemic where global energy companies slashed their capital expenditures (capex) might also be a long-term positive for Kinder Morgan. Reducing capex tightened the global supply of crude oil and lifted its spot price. If the spot price for in-demand energy commodities remains high, it'll likely incent more production and afford Kinder Morgan the opportunity to land lucrative, fixed-fee contracts.\n\nKinder Morgan is currently valued at 9.7 times forecast cash flow for 2025, which is its priciest multiple to cash flow since 2019. But with Druckenmiller's fund gaining in the neighborhood of 20% to 30% on its stake in Kinder Morgan in a couple of months, I doubt he or his investment team are complaining.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – October 10, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Duke Energy Corp. DUK, American Electric Power Co., Inc. AEP and MIND Technology, Inc. MIND.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for NVIDIA, Duke Energy and American Electric Power\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and American Electric Power Co., Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock, MIND Technology, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+168.5% vs. +119.6%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\r\n\r\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks analyst expects NVIDIA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 46.4% through fiscal 2025-2027. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds and the US-China tech war remain major concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Duke Energy have outperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past six months (+18.3% vs. +17.3%). The company remains a premier utility service provider that focuses on expanding its scale of operations and implementing modern technologies at its facilities. During the 2024-2028 period, the company plans to invest $73.4 billion to strengthen its grid and expand its renewable energy portfolio.\r\n\r\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023, Duke Energy reduced its carbon emissions by 48% from the 2005 level. However, it holds a weak solvency position. Duke Energy’s unfavorable financial ratios make one further skeptical about its financial position. Its EV/Sales ratio came in higher than the industry’s level.\r\n\r\nThe high interest rate environment in the United States remains a concern for Duke Energy. This may adversely impact its earnings growth and even constrict its future investment plans.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Duke Energy here >>>)\r\n\r\nAmerican Electric Power’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past year (+37.8% vs. +30.9%). The company’s geographically diversified operations allow it to avail of transmission opportunities with better returns compared to its single-state utility peers. The company owns the U.S' largest electricity transmission system, with 40,000 circuit miles of transmission lines.\r\n\r\nTo strengthen its grid, the company plans to invest $43 billion during the 2024-2028 period. Such investments should enable it to achieve a long-term earnings growth rate of 6-7%. Our model predicts total revenues to increase in 2024 to 2026 period.\r\n\r\nHowever, the stock holds a weak solvency position. New rules directed at fossil-fuel electric generation facilities may impact American Electric’s operating results. Moreover, the company may continue to incur rising interest expenses in the near future.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on American Electric Power here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of MIND Technology have underperformed the Zacks Technology Services industry over the past year (-18.3% vs. +47.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $5.4 million is facing risks which include supply chain disruptions, customer concentration, and market exposure to oil and gas cycles. Share dilution from the preferred stock conversion and competition from larger players remain concerns.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, MIND Technology's $26.2 million backlog as of July 31, 2024, up 50% YoY, provides strong revenue visibility into fiscal 2025, bolstered by demand for key products like GunLink and BuoyLink systems. MIND is expanding its market reach, capitalizing on the growing demand for marine seismic equipment, with a robust pipeline and recent orders in energy exploration.\r\n\r\nOperational efficiencies have improved profitability, with gross margins rising to 46% in the first half of fiscal 2025. The development of the Spectral Ai software suite diversifies its product offerings, targeting advanced analytics in marine tech. A debt-free balance sheet and solid working capital provide financial flexibility.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on MIND Technology here >>>)\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Winners And Losers Of Q2: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Vs The Rest Of The Processors and Graphics Chips Stocks",
        "content": "Winners And Losers Of Q2: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Vs The Rest Of The Processors and Graphics Chips Stocks\n\nAs the Q2 earnings season comes to a close, it’s time to take stock of this quarter’s best and worst performers in the processors and graphics chips industry, including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and its peers.\n\nThe biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\n\nThe 9 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.9% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 12.9% below.\n\nBig picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled.\n\nWhile some processors and graphics chips stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 2.3% since the latest earnings results.\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nInventor of the x86 processor that powered decades of technological innovation in PCs, data centers, and numerous other markets, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is the leading manufacturer of computer processors and graphics chips.\n\nIntel reported revenues of $12.83 billion, flat year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 1.1%. Overall, it was a softer quarter for the company with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decline in its operating margin.\n\n“Our Q2 financial performance was disappointing, even as we hit key product and process technology milestones. Second-half trends are more challenging than we previously expected, and we are leveraging our new operating model to take decisive actions that will improve operating and capital efficiencies while accelerating our IDM 2.0 transformation,” said Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO. Intel Total Revenue\n\nUnsurprisingly, the stock is down 19.5% since reporting and currently trades at $23.43.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead our full report on Intel here, it’s free.\n\nBest Q2: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nFounded in 1993 by Jensen Huang and two former Sun Microsystems engineers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading fabless designer of chips used in gaming, PCs, data centers, automotive, and a variety of end markets.\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $30.04 billion, up 122% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 4.5%. The business had an exceptional quarter with a significant improvement in its inventory levels and an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS estimates. Nvidia Total Revenue\n\nNvidia achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth among its peers. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 5.2% since reporting. It currently trades at $132.14.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free.\n\nWeakest Q2: Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC)\n\nA global leader in its category, Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) is a semiconductor designer specializing in customer-programmable chips that enhance CPU performance for intensive tasks such as machine learning.\n\nLattice Semiconductor reported revenues of $124.1 million, down 34.7% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 4.7%. It was a disappointing quarter as it posted underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decline in its operating margin.\n\nLattice Semiconductor delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group. As expected, the stock is down 5.4% since the results and currently trades at $51.98.\n\nRead our full analysis of Lattice Semiconductor’s results here.\n\nQorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO)\n\nFormed by the merger of TriQuint and RF Micro Devices, Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO) is a designer and manufacturer of RF chips used in almost all smartphones globally, along with a variety of chips used in networking equipment and infrastructure.\n\nQorvo reported revenues of $886.7 million, up 36.2% year on year. This print beat analysts’ expectations by 4.1%. Overall, it was a strong quarter as it also recorded an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS estimates and a significant improvement in its operating margin.\n\nThe stock is down 15% since reporting and currently trades at $101.50.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Qorvo here, it’s free.\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nHaving been at the forefront of developing the standards for cellular connectivity for over four decades, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading innovator and a fabless manufacturer of wireless technology chips used in smartphones, autos and internet of things appliances.\n\nQualcomm reported revenues of $9.39 billion, up 11.1% year on year. This result beat analysts’ expectations by 1.9%. Overall, it was a strong quarter as it also logged a decent beat of analysts’ EPS estimates and strong sales guidance for the next quarter.\n\nThe stock is down 5.9% since reporting and currently trades at $170.17.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Qualcomm here, it’s free.\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.

        "title": "2 Massive Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Before 2025",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has delivered stunning returns once again in 2024 following a blistering performance last year, but a closer look at the company's price chart will tell us that it has lost momentum over the past three months.\n\nNvidia stock has remained flat during this period because of doubts surrounding the company's artificial intelligence (AI)-related prospects and its ability to continue delivering eye-popping growth. Investors may be wondering if they should be buying more shares of this semiconductor giant or start booking profits. However, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia stock regaining its mojo and delivering another stellar year in 2025.\n\nIn this article, we will check out a couple of reasons why buying Nvidia stock before 2025 is a no-brainer.\n\nNvidia is expected to ship more AI chips next year\n\nAnalysts are expecting Nvidia to witness a substantial increase in shipments of its AI graphics processing units (GPUs) in 2025. Market research firm TrendForce believes that Nvidia could witness a 55% increase in shipments of its AI GPUs next year, driven by the arrival of the company's next-generation Blackwell processors.\n\nTrendForce estimates that Blackwell will account for 80% of Nvidia's AI GPU shipments next year. This also means that the shipments of Nvidia's older generation Hopper chips will continue to remain solid as well in 2025. The good part is that TrendForce isn't the only one expecting a jump in Nvidia's AI GPU sales next year.\n\nJapanese investment bank Mizuho has raised its estimate for Nvidia's 2025 AI GPU shipments by 8% to 10% as compared to its prior estimate issued in July this year. Mizuho credits this upward revision to an improvement in the company's supply chain. More specifically, Nvidia's foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (popularly known as TSMC) is reportedly going to double its advanced packaging capacity, which will allow the former to manufacture more AI GPUs.\n\nMoreover, TSMC plans to continue increasing its advanced packaging capacity beyond next year as well. The foundry giant believes that it will be able to clock an annual growth rate of at least 60% in its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) packaging capacity through 2026. This should place Nvidia in a nice position to capitalize on the fast-growing demand for AI chips.\n\nAllied Market Research estimates that sales of AI chips could increase at an annual rate of 38% through 2032, generating $384 billion in annual revenue. Nvidia is the dominant player in the AI chip market with a market share that's estimated between 70% and 95%, though a closer look at its AI revenue as compared to that of its rivals will indicate that its share is likely at the higher end of that range.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore importantly, TSMC's improving production profile should ensure that Nvidia maintains its dominance in the AI chip market. So, higher sales of AI GPUs should translate into solid growth for Nvidia in the next fiscal year, while its pricing power in this market would lead to healthy growth in its bottom line as well. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\n\nThe valuation shouldn't be a concern considering its potential growth\n\nSome might point out that Nvidia is richly valued right now with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 58, which is higher than the Nasdaq-100 index's average earnings multiple of 32. But at the same time, Nvidia has been able to justify its valuation with outstanding growth. In fact, Nvidia's earnings multiple is currently lower than its five-year average P/E of 72.\n\nAlso, Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of just 0.14 means that the stock is very much undervalued considering the growth that it is forecasted to deliver. NVDA PEG Ratio Chart\n\nNVDA PEG Ratio data by YCharts\n\nThe PEG ratio is a valuation metric that takes into account the potential earnings growth that a company could deliver. A reading of less than 1 means that the said stock is undervalued. That's why now would be a good time for investors to load up on Nvidia stock before the potential jump in sales of the company's AI chips in 2025 sends it soaring.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI data center stocks.\n\nThe AI data center industry is experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the massive computational power they require. AI data centers are specialized facilities designed to handle high-intensity AI workloads, including machine learning, natural language processing, and neural network training. These facilities integrate advanced hardware and software to process large-scale data efficiently, creating a crucial infrastructure for the global digital economy. Leading technology companies are making substantial investments in AI data centers. For instance, Meta announced plans to invest $33 billion in data center expansion to support AI research and development. Google is also investing billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, committing $3.3 billion in just one region of the United States​. These investments highlight the significance of AI data centers in the broader tech ecosystem.\n\nAI workloads demand hardware that can process vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This need has led to the development of AI-specific chips, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These chips are essential components in AI data centers.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhile AI data centers are essential for technological progress, they consume enormous amounts of energy. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers worldwide account for about 1% of global electricity demand, a figure that could increase significantly with the rise of AI. Cooling systems, necessary to maintain optimal hardware performance, further contribute to this energy demand. To address this, companies are increasingly focused on building energy-efficient data centers. For example, Google has implemented machine learning algorithms to reduce energy use in its data centers by 30%.\n\nThe AI data center industry will continue to evolve as the demand for AI-driven applications grows. Experts predict a significant shift toward edge computing, where data centers are decentralized and located closer to the source of data generation. This reduces latency and improves performance for real-time AI applications such as autonomous driving and smart cities. Moreover, the integration of quantum computing into AI data centers could revolutionize the field. Quantum computers are capable of processing complex calculations at speeds unattainable by classical computers, making them ideal for AI and big data applications. Companies like IBM and Google are already exploring quantum technology in their AI research.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The company has emerged as the most important AI data center stock in the past few months. This is because it has managed to become the biggest provider of data center hardware, like chips and GPUs, to hyperscale customers. The GPU and chips of the firm derive their competitive advantage on power and efficiency. In addition to these, the company has also started focusing on AI software needed to maximize the potential of these chips. Back in 2022, NVIDIA CFO Collete Kress had claimed that the subscription-based GPU model of the firm, which packages AI hardware and software, would drive $1 trillion in revenue for the company.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best AI data center stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Wednesday, October 9, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and American Electric Power Co., Inc. (AEP), as well as a micro-cap stock MIND Technology, Inc. (MIND). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+168.5% vs. +119.6%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high performance and accelerated computing.

Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. \r\n\r\nThe Zacks analyst expects NVIDIA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 46.4% through fiscal 2025-2027. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds and the US-China tech war remain major concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Duke Energy have outperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past six months (+18.3% vs. +17.3%). The company remains a premier utility service provider that focuses on expanding its scale of operations and implementing modern technologies at its facilities. During the 2024-2028 period, the company plans to invest $73.4 billion to strengthen its grid and expand its renewable energy portfolio. \r\n\r\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023, Duke Energy reduced its carbon emissions by 48% from the 2005 level. However, it holds a weak solvency position. Duke Energy’s unfavorable financial ratios make one further skeptical about its financial position. Its EV/Sales ratio came in higher than the industry’s level. \r\n\r\nThe high interest rate environment in the United States remains a concern for Duke Energy. This may adversely impact its earnings growth and even constrict its future investment plans.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Duke Energy here >>>)\r\n\r\nAmerican Electric Power’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past year (+37.8% vs. +30.9%). The company’s geographically diversified operations allow it to avail of transmission opportunities with better returns compared to its single-state utility peers. The company owns the U.S' largest electricity transmission system, with 40,000 circuit miles of transmission lines. \r\n\r\nTo strengthen its grid, the company plans to invest $43 billion during the 2024-2028 period. Such investments should enable it to achieve a long-term earnings growth rate of 6-7%. Our model predicts total revenues to increase in 2024 to 2026 period. \r\n\r\nHowever, the stock holds a weak solvency position. New rules directed at fossil-fuel electric generation facilities may impact American Electric’s operating results. Moreover, the company may continue to incur rising interest expenses in the near future.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on American Electric Power here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of MIND Technology have underperformed the Zacks Technology Services industry over the past year (-18.3% vs. +47.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $5.4 million is facing risks which include supply chain disruptions, customer concentration, and market exposure to oil and gas cycles. Share dilution from the preferred stock conversion and competition from larger players remain concerns.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, MIND Technology's $26.2 million backlog as of July 31, 2024, up 50% YoY, provides strong revenue visibility into fiscal 2025, bolstered by demand for key products like GunLink and BuoyLink systems. MIND is expanding its market reach, capitalizing on the growing demand for marine seismic equipment, with a robust pipeline and recent orders in energy exploration. \r\n\r\nOperational efficiencies have improved profitability, with gross margins rising to 46% in the first half of fiscal 2025. The development of the Spectral Ai software suite diversifies its product offerings, targeting advanced analytics in marine tech. A debt-free balance sheet and solid working capital provide financial flexibility.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on MIND Technology here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Williams-Sonoma, Inc.

        "title": "Nvidia Is Still Undervalued, Says $50 Billion Manager Impax",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- As Nvidia Corp. found itself the target of a deep selloff earlier this year, Impax Asset Management was quietly seizing the moment to build a stake it had long regretted not owning.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes\n\nIan Simm, chief executive officer and founder of the $50 billion London-based asset manager, says he and his team had been looking for an opportunity to correct what they had come to realize was a wrong call a few years ago, which meant missing out on Nvidia’s stunning 800% rally since the beginning of 2023.\n\n“We just underestimated the market potential of their product,” Simm said in an interview. Impax had been looking for a way in, but Nvidia “was expensive.” That is, “until it had a selloff.”\n\nNvidia’s share-price slump earlier this year resulted in a peak-to-trough decline in its market value of close to $1 trillion. Though much of that has since been recouped, Simm says he thinks the company’s current valuation of more than $3.2 trillion understates what it’s really worth.\n\nEstablished in 1998, Impax has made a name for itself as a giant among asset managers focused on the transition to a more sustainable economy. Simm says that goal should be compatible with making money for his clients. But it’s been a tough sell of late.\n\nOver the past couple of years, a spike in interest rates, an energy crisis and the ascent of the so-called Magnificent Seven of technology behemoths have turned green investing into a losing bet. Impax’s own share price is down almost 30% this year, while the S&P Global Clean Energy Index has lost more than 10%. The S&P 500, meanwhile, is up more than 20% in the same period.\n\nEarlier this week, Impax reported results that showed gains in listed equities of £5.3 billion ($6.9 billion) for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. Still, that was less than the £5.8 billion of net outflows that Impax suffered in the period.\n\nSimm says Impax is learning from the past few years and focusing more on Big Tech, as it looks for undervalued opportunities to generate bigger returns.\n\n“Frankly, we’ve underperformed for the last couple of years in our main strategies because we’ve been more growth-at-a-reasonable-price, staying away from the momentum and hype around mega-cap tech investing,” he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Nvidia’s share price was falling in June, Impax more than tripled its stake in the company to 4.9 million shares by the end of the month from 1.4 million shares at the end of the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and confirmed by Impax.\n\nSimm says Impax still considers Nvidia to be undervalued when taking into account how the boom in artificial intelligence is expected to drive demand for its chips.\n\nSimm says holding Nvidia, which like other technology giants needs to consume vast stores of energy to power its growth, also makes investing sense from a climate perspective. As demand for energy continues to increase, Nvidia and other companies that develop more efficient models will be better for the environment, he says.\n\nNvidia’s Blackwell chips, which are beginning to roll out to customers this year, would need 3 gigawatts of power to develop OpenAI’s GPT-4 software, the company said at an event earlier this month. Ten years ago, that process would have required 5,500 gigawatts, the chipmaker said.\n\n“Nvidia’s ability to deliver energy savings makes it even more valuable,” Simm said.\n\nImpax holds Nvidia in five strategies and funds. That includes its Global Opportunities portfolio, which is limited to 40 stocks and consists of companies that have a diversified business model, operate in high-growth markets and are “out of favor for whatever reason,” Simm said. Microsoft Corp. is included because Impax thinks it’s undervalued “in the context of the secular trend toward more AI,” he said.\n\nIn fact, “the whole industrial space” now looks undervalued, Simm said. That may change as a “soft landing in the US” looks increasingly likely, which is helping restore confidence, he said. The cost of capital is falling and consumer sentiment is stabilizing, so equity “is looking more attractive.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMusk Reveals Why He’s Jumping Into Trump’s Arms How Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession Rate Cuts Need Time to Work Their Way Through the Economy Hamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

Moreover, oil prices have declined, boosting investors’ confidence.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 386 points, or 0.9%.

Oil prices declined, taking the international benchmark Brent crude closer to $72 per barrel.\n\nShares of Alphabet slip after DOJ filing\n\nGoogle parent company Alphabet’s (GOOG) shares dropped over 2% as the Department of Justice could consider breaking up Google after a federal judge ruled in August that the tech giant monopolized the online search engine market.\n\nTo address Google’s monopoly, the Justice Department said in a court filing Tuesday that it will find remedies that would prevent and restrain any present and future maintenance of the company’s dominance in the search market.\n\nNvidia’s market cap surpasses Microsoft — again\n\nNvidia stock(NVDA) seems to be climbing back to its record-high close from June. The AI chipmaker’s stock was up almost 1% at the open Wednesday. Nvidia’s rising stock has pushed its market capitalization past Microsoft’s (MSFT) once again.\n\nDuring Wednesday morning trading, the chipmaker’s market cap reached $3.26 trillion, while Microsoft’s was $3.09 trillion. Both trailed Apple’s (AAPL) market cap of $3.44 trillion. In June, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple in total market cap and crossed the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. Just weeks later, it overtook both Apple and Microsoft to, at the time, become the the world’s most valuable public company.\n\nBoeing stock drops as strike continues\n\nBoeing (BA-2.41%) withdrew its latest offer to union machinists Tuesday after negotiations broke down as their strike heads into its fourth week.

        "title": "Nvidia wants to drive AI costs down as 'reasoning' models rise",
        "content": "Nvidia’s (NVDA) chips have been a driver of the current artificial intelligence boom — and the chipmaker only wants to make it move faster, chief executive Jensen Huang said.\n\nDuring an appearance on the Tech Unheard podcast, Huang was asked by host Rene Haas, chief executive of British semiconductor company Arm (ARM), if the pace of AI innovation is moving “faster than you imagined.”\n\nHuang replied, “No,” and said Nvidia is “trying to make it go faster.”\n\n“We’ve gone to a one-year cycle,” Huang said about the company’s production of new chips. “And the reason for that is because the technology has the opportunity to move fast.”\n\nNvidia is designing “six or seven new chips per system,” Huang said, then using “co-design to reinvent the entire system” and inventing other technologies that allow it to improve performance by two or three times while using the same amount of energy and cost each year.\n\n“That’s another way of, essentially, reducing the cost of AI by two or three times per year,” Huang said. “That is way faster than Moore’s Law.”\n\nOver the next few years, Huang said, Nvidia wants to drive down the cost of AI amid the rise of even more complex models. This evolution is already underway. In September, OpenAI released a new series of “reasoning” AI models called o1, which are “designed to spend more time thinking before they respond,” the way humans do.\n\nIn the future, AI services such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which Huang said he uses every day, will “iteratively reason about the answer” and could go through hundreds or thousands of inferences before producing an output.\n\nThis level of complex processing would require significantly more computational power than current models. Despite the increased demands, Huang believes the trade-off is worthwhile.\n\n“[T]he quality of the answer is so much better,” Huang said. “We want to drive the cost down so that we could deliver this new type of reasoning inference with the same level of cost and responsiveness as the past.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia’s stock was climbing back toward its record high $135 close in June. The chipmaker’s shares were down 0.27% during midday trading, but opened up almost 1% at around $134 per share.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) is aiming for a new all-time high close as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe stock traded roughly flat Wednesday, closing at $132.65. It previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June.\n\nNvidia has been on a torrid winning streak, notching its fifth consecutive day of gains Tuesday before Wednesday's slightly down session. Shares are up 12% from last week.\n\nThe stock’s climb has been fueled by a barrage of good news for the AI chipmaker. Wall Street analysts this week have reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs “remains extremely robust.” A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia’s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday.\n\nNvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan’s largest supercomputer during Foxconn’s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a mega-factory it’s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia’s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions. Deepu Talla, Nvidia's vice president for AI and robotics makes a speech at Foxconn's annual tech day in Taiwan on Oct. 8, 2024. (REUTERS/Ann Wang) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nNvidia’s weeklong ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company’s second-quarter earnings. Shares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China, due to rising trade tensions with the US, had also driven shares down. Nvidia’s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June.\n\nOther positive news in the semiconductor sector Wednesday could help Nvidia stock achieve a new record close. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations — another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term.\n\n“AI is hot,” Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, “I see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.”\n\nThe chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech’s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown.\n\nSemiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia’s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that the company is boosting capacity to meet “crazy” demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs (graphics processing units). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips has been “insane.”\n\nStory continues\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nView comments",

At the 2024 event, the company unveiled new products and partnerships.\n\nNvidia showed off the NVIDIA Ace (Avatar Cloud Engine) that could provide generative AI models for digital avatars, helping several video game companies like NetEase, Tencent and Ubisoft.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also announced a partnership with content creator marketplace Getty Images at the event.\n\nNvidia introduced the GeForce RTX 40 Super Series at the 2024 CES.\n\n\"Generative AI is the single most significant platform transition in computing history and will transform every industry, including gaming,\" Huang said in a press release sharing the RTX 40 Super Series details for CES 2024.\n\nNvidia also announced NVIDIA Isaac to bring generative AI into robotics and highlighted partnerships for its automotive segment.\n\nRumors are swirling that Nvidia could use CES 2025 to share details of its RTX-50 GPU series — a key catalyst for the stock.\n\nNividia shares traded at all-time highs during CES 2024 and investors will be closely monitoring the 2025 event.\n\nWhile shares hit all-time highs during CES 2024 on the heels of new products and partnerships, they didn't stop there.\n\nNvidia stock is up 153.7% from the highs on Jan. 8, 2024.\n\nWith three months to go until CES 2025, investors and analysts will likely look to history to see the impact Nvidia's presence at the technology conference in 2024 had on the stock.\n\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\n\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nArrived Homes, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform, offers a Private Credit Fund.

        "content": "AI behemoth NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is breaking out and could be heading to its June high of around $141 per share, according to technical analyst Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies.\n\n\"Heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) confirmed a triangle breakout yesterday, supporting near-term follow-through toward its June high (~$141),\" Stockton said. \"While the SPX and NDX have seen short-term momentum weaken, NVDA’s breakout is likely to prevent a major pullback in the major indices, which is part of the reason why we keep a short-term neutral bias for U.S. equities in today's Fairlead Tactics.\"\n\nNVIDIA stock has been up six straight sessions, including today's fractional gain of 0.12%. The stock is up more than 170% year-to-date.\n\nAnalysts have been increasingly bullish on the company's Blackwell product, which the CEO Jensen Huang said is seeing \"insane\" demand.\n\n\"Blackwell is in full production, Blackwell is as planned, and demand for Blackwell is insane,\" Huang said on CNBC's last week. \"Everyone wants the most, and everyone wants to be first.\"\n\nToday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) reported that September sales beat estimates on solid AI chip demand. TSM said revenue for September 2024 was approximately NT$251.87 billion, an increase of 0.4 percent from August 2024 and an increase of 39.6 percent from September 2023. TSM makes NVIDIA's AI chip.\n\nOn Tuesday, analysts at Morgan Stanley said Blackwell production revenue in 1Q25 may surpass Hopper. Blackwell chips command a price premium, with B200 chips priced 60-70% higher than H200, positioning Blackwell revenue to overtake Hopper in the upcoming quarter.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia's stock is breaking out, Fairlead Strategies says\n\nMorocco stocks higher at close of trade; Moroccan All Shares up 0.92%\n\nMeta's AI chatbot to be available in new markets including Brazil, UK\n\nView comments",

It later fell to about $133 per share. Nvidia (NVDA) shares closed at almost $133 the day before.\n\nNvidia’s rising stock has pushed its market capitalization past Microsoft’s (MSFT) again. During Wednesday morning trading, the chipmaker’s market cap reached $3.26 trillion, while Microsoft’s was $3.09 trillion. Both trailed Apple’s (AAPL) market cap of $3.44 trillion.\n\nIn June, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple in total market cap and crossed the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. Just weeks later, it overtook both Apple and Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable public company. Despite falling back down, Nvidia remains the most valuable semiconductor company in the world. In February, it became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after reporting record fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nIn June, Nvidia’s shares closed at a record high $135.58, days after it initiated a 10-for-1 stock split. Since then, its shares have experienced some turbulence, but the company’s stock is still up 173.4% so far this year. Compared to a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up 192%.\n\nMeanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), which supplies Nvidia and Apple with chips, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue of NT$759.7 billion, or $23.6 billion, for the September quarter, according to Reuters.

        "title": "AI’s Thirst for Power Turns Utility Stocks Into Big Tech Proxies",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The tech world’s obsession with artificial intelligence is continuing to spur a huge demand for power — supercharging returns in the utilities sector and shaking up the S&P 500 index. Wall Street sees more to come.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? Singapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes\n\nWhile utilities have been market leaders all year thanks to AI, shares in independent power producers Vistra Corp. and Constellation Energy Corp. have really taken off in the past month, helped by a landmark deal for Constellation to supply nuclear power to Microsoft Corp. Vistra — a top pick of Third Point LLC’s Daniel Loeb because of its AI-related potential — is the top S&P 500 performer year-to-date, with a more than 220% gain eclipsing Nvidia Corp.’s 165% rally.\n\nConstellation is in fourth place, with a jump of about 130%, while power company NRG Energy Inc. and electrical equipment maker GE Vernova Inc. are also in the leaderboard’s top ten. Last year, the top spots were dominated by chip and server makers, as well as AI trades like Meta Platforms Inc.\n\n“What was introduced to utilities is this growth component and that is AI and the need for electricity and, more importantly, the potential for pretty substantial electricity growth,” said Rob Thummel, managing director and portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC. That’s “gotten investors excited as they look for cheaper ways to invest in AI and not have to buy more expensive technology stocks.”\n\nThe gains have come as investors grow more cautious about the original AI winners, questioning how long it will take for big technology firms’ heavy spending on AI to pay off. As in previous rushes, purveyors of the tools that power the frenzy — like Nvidia — are among the most obvious early winners. But no matter which companies end up using the chips or developing the best AI software, they’ll all need more power.\n\nInvestors have been taking notice, pushing shares in Texas-based Vistra and Maryland-headquartered Constellation to multiple record highs recently. The pair have been particularly prominent among utilities because of their position as independent power producers (IPPs) — a status that means they sell electricity at market prices, unlike regulated utilities.\n\nMultiple analysts have raised their price targets for Constellation since the Microsoft deal, while those at Guggenheim think the rally in IPPs has legs, even after the recent stellar performance.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We see further growth driven by power market upside, datacenter/hyperscaler deals further improving the overall business mix, cash flow profile,” the team led by Shahriar Pourreza wrote. They are buy-rated on the entire sector, and set new Street-high price targets for both Vistra and Constellation.\n\nThummel also expects to see more deals. “The anticipation is that these independent power producers can actually be the first source solution for these new hyperscalers like Amazon, Google and Meta — whoever is going to want to get these new data centers powered as soon as possible,” he said.\n\nAt the same time — and in contrast to the recent volatility of the tech sector — power also benefits from being seen as a defensive play with solid dividends that should be supported by interest rate cuts.\n\nThose factors have helped the overall S&P 500 Utilities Index outperform the broader market, with a 25% gain this year. The typically-staid sector is now on track for its best annual performance since 2000.\n\nEven after recent gains, the two biggest winners in the group aren’t as expensive as tech. Vistra shares trade at about 20 times forward earnings, less than the Nasdaq 100 index at about 26 times, while Constellation has a multiple of about 31 times. Nvidia, meanwhile, trades at 36 times earnings after its recent decline.\n\nTo be sure, this year’s surge for utilities comes after the group underperformed the market last year, declining 10% compared with a 24% gain for the S&P 500. Gains may also be fragile given the sector’s sensitivity to rates: Vistra and Constellation both sold off this week amid bets that the Federal Reserve will opt for a smaller rate cut next month.\n\nStill, the rally shows the broadening out of the AI trade, and has some investors looking for the next part of the market that stands to gain.\n\n“Generative AI will have the most impact among sort-of pedestrian companies,” said Irene Tunkel, chief US equity strategist at BCA Research Inc., pointing to industries like pharmaceuticals. “The huge revolutionary change will be happening elsewhere and money is not going there yet.”\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nThe US Justice Department is considering asking a federal judge to force Google to sell off parts of its business in what would be a historic breakup of one of the world’s biggest tech companies. Walt Disney Co. is increasing ticket prices for its two Southern California theme parks by about 6% on most days. A new HBO documentary about the origins of Bitcoin suggests that Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the original cryptocurrency, is likely Canadian software developer Peter Todd. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. posted a better-than-expected 39% rise in quarterly revenue, assuaging concerns that AI hardware spending is beginning to taper off. Online verification company ID.me Inc. is letting employees and early investors sell shares in a deal that values the startup at $1.8 billion, according to people familiar with the situation. OpenAI is building a team in Singapore to support growing demand for artificial intelligence tools in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPostmarket\n\nE2open\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates stock moves throughout.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMusk Reveals Why He’s Jumping Into Trump’s Arms How Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession Rate Cuts Need Time to Work Their Way Through the Economy Hamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Go Parabolic",
        "content": "Many companies have witnessed a tremendous increase in their share prices over the past couple of years thanks to the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), which is not surprising as this technology has created massive demand for both hardware and software.\n\nThe good part is that AI is currently in its early phases of growth. IDC estimates that global AI spending could increase at an annual rate of 29% over the next five years, hitting $632 billion in value in 2028.\n\nThis robust increase in the adoption of AI could help make companies like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW) make a parabolic move, which refers to the rapid rise in the stock price of a company in a short time (just like the right side of a parabolic curve).\n\nNvidia stock has already gained immensely in the past couple of years thanks to its pioneering role in the AI hardware market, but Snowflake has headed south because of its slowing growth. More specifically, Snowflake stock is down over 42% in 2024, while Nvidia has jumped 152%.\n\nLet's look at the reasons why AI could help one of these names make a parabolic jump and head even higher while also allowing the beaten-down Snowflake to rise rapidly.\n\nNvidia's new Blackwell chips could fuel its rally\n\nThe robust demand for Nvidia's data center graphics processing units (GPUs) based on the Hopper architecture has played an instrumental role in the company's outstanding growth in recent quarters. Demand for its H100 Hopper AI GPUs was so solid that the chip reportedly commanded a waiting period of as long as a year.\n\nThe company followed up this chip with the more powerful H200 processor, whose production ramp and shipments started in the previous quarter.\n\nNvidia points out that the shipments of its Hopper-based GPUs will increase in the second half of the current fiscal year thanks to improved supply and availability, suggesting that the H200 could continue to bring in more business for the company. However, all eyes are set on Nvidia's next generation of AI chips based on the Blackwell platform.\n\nThe company started sampling the Blackwell processors to customers last quarter. Nvidia says that the production ramp of the Blackwell chips will begin in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. More importantly, Nvidia claims that the \"demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year.\"\n\nAdditionally, CEO Jensen Huang recently told CNBC that Blackwell is witnessing \"insane\" demand. That's not surprising as the company has already lined up multiple customers that include the likes of Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta Platforms, and others for this chip that's reportedly going to deliver a 4 times jump in performance over the Hopper chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley estimates that Nvidia could sell $200 billion worth of Blackwell-based server systems next year. While that seems like an ambitious target, the pace at which Nvidia's data center revenue is growing suggests that it could indeed hit that mark. More specifically, Nvidia's data center revenue has more than tripled in the first six months of fiscal 2025 to $49 billion from $14.6 billion in the same period last year.\n\nThe current run rate suggests that Nvidia could end the year with $98 billion in data center revenue. That would be more than double its fiscal 2024 data center revenue of $47.5 billion. Morgan Stanley's forecast suggests that Nvidia may be able to double its data center revenue once again in the next fiscal year. If that's indeed the case, the semiconductor giant's top line could land well ahead of the $178 billion revenue that analysts are expecting from the company next fiscal year.\n\nThat could reignite Nvidia's stupendous rally once again following a flat performance in the past three months and could even help the stock go on a parabolic run.\n\nAI is helping Snowflake build a solid revenue pipeline\n\nSnowflake is a cloud-based data platform provider on which customers store and consolidate data so that they can derive insights using that data, build applications, and even share that data. And now, Snowflake is adding AI-focused capabilities to its data cloud platform.\n\nThe company has been renting GPUs so that it can \"fulfill customer demand for our newer product features,\" suggesting that Snowflake's AI offerings are gathering momentum. Snowflake enables its customers to develop AI applications using large language models (LLMs) and deploy those models within the secure environment of its data cloud platform.\n\nSnowflake customers can build custom chatbots, use the company's Copilot feature to speed up their tasks and extract data from documents, among other things. Snowflake management pointed out on the August earnings conference call that more than 2,500 customers were using its AI offerings in its fiscal 2025's second quarter (ended July 31).\n\nIt is worth noting that Snowflake ended the quarter with just over 10,000 customers, indicating that it is well-placed to upsell its AI services to a large customer base. The good part is that the growing adoption of its AI tools is leading to increased spending by existing customers.\n\nThe company's net revenue retention rate stood at 127% in fiscal Q2, a metric that compares the spending by its customers at the end of a particular period to the spending by the same customer base in the year-ago period. So, a net revenue retention rate of more than 100% means that it is winning a bigger share of customers' wallets.\n\nEven better, the quality of Snowflake's customer base seems to be improving as well. This is evident from the fact that the number of customers who have generated more than $1 million in product revenue for the company increased by 28% year over year to 510 in the previous quarter, as compared to the 21% growth in the overall customer base.\n\nThis combination of higher spending by its existing customers as well as the addition of new customers explains why Snowflake's remaining performance obligations (RPO) shot up a remarkable 48% year over year last quarter to $5.2 billion. That exceeded the 30% year-over-year growth in the company's product revenue.\n\nAs RPO refers to the total value of a company's future contracts that are yet to be fulfilled, the faster growth in this metric as compared to its revenue growth suggests that Snowflake's revenue growth is likely to accelerate in the long run. Of course, the investments that the company is making are weighing on its margins, with its non-GAAP (adjusted) operating margin dropping to 5% last quarter from 8% in the year-ago period.\n\nThat's why analysts are expecting Snowflake's bottom line to shrink to $0.61 per share in fiscal 2025 from $0.98 per share in the previous year. However, it is expected to return to terrific bottom-line growth from the next fiscal year.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Trending AI Stocks in October. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nTom Lee, Fundstrat co-founder, while talking to CNBC in a latest program, explained his bullish case for the market and why he believes the S&P 500 is headed to close the year “well beyond” 5,700.\n\n“Bull markets are supported by a strong fundamentals and this is a case where not only has the economy survivie extremely high interest rates but the Fed is beginning to cut rates, and an economy that has been sort of languishing has been China. Now we have stimulus and what looks like some bazooka policies that are supporting that region, and we have a lot of cash on the sidelines. I think this is a formula for stocks to do pretty well the next three to 12 months, and that’s why we think that we would be well beyond 5700 before year-end.”\n\nLee said that he’s inclined to buy “risks outright” as he believes more upward momentum would come for stocks after the election.\n\n“Small caps still have good fundamentals, earnings growth is accelerating, the media P/E is eleven times which is almost seven turns lower than the S&P so I think there is still case to be made that small-cap are starting a multi-year gain.”\n\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks that are making big moves on the back of latest news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Analyst Sees ‘Continued Growth’ For Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) On Training Demand Inference\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains one of the “top picks” among large-cap generative artificial intelligence companies, according to William Blair. “The company has already seen tremendous growth for its GPU and parallel computing systems, and we believe there is time for continued growth, driven by robust training demand from hyperscalers and enterprises, and a ramping inference opportunity,” said William Blair analysts Sebastien Naji and Jason Ader in a detailed investor note.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has also built a strong competitive advantage, with its CUDA software stack being the standard interface for GPUs and AI, Naji added. Both training and inference offer further growth potential as the new Blackwell cycle gets underway.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s declines after the Q2 results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\n\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\n\nAt Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\n\nOf course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n“This focus on consistency also guides our regular trimming of strong performers to manage stock-specific and overall portfolio risk. The quarter saw us continue to trim NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), reducing the GPU chipmaker from an active weight in the portfolio to an underweight versus the benchmark. We continue to believe in Nvidia’s 10-year trajectory as hyperscaler and enterprise customers invest in GPU architecture. However, we have reduced our Nvidia position as its valuation now more fully reflects the company’s robust growth path and as estimates have risen to levels that require a very steep growth trajectory to drive further stock appreciation.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Trending AI Stocks in October. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Stocks That You Can Buy and Hold for Decades",
        "content": "Are you looking for stocks that you can put in your portfolio and just buy and forget about? With the volatility in the stock market these days, it's not always easy to find safe and stable investments to hang on to and not worry about. But as long as you invest in businesses with strong fundamentals and solid prospects for the future, you can find some great long-term options out there.\n\nThree stocks that look unstoppable in the long run and which can be ideal investments in any portfolio are Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST), Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Below, I'll examine why you shouldn't worry about holding onto these stocks for the long run.\n\nCostco Wholesale\n\nBig-box retailer Costco has proven itself to be one of the largest and most versatile retail stocks that you can own. Regardless of economic conditions, there always seems to be plenty of traffic at the company's warehouses. Not only has it generated strong and consistent growth over the years, but Costco still has plenty of room to expand internationally; more than 80% of its warehouses are located in Canada and the U.S.\n\nThe company recently wrapped up its 2024 fiscal year (which ended on Sept. 1), and comparable sales grew by 5.3% year over year. A big growth opportunity remains in e-commerce, where the comparable growth rate was even higher at 16.1%. Costco's business remains strong even with consumers struggling due to inflation.\n\nWhile the stock may seem expensive, trading at more than 50 times earnings, with many opportunities for continued growth and the business flourishing under various circumstances, this is an excellent stock to buy and hold for decades.\n\nToronto-Dominion Bank\n\nToronto-Dominion Bank is a top Canadian-based bank that also has a solid presence in the U.S. It is one of the most stable stocks you can put in your portfolio as it generates strong and consistent earnings over the years. While there may be some fluctuations due to interest rates and economic conditions, it can make for an ideal long-term investment, especially as it continues to grow its operations.\n\nOne of the best reasons to own Toronto-Dominion is its dividend, which today yields 4.7%. It looks strong compared to the average S&P 500 yield of 1.3%. Toronto-Dominion Bank has been making dividend payments going back all the way to 1857. That's a period covering wars, the Great Depression, inflation, and other economic turbulence. The bank has a solid track record for paying dividends, and that's why it can be an excellent stock to hold on to.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrading at just 10 times its estimated future profits, Toronto-Dominion is an attractively valued stock with solid fundamentals to which you can hang on for the long haul.\n\nNvidia\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has lifted Nvidia to a monstrous $3 trillion valuation this year, but there's little reason to expect that the stock has peaked, especially when you're looking at the long run. AI is still in its early innings, meaning demand for Nvidia's chips is going to rise; according to research company Gartner, the AI chip market could be worth $119.4 billion by 2027 -- up from $67.1 billion this year. With so much growth still on the horizon for Nvidia, it's arguably still not too late to invest in it.\n\nThe tech stock has been slowing down in recent weeks (it's down 3% in three months) but if you're patient and willing to hang on, Nvidia still has the potential to generate excellent returns for you over the years. It has a price-to-earnings-growth multiple of right around 1, which indicates that it's a good value buy for investors willing to hold the stock for at least five years. And if you're prepared to stay invested even longer, Nvidia may be an even better investment.\n\nIn the past four quarters, Nvidia has generated a staggering $46.8 billion in free cash flow. With so much cash at its disposal, it will have plenty of ways to continue to find ways to reinvest and grow its business in the long run.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $20,579!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $42,710!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $389,239!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 7, 2024\n\nDavid Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A Strong Buy as Hedge Fund Investments Surge and AI Opportunities Expand",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Renaissance Technologies Portfolio: 10 Best Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other best stocks to buy which are part of the Renaissance Technologies portfolio.\n\nRenaissance Technologies is an American hedge fund that specializes in systematic trading and employs statistical and mathematical tools to drive its investment programs. As of March 2024, the fund managed discretionary assets over $89 billion, according to their Form ADV. It was founded in 1982 by Jim Simons, a mathematician who worked as a code breaker for the US National Security Agency during the Cold War.\n\nSimons is considered among the pioneers of quantitative investing. At the time of his death in May 2024, he had an estimated net worth of $31.4 billion, making him the 51st richest person in the world. His use of mathematical models and algorithms to drive long-term investment returns earned him a legacy that rivaled the likes of Warren Buffet and George Soros.\n\nHis signature Medallion generated average annual returns of 66% for three decades between 1988 and 2018, earning more than $100 billion in profits during the period. The fund started with charging a 5% fixed fee and also had performance charges of 20%, which were later increased to 44% in 2002. Despite those cuts, Medallion earned annual returns of around 39% on average.\n\nThe fund was closed to outside investors in 1993 and has since then only been available to past and current employees, and their families. Renaissance Technologies does have other funds that are open to outsiders, such as Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF) and Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha (RIDA).\n\nSimons stepped down from active management of Renaissance Technologies in 2010 and resigned as its executive chairman in 2021. Peter Brown is the current CEO of the capital market company. He graduated with a B.A. in Mathematics from Harvard University and also holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. Brown’s father, Henry B.R. Brown, invented the Reserve Primary Fund in 1970, which was the first money market fund to be set up.\n\nBrown is committed to the use of mathematical models to discover and unlock the value of stocks in the market. However, Renaissance hedge funds that are open to outside investors have been shrinking for some while. According to a recent report in the Financial Times, RIEF currently manages around $19.6 billion, significantly down from $35.8 billion in 2020. The collapse of RIDA and Renaissance Institutional Diversified Global Equities (RIDGE) has been even worse. The two funds were merged this year. In 2019, RIDA managed about $15 billion, while RIDGE had a portfolio of $14.3 billion. Today, the combined fund manages only $3.6 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, Renaissance’s external assets under management have declined from $65.1 billion in 2019 to $23.2 billion today. Much of the exodus happened following the coronavirus pandemic and was driven by a shock performance by the hedge fund as the stock market rattled. In contrast, the Medallion Fund, which is limited to past and current employees, gained 76% in 2020 despite Covid-19. This is because the fund indulges in high-frequency trading with a lower capacity, a strategy that is strikingly different from those applied for external funds.\n\nHowever, the performance of external funds is beginning to stabilize after the lows over the last few years. RIEF is up 19.8% this year, while RIDA has also gained 17.4%. Though financial experts believe the improvement is owed more to the fund’s performance, rather than flows.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe scanned Renaissance Technologies’ 13F portfolio, as of June 30, 2024 and picked the top 10 stocks according to their stake value. The figures were sourced from Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nStake Value as of Q2 2024: $867,494,208\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a software and fabless company headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Its share price has soared by over 2000% in the last five years, fueled by strong demand for graphics processing units (GPU) and AI models. It remains the go-to company for cloud computing firms looking for GPUs and semiconductors as they expand investments in artificial intelligence, and this has been a critical catalyst behind NVIDIA’s financial growth.\n\nThe company continues to drive robust results and had another impressive quarter during Q2 FY25, in which revenue increased 122% year-over-year to reach $30 billion, beating forecasts of $28 billion. Net income totaled $16.6 billion with an EPS of $0.68, going past analyst expectations of $0.645. The strong show during the quarter was attributed to a surge in demand for data center chips.\n\nNVIDIA anticipates revenue in Q3 to be around $32.5 billion, with gross margins between 74.4% to 75%. It also expects continued revenue growth from its Blackwell and Hopper Architecture products during the backend of the year. There is consensus among Street analysts on the stock’s Strong Buy rating. They also expect an 18% upside in its share price. Having said that, if the market matures and growth fails to meet expectations, that could lead to a downward turn in the share price.\n\nMost investors, however, remain bullish on the stock. According to Insider Monkey’s database, 179 hedge funds had investments in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as of Q2 2024. Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding the company in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including data center acceleration, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefited from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.\n\nNVIDIA is one of the best stocks to buy from the Renaissance Technologies portfolio. The hedge fund has a stake valued at over $867 million in the company, as of June 30, 2024.\n\nOverall, NVDA ranks 3rd among the Renaissance Technologies Portfolio: 10 Best Stocks To Buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "These Are the 3 Fastest-Growing Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "There are many ways to define \"the fastest-growing\" stocks. You can focus on market returns, sales growth, or profits, and you can look at proven results or future expectations. Traditionalists may prefer analyzing reported results and historical market data. Growth-oriented investors can lean into forward-looking projections, based on rapid top-line growth or beefy long-term profit targets.\n\nToday, I'm looking at the fastest-growing artificial intelligence (AI) stocks of the last three years, in terms of estimated revenue growth. This way, I'll zoom in on companies with plenty of business growth expected in the years ahead, no matter what they did in the early days of the generative AI boom.\n\nSo here are the top three names of that analysis, based on their top-line sales' expected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the next three years.\n\n1. Nvidia: 50.4% estimated CAGR\n\nIt's no secret that semiconductor designer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has grown like wildfire in recent years. Its trailing 3-year revenue growth stands at a spine-chilling CAGR of 63.8% at the moment. OpenAI introduced its groundbreaking ChatGPT system in November 2022. As the primary provider of AI accelerator hardware for that platform, Nvidia has enjoyed skyrocketing sales ever since.\n\nAnd analysts see no end to that trend. Your average analyst firm expect Nvidia to deliver annual sales growth of roughly 50.4% over the next three years.\n\nI agree that Nvidia should deliver strong sales growth in this AI boom. However, it gets harder and harder to maintain these skyrocketing growth rates as the base figure for each year-over-year comparison increases. Moreover, I'm not convinced that the analyst community gives enough respect to Nvidia's current and potential rivals. If nothing else, having plenty of high-powered AI accelerator chips available could limit Nvidia's gross profit margins over time.\n\nSo Nvidia looks overpriced to me, since Wall Street's growth targets seem a bit too optimistic. I cashed in some of my paper gains on this stock several months ago. Yet, the analysts might be right. I'd be kicking myself if Nvidia continues to dominate the AI hardware space and my portfolio had no connection to that opportunity. You should check your risk tolerance before backing away from Nvidia's soaring stock -- or doubling down on it.\n\n2. Super Micro Computers: 36% estimated CAGR\n\nNvidia is the leading seller of AI accelerator chips, and Super Micro Computers(NASDAQ: SMCI) sells a ton of custom server systems using those chips. As a result, Supermicro's sales growth is trailing slightly behind Nvidia's. In an alternate universe where this was the only builder of AI servers, Supermicro could have shown growth equal to or even greater than Nvidia's.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn this world, Supermicro started this surge from a much lower revenue level than Nvidia, as is currently raising its long-term growth rate faster. Supermicro stands out in the system-building market with a combination of unique cooling solutions and relatively low system prices.\n\nThat being said, Supermicro's target market is even more fragmented than Nvidia's. Hewlett Packard Enterprise(NYSE: HPE) and Dell(NYSE: DELL) sell far more servers than Supermicro, even in the AI server niche. On the upside, this situation gives Supermicro more room to take market share from rivals, outgrowing its peers in the process. On the downside, the HPs and Dells out there won't simply stand back and let Supermicro win.\n\nSo this is another challenging growth target. At the same time, Supermicro comes with lofty valuation ratios for this subsector. As such, it's far from my favorite buying idea among AI stocks.\n\n3. Cloudflare: 27.7% estimated CAGR\n\nFinally, network security and performance specialist Cloudflare(NYSE: NET) trails behind Supermicro's revenue growth due to a significant slowdown in the last two years.\n\nCloudflare isn't a pure-play AI investment, but the company has strong ties to the emerging AI space. You can already buy AI-oriented edge computing services directly from Cloudflare, using its global network of servers and AI accelerators to deliver results near the end user. Its cybersecurity and network acceleration features are also quite valuable for AI service providers. For example, ChatGPT's services always pass through Cloudflare's content delivery and data security tools.\n\nSo Cloudflare is a serious AI investment with robust revenue growth. The company is also boosting its AI computing infrastructure over time. Meanwhile, Cloudflare recently revamped its sales department, boosting both its revenue growth per sales agent and operating margin.\n\nThe stock is far from cheap, but Cloudflare is perhaps the most convincing long-term growth story on this list.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock was up 239% last year, and it's up a further 158% in 2024. In dollar terms, the company added a whopping $2.7 trillion to its market capitalization over that two-year stretch, and it's now the second-most valuable company in the world.\n\nNvidia generates substantial revenue and earnings growth to support the incredible gains in its stock. The company designs the most powerful graphics processing chips (GPUs) for the data center, which are used for developing artificial intelligence (AI) models, and it simply can't keep up with demand.\n\nUnfortunately, not every AI company will be a winner like Nvidia. Many struggle to deliver the financial results to match their innovation in this fast-moving industry, which has decimated their stock prices over the last few years:\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) stock is down 74% from its all-time high. C3.ai(NYSE: AI) stock is down 85% from its all-time high. Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ: UPST) stock is down 89% from its all-time high.\n\nI'm not suggesting any of those stocks are bad investments from today. I'm merely highlighting how challenging it is to pick winners and losers in new industries like AI, because nobody truly knows what the landscape will look like in the future. Therefore, investors might want to consider using a simpler strategy. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAn exchange-traded fund might be the answer\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) can hold dozens or even hundreds of individual stocks to give investors exposure to a specific segment of the market like AI. They are managed by a team of professionals who adjust the holdings as necessary, so investors can take a passive approach.\n\nAn ETF with hundreds of stock holdings typically won't suffer a catastrophic loss if one or two companies fail, which is a great feature in an industry like AI with so many unknowns.\n\nHere's why the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (NYSEMKT: IGM) might be a great alternative to building a portfolio of AI stocks on your own.\n\nThe iShares ETF holds every top AI stock investors could want\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF was established in 2001, so it successfully navigated several technology booms including the internet, enterprise software, smartphone devices, cloud computing, and now, AI. It aims to give investors exposure to the hardware, software, and related companies that make those innovations possible.\n\nThe ETF holds 279 stocks, so it's one of the most diversified technology funds investors can buy. However, it's heavily weighted toward its top 10 holdings, which account for 53.9% of the total value of its entire portfolio:\n\nStory continues\n\nStock iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting 1. Meta Platforms 9.16% 2. Nvidia 8.47% 3. Apple  8.23% 4. Microsoft  7.87% 5. Alphabet Class A 4.78% 6. Broadcom  4.59% 7. Alphabet Class C 3.95% 8. Netflix  2.48% 9. Salesforce  2.23% 10. Advanced Micro Devices  2.22%\n\nData source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Oct. 4, 2024, and are subject to change.\n\nAll of the above companies are using AI in some capacity. Meta Platforms developed several AI features for both users and advertisers on its Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp social networks. The company builds its own large language models (LLMs) called Llama, which power those features. Meta is preparing to launch Llama 4 next year, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg says could set the benchmark for the entire AI industry.\n\nApple is diving deeper into AI with each new product release. Its Apple Intelligence software is now rolling out on the latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. It will transform the way users consume and generate content, and it will also add powerful new capabilities to the Siri voice assistant.\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet both launched AI-powered virtual assistants of their own, and their respective cloud platforms have become key distribution channels for the latest AI models, software, and data center computing capacity for businesses.\n\nNvidia's chips power everything I mentioned above. The company's flagship H100 GPU set the benchmark for AI development last year, but it's about to start shipping a new generation of chips based on its latest Blackwell architecture, which will offer a performance boost of up to 30 times. Nvidia does face growing competition, though, with Advanced Micro Devices rapidly becoming a player in the market for AI data center GPUs.\n\nOracle, Micron Technology, and Palantir are some of the noteworthy AI stocks sitting outside the ETF's top 10 holdings.\n\nThe iShares ETF routinely outperforms the S&P 500 index\n\nThe iShares ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 10.8% since its inception in 2001, which is much better than the average annual return of 8.2% generated by the S&P 500 index over the same period.\n\nHowever, the widespread adoption of technologies like enterprise software, cloud computing, and AI propelled the ETF to a compound annual return of 20% over the last 10 years. That extended its advantage over the S&P 500, which has delivered a compound annual return of just 13.2% over the same period.\n\nThe 6.8% differential each year makes a substantial difference in dollar terms thanks to the effects of compounding:\n\nStarting Balance (2014) Compound Annual Return Balance In 2024 $10,000 20% (iShares ETF) $61,917 $10,000 13.2% (S&P 500) $34,551\n\nCalculations by author.\n\nIt will be a challenge for any fund to maintain an average yearly return of 20% over the long term, but AI could be one of the most valuable technologies in a generation. Goldman Sachs believes it will add $7 trillion to the global economy within a decade, and Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management places that figure at a whopping $200 trillion by 2030.\n\nTechnology stocks are almost certainly the place to be if those forecasts prove to be correct, and the iShares ETF is a great alternative to picking individual winners and losers in the AI race. However, just in case AI fails to live up to the hype, it's a good idea to buy this ETF as part of a diversified portfolio which includes exposure to the non-technology sectors of the market.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Palantir Technologies",
        "content": "Shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) have delivered stunning gains of 152% and 133%, respectively, in 2024, as both companies have been benefiting from the fast-growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software. That is also why both of them are now trading at expensive valuations.\n\nHowever, a closer look at their prospects indicates that Nvidia and Palantir's AI-powered growth is here to stay, as both of them stand to gain from massive end-market opportunities. Here, let's examine which of these two AI stocks investors should consider buying right now following their stunning gains so far this year.\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nNvidia has been delivering robust growth quarter after quarter thanks to its market share of more than 85% in AI chips, which analysts at investment research firm Third Bridge believe is sustainable, thanks to the arrival of the company's next-generation Blackwell processors.\n\nNvidia's revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended July 28) shot up 122% year over year to $30 billion. More importantly, the company's pricing power helped it increase its non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) gross margin by 4.5 percentage points last quarter to 75.7%. As a result, the growth in the company's bottom line outpaced its revenue growth.\n\nNvidia reported $0.68 per share in earnings in fiscal Q2, an increase of 152% from the year-ago period. And now, analysts at Japanese investment bank Mizuho have raised their sales expectations of Nvidia's AI graphics cards for 2025. Mizuho is expecting Nvidia to sell 8% to 10% more AI graphics cards next year from its prior guidance issued in July.\n\nThe company is expected to sell between 6.5 million to 7 million AI GPUs (graphics processing units) next year, driven by an improving supply chain that is expected to help it manufacture more chips. Given that Nvidia has reportedly priced its upcoming Blackwell processors between $30,000 to $40,000, which is identical to what it charges for its current generation flagship processor -- the H200 -- there is a solid chance its data center revenue could surge big time next year.\n\nAssuming Nvidia sells even 6 million of its AI GPUs in 2025 at an average selling price (ASP) of $30,000, it could generate a whopping $180 billion in revenue from the data center business next year. Moreover, its data center revenue could exceed $200 billion, at the higher end of Mizuho's shipment forecast. Given that Nvidia has generated close to $49 billion in revenue from the data center business in the first six months of the current fiscal year, which translates into an annual revenue run rate of $98 billion, investors can hope for another stellar year from this semiconductor giant next year.\n\nConsensus estimates are projecting Nvidia's revenue to hit $176 billion in fiscal 2026 (which will begin in January next year) from this year's level of $125 billion. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nHowever, if Nvidia can indeed manage to ship at least 6 million AI GPUs next year at the ASP discussed, it could very well coast past consensus expectations. As such, Nvidia could remain a top AI stock even after the stellar gains it has recorded in 2024.\n\nThe case for Palantir Technologies\n\nJust like Nvidia is the dominant player in the AI hardware market, Palantir has been touted to be the leading provider of AI software platforms by market research firms. Forrester, for instance, recognizes Palantir as a leader in \"artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) software platforms.\" Similarly, Dresner Advisory Services says that Palantir is a \"top performer\" in its AI, data science, and machine learning market study.\n\nWith the AI platforms software market forecast to clock an annual growth rate of 40% through 2028, generating $153 billion in annual revenue, Palantir seems to be on the cusp of a major growth opportunity. More importantly, Palantir's growth rate has started improving as more customers have started deploying its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) to integrate generative AI into their operations.\n\nThe company's revenue in the first six months of 2024 increased by 23% from the same period last year. Its earnings have shot up fivefold over the same period to $0.10 per share. For comparison, Palantir's revenue in the first six months of 2023 increased at a slower pace of 15% from the year-ago period.\n\nPalantir management made it clear on the company's August earnings conference call that its AIP is leading to stronger deal activity by attracting new customers, and by also helping it gain more business at existing customers. According to Palantir chief revenue officer Ryan Taylor:\n\nOne of the most notable indicators of our delivery is the volume of existing customers who are signing expansion deals, many of which are a direct result of AIP.\n\nThe strong traction of Palantir's AIP has encouraged the company to raise its full-year guidance to just under $2.75 billion from the earlier expectation of $2.68 billion. Analysts, however, are expecting Palantir to deliver $2.76 billion in revenue in 2024, which would be a 24% increase from last year. However, it won't be surprising to see it post stronger growth than that because of a healthy revenue pipeline that stands at $4.3 billion (its remaining deal value at the end of Q2, a metric that refers to the total value of contracts it is yet to fulfill).\n\nTime to make a choice\n\nThe points discussed indicate that both Palantir and Nvidia are heading into 2025 with sunny prospects, thanks to solid demand for their AI offerings. However, Nvidia is growing at a significantly faster pace than Palantir. Also, a look at the valuation of the two companies, Nvidia turns out to be the relatively cheaper bet. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nInvestors should also note that Nvidia is possibly straddling Palantir's territory, as Nvidia has been witnessing solid traction in its software business. So, based on the valuation, the pace of growth, and Nvidia's moat in AI hardware and its focus on diversifying into the software side, it looks like the better AI investment of the two high-flying companies discussed here.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2347643/the-cheapest-mag-7-stocks-in-2024\n\nThe Cheapest Mag 7 Stocks in 2024\n\nWelcome to Episode #385 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\n(0:30) - Can You Find Value Within The Magnificent 7? (6:15) - Breaking Down Recent Performances: What Stocks To Keep On Your Radar? (28:30) - Episode Roundup: META, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, TSLA Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nIt’s time to check in on the Mag 7 stocks, formerly known as FAANG stocks or FANGMAN stocks. The Mag 7 stocks are the large cap innovators with high growth. The Mag 7 includes Tesla, NVIDIA, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Meta Platforms.\n\nTracey has often discussed how value investors can own both growth and value stocks. Value investors are not limited only to value stocks.\n\nWhy not look at the largest big cap growth stocks out there? Why not own some Mag 7 stocks?\n\nWhat’s the Definition of a “Cheap” Stock?\n\nBut just because a value investor might buy a growth stock, doesn’t mean that investor doesn’t want attractive valuations. A “cheap” stock, for value investors, doesn’t mean the share price. Cheapness is not talking about a stock under $1.00. Cheapness means the company’s valuations are attractive.\n\nFor value investors, valuations are often determined by looking at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. P/E ratios are usually the first default though, so Tracey looked at them for this podcast.\n\nThe P/E ratio is price divided by earnings.\n\nBut there’s a good case for the P/S ratio, especially when looking at technology stocks.\n\nTracey considers both on the podcast.\n\nAre There Any Deals in the Mag 7 Stocks?\n\n1. Tesla, Inc. TSLA\n\nTesla has underperformed so far in 2024. Shares of Tesla are down 3.1% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is up 19.4%.\n\nBut the sell-off doesn’t mean Tesla is cheap. It’s trading with a forward P/E of 113, which is at the nosebleed levels. And it has a P/S ratio of 8.7. That’s not cheap but at least it’s under 10.\n\nIs Tesla a deal on the weakness or is it a value trap?\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN\n\nHas Amazon EVER been cheap? Investors have always paid a premium for the stock, at least on a P/E basis. But Amazon is currently trading with a forward P/E of 39, which is among its lowest P/E ratios over the last decade.\n\nShares of Amazon have gained 19% year-to-date yet it’s still sporting an attractive P/E. Earnings are expected to rise 63.5% this year and 23% next year, which explains it.\n\nBut it is Amazon’s P/S ratio which is the real surprise. It has P/S ratio of just 3.2, the lowest of the Mag 7.\n\nShould Amazon be on a value investor’s short list?\n\n3. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\n\nNVIDIA can’t be a deal, can it? It has been one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street this year. Shares of NVIDIA are up 157.9% year-to-date. But earnings are also expected to be up 116% this year and another 33% in fiscal 2026.\n\nNVIDIA is trading with a forward P/E of “just” 41.5. But that is well under Tesla at 113x, and other growth stocks like Costco, which is trading at 49x.\n\nIs NVIDIA still a buy here?\n\n4. Apple Inc. AAPL\n\nWarren Buffett might have sold a bunch of his Apple position in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio this year, but he still owns a big chunk of shares. And if the greatest value investor ever owns your stock, there must be some value there, right?\n\nBut Apple isn’t that cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 30. Earnings are expected to be up this year, but just 9.3%. Shares of Apple have gained 15.1% year-to-date.\n\nIs Apple losing its shine with value investors in 2024?\n\n5. Meta Platforms, Inc. META\n\nMeta Platforms has been a quiet winner in 2024. Shares of Meta Platforms are up 65.2% year-to-date.\n\nIt’s a growth stock. Earnings are expected to rise 43.6% this year and another 12.8% next year. But Meta Platforms also has an attractive forward P/E of just 27. And it’s now paying a dividend, yielding 0.4%.\n\nIs Meta Platforms the cheapest Mag 7 stock?\n\nWhat Is the Cheapest of the Mag 7 stocks?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL, MSFT and AMZN in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other the Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years.\n\nEconomic Resilience and Surprising Rate Cut Amid Geopolitical Tensions\n\nThe US economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, and the stock market hit all-time highs in the third quarter, averting fears of a recession at hand. While the economy has remained resilient for the better part of the year, the US Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut surprised many analysts.\n\nJamie Dimon believes the steep cut might be justified as geopolitical uncertainties can potentially disrupt the gains achieved by affecting supply chains and triggering uncertainties and fears in the market.\n\nREAD ALSO: Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks and 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows.\n\nPowell and other Fed officials are open to further lowering interest rates after last month’s half-point cut, but there’s market debate on the pace.\n\nSoaring tensions in the Middle East with Israel invading Lebanon and threatening to attack Iran have triggered a layer of uncertainty, which Dimon believes could have a significant impact on the economy. Consequently, the banker believes that the 50 basis point cut could offer the much-needed economic support as inflation continues to drop.\n\nNevertheless, James Demerit, Main Street Research CIO, believes the upward momentum in the equity markets will persist as the macro environment improves. While valuations appear to have gotten out of hand, there are still opportunities for stocks trading below their fair value as the investment environment improves.\n\nApart from the magnificent seven stocks whose valuations have gotten out of hand, other stocks are trading at 16 times earnings, which, according to Demmert, is cheap considering the strong fundamentals that support a further rally. Companies that have consistently grown sales and profits should continue delivering regardless of the uncertainties around the US election and soaring geopolitical tensions.\n\nAccording to Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, it is time to be upbeat about the market heading into year-end. “The bull market has survived the year’s historically weakest quarter,” said Hill in an interview with CNBC. “It is likely to remain intact through at least the end of the year, as earnings remain strong, interest rates are moving lower and consumers are still spending.”\n\nStory continues\n\nWhich Stocks Could Make You Rich in 5 to 10 Years?\n\nWhen considering which stocks to buy, it’s beneficial to ask, “Which industries are experiencing the most rapid growth?” Despite some sectors facing challenges post-pandemic, many are flourishing, offering abundant opportunities. The global economy is rapidly evolving, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, travel, online retail, cybersecurity, and green energy experiencing significant growth. The AI market alone is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027 (according to estimates from Markets and Markets). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, total employment in the United States will expand by 11.9 million, or 7.7%, to 165.4 million from 153.5 million.\n\nSome of the top stocks that will make you rich in 5 to 10 years are companies that can rally as the global economy grows on the back of favorable monetary policies. Additionally, they include stocks of companies that are leaders in their respective fields and well-poised to benefit from technological changes such as artificial intelligence.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head, reiterated utilities and large-cap real estate stocks are well positioned to perform heading into year end. Likewise, industrials and financials should receive a significant boost if the overall economy improves.\n\nAccording to Subramanian, the idea of the Fed cutting is not only liquidity inducing that should benefit the equity market but a move that ends up cutting money market yields. With liquidity slowly moving out of short-term bonds, most of it is ending up in equity markets as investors take note of high-risk reward opportunities at highly discounted valuations. Subramanian believes dividend stocks and growth stocks are well-positioned to generate significant value going forward.\n\nWith this economic perspective in mind, let’s start our list of stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, we sifted through multiple reports and rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 possible stocks that experts and analysts believe have multi-year growth opportunities. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them, as of the end of Q2 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has made a name for itself as a poster child of the artificial intelligence race and one of the stocks sure to make any investor rich in the next five to ten years. The company is known for producing the most sought-after graphics processing units (GPUs) that can handle more complex workloads, such as training large language models and AI applications.\n\nStrong demand was the catalyst behind NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), accounting for 98% of shipments of GPUs for data centers last year, and it has a market share of more than 80% for AI chips. One reason the company has achieved such a dominant position is the superior performance of its hardware.\n\nAdditionally, the CUDA software ecosystem contributes to the company’s success in gaining such a strong market position. Hundreds of software libraries make it easier to develop GPU-accelerated applications with CUDA. Since Nvidia is the only chipmaker offering anything like CUDA, Nvidia GPUs have become the industry standard for data center accelerators.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is anticipated to grow quickly and generate more shareholder value due to the strong demand for AI infrastructure. Grand View Research projects that through 2030, the market for AI accelerators will grow at a rate of 29% annually, while spending on AI services, software, and hardware will compound at a rate of 36% annually. This is encouraging for Nvidia’s investors.\n\nThe strong demand for the company’s GPUs was the catalyst behind the 122% year-over-year growth in revenue in Q2 to $30 billion. Earnings were up 168% from last year to $0.67 a share. Given that the artificial intelligence race is just starting, it affirms why NVidia is one of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, going by solid financial results.\n\nAt the close of Q2 2024, 179 investors were bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), down from 186 in the previous quarter.\n\nIthaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefited from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "TSMC Sales Beat Estimates in Sign of Solid AI Chip Demand",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. posted a better-than-expected 39% rise in quarterly revenue, assuaging concerns that AI hardware spending is beginning to taper off.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums Singapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters?\n\nThe main chipmaker to Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. reported September-quarter sales of NT$759.7 billion ($23.6 billion), versus the average analyst projection for NT$748 billion. Taiwan’s largest company will disclose its full results next Thursday.\n\nHsinchu-based TSMC is one of the key companies at the heart of a global surge in spending on AI development, producing the cutting-edge chips needed to train artificial intelligence. Its sales have more than doubled since 2020, with the seminal launch of ChatGPT sparking a race to acquire Nvidia hardware for AI server farms.\n\nIn recent months, however, views have begun to diverge on whether the AI-driven growth momentum will last.\n\nSome investors have cautioned that the likes of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google can’t sustain their current pace of infrastructure spending without a compelling and monetizable AI use case. That skepticism has led to a pullback in AI stocks, including flag bearer Nvidia, earlier this year.\n\nStill, TSMC shares have more than doubled since the launch of ChatGPT, with its market capitalization briefly crossing the $1 trillion mark in July. That month, Taiwan’s largest company also lifted its outlook for 2024 revenue growth after quarterly results beat estimates.\n\nThe revision underscored TSMC’s view that AI spending will remain elevated despite growing US-Chinese trade tensions. In both countries, startups and tech firms from Microsoft Corp. to Baidu Inc. are splurging on AI infrastructure in a race to develop applications.\n\nSome analysts worry that delays in the delivery of Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips might disrupt the industry, though most investors don’t view that as a long-term issue for TSMC. With Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. both struggling to get ahead in the business of bespoke chipmaking, TSMC’s market leadership is expected to help prop up margins.\n\nNvidia’s key server assembly partner Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. earlier this week also reaffirmed demand for AI hardware remains solid. Hon Hai Chairman Young Liu told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday that his company plans to boost server production capacity to meet “crazy” demand for the next-generation Blackwell chips, echoing similar remarks from Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang earlier this month.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nWhile Apple’s A18 chip orders may decline due to soft demand for new iPhone 16s, robust orders from Nvidia and Intel are likely to offset any revenue shortfall for TSMC. Other key topics include the potential for earlier 2-nanometer (N2) node mass production and plans to expand its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) advanced packaging capacity in 2025.\n\n- Charles Shum, analyst\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nTSMC now makes more than half of its revenue from high-performance computing, the segment of its business driven by AI demand. It also remains the sole manufacturer for the iPhone’s processor, although a growing number of analysts have voiced concerns over worse-than-expected demand for the new iPhone 16 range.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMusk Reveals Why He’s Jumping Into Trump’s Arms How Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession Rate Cuts Need Time to Work Their Way Through the Economy Hamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Rallied (Again) Today and Is Near a New All-Time High. Is the Stock Still a Buy?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has started off October with a bang. After suffering through an epic meltdown over the summer, things are beginning to look up. A lofty valuation and concerns about the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption gave investors pause, sending the AI chip specialist skidding as much as 27%. However, Nvidia regained its footing early last month and has rallied more than 29% in the roughly four weeks since.\n\nThe stock added to its tally today, climbing as much as 4.5%. By the time the market closed, the stock was still up 4.1%.\n\nAfter a rally of that magnitude, investors are wondering if the stock is still a buy.\n\nBullish signs abound\n\nNvidia stock has been on a blistering rally since the start of last year, with the stock gaining more than 800%. The advent of AI caused a mad dash for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs), which have the raw number-crunching capability needed to process AI. This insatiable demand showed in Nvidia's results, as the company generated five successive quarters of triple-digit, year-over-year sales and profit growth. However, when the company forecasted revenue growth of \"just\" 80%, fair-weather investors thought the sky was falling and headed for the hills. That may have been a costly blunder.\n\nIn an interview last week, CEO Jensen Huang said the demand for Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell AI architecture is \"insane.\" He went on to say, \"Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.\" This comes in stark contrast to recent fears that demand for AI had peaked.\n\nWall Street continues to bet on Nvidia in a big way. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse is representative of the mood among analysts, noting Nvidia has \"the best upside consensus\" among all the stocks he covers, saying it's \"far and away our Top Pick.\"\n\nThe forest for the trees\n\nOne of the biggest sticking points for investors was Nvidia's lofty valuation, and at 62 times earnings, that concern is understandable. However, for Nvidia's 2026 fiscal year (which begins in January), Wall Street is predicting earnings per share of $4.02. At its current share price of about $133, that works out to about 33 times forward earnings, which is only a slight premium to the multiple of 30 for the S&P 500.\n\nThat's an attractive price to pay for a company with so many ways to win.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $782,682!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) gained for the fifth day in a row, as enthusiasm continued to build on Wall Street and among its customers for the new Blackwell platform. In addition, the company's artificial intelligence (AI) summit rolled on in its second day.\n\nThat news was enough to drive Nvidia up 4.1% at market close. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia shines again\n\nWall Street continued to up its estimates on the AI chip leader, and news also broke that Foxconn and Nvidia are building Taiwan's largest supercomputer, built on the new Blackwell platform. Additionally, Foxconn is building the world's largest manufacturing facility for bundling Nvidia's GB200 Superchips in Mexico.\n\nThe move should help assure investors and customers that Nvidia has an adequate supply of the new Blackwell components and shows the company diversifying away from Taiwan, which will help protect that supply from potential Chinese meddling.\n\nNvidia's vice president and general manager of enterprise platforms, Bob Pette, also talked up the power of the company's accelerated computing stack at his keynote address at the Nvidia AI Summit. Pette told the audience, \"We are in the dawn of a new industrial revolution,\" and said the Blackwell platform improves both performance and energy efficiency.\n\nFinally, Nvidia continued to earn plaudits from Wall Street, as Cantor Fitzgerald said Nvidia's updated investor presentation sets up a revitalization in the stock. The Information also said the latest $6.6 billion funding round would set off another wave of investments in AI.\n\nCan Nvidia keep climbing?\n\nFears of an AI bubble seem to be subsiding following the OpenAI funding round that sent its valuation to $157 billion, and falling interest rates should help drive spending on AI infrastructure.\n\nWe'll soon get a look at third-quarter results of AI stocks like Microsoft and Alphabet, and Tesla's robotaxi event on Thursday should also provide some insight into the potential of autonomous vehicles.\n\nNvidia's business continues to thrive, and it will likely report another blowout quarter next month. There's room for the stock to move higher, but investors should expect the stock to remain volatile.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Markets Bounce Back Behind Mag-7 Momentum",
        "content": "Tuesday, October 8th, 2024\r\n\r\nMajor market indexes were in the green across the board today. After something of a palette cleanse Monday, which saw the indexes giving back near-term gains previously, the Nasdaq looks to break out to new levels from here. The tech-heavy index led the way higher — +259 points, +1.45% — followed by the S&P +0.97% and the blue-chip Dow +0.30%. The small-cap Russell collected a scant +0.17% on the session.\n\nReturn of the Magnificent 7 Stocks?\n\nEarlier today, Zacks Strategist Tracey Ryniec released a new podcast from her Zacks Value Trader series, discussing which of the “Mag 7” stocks are still cheap enough to buy? It turned out to be a perfect day for such an account, and you can listen to it here.\n\nMag-7 stocks led the Nasdaq and S&P higher today, partly spearheaded by the Mag-7 leader earlier in the year, NVIDIA NVDA. The GPU innovator and primary AI market play concluded its fifth-straight trading day higher, +4% for the session. Apparently, the demise of the AI trade has been greatly exaggerated.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares are still off all-time highs set earlier in 2024, but have grown an outstanding +24% in the past month and +175% year to date — after growing more than +200% in full-year 2003! NVIDIA stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating with a Value-Growth-Momentum grade of C.\n\nOil, China, Boeing Head Lower\n\nTalk of a cease fire between Israel and Hezbollah has managed to bring down spot oil prices. A -4.6% drop today has brought West Texas Intermediate (WTI) down below $74 per barrel and Brent crude prices beneath $78 per barrel. Yesterday, the one-year anniversary of the Hamas sneak attack on Israel, oil prices threatened to move notably higher, reaching above $80 per barrel.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese stimulus trade looks to have hit a dry patch today, after talk of a fresh package in the world’s second-largest economy failed to materialize. Alibaba BABA shares fell more than -6% on the session, off yesterday’s peak in the stimulus play above $117 per share. Major Chinese companies like BABA are well off their record highs in 2020 and 2021.\r\n\r\nAfter today’s close, Boeing BA has been put on “Creditwatch Negative” by W&P, as its labor strike as of the end of this week will have lasted a full month. Costs to the business based on this strike are estimated to be around -$1 billion per month, as roughly 33K workers on the West Coast look for a better cut in its next pay contract. This is the first strike at the airplane-making giant in 16 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat to Expect Wednesday in the Stock Market\n\nTomorrow, we will see the minutes of the last Fed meeting — where the monetary policy body lowered interest rates for the first time since March 2020 — as well as appearances from more Fed members than you can shake a stick at. We already know a rate cut was unanimous; only one voting member preferred a 25 basis-point (bps) rate cut rather than the 50 bps we got.\r\n\r\nWe’ll also see Wholesale Inventories for August (expected to remain steady from the prior month at +0.2%) and fiscal Q2 results from beauty and wellness retailer Helen of Troy HELE ahead of the opening bell. Things get cooking this week on Thursday, when September Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers come out, including an updated Inflation Rate.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

Even as production of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips ramps up, KeyBanc said in a note to investors Monday that demand for Nvidia’s prior AI chip models — H100s and H200s — “remains extremely robust.”\n\nNvidia shares are up nearly 14% over the past week and 190% from last year.\n\nWedbush analysts said “another positive data point” for Nvidia is a potential new wave of funding for AI startups. The Information reported Monday that OpenAI’s staggering $6.6 billion funding round will likely drive a wave of new AI investments. New funding for AI-related startups would, in turn, fuel demand for Nvidia's AI chips.\n\nWedbush’s Matt Bryson said on Tuesday that the report is an indication \"that there is little likelihood AI spending growth pauses through much (if not all of 2025) to NVDA's benefit.\"\n\nNvidia is also looking to prove its worth beyond AI hardware. At its AI Summit in D.C. this week, the company is attempting to highlight the strength of its AI software offerings in a bid to prove it’s more than just a chipmaker. Deepu Talla, vice president of Robotics and Edge Computing of NVIDIA, and Zhe Shi, chief digital officer of Foxconn, deliver a speech during the Hon Hai Tech Day in Taipei on Oct. 8, 2024. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAdding to the wave of positive press for Nvidia was the announcement of Foxconn's new megafactory assembling Nvidia's AI servers. The chair of electronics manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), Young Liu, said during an annual event in Taipei Tuesday that it’s building the world’s largest factory assembling Nvidia GB200 servers in Mexico, according to the Financial Times. Liu said there is “crazy” demand for Nvidia’s latest AI chips. The move will reduce Nvidia’s reliance on China amid rising trade tensions.\n\nNvidia and Foxconn said they're also working to build Taiwan's fastest supercomputer.\n\nNvidia isn’t the only semiconductor company that’s thriving. Citing WSTS semiconductor industry data, JPMorgan (JPM) said Tuesday that sector-wide sales rose 28% in August from last year.\n\n“We remain positive on semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks as we believe stocks should continue to move higher in anticipation of better supply/demand in 2H24/25 [the second half of 2024 and 2025] and stable/rising earnings power trends in CY24/25 [the 2024 and 2025 calendar years].”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) both rose more than 1% on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, chipmakers in China faced a different fate Tuesday. After China’s economic planning agency failed to live up to the market’s hope for more stimulus measures, China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (0981.HK) fell 18%. Investors had expected stimulus initiatives to boost China’s semiconductor sector.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia, AMD Lead The Pack, Broadcom Stable, Intel Falters: Analyst's Latest Take\n\nKeyBanc analyst John Vinh shared mixed quarterly supply chain findings for the semiconductor sector. The analyst revised several company estimates and price targets.\n\nThough most end markets were weak in analog, he noted indications of auto getting closer to a bottom. Traditional server and AI strength is sustained, with Blackwell on track to launch in the fourth quarter without further delays, as per Vinh.\n\nAlso Read: What’s Going On With Super Micro Computer Stock On Monday?\n\nThe analyst’s feedback on the iPhone 16 launch appears to be better than feared but could be better. Therefore, Vinh downgraded Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Synaptics Inc (NASDAQ:SYNA) to Sector Weight.\n\nGiven increased price competition, he expects Qualcomm to lose market share to Mediatek in the mid-to-low-end segment of the smartphone market. This headwind will compound the impacts of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ramping up its internal modem.\n\nThe Synaptics downgrade reflects its underperformance versus its IoT peers, given limited growth catalysts within its Enterprise & Automotive segment, representing almost 60% of overall revenues and the company’s highest margins. Vinh flagged increased competition in the Chinese market from local chipmaker HiSilicon as another headwind.\n\nAdditionally, the analyst’s findings were most favorable for Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), mixed for Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), and negative for Monolithic Power Systems, Inc (NASDAQ:MPWR), Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MU), Marvell Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL), and Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). He also fine-tuned his estimates on Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM).\n\nVinh noted that Nvidia’s Blackwell will likely ramp into mass production beginning in December, contributing over $7 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter. He said Hopper demand remains strong, with fourth-quarter revenues increasing ~15% sequentially.\n\nAMD’s positive catalysts included traditional server demand, the inflection in Genoa instances in the cloud, demand for MI300X remains on track to ship 500K GPUs in 2024, and a possible update on its next-generation GPU and CPU at its AI event on Thursday.\n\nFor Broadcom, Vinh flagged sustained networking demand from improving traditional server demand, share gains from its 800Gb optical DSP launch, and higher revision of CoWoS demand. Broadcom’s upsides could be offset by Apple preparing its Wi-Fi 7 radio for the iPhone 17 in 2025.\n\nFor Micron, Vinh flagged oversupply as Micron prompts Samsung to convert its unused HBM capacity back to traditional DRAM to survive the competition.\n\nStory continues\n\nMonolithic Power Systems remains vulnerable, given RMAs (Return Merchandise Authorization) for Nvidia H100 AI servers related to field failures associated with Monolithic Power Systems’ power modules increasing again, affecting its market share on Blackwell.\n\nVinh highlighted his adverse findings from Asia for Marvell Technology. According to the analyst, Marvell is vulnerable to market share loss from the next-generation AWS Trainium 3 loss to Alchip, Google’s second-generation Axion ARM CPU, and Nvidia’s development of its 1.6T optical DSP.\n\nVinh mentioned his negative findings from Asia for Intel. The analyst highlighted Intel’s server market share loss to AMD and the ramp of Blackwell posing a headwind for Intel. He also flagged the lack of a cost-down AI CPU targeted at mass market AI PCs is likely to result in a share loss for Intel and disappointing feedback on Intel’s AI chip Gaudi 3.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNext-Gen Nvidia GPUs Could Be Revealed at CES 2025 – What You Need to Know\n\nLatest Ratings for QCOM\n\nDate Firm Action From To Feb 2022 Mizuho Maintains Buy Feb 2022 Morgan Stanley Maintains Overweight Feb 2022 JP Morgan Maintains Overweight\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for QCOM\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "title": "DELL Rises 56% Year to Date: Can AI Focus Push the Stock Higher?",
        "content": "Dell Technologies DELL shares have returned 55.7% year to date (YTD), outperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 23.5%. \r\n\r\nDELL shares have also surpassed the Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry and peers HP HPQ and Apple AAPL. \r\n\r\nOver the same timeframe, shares of HP and Apple have returned 19.3% and 15.1%, respectively. The industry has appreciated 18.5% YTD. \r\n\r\nDELL’s outperformance can be primarily attributed to the strong demand for AI servers, driven by ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI (GenAI) applications.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSo, can DELL’s AI push boost the shares further? Let’s dig deep to find out.\n\nDell Stock Rides on Strong Portfolio, Partner Base\n\nDell Technologies is benefiting from an expanding partner base. NVIDIA NVDA has played a pivotal role in developing the Dell AI Factory. The collaboration integrates Dell Technologies’ portfolio with NVIDIA’s AI Enterprise software platform and Tensor Core GPUs, enhancing compute power and simplifying AI application development and deployment for faster time to value.\r\n\r\nDell AI Factory launch has been a key catalyst. It combines Dell Technologies solutions and services optimized for AI workloads and supports an open ecosystem of partners comprising NVIDIA, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Hugging Face.\r\n\r\nIn collaboration with NVIDIA, Dell is transforming telecom networks with advanced AI solutions. This partnership enables communications service providers to implement AI-driven technologies that optimize network performance, improve customer experience and reduce operational costs. \r\n\r\nDELL and NVIDIA are working to enable AI deployments at the telecom network’s edge through the PowerEdge XR8000 server, which is equipped with NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPUs. This combination enhances compute power and simplifies AI application development and deployment for faster time to value.\n\nDELL Offers Positive View for 2H25\n\nDELL believes that the AI hardware and services market will be worth $174 billion by 2027, witnessing a CAGR of more than 22% between 2023 and 2027. Dell Technologies is strengthening engineering capabilities, including data center networking and design, to support its AI-related initiatives.\r\n\r\nDell Technologies expects strong top-line growth in the second half of fiscal 2025, driven by robust AI demand. PC shipments are expected to improve in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\r\n\r\nFor fiscal 2025, Dell expects revenues between $95.5 billion and $98.5 billion, indicating growth of 10% year over year at the mid-point of $97 billion. It expects the Infrastructure Solutions Group to grow roughly 30%, fueled by AI.\r\n\r\nEarnings are expected to be $7.80 per share (+/- 25 cents), up 9% at the mid-point for fiscal 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions Trend Higher for DELL\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dell’s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $7.85 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days and indicating 10.1% year-over-year growth.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for Dell’s revenues is currently pegged at $97.5 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 10.26%. \r\n\r\nDELL’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 16.32%.\n\nDell Technologies Inc. Price and Consensus Dell Technologies Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nDell Technologies Inc. price-consensus-chart | Dell Technologies Inc. Quote\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nDELL Shares Are Cheap\n\nDell Technologies shares are cheap, as suggested by a Value Score of A. \r\n\r\nDELL stock is trading at a significant discount with a forward 12-month P/E of 13.16X compared with the sector’s 26.49X.\n\nDELL’s P/E Ratio (F12M) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDELL shares are also trading above the 50-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend.\n\nDELL Shares Trade Above 50-Day SMA Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat Should Investors Do With DELL Shares?\n\nDell’s robust portfolio and expanding partner base are key drivers that make the stock attractive for long-term investors. Hence, investors who already own the stock may expect the company's growth prospects to be rewarding over the long term.\r\n\r\nHowever, a contraction in fiscal 2025 gross margin of roughly 180 bps (up from previous guidance of 150 bps) due to the negative impact of inflation on costs, stiff competition and a higher mix of low-margin of AI optimized servers is a headwind.\r\n\r\nContinuing weakness in the consumer segment of the PC market is a concern.\r\n\r\nDELL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

        "content": "(0:30) - Can You Find Value Within The Magnificent 7? (6:15) - Breaking Down Recent Performances: What Stocks To Keep On Your Radar? (28:30) - Episode Roundup: META, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, TSLA Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #385 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nIt’s time to check in on the Mag 7 stocks, formerly known as FAANG stocks or FANGMAN stocks. The Mag 7 stocks are the large cap innovators with high growth. The Mag 7 includes Tesla, NVIDIA, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Meta Platforms.\n\nTracey has often discussed how value investors can own both growth and value stocks. Value investors are not limited only to value stocks.\n\nWhy not look at the largest big cap growth stocks out there? Why not own some Mag 7 stocks?\n\nWhat’s the Definition of a “Cheap” Stock?\n\nBut just because a value investor might buy a growth stock, doesn’t mean that investor doesn’t want attractive valuations. A “cheap” stock, for value investors, doesn’t mean the share price. Cheapness is not talking about a stock under $1.00. Cheapness means the company’s valuations are attractive.\n\nFor value investors, valuations are often determined by looking at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. P/E ratios are usually the first default though, so Tracey looked at them for this podcast.\n\nThe P/E ratio is price divided by earnings.\n\nBut there’s a good case for the P/S ratio, especially when looking at technology stocks.\n\nTracey considers both on the podcast.\n\nAre There Any Deals in the Mag 7 Stocks?\n\n1. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla has underperformed so far in 2024. Shares of Tesla are down 3.1% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is up 19.4%.\n\nBut the sell-off doesn’t mean Tesla is cheap. It’s trading with a forward P/E of 113, which is at the nosebleed levels. And it has a P/S ratio of 8.7. That’s not cheap but at least it’s under 10.\n\nIs Tesla a deal on the weakness or is it a value trap?\n\n2. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)\n\nHas Amazon EVER been cheap? Investors have always paid a premium for the stock, at least on a P/E basis. But Amazon is currently trading with a forward P/E of 39, which is among its lowest P/E ratios over the last decade.\n\nShares of Amazon have gained 19% year-to-date yet it’s still sporting an attractive P/E. Earnings are expected to rise 63.5% this year and 23% next year, which explains it.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it is Amazon’s P/S ratio which is the real surprise. It has P/S ratio of just 3.2, the lowest of the Mag 7.\n\nShould Amazon be on a value investor’s short list?\n\n3. NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA can’t be a deal, can it? It has been one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street this year. Shares of NVIDIA are up 157.9% year-to-date. But earnings are also expected to be up 116% this year and another 33% in fiscal 2026.\n\nNVIDIA is trading with a forward P/E of “just” 41.5. But that is well under Tesla at 113x, and other growth stocks like Costco, which is trading at 49x.\n\nIs NVIDIA still a buy here?\n\n4. Apple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett might have sold a bunch of his Apple position in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio this year, but he still owns a big chunk of shares. And if the greatest value investor ever owns your stock, there must be some value there, right?\n\nBut Apple isn’t that cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 30. Earnings are expected to be up this year, but just 9.3%. Shares of Apple have gained 15.1% year-to-date.\n\nIs Apple losing its shine with value investors in 2024?\n\n5. Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)\n\nMeta Platforms has been a quiet winner in 2024. Shares of Meta Platforms are up 65.2% year-to-date.\n\nIt’s a growth stock. Earnings are expected to rise 43.6% this year and another 12.8% next year. But Meta Platforms also has an attractive forward P/E of just 27. And it’s now paying a dividend, yielding 0.4%.\n\nIs Meta Platforms the cheapest Mag 7 stock?\n\nWhat Is the Cheapest of the Mag 7 stocks?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL, MSFT and AMZN in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For a Master of Brutalist Provocations, a Modest Museum Appraisal\n\nThe company’s Blackwell chips, which are beginning to roll out to customers this year, would need 3 gigawatts of power to develop OpenAI’s GPT-4 software, Nvidia said at an event called the AI Summit DC. Ten years ago, that process would have required 5,500 gigawatts, the chipmaker said.\n\n“Our Blackwell platform is basically built with energy efficiency in mind,” Nvidia Vice President Bob Pette said at a briefing ahead of the event.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company also pointed to its headway in software. That includes producing “agent blueprints” that will let businesses rapidly deploy customized AI services. Agents are pieces of software that handle real-world tasks, such as dealing with customer requests, aiding in the design of a device or speeding up drug discovery.\n\nNvidia shares gained as much as 4.1% to $132.92 on Tuesday. The stock has more than doubled this year, following a 239% rally in 2023.\n\nThough Nvidia has been the single biggest beneficiary of the AI spending boom, much of its revenue comes from a small group of data center makers and operators. The company said it’s “leading the charge” to spread the use of the technology to more areas, setting the stage for what it sees as a new industrial revolution.\n\nThe push also includes finding more customized uses for AI. Though tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT are generally helpful, they tend to “regurgitate back what we’ve put on the internet,” Pette said.\n\nSuch a service isn’t going to find a cure for cancer or help run a specific business, he said. Instead, people will need a smaller AI model that’s been tailored to a certain purpose.\n\nThe software is part of an ever-expanding range of Nvidia products and services — a lineup that spans chips, servers, networking gear, AI models and services. The overarching goal is to help companies more easily put together everything they need to be able to use AI.\n\nBeyond the agent software, Deloitte LLP is using some Nvidia software in its CyberSphere online security service. AT&T Inc., Lowe’s Cos. and ServiceNow Inc. are also adopting Nvidia offerings, the chipmaker said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI has the potential to transform the health care industry in particular, Nvidia said. The Santa Clara, California-based company has been preparing for this shift for a decade by developing a drug discovery business, Pette said.\n\n(Updates with shares in fifth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "title": "Meta Platforms Just Hinted That Nvidia Is Going to Have a Monster 2025",
        "content": "As we enter the final quarter of 2024, some investors might be thinking about how they want to position their portfolio heading into 2025. This includes assessing winners and losers, and if you bought Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock at the start of the year, you're sitting on some nice gains.\n\nWith the stock rising around 150% so far in 2024, investors would be forgiven for thinking that it couldn't rise any higher. However, some hints on other companies' conference calls indicate that 2025 will be just as good a year for the company as 2024 has been. The question is, will the stock see the same benefit?\n\nMeta is going to buy a bunch more GPUs in 2025\n\nNvidia's incredible rise has been tied to the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race. Its primary product is the graphics processing unit (GPU), which can be used to perform multiple calculations in parallel. Additionally, companies don't just buy one or two of these units. Instead, they buy them by the thousands. This gives AI researchers ridiculous computing power and allows them to train AI models quickly.\n\nAs these models get more complex, the amount of time it takes to train them rises exponentially. Take Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) Llama generative AI model, for instance. The current iteration is Llama 3.1, but Meta has already started training Llama 4. However, CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that the training time for Llama 4 will likely be 10 times as long as it took to train Llama 3. Beyond Llama 4, the training time will likely increase again.\n\nThis isn't just a Meta problem. OpenAI's ChatGPT, Alphabet's Gemini, and other generative AI models will experience the same phenomenon as these models improve and become more complex.\n\nDo you think these AI innovators will just wait 10 times longer for their next AI model to train? Probably not. Instead, they'll increase their computing power to speed up the process, significantly benefiting Nvidia.\n\nIn its Q2 earnings release, Meta also commented that its infrastructure cost expense will significantly rise in 2025. This is clearly tied to its computing power build-out to create the best AI model it can. Nvidia will be a primary beneficiary of this, making it an intriguing stock for 2025.\n\nNvidia should have strong growth in 2025\n\nNvidia also has some tricks up its sleeve for 2025. Its Blackwell technology is expected to launch and, according to CEO Jensen Huang, provides 3 to 5 times more AI throughput in a power-limited data center than Hopper, Nvidia's current architecture. That's a big deal, and Blackwell could become a new source of revenue growth for Nvidia. Currently, demand for Blackwell is \"well above supply,\" according to management.\n\nThis is just part of the reason why Wall Street analysts believe that Nvidia can grow fiscal year 2026 (ending January 2026) revenue by 42%. It also expects strong earnings growth, with earnings per share (EPS) expected to rise from $2.84 in fiscal 2025 to $4.02 in fiscal 2026. At today's prices, that would value the stock at around 30 times fiscal 2026 earnings.\n\nConsidering Nvidia's growth, that's not a terrible price to pay for the stock if it can keep up its business past fiscal 2026.\n\nLooking one year out is hard enough, but looking two years out is considerably harder. The major question is whether the demand for Nvidia's GPUs will last past fiscal 2026. If it won't, then Nvidia's not worth buying here. But if it does, Nvidia's stock could be a great purchase right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $765,523!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The technology heavyweights that powered this year’s rally in US stocks are no longer attractive to Findlay Park Partners LLP, whose fund has outperformed 86% of peers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Singapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums What Do US Vehicle Regulators Have Against Tiny Cars? For a Master of Brutalist Provocations, a Modest Museum Appraisal\n\nThe fund — which has about $11.3 billion in assets and counts UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Accenture Plc among its top holdings — sold down its stake in Nvidia Corp. to zero in the third quarter, according to a note sent to clients and seen by Bloomberg News. The chipmaker’s shares dropped in that period, while the other two stocks rallied at least 15%.\n\nNvidia — a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence buzz — accounted for 5% of total holdings at one point this year, the note showed. The asset manager also reduced its stake in Microsoft Corp. — its biggest position for much of the past decade — to 3% as of end-September from 4.8% in August, according to a fund fact-sheet.\n\n“The Magnificent Seven have all warranted their outperformance to an extent by the growth they’ve delivered, but now earnings growth expectations are pretty tepid and valuations are still pricing in as if that growth pattern’s going to continue,” Simon Pryke, chief executive officer at Findlay Park, said in an interview. “One of those numbers is wrong.”\n\nThe Dublin-domiciled fund, which operates under Europe’s UCITS framework designed to protect retail investors, invests mainly in the US. It has returned about 29% in the past year compared with 16% by peers, and with lower relative volatility, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In 2023, it outperformed 90% of peers.\n\nFindlay Park’s focus is to bet on stocks that have a big exposure to the domestic US market and supply chain. That approach means it has never held Tesla Inc. or Apple Inc., Pryke said. The fund holds just 4.8% in the Magnificent Seven, compared with a benchmark weighting of over 28%, the firm said in the note to clients.\n\nUS stocks have scaled record highs this year, with the rally concentrated in a small group of stocks, mainly tech, through much of the first half. But the gains have broadened out to smaller stocks in the third quarter as worries about the threat of a recession faded. Investors are also questioning the payoff from heavy investment in AI.\n\nAnalysts expect earnings growth among the so-called Magnificent Seven group of stocks to slow to 18% in the July-September period from 36% in the previous quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, the overall outlook for the tech sector remains upbeat. Analysts predict that the S&P 500 Information Technology Index — which houses Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft among others — will hit around 4,962 points over 12 months, implying gains of about 14% from current levels.\n\nFindlay Park has about 40% of its portfolio in stocks with between $5 billion and $50 billion in market capitalization, said Rose Vangerven, the fund’s responsible investment lead.\n\nPryke added that they prefer to invest in business-to-business enterprises, rather than consumer-facing stocks. “They’re typically capital light, with high recurring revenue and high free-cash regeneration.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "title": "What's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy If Kamala Harris Wins in November?",
        "content": "The stock market has performed pretty well as the Biden-Harris administration draws to a close. Despite the steep decline in 2022, the S&P 500 has soared nearly 50%. Much of this performance was driven by huge gains for the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nCould this momentum continue in a Kamala Harris administration? And, if so, what's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Harris wins in November? Kamala Harris. Official White House photo by Lawrence Jackson.\n\nHarris' proposals that could affect the Magnificent Seven\n\nHarris has unveiled a wide range of economic proposals. Her campaign released an 82-page document outlining what she'd like to do to create what she calls \"an opportunity economy.\" Not all of the proposals in this document affect the Magnificent Seven, but several could.\n\nThe vice president's plan to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% has received significant media attention. Although this is a large increase, it's still lower than the maximum corporate tax rate of 39% that was in place before former President Donald Trump's tax cuts went into effect in 2018.\n\nAnother Harris proposal is to quadruple the tax rate on corporate stock buybacks. The rationale behind this plan is \"to encourage businesses to invest in growth and productivity.\"\n\nHarris also wants the federal government to invest in industries that are important to the country's economic and national security. Her plan specifically identifies the following types of businesses that would be eligible for tax credits:\n\nAerospace companies Artificial intelligence (AI) data centers Automobile manufacturers Biotechnology companies Clean energy manufacturers Semiconductor manufacturers Steel and iron producers\n\nEvaluating the impact of these proposals\n\nIn theory, the members of the Magnificent Seven -- Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) -- would be affected equally by Harris' proposed corporate tax rate increase. However, in practice, this change could impact the big companies differently.\n\nThe following table shows the effective tax rates paid by the Magnificent Seven in their most recent fiscal years:\n\nCompany Effective Tax Rate Alphabet 13.9% Amazon 9.73% Apple 14.7% Meta Platforms 17.6% Microsoft 18% Nvidia 12% Tesla (50% Tax Benefit)\n\nData sources: Company 10-K filings. *Tesla received more tax benefits than it paid in taxes in 2023.\n\nAs you can see, none of the Magnificent Seven companies paid the full 21% corporate tax rate. Microsoft and Meta had the highest effective tax rates of the group. However, all of the companies have been adept at using the tax code to their advantage.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat about stock buybacks? Most of the Magnificent Seven members have repurchased shares in significant amounts. Apple has by far spent the most money on stock buybacks -- $70.6 billion in the nine months ended July 1, 2023. Increased taxes on stock buybacks could cause Apple and others to change their capital deployment strategies. However, I don't expect this would significantly impact their stock performance or underlying businesses.\n\nEach of these companies could benefit from the tax credits for AI data centers proposed by Harris. As the three largest cloud services providers, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet might be the biggest winners on this front. However, Nvidia could also be helped quite a bit because its GPUs are used heavily in AI data centers. In addition, Nvidia and Tesla could potentially receive tax credits offered to semiconductor makers and automakers, respectively.\n\nThe best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Harris wins\n\nSo what's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Harris wins the presidential race? The honest answer is that there's insufficient information to know which stock might benefit the most from the aforementioned policies proposed by the vice president. Furthermore, it's uncertain if she would be able to implement all of her plans should she be elected. The U.S. Congress advances legislation; the president only signs the bills into law.\n\nThat said, many economists believe that Harris' economic policies would help control inflation, while Trump's plans (especially his proposed tariffs) could cause inflation to rise. If these economists are right, interest rates would more likely be lower during a Harris administration than they would otherwise be.\n\nWhile all the Magnificent Seven stocks should benefit from a lower-rate environment, I think the best pick of the group is Amazon. The company has a substantial debt load, which makes it a potentially bigger beneficiary of lower rates than the other Magnificent Seven members. Lower interest rates could also boost consumer and corporate spending, helping Amazon's e-commerce, advertising, and cloud services businesses.\n\nRegardless of which person occupies the White House over the next four years, Amazon should benefit from the shift of IT spending to the cloud from on-premises. This migration will likely be accelerated by AI advances.\n\nSurprisingly, Amazon stock has only climbed around 12% during Harris' time as VP. I suspect it could deliver much greater gains if she becomes president and interest rates decline further.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "title": "Prediction: Nvidia Could Be Headed to $150 in 2025",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been one of the market's top performers in recent years, soaring a mind-boggling 2,600% over the past five. And this year, the trend continues with Nvidia stock heading for a 150% gain. All of this is thanks to the company's dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, where it holds more than 80% share.\n\nAnd Nvidia hasn't stopped there but has developed a broad range of AI products and services, helping the company deliver billions of dollars in earnings quarter after quarter. In fact, Nvidia has been on a roll, growing quarterly revenue in the triple digits year over year. So now, the natural question is: With all of this positive momentum, where is Nvidia's stock going to land in 2025?\n\nToday, Nvidia shares trade for about $124 following the company's 10-for-1 stock split in June. A stock split doesn't change the total value of a company but lowers the price of each individual share through the issuance of new shares to current shareholders. This makes it easier for a broader range of investors to access the stock. From this new price level, my prediction is Nvidia could be headed to $150 next year as gains continue but potentially at a slower pace than in recent times. Let's find out more. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRecord data-center revenue\n\nFirst, some background on Nvidia. The company sells graphics processing units (GPUs) used to power many tasks -- from gaming to AI. Gaming actually was Nvidia's biggest business a few years ago, but as the AI boom accelerated, so did Nvidia's AI business. Data-center revenue, accounting for 87% of Nvidia's total revenue, came in at more than $26 billion in the most recent quarter -- a record and a triple-digit gain from the prior year.\n\nOther companies sell AI chips, but Nvidia's are particularly sought-after due to their speed -- they're the fastest around, and Nvidia says this high performance can save customers money over the long term. So, while they pay more for a Nvidia GPU today, they're likely to have a lower-total cost of ownership over time.\n\nCompanies developing major AI projects clearly are on board because demand for Nvidia's soon-to-launch architecture Blackwell is surpassing supply. Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang says he expects this trend to continue well into next year even as Nvidia works night and day to bring supply to the highest levels possible. In a recent interview with CNBC, Huang even said demand for the company's new Blackwell chip is \"insane.\"\n\nBillions in Blackwell revenue right around the corner\n\nAll of this should support the idea of more gains for Nvidia stock. The company predicts that after ramping production of Blackwell in the fourth quarter, Nvidia also should see \"several billion dollars\" in revenue from the platform in that quarter too. We also should expect a clear picture of how the demand for Blackwell translates into earnings in the following quarters throughout 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf Nvidia is able to serve most of the demand and generate growth from Blackwell from quarter to quarter, I would expect investors to continue flocking to the stock. It's also important to keep in mind that Nvidia isn't cheap, but it isn't excessively expensive for a growth stock either -- at 44 times forward-earnings estimates -- especially considering potential for growth down the road thanks to the company's market leadership and focus on innovation to keep its top spot. So Nvidia stock could increase in valuation from today's level and still remain reasonably priced.\n\nNow let's talk market value. If Nvidia were to increase to $150 next year, market cap would reach $3.6 trillion, roaring past the value of market giant Microsoft, today worth $3.09 trillion. But it's important to keep in mind that Microsoft, too, may climb next year, keeping it ahead of Nvidia. In any case, I would expect the two companies, both building solid positions in the high-growth area of AI, to remain neck and neck when it comes to market value over the coming year.\n\nA 20% gain\n\nFinally, my prediction of an increase to $150 represents a gain but only about 20% from today's level. That isn't much compared to this year's winnings so far. I'm not any less positive on Nvidia than I was earlier in the year. But stocks generally don't soar nonstop without any slowdown in the pace from time to time, and Nvidia, considering its enormous advance over the past few years, now may enter a phase of more measured increases.\n\nAnd this is actually positive because it would show that Nvidia stock isn't a bubble ready to burst but instead a player that has what it takes to deliver lasting gains over the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Everything to know about Nvidia, from the stock to its AI chips",
        "content": "Image: NurPhoto (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia has emerged as one of the hottest artificial intelligence stocks on the market. The 31-year-old company’s meteoric rise is largely due to the recent AI boom, which revealed the unexpected potential of its core product, the graphics processing units (GPUs), for AI development.\n\nOriginally designed for quickly rendering complex graphics in video games, Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPUs proved well-suited for the demands of AI model training. As tech giants began investing billions in AI research and development, Nvidia swiftly adapted its gaming-oriented chips for AI applications, making them the go-to solution and catapulting the company to the forefront of the AI revolution.\n\nRead more: Nvidia is an AI superpower. It started at a Denny’s\n\nHere’s a closer look at the semiconductor maker’s success, challenges, and outlook as we head into 2025.\n\nWhy is Nvidia at the center of the AI boom? Image: Anadolu (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia’s journey in AI began long before the current boom, with the company entering the market in 1999. For years, the company’s AI-capable GPUs remained a niche product. However, about a decade ago, breakthroughs in machine learning techniques sparked increased interest in AI across various industries.\n\nNvidia’s GPUs are designed for parallel processing – the ability to perform many calculations simultaneously rather than in sequence. This makes them ideal for AI tasks, which often involve crunching vast amounts of data at once. In 2007, Nvidia developed CUDA, a software tool that gives developers an easy way to harness the power of these chips which has proved especially useful for AI products.\n\nThis combination of specialized hardware and user-friendly software created a comprehensive toolkit for AI developers, establishing Nvidia as a key enabler in the rapidly evolving field.\n\nHow did Nvidia stock become so valuable? Image: CFOTO (Getty Images)\n\nWhen Nvidia went public in 1999, shares were initially priced at $12. The company had already made its mark in the graphics industry, having launched its first chip, the NV1, in 1995. For years, Nvidia’s stock grew steadily as the company dominated the gaming graphics market and gradually expanded into the nascent AI industry.\n\nThen came November 2022. The release of ChatGPT thrust AI into the spotlight, sparking a new wave of interest and investment. As tech giants rushed to beef up their AI capabilities, Nvidia’s specialized chips suddenly became the hottest commodity in Silicon Valley. This surge in demand sent Nvidia’s stock on a remarkable upward trajectory. Today, depending on the trading day, Nvidia’s shares are estimated to be worth $110 and $120.\n\nWhat Nvidia’s recent earnings say about the demand for AI chips  Image: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia posted its earnings for the second quarter, which ended on July 28, showing a record $30 billion in revenue, beating Wall Street expectations. That figure is up by 15% from its first-quarter earnings of $26 billion for fiscal year 2025 – up 262% from the previous year.\n\nFor the third quarter, Nvidia expects to report its revenue at $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — which is above the average of what analysts are expecting, but below top-end estimates, hinting that the company’s explosive growth might be reaching a plateau.\n\n“While the numbers [for Q2] indicate that the AI revolution remains alive and well, the smaller beat compared to the previous quarters adds to the multiple warning signs across the tech space earlier in this earnings season,” Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, told Quartz.\n\nWhat do market experts say about Nvidia’s position?  Image: CFOTO (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia’s dominance in the AI chip market has drawn both praise and caution from industry experts. Their unique position highlights both the potential and the challenges facing the AI industry as a whole.\n\nNvidia’s dominance in the AI chip market gives it unprecedented control over pricing, allowing the company to adjust prices based on demand, according to Monteiro.\n\nOn the other hand, Nvidia isn’t getting all of the praise from investors – as they turn their eye to other stocks in the sector, like Intel, said David Dietze of Peapack Private Wealth Management.\n\nEven though Intel (INTC) is gaining some attention from analysts, the chipmaker has struggled to compete in the AI-driven market. Despite the stock’s sharp decline, asset manager Apollo Global Management has offered to invest up to $5 billion in the company, which would bring an upside surprise to the chipmaker’s dwindling market cap.\n\n“[Nvidia] is significantly off its highs, arguably still in a mini-correction period. It has not done well this summer, because I think one of the key issues is ‘how will their consumers make purchases?’’ Dietze said in an interview with Quartz.\n\nWhat’s Nvidia’s outlook for 2025?  Image: CFOTO (Getty Images)\n\nAs Nvidia continues to overtake other tech giants in the market like Microsoft (MSFT) and others, analysts are confident that the company can still deliver strong double-digit figures by the end of this year and into 2025.\n\nAccording to Bain’s annual technology report, the consulting firm predicted that chipmakers will need to make “unprecedented levels of investment in technology infrastructure” to remain on top of the markets.\n\nWhile there are still murmurs regarding the possibility of the economy heading into a recession next year, Tony Roth, CIO of Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors, said to Quartz, that because of companies like Nvidia and Microsoft leading the markets, the public can “certainly” expect to see those large names “continue to grow earnings at a pretty rapid pace,” over the long haul.\n\n“In a nutshell, we believe the stage is set for tech stocks to move higher into year-end and 2025,” said Daniel Ives, Managing Director of Equity Research at Wedbush Securities to Quartz.\n\nWhere Nvidia stands in the litigation space right now  Image: CFOTO (Getty Images)\n\nDespite its market success, Nvidia faces several legal challenges related to its business practices and disclosures. The company’s legal troubles date back to 2018 when E. Ohman J:or Fonder AB, a Swedish investment firm, sued Nvidia and CEO Jensen Huang for allegedly misleading investors about crypto-mining’s contribution to revenue. This case has recently gained new attention as the U.S. Supreme Court agreed in June 2024 to hear it, with a decision still pending.\n\nIn 2022, Nvidia faced scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar issues. The SEC alleged that Nvidia failed to disclose that cryptocurrency mining was a “significant element” in its revenue growth from sales of gaming chips. The company settled with the SEC, agreeing to pay $5.5 million without admitting wrongdoing.\n\nMore recently, Nvidia’s AI endeavors have drawn legal challenges like other companies building generative AI tools that need massive datasets that contain copyrighted material. In March, the company was sued by the authors of Last Night at the Lobster and Ghost Walk for allegedly using their works to help train Nvidia’s NeMo AI platform.\n\nThe latest legal hurdle came in September 2024 when Texas-based startup Xockets filed a lawsuit against Nvidia and Microsoft. Xockets alleged monopolistic practices, patent infringement, and antitrust violations. The startup went further, accusing the companies of forming an “illegal cartel” through an entity called RPX, which has allegedly allowed them to “avoid paying the fair market price” for Xockets’ patented technology.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Went Parabolic Can Plunge by Up to 78%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "For almost two years, artificial intelligence (AI) has dominated the discussion on Wall Street -- and with good reason.\n\nThe ability for AI-driven software and systems to learn and evolve over time without human intervention gives this technology utility in most sectors and industries around the globe. The rise of AI is why the analysts at PwC forecast a $15.7 trillion lift to the worldwide economy by 2030.\n\nHowever, previous next-big-thing innovations have consistently shown that not all participants will be winners, or at the very least sustain their parabolic moves higher. Although artificial intelligence has been a boon for a number of tech-driven companies, three AI-dependent highfliers can plunge by up to 78%, based on the price targets issued by select Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied downside of 28%\n\nThe first leading AI stock that went parabolic but could soon endure substantial downside, at least according to the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is semiconductor giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Analyst Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson is looking for shares of Nvidia to hit $90, which would represent a 28% decline from the nearly $125 they closed at on Oct. 4.\n\nNvidia's parabolic gains reflect it being the face of the AI revolution. Its H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) has effectively become the brains for high-compute data centers needing to make split-second decisions, run generative AI solutions, and train large language models.\n\nNvidia is also enjoying exceptionally strong pricing power for its H100, which has commanded a 100% to 300% price premium to competing AI-GPUs. Further, CEO Jensen Huang noted last week that demand for the successor Blackwell chip, which is faster and more energy efficient than its predecessor, is \"insane.\"\n\nDespite being on the leading edge of innovation for Wall Street's hottest trend, headwinds are emerging for this AI darling.\n\nFor example, Nvidia has competition coming at it from all angles. Less costly and more available AI-GPUs are logically expected to chip away at its monopoly like market share in AI-accelerated data centers over the coming quarters. Perhaps more importantly, Nvidia's four largest customers by net sales (all members of the \"Magnificent Seven\") are internally developing AI-GPUs for their data centers. This signals a reduced reliance on Nvidia's hardware in the future.\n\nThe company's insiders have given little reason for investors to cheer, either. Jensen Huang was a persistent seller of his company's stock for a three-month stretch between mid-June and mid-September. Meanwhile, not a single insider has purchased shares of Nvidia on the open market since December 2020. It sends a pretty clear signal that the company's stock isn't a good value.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, there hasn't been a game-changing innovation or technology for three decades that's avoided an early stage bubble. Investors consistently overestimate how quickly a new technology will become mainstream, and we appear to be witnessing this same story playing out with artificial intelligence. If history is accurate and the AI bubble bursts, Nvidia would probably be hit harder than any other leading AI stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nUpstart Holdings: Implied downside of 76%\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock that's had a few parabolic moves upward since this decade began, but could be staring down a sizable decline in the not-too-distant future based on the forecast of one Wall Street analyst, is cloud-based lending platform Upstart Holdings(NASDAQ: UPST). Wedbush analyst David Chiaverini has Upstart's stock retreating to $10 per share, which would represent a drop of 76% from where it ended on Oct. 4.\n\nOn paper, Upstart is an exciting business model. Instead of the traditional loan-vetting process taking weeks and costing lending institutions time and money, Upstart's platform was able to fully automate 91% of loan applicants during the second quarter. The company's approval process leans on AI and machine learning to assess risk and approve/deny loans.\n\nUpstart is also working with more than 100 banks and credit unions. Its AI-driven lending model is leading to more approvals and expanding the pool of clients for financial institutions without adversely impacting their delinquency and charge-off rates.\n\nHowever, Upstart's model is highly dependent on favorable lending rates. The Federal Reserve's steepest rate-hiking cycle in four decades, which began in March 2022, reduced demand for personal, auto, and home loans. Even with the nation's central bank kicking off a rate-easing cycle in September, rates will likely need to fall a lot more before lending activity really picks up.\n\nUpstart's operating model isn't time-tested, either, which may give Wall Street and investors some level of pause. When interest rates were near historic lows earlier this decade, Upstart's model was growing lightning fast and the company was profitable on a recurring basis. It's now losing money every quarter and its growth engine has completely stalled.\n\nIt's also unclear how Upstart would fare if a U.S. recession were to occur. A couple of predictive indicators, such as a historic decline in U.S. M2 money supply and the longest yield-curve inversion on record, suggest economic weakness is a real possibility. Lending is highly cyclical and Upstart is still trying to find its footing following the fastest rate-hiking cycle since the early 1980s.\n\nPalantir Technologies: Implied downside of 78%\n\nThe third AI stock that went parabolic but may come tumbling back down, based on the estimate of one Wall Street analyst, is data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR). RBC Capital's Rishi Jaluria has maintained a $9 price target for Palantir, which if accurate would imply downside to come of 78%!\n\nPalantir's monstrous run-up is a reflection of its operating model being unique. The company's Gotham platform, which caters to select federal governments, relies on AI and machine learning to help with data collection/aggregation and mission planning, among other tasks. Gotham has been Palantir's primary source of growth in recent years, with many of its largest contracts spread out over four or five years.\n\nHowever, the company's future is very much dependent on its relatively nascent Foundry platform. Foundry also incorporates AI solutions and is focused on helping businesses streamline their operations by better understanding their data.\n\nAlthough Palantir's irreplaceability and sustained double-digit growth rate are worthy of some level of valuation premium, there are reasons to believe its stock has hit a plateau.\n\nFor instance, Palantir's Gotham platform is only available to select nations that are allies of the United States. This is to say that the company's leadership wouldn't allow China, as an example, to access Gotham. Despite generating consistent sales growth from Gotham, this does place a glass ceiling over this operating segment.\n\nPalantir's valuation is less than palatable, as well. Shares closed out the previous week at an estimated 93 times forward-year earnings and 27 times forecast revenue. These are nosebleed multiples that will require flawless execution, which is something rarely witnessed on Wall Street over extended periods.\n\nThough Jaluria's $9 price target appears overly pessimistic, optimists have likely also overshot to the upside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. plans to boost server capacity to meet stronger-than-anticipated demand for Nvidia Corp. chips used to develop AI, reflecting its expectations that spending on artificial intelligence will stay high.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Singapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums What Do US Vehicle Regulators Have Against Tiny Cars? For a Master of Brutalist Provocations, a Modest Museum Appraisal\n\nChairman Young Liu told Bloomberg Television that demand for the next-generation Blackwell chips was “crazy,” echoing similar remarks from Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang last week.\n\nThe Taiwanese company is now building the world’s largest assembly plant for servers housing Nvidia’s most advanced Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico. Hon Hai will have a planned capacity of 20,000 GB200 NVL 72 servers in 2025, according to Liu, disclosing its scale for the first time.\n\nRead: IPhone Maker Hon Hai Sustains Revenue Rebound With Help From AI\n\n“There was a lot of talk that the need for compute may be saturated pretty soon. But it looks like the demand is still growing. So that’s beyond our expectations,” Liu said.\n\nHowever, Liu said there was a “hiccup” in the production of GB200 servers, confirming again a delay with Blackwell supply. Shipments are now expected to start in the late fourth quarter instead of early in the October-December period, he said.\n\nStill, Nvidia’s Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said in August that the company expects to ship several billion dollars worth of Blackwell chips in its fiscal fourth quarter.\n\n--With assistance from Lauren Faith Lau.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "title": "The Top 10 Oil and Gas Gainers So Far This Year",
        "content": "The latest oil price rally is showing real strength with oil prices making big gains again on Monday. The rally kicked off last week after Washington indicated Israel could strike Iran’s oil facilities. Brent crude for November delivery gained 3.4% in Monday’s intraday session to trade at $80.71 per barrel at 1.20 pm ET while WTI crude was changing hands at $77.05 per barrel after gaining 3.1%.\n\nClearview Energy Partners has predicted that oil prices could gain as much as $28/bbl if flows are blocked in the Strait of Hormuz; $13/bbl if Israel strikes Iranian energy infrastructure and $7/bbl if the U.S. and its allies placed economic sanctions on Iran.\n\nMeanwhile, Citi analysts have provided estimates that a major strike by Israel on Iran's export capacity could take 1.5M bbl/day of crude off the market, while an attack on downstream assets and other relatively minor infrastructure such as could take out 300K-450K bbl/day. According to ANZ Bank, Iran's oil output hit a six-year high of 3.7M bbl/day in August.\n\nNot surprisingly, oil and gas stocks are flying, with the sector’s favorite benchmark, Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE), up nearly 10% over the past 30 days. The energy sector, however, has yet to catch up to the broader market after returning 12.0% vs. 20.0% by the S&P 500. That said, some energy stocks have outperformed even red-hot AI leader Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA). Here are the top 10 best performers in the energy sector so far in the current year.\n\n#1 Sintana Energy Inc. (OTCQB:SEUSF)\n\nMarket Cap: $320.0M\n\nYear-to-Date Returns: 274.8%\n\nToronto, Canada-based Sintana Energy Inc. (OTCQB:SEUSF)(CVE:SEI) engages in crude oil and natural gas exploration and development business in Colombia. The company holds five onshore and offshore petroleum exploration licenses in Namibia, as well as in Colombia’s Magdalena Basin.\n\nSEI shares have soared after Galp Energy announced in April that its part-owned Mopane discovery in offshore Namibia is “world class”. Flows from the Mopane-1X well hit the maximum limit of 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in a test.\n\nRelated: Crude Oil Soars over 3.5% As Hezbollah Strikes Haifa\n\n#2 CES Energy Solutions Corp. (OTCPK:CESDF)\n\nMarket Cap: $1.3B\n\nYear-to-Date Returns: 125.6%\n\nCalgary, Canada-based CES Energy Solutions Corp. (OTCPK:CESDF) is an oilfield services company that provides solutions for drill-bit, point of completion and stimulation, wellhead and pump-jack, and pipeline services to midstream markets.\n\nCES has been a top performer among TSX Composite components over the past two years. The stock has delivered an eye-popping 400%+ return over the last three years, incomparable to a 11% rise by the TSX benchmark over the timeframe thanks to the company’s solid long-term financial growth prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\n#3 Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP)\n\nMarket Cap: $34.6B\n\nYear-to-Date Returns: 82.4%\n\nTexas-based TargaResourcesCorp. (NYSE:TRGP) owns general and limited partner interests in a limited partnership that provides midstream natural gas and natural gas liquid services. The company gathers, compresses, treats, processes, and sells natural gas. TRGP has earned a Buy recommendation from Goldman Sachs thanks to a strong return on equity (or ROE).\n\n“Stronger-than-expected economic growth represents the clearest upside risk to ROE. [It] would create upside to asset turnover through faster sales growth and to profit margins through operating leverage. Stronger growth has recently coincided with hotter-than-expected inflation, however,” wrote GS analyst David J. Kostin. “\n\nGS estimates that Targa Resources will be able to grow its ROE by 17% in the current year. TRGP has been an exceptional performer and is currently trading at a decade-high.\n\n#4 The Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB)\n\nMarket Cap: $60.5B\n\nYear-to-Date Returns: 43.0%\n\nThe Williams Companies Inc. (NYSE:WMB) is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in the United States, operating 33,000 miles of pipelines in total, which it says account for a third of the transported gas in the U.S. The company has been posting solid results, with the recent pop in electricity demand growth, particularly from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, likely to keep demand for the company’s gas pipelines high.\n\nWMB has continued to rapidly expand its gas infrastructure. Earlier in the year, the company completed the purchase of facilities with transport links from Hartree Partners for $1.95 billion. The gas assets include six underground natural gas storage facilities in Louisiana and Mississippi with a total capacity of 115B cf, 30 pipeline interconnects to attractive markets including connections to Transco, and 230 miles of gas transmission pipeline. Transco is the largest U.S. natural gas transmission pipeline\n\n\"Importantly, this storage will also allow us to provide value to customers in markets with growing renewables adoption as daily peaks for natural gas increases the need for storage,\" Williams President and CEO Alan Armstrong said in a press release.\n\n#5 Topaz Energy Corp. (OTCPK:TPZEF)\n\nMarket Cap: $2.9B\n\nYear-to-Date Returns: 35.3%\n\nCalgary, Canada-based Topaz Energy Corp. (OTCPK:TPZEF) operates as a royalty and energy infrastructure company in Canada. The company holds royalty interests on ~6 million gross acres of developed and undeveloped lands.\n\nA week ago, RBC reiterated a Buy rating on Topaz Energy with a price target of C$28.00. Topaz Energy Corp has an analyst consensus of Strong Buy, with a price target consensus of C$30.06, representing a 15.04% upside. Last month, National Bank also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a C$32.50 price target.\n\n#6 ONEOK Inc. (NYSE:OKE)\n\nMarket Cap: $55.6B\n\nYear-to-Date Returns: 35.2%\n\nTulsa, Oklahoma-based ONEOK Inc. (NYSE:OKE) is another midstream infrastructure company that engages in the processing, storage, transportation, and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids. The company recently posted Q2 adjusted EPS of $1.33, beating the Wall Street consensus by $0.12 thanks to higher natural gas processing volumes.\n\nSimilar to its peers, ONEOK has been looking to expand its gas assets through mergers. The company recently announced the acquisition of 43 percent of Enlink's outstanding common units for $14.90 per unit and 100% of the interests in the managing member for $300 million, for total cash consideration of approximately $3.3 billion. The acquisition includes a crude infrastructure platform capable of processing 1.7 billion cubic feet per day of Permian gas and 1.6 million barrels per day of Permian crude gathering capacity.\n\nRecently, Morgan Stanley upgraded OKE shares to Overweight from Equal Weight with a $111 price target, up from $103 (17.3% upside), expecting a positive estimate revision cycle over the next year. Morgan Stanley's Devin McDermott expects the company to achieve strong execution in growth and synergy realization with EnLink and Medallion, following strong execution in integrating the Magellan acquisition.\n\n#7 Kinder Morgan Inc. (NYSE:KMI)\n\nMarket Cap: $52.4B\n\nYear-to-Date Returns: 34.2%\n\nYet another energy infrastructure giant, Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) owns and operates approximately 82,000 miles of pipelines and 139 terminals. Kinder Morgan has reported that its natural gas pipeline segment recorded a boost from higher margins realized on its storage assets and higher volumes on its gathering systems. On the earnings conference call, CEO Kim Dang said he expects \"significant new natural gas demand\" rising from energy-intensive tech such as AI, crypto mining and data centers.\n\n\"We expect demand for natural gas to grow substantially between now and 2030, led by more than a doubling of demand for liquefied natural gas exports and a more than 50% increase in exports to Mexico,\" Dang said.\n\n\"The emphasis on renewables as the only sources of power is fatally flawed,\" Dang added, arguing that Big Tech leaders, \"like the rest of us, realize that the wind doesn't blow all the time and the sun doesn't shine all the time.\"\n\nSital Mody, natural gas president at energy infrastructure company Kinder Morgan, is highly bullish on the Eagle Ford’s natural gas prospects. Mody has predicted strong production growth by the Eagle Ford Shale out to 2030 thanks to the favorable economics and low nitrogen content of natural gas produced in the basin. According to data from S&P Global Commodity Insight, natural gas production from the Eagle Ford Shale averaged 5.2 Bcf/d in 2023; Kinder Morgan has forecast that production will grow by another 2.5 Bcf/d, or nearly 50%, by 2030, and probably rival that of the Haynesville.\n\n#8 Galp Energia S.A. (OTCPK:GLPEF)\n\nMarket Cap: $14.6B\n\nYear-to-Date Returns: 30.6%\n\nGalp Energia S.A. (OTCPK:GLPEF) operates as an integrated energy operator in Portugal and internationally.\n\nIn April, Galp described the Mopane discovery (see Sintana Energy above) as \"potentially an important commercial discovery.\" Galp reckons the complex alone could contain hydrocarbon in-place in excess of 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) and sees possible additional exploration and appraisal wells in the project’s vicinity.\n\n“All acquired data from the current Mopane drilling campaign will be analyzed and integrated into an updated reservoir model. The model will serve as the basis to refine Galp´s near-term drilling plan to further explore, appraise and develop the wider Mopane complex,” the company said in a statement.\n\n#9 Diamondback Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG)\n\nMarket Cap: $57.4B\n\nYear-to-Date Returns: 28.8%\n\nMidland, Tex.-based Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) has been one of the standout performers in the ongoing earnings season. The company reported Q2 revenue of $2.48B (+29.2% Y/Y), beating Wall Street consensus by $280M while Q2 Non-GAAP EPS of $4.52 beat by $0.02. The company averaged production of 276.1 MBO/d (474.7 MBOE/d).\n\nEarlier, Diamondback Energy agreed to buy privately held Permian producer Endeavor Energy Resources in a cash and stock deal valued at $26 billion. Interestingly, FANG shares have jumped more than 10% after the deal was announced nearly a week ago, meaning the market views it favorably.  Stock prices of the acquiring company, more often than not, tend to go down as the company has to pay a premium coupled with a high risk of failure.\n\n#10 Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM)\n\nMarket Cap: $554.6B\n\nYear-to-Date Returns: 25.8%\n\nExxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) is the largest integrated oil and gas company in America.\n\nXOM is trading at an all-time high thanks in large part to Wall Street being bullish on the company’s long-term outlook. XOM has a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy” among the 19 analysts covering the stock, based on 12 “Strong Buy” ratings and seven “Holds.”\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\n\nHurricane Helene Exposes Tech Industry's Fragile Supply Chain 3i Infrastructure to Divest Stake in French Green Energy Firm North Africa Poised to Power Europe's Green Energy Future\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The 2024 Q3 earnings season is just days from kicking into a much higher gear with the release of the big banks’ results on Friday. The period looks to be constructive, with earnings growth expected to be positive again despite recent downward revisions that have contrasted with recent periods.\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at a few key reports across different sectors.\n\nNvidia's Data Center Results in Focus\n\nIt’s hard to put Nvidia’s NVDA success into words anymore, with record-breaking quarterly results over the last year driven by the AI frenzy leading to remarkable share performance. Though shares have been relatively quiet over the last three months, essentially flat, revisions for the upcoming release continue to reflect bullishness.\n\nThe $0.74 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate is up nearly 9% since mid-July, suggesting a sizable 85% increase from the year-ago period. Revenue expectations have also remained bullish, with the $32.6 billion expected also 7% higher over the same period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOf course, Data Center results will be the real highlight of the release, no different than recent periods. The results have consistently blown away our consensus expectations, exceeding estimates by at least $1.4 billion across its last five releases. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd despite its strong run, the valuation picture here remains attractive, with the current 36.2X forward 12-month earnings multiple comparing favorably to the 50.7X five-year median. The current PEG works out to 0.9X, reflective of both growth and value.\n\nRemember that NVDA is one of the ‘late’ reporters during earnings season, with its release scheduled for November 19th.\n\nMCD Faces Bearish Expectations\n\nMCD’s MCD quarterly release will likely provide some insight into the state of consumers, particularly given that it’s recently faced a slowdown in restaurant foot traffic. High menu prices have been behind the slowdown, though it’s worth noting that recent value propositions could help close the gap.\n\nEarnings expectations for the restaurant titan have been taken lower over recent months, with the current $3.15 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down 4.5% and suggesting a 1.2% pullback from the year-ago period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRevenue expectations have largely followed the same trajectory, with McDonald’s expected to see $6.7 billion in revenue throughout the period, 1% higher year-over-year. The company’s sales growth rates have been decreasing for some time now, as we can see below.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that the chart below tracks the year-over-year change in sales, not actual revenue numbers. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla Reveals EV Numbers\n\nTesla TSLA, another member of the Mag 7 group, will also see its quarterly release in focus, giving us further clues surrounding the current state of the EV industry. Shares have delivered a nice performance over the last month, gaining 11%.\n\nStill, expectations for the period have primarily reflected bearishness, with the $0.57 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down nearly 10% since mid-July. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOf course, the key metric for Tesla is the company’s EV production/delivery numbers. The company unveiled its production and delivery numbers recently; Tesla delivered roughly 463k EVs and produced nearly 470k throughout the period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Q3 earnings season looks to pick up notable steam over the coming weeks, with the big banks delivering the results this Friday. It looks to be another positive period, with S&P 500 earnings growth again expected to be positive.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "IPhone Maker Hon Hai Says EV Business Will Need Years to Ramp Up",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. said that it will take years to build up its nascent automotive arm as electric vehicle sales slow globally, while its business of making and selling AI servers with Nvidia Corp. chips has been booming and growing fast.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Singapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums What Do US Vehicle Regulators Have Against Tiny Cars? For a Master of Brutalist Provocations, a Modest Museum Appraisal\n\nThe world’s biggest iPhone assembler is proceeding cautiously with its EV push as it sees a highly uncertain business environment where “a fast move may be dangerous,” the head of its EV business Jun Seki said in an interview with Bloomberg TV ahead of a two-day event showcasing emerging tech and products. “We want to be very smart investment wise, development wise.”\n\nSeki, a Nissan Motor Co. veteran who was appointed Hon Hai’s EV strategy chief in 2023, will be one of several key executives showcasing the firm’s latest tech on Tuesday, including a couple of new vehicle models and a $3 million Nvidia AI chip server. On EVs, he said it will probably take about another five years for the company to fully utilize its production lines at an Ohio facility it acquired from Lordstown Motors Corp. in 2022. The company’s main EV campus in the US, the Ohio plant will be able to build 350,000 vehicles per year.\n\nStill, Seki reaffirmed Hon Hai’s goal of securing 5% of global EV manufacturing in 2025 and said it’s interested in becoming a player in Japan and Southeast Asia in addition to the US.\n\n“We never give up, 5% is the first step we have to achieve,” said Seki, and the ultimate aim is to garner a share as large as Hon Hai has in smartphone manufacturing, as much as 40% or more.\n\nTo date, Hon Hai has only won corporate customers for its EV manufacturing at home in Taiwan. It ventured into the EV assembly business in 2020 as then-new Chairman Young Liu, who took over from founder Terry Gou, was looking for new cash cows. At the time, Apple Inc. was also harboring automotive ambitions, however it canceled its iPhone-on-four-wheels plans earlier this year.\n\nIn addition to EVs, The Taipei-based firm, also known as Foxconn, is fast expanding its AI server manufacturing. OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT in 2022 has triggered a big spending spree among the biggest cloud service providers, from Amazon.com Inc. to Meta Platforms Inc., transforming Hon Hai’s priorities and prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Taiwanese company assembles Nvidia’s highly prized graphics processors into ready-made modules that AI data center operators can buy in bulk. That’s helped propel its shares up by nearly 90% this year, and it reported better-than-expected sales for the third quarter on Saturday.\n\nNvidia’s multimillion-dollar NVL72 system, composed of dozens of next-generation Blackwell chips organized to work as a single unit, will be one of the highlight showpieces at the Hon Hai event on Tuesday.\n\n--With assistance from Lauren Faith Lau.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "title": "Cramer Congratulates NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) On Its GPU’s 25-Year Anniversary",
        "content": "We recently published an article titled, 11 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar right now.\n\nIn his recent episode of Mad Money, host Jim Cramer focused on the upcoming market events, emphasizing the importance of new consumer price index data alongside a series of reports as the earnings season kicks off.\n\nCramer pointed out that the Labor Department’s nonfarm payroll report revealed significant job growth in September, surpassing expectations. He highlighted the significant rally in stocks on Friday, a response to better-than-expected job creation figures. The U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs in September, significantly exceeding Wall Street’s estimate of 150,000. Additionally, there were upward revisions for the previous two months, with 72,000 more jobs reported for July and August combined.\n\nDespite his initial expectation that stocks would decline as bond yields surged, Cramer noted the resilience in the market. He observed that people seemed to feel relief, thinking that a major economic downturn was not on the horizon, which prompted a flurry of buying activity in the stock market. He added, “Maybe we aren’t headed toward a landing at all.” He described the situation as quite unusual and, in his view, “quite exciting”.\n\nHe mentioned that on Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee will publish notes from its last month’s meeting, which could clarify the central bank’s bold choice to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. According to Cramer, Wall Street is rife with speculation about the Federal Reserve’s future actions, especially following strong labor statistics released last Friday. As speculation swirls around whether the next cut will be 25 or 50 basis points, Cramer leaned towards the belief that it would likely be 25 or nothing at all. He added:\n\n“Then again, what really matters is the overall direction for rates, and that direction is most definitely lower, which is bullish for stocks.”\n\nHe also mentioned that Friday would bring the producer price index report, which, like the consumer price index, will serve as a critical indicator for the Fed’s upcoming decisions. Cramer commented:\n\n“Here’s the bottom line: a market that appreciates good news, like a robust job creation number, is a market that can handle, well, let’s just say, the historically tough month of October. After today’s performance, all I can say is so far so good.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were mentioned by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 4. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Cramer Congratulates NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) On Its GPU’s 25-Year Anniversary\n\nCramer Congratulates NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) On Its GPU’s 25-Year Anniversary\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading global provider of graphics, compute, and networking solutions, known for its technologies that cater to various markets, including gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive applications. Within its Graphics segment, NVIDIA offers GeForce GPUs designed for gaming, the GeForce NOW streaming service, and Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs tailored for enterprise graphics. Additionally, the company develops software solutions.\n\nCramer commented on the excitement surrounding the company and said:\n\n“Nvidia’s Jensen Huang will be ringing the Nasdaq opening bell with his team to celebrate the birth of the GPU 25 years ago. Those are the faster chips that make generative AI work. Congratulations to the NVIDIA team.”\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) first gained recognition with the launch of the GeForce 256 in 1999, which was hailed as the world’s first graphics processing unit (GPU). It revolutionized gaming by delivering smoother graphics and higher frame rates, ultimately shaping the future of computer graphics and gaming experiences.\n\nOver the years, the company expanded its focus beyond gaming and has made a name for itself, especially in AI. Recently, CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the overwhelming demand for NVIDIA’s next-generation AI chip, Blackwell, calling it “insane.”\n\nHuang expressed that the rapid pace of technological advancement presents an opportunity for the company to intensify its innovation efforts. He emphasized the goal of advancing capabilities, increasing throughput, and reducing both costs and energy consumption.\n\nBlackwell is set to be priced between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit, and demand is high from major corporations such as Microsoft and Meta, which are establishing AI data centers to support applications like ChatGPT and Copilot.\n\nGeneration Investment Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Recent net performance is behind market averages. However since the fund’s inception, we have spent only about 8% of the time underperforming on a rolling five-year basis.1 We do not enjoy these spells. A number of different factors has contributed to the current period of underperformance. The fact that we do not own NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one. That single company accounted for roughly 25% of returns in the benchmark so far this year, meaning almost everyone who does not own Nvidia has lost out. Year-to-date, not owning Nvidia explains about a third of our relative underperformance.\n\nNvidia is, clearly, an earnings juggernaut. In the past year its revenue has more than tripled, as cloud companies load up on hardware to power AI models. So while its earnings multiple has increased, we are not seeing a repeat of the dotcom mania of the late 1990s. This company’s valuation is backed by cold, hard cash…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer’s radar right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Key Events This Week: FOMC Meeting, AMD AI Event, TSLA Robotaxi Unveil",
        "content": "It’s a busy week ahead on Wall Street. Today, I will cover some of the most important economic and company-specific events for the week ahead.\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases:See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWednesday: Fed FOMC Minutes\n\nFollowing the 50-bps rate cut, Wall Street investors will be anxious to tune into what the Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the Fed has to say about the path forward for monetary policy at the FOMC meeting Wednesday at 2:00 PM EST.\n\nThursday: AMD AI Event\n\nOver the past few years, US equities have defied the odds and climbed the proverbial “Wall of Worry,” shaking off inflation fears, higher interest rates, and escalating wars in Europe and the Middle East. One of the significant drivers that has kept the market strong is the bullish spark that the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has provided. Last week, OpenAI, which runs ChatGPT, the most popular large language model (LLM) “chatbot”, announced a successful fresh round of funding that values the start up at more than $150 billion. Meanwhile, the AI revolution has reverberated throughout the economy. For instance, nuclear-centric utility company Constellation Energy (CEG) soared after it inked a 20-year deal to provide nuclear power to Microsoft (MSFT) (the largest OpenAI investor).\n\nHowever, no stock has benefitted more from the AI revolution than Nvidia (NVDA). Nvidia’s market cap has ballooned to more than $3 trillion as big tech companies rush to buildout their AI portfolios. Though Nvidia enjoys the lion’s share of the AI market, Advance Micro Devices (AMD) has a chance to shine this week when it presents its latest AI technology at its Advancing AI event Thursday. Though AMD only has a small share of the AI market, a Bank of America (BAC) analyst pointed out that even a 2-3% market share gain would be a massive catalyst. Meanwhile, Nvidia suffers from a demand problem, not a supply problem. Last week, NVDA CEO Jensen Huang updated investors on Blackwell, Nvidia’s most sophisticated and next generation chip, saying that demand for it is “insane.” If AMD is able to impress the Street with its new AI technology, the company may be able to take advantage of some of that demand.\n\nThursday: Initial jobless claims, consumer price index\n\nInitial jobless claims and the latest CPI numbers will be released Thursday morning at 8:30 am EST.\n\nThursday: Tesla Robotaxi Event\n\nTesla’s (TSLA) most highly anticipated unveiling event will occur this Thursday at the Robotaxi event. Tesla’s visionary CEO Elon Musk has touted the Tesla Robotaxi as the next big bullish catalyst for the company. However, the Robotaxi timeline and the Robotaxi event itself have been pushed back several times in classic Musk fashion, leading to a sluggish stock price until recently. That said, if Tesla can meet or beat expectations, the stock should continue its recent uptrend.\n\nStory continues\n\nFriday: JP Morgan Earnings\n\nJP Morgan (JPM) will kick off big bank earnings this Friday before the market open. JPM has beat Zacks Consensus Estimates for eight quarters in a row. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFriday: US PPI Inflation, Consumer Sentiment\n\nThe US Producer Price Index (PPI) and the latest consumer sentiment numbers will round out the economic data for the week at 8:30 am and 10 am EST respectively.\n\nOther Key Events to Watch:\n\nPotential geopolitical escalations between Israel and Iran, options expiration end of week.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Semiconductor Sales Soar on Surging Demand: 3 Stocks With Upside",
        "content": "The semiconductor industry is making a solid rebound on soaring demand for microchips. The past few months have seen worldwide semiconductor sales get a solid boost, with price pressures easing.\n\nThe ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) is also driving demand for semiconductors. The semiconductor industry is part of the broader technology sector, which is expected to grow further as the Federal Reserve goes ahead with more rate cuts.\n\nGiven this situation, investing in semiconductor stocks like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM, Semtech Corporation SMTC and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA should be a wise decision.\n\nSemiconductor Sales Continue to Grow\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said last week that global semiconductor sales totaled $53.1 billion in August, up 20.6% from year-ago levels of $44 billion. Month over month, semiconductor sales grew 3.5% from July’s total of $51.3 billion.\n\nThe year-over-year jump in semiconductor sales is the largest percentage gain since April 2022, driven by a 43.9% year-to-year sales surge in the Americas.\n\nJohn Neuffer, SIA president and CEO, said, “The global semiconductor market continued to grow substantially in August, hitting its highest-ever sales total for August, and month-to-month sales increased for the fifth consecutive month.”\n\nAI Enthusiasm, Rate Cut to Help Semiconductor Stocks\n\nCooling inflation is helping semiconductor sales, as easing price pressures have led to a rebound in demand. Also, the tech rally this year has primarily been driven by NVIDIA, which has taken a leading role in the generative AI sector, spurring a surge in interest and development in this field.\n\nExperts believe that AI holds a lot of untapped potential, and there is still much for the world to explore. This soaring enthusiasm is likely to further boost demand as more semiconductor manufacturers venture into the AI domain. The AI market is projected to experience explosive growth in the near future, with the demand for AI chipsets already on the rise.\n\nAlso, the Federal Reserve started its easing cycle last month with a jumbo 50 basis point rate cut, the first since March 2020. The current benchmark policy rate is between 4.75% and 5%, marking the lowest level since April 2023.\n\nAlso, the Fed's latest dot plot indicates that the Fed funds rate is expected to decrease to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% by the year-end, with a projected reduction of one percentage point in 2025 and another half-point cut in 2026. This would lead to a final rate range of 2.75% to 3%. Lower interest rates typically benefit growth assets by decreasing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets, like technology and semiconductor stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\n4 Semiconductor Stocks With Growth Potential\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited is the world's largest dedicated integrated circuit foundry. As a foundry, TSM manufactures ICs for its customers based on their proprietary IC designs using its advanced production processes. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited’s goal is to establish itself as one of the world's leading semiconductor companies by building upon the strengths that have made it the world's leading IC foundry.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 24.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.7% over the past 60 days. TSM presently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSemtech Corporation\n\nSemtech Corporation designs, manufactures and markets a wide range of analog and mixed-signal semiconductors for commercial applications. SMTC’s product line comprises Signal Integrity Products, Protection Products, Power and High-Reliability Products, Wireless and Sensing Products, and Systems Innovation Group.\n\nSemtech’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 6.3% over the past 60 days. SMTC presently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Researc\n\nNVIDIA Corporation\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to AI-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%.

        "title": "NVIDIA Stock Up 155% The Year: Still a Buy? Related ETFs to Consider",
        "content": "Semiconductor behemoth NVIDIA NVDA stock has gained about 155% this year, has added about 179% in the past year, and surged 2600% in the past five years. NVIDIA’s market cap has attained the level of $3 trillion this year.\n\nThe stock currently trades at a Price/Earnings (P/E) (trailing 12 months) of 55.59X, way higher than the 8.14X P/E (ttm) recorded by Semiconductor – General industry. The NVIDIA stock is currently trading at price/book (most recent quarter) of 51.82X, again much higher than industry figure of 1.33X. Price/Cash Flow of NVIDIA stock stands at 99.02X versus 11.11X recorded by the underlying industry.\n\nIn fact, the industry is currently ranked in the bottom 18% of 251 industries. But does this mean NVIDIA shares have any threat ahead? No. Let’s tell you why?\n\nNVIDIA’s Huge Market Share\n\nNVIDIA is the world leader in AI chip design and software, controlling between 80% and 95% of the market, according to Reuters. Tech giants like Microsoft MSFT, Google GOOGL, Oracle ORCL and Meta META are its clients. Autonomous vehicle companies like Tesla TSLA depend on NVIDIA’s chips. NVIDIA's AI chips, like the H200, are used to train large language models and power inference. Huge demand has been creating shortages of GPUs.\n\nHigh Demand for Next-Generation Blackwell AI Chip\n\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said in an interview with CNBC that demand for the company’s next-generation artificial intelligence chip Blackwell is “insane.” Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said in August that the company expects to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue in the company’s fourth fiscal quarter. Jensen said Nvidia intends to update its AI platform each year to increase performance by two to three times.\n\nThis Year’s NVIDIA Stock Split\n\nFurther, NVIDIA completed a 10-for-1 stock split on June 7, which made its shares more affordable to a wider range of investors, including the ones who make small trades, thereby increasing liquidity and sparking a retail frenzy. Some analysts believe NVIDIA is on track to become the first $10 trillion company.\n\nInside NVIDIA’s Earnings Growth Rate\n\nThe company’s earnings are expected to grow 116.2% in the current year ending in Jan. 2025 versus the 21.5% expected decline in the industry’s growth rate and 15.67% growth expected to be recorded by the S&P 500. The growth rate, forever, is expected to cool next year. Over the next five years, NVIDIA is expected to see a 41.70% growth rate versus 17.80% in the industry. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat Do Analysts Believe Ahead of Earnings?\n\nNVIDIA is expected to report earnings on Nov. 19, 2024. NVIDIA currently has an Earnings ESP of -0.27% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne analyst out of 15 boosted the earnings estimate of NVIDIA for the to-be-reported quarter over the past 30 days and 10 analysts did that over the last 60 days. The earnings estimate for the current quarter is 74 cents, up from 68 cents recorded 60 days ago.\n\nSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.\n\nNVDA Stock Price Target\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 40 analysts, the average price target for Nvidia comes to $149.99. The forecasts range from a low of $90.00 to a high of $200.00. The average price target represents an increase of 22.09% from the last closing price of $122.85, as of Oct. 3, 2024. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVDA ETFs in Focus\n\nIf you are worried about NVIDIA’s negative ESP and still take advantage of the AI boom and prospective high growth trajectory, you can stay invested in the NVDA-heavy semiconductor exchange-traded funds (ETF). The ETF approach minimizes the company-specific concentration risks.\n\nSome NVIDIA-heavy ETFs include Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Grizzle Growth ETF DARP and TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF LRNZ.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Reuters) - Super Micro Computer said on Monday it is currently shipping more than 100,000 graphics processors per quarter and unveiled a new suite of liquid cooling products, sending the AI server maker's shares up about 14% following a weeks-long slump.\n\nA boom in generative artificial intelligence technology has bumped up demand for the hardware required to process the large amounts of data genAI uses, helping Super Micro, which makes servers featuring leading AI chips including Nvidia's.\n\nIt \"recently deployed more than 100,000 GPUs with liquid cooling solution (DLC) for some of the largest AI factories ever built,\" Super Micro said in a statement.\n\nThe company is acclaimed for its liquid cooling technology, which boasts greater power-saving than the air cooling techniques used in some data centers. It is also typically among the first to receive Nvidia's coveted AI chips.\n\nNvidia's shares were up more than 3%.\n\nMonday's rally provides a breath of relief to Super Micro's investors after the stock was slammed by mounting troubles, including Hindenburg Research disclosing a short position in the company last month.\n\nShort interest in Super Micro is just over 20% of its free float, worth about $3.59 billion, market research firm Ortex estimated.\n\n\"If this is related to short sellers trying to buy back shares or not is too early to tell at this point, but at the current price, short sellers are making short-term losses and may choose to close their positions,\" Ortex said, noting this could have added to the stock's gains on the day.\n\nSuper Micro's shares lost more than 9% of their value over the last two weeks, but are still up more than 66% this year, benefiting from a rally in AI-linked shares amid Wall Street's booming \"picks-and-shovels\" trade.\n\nThe company also launched a new range of DLC products, which would enable the \"highest GPU per rack density\", with up to 96 of Nvidia's Blackwell B200 chips per rack.\n\n\"Providing demonstrable solutions will help the company gain market share, especially once the newer Nvidia Blackwell GPUs come to market later this year,\" said Gadjo Sevilla, senior AI and tech analyst for eMarketer.\n\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa, Medha Singh and Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AMD Up on Strong August Semiconductor Sales: Is the Stock a Buy?",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices AMD shares gained 4.94% to close at $170.9 on Friday, following impressive semiconductor sales data for August. \r\n\r\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association reported a 3.5% month-over-month increase and 20.6% year-over-year growth in global semiconductor sales, which hit $53.1 billion, the highest ever recorded for August. \r\n\r\nAMD’s chip peers — NVIDIA NVDA, Intel INTC and Broadcom AVGO — also rose 1.68%, 1.48% and 2.76%, respectively, following the strong sales data. \r\n\r\nIn the past one-month period, AMD shares have appreciated 23.7%, outperforming Intel and NVIDIA’s return of 18.4% and 17.3%, respectively. However, it lagged Broadcom shares, which were up 25.4% over the same timeframe.\n\nOne Month Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStrong August Sales Infuse Confidence Among AMD Investors\n\nThe year-over-year sales percentage growth in August was the largest since April 2022, infusing renewed confidence among investors. Year-over-year growth was strongest in the Americas, with sales jumping 43.9%, trailed by China and Asia Pacific/All Other, sales of which increased 19.2% and 17.1%, respectively.\r\n\r\nAMD has been benefiting from strong sales of its data center chips. Exiting second-quarter 2024, it had more than 900 public cloud instances available, with Netflix and Uber selecting fourth-gen EPYC public cloud instances. In the data center AI business, the MI300 accelerator’s quarterly revenues exceeded $1 billion for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe strong semiconductor sales growth supports 2024 and 2025 prospects, which bodes well for AMD and its chip peers. The World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) projects global sales to reach $611.2 billion, indicating a 16% increase over 2023, up from the previous guidance of 13.1%. \r\n\r\nIDC’s expectations for 2024 semiconductor sales are more optimistic. It expects more than 20% year-over-year growth, primarily fueled by heightened demand for AI chips and recovery in smartphone demand. For 2025, WSTS global sales are expected to grow 12.5%, ultimately reaching $687.4 billion.\n\nRich Partner Base, Acquisitions Aid AMD’s Prospects\n\nEnterprise and Cloud AI customer pipeline remains robust. AMD and its partners, including Microsoft, Oracle, DELL, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro, have instinct platforms in production.\r\n\r\nAMD’s acquisitiveness is aimed at primarily reducing the technological gap with NVIDIA in the ongoing race for AI dominance. It has been on an acquisition spree to strengthen its AI ecosystem. \r\n\r\nIn the past 12 months, AMD has spent $125 million on a dozen of acquisitions. Nod.ai and Mipsology are some other notable acquisitions in the recent past. \r\n\r\nIt recently closed the acquisition of Helsinki, Finland-based Silo AI. AMD is strengthening its data center AI footprint with the announced acquisition of ZT Systems for roughly $4.9 billion in cash and stock.\r\n\r\nAMD’s initiatives to expand its portfolio are making it well-positioned to challenge NVDA not only in the data center market but also in the growing AI-enabled consumer PC market. \r\n\r\nNew offerings like the Instinct MI325X accelerator are helping to expand AMD’s footprint in the data center market. AMD has launched the Ryzen AI 300 Series, the third generation of AMD AI-enabled mobile processors, and Ryzen 9000 Series processors for laptop and desktop PCs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD’s Estimate Revision Shows Upward Trend\n\nAMD expects third-quarter 2024 revenues to be $6.7 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 16% and sequential growth of approximately 15%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2024 revenues is pegged at $6.71 billion, indicating 15.71% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 91 cents per share, up by a penny over the past 60 days, and suggests 30% year-over-year growth.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Quote\n\nAMD Stock is Trading at a Premium\n\nAMD stock is trading at a premium, as suggested by the Value Score of F.\r\n\r\nThe stock is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 8.99X compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 6.15X.\n\nPrice/Sales Ratio (F12M) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, the technical indicator is bullish for AMD as the shares trade above the 50-day and the 10-day moving averages, which indicates robust upward momentum.\n\nAMD Shares Trade Above 50-Day & 100-Day SMA Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nAMD’s expanding portfolio, thanks to acquisitions of Silo AI and ZT Systems, is expected to boost its top-line growth. \r\n\r\nAlthough the weakness in the Gaming segment amid stiff competition from NVIDIA is a headwind, we believe a strong portfolio and expanding partner base justifies the premium valuation.\r\n\r\nAMD currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "title": "Jensen Huang On China Sanctions – 'We're Exporting American Technology Which Is Really Terrific For The U.S.,' Says Government Backs Nvidia",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang recently discussed the problems created by U.S. sanctions against China and how they are harming Nvidia's business. While the tech giant is facing restrictions on exporting its most advanced chips to China, Huang believes that Nvidia's global impact is still a major win for the United States.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\nIn a short interview, Huang shared his thoughts on how his company is balancing national security and technological progress. He emphasized that the U.S. government is doing its best to navigate these tough waters while ensuring that American companies like Nvidia continue to succeed on the world stage.\n\n\"We have to defer all of the policymaking to the administration,\" Huang said, continuing that the administration understands the need to balance national security with the prosperity of American technology.\n\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\n\n“We’re exporting American technology, which is really terrific for the U.S. The world is built on American standards.\"\n\nNvidia, an American company leading the charge in artificial intelligence (AI) chip technology, has been deeply affected by these sanctions. Yet, Huang shared that, “Nvidia is an American company, and our government and the administration would love to see us succeed.”\n\nThe restrictions were put in place to prevent China from using advanced AI chips in its military, which could risk national security. However, these sanctions have also made it harder for Nvidia to sell its most powerful chips, like the H100 and B100, to China, one of its biggest markets, contributing around 17% of its revenue for fiscal 2024.\n\nTrending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\nNvidia launched customized chips, such as the H20, for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. restrictions. The market for these chips hasn’t been as strong as anticipated.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia reportedly had to lower the price of its H20 processor to compete with Chinese firms like Huawei, which produces the Ascend 910B AI chip. Given the challenging market conditions in China, Nvidia’s H20 chip is being sold at a discount of more than 10% compared to Huawei’s offering.\n\nIn addition, China has been pushing domestic manufacturers of AI chips to support the growth of its semiconductor sector. Due to the pressure from Chinese authorities, it is now much more difficult for Nvidia to maintain its market dominance in China.\n\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\n\nBeyond its struggles in China, Nvidia continues to see strong global demand for its AI chips. Jensen Huang recently revealed that demand for the company's next-gen Blackwell GPU platform has been \"insane.\" The Blackwell chips, expected to launch in full production by the fourth quarter of 2024, are projected to deliver 2.5 times the performance of Nvidia's previous Hopper chips.\n\n\"Blackwell is in full production, Blackwell is as planned, and the demand for Blackwell is insane,\" he said on CNBC's Closing Bell Overtime, adding, \"Everyone wants to have the most, and everyone wants to be first.\"\n\nRead Next:\n\nUnlock a $400 billion opportunity by investing in the future of EV infrastructure on this startup already valued at $50 million with just $500. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "content": "Cramer Says 'Hot Money' Flowing From Nvidia, Apple Into China, Focus On Alibaba 'If You Must'\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nJim Cramer is sounding the alarm, but not in the way you might expect. For those bullish on Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Cramer's latest take might be hard to swallow.\n\nHot Money Streaming Out Of Nvidia, Apple\n\nIn a tweet, Cramer said, “The hot money is streaming out of Nvidia and Apple and into China. Let it stream. Do not defend these now. Let this money leave. On China only BABA has actual fundamentals if you must... But let it rain here. Get all of these short Nvidia options and ETFs to play out.”\n\nDon’t Miss Out:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\nThe reasoning? Cramer hints that Nvidia's sky-high valuations and Apple's post-iPhone slump might leave them vulnerable to short-term pain. If you’re holding Nvidia options or ETFs, Cramer believes you might want to ride the short wave.\n\nCramer’s suggestion is a subtle signal that a pullback could be looming, especially as investor sentiment shifts and valuations begin to look more stretched than a Friday-night binge-watch.\n\nThe GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF (NASDAQ:NVD) and the Direxion Daily NVDA Bear 1X Shares (NASDAQ:NVDD) are inverse ETFs positioned to gain on Nvidia stock’s underperformance. Investors in the Direxion Daily AAPL Bear 1X Shares (NASDAQ:AAPD) gain when Apple shares underperform.\n\nTrending: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nOnly Alibaba Has Actual Fundamentals, Says Jim Cramer\n\nMeanwhile, where should the more adventurous traders look? According to Cramer, only one Chinese juggernaut is worth considering amid the capital outflows into China: Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd (NYSE:BABA) (NYSE:BABAF).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe e-commerce giant, despite facing regulatory hurdles, is backed by solid fundamentals. The GraniteShares 2x Long BABA Daily ETF (NASDAQ:BABX) provides leveraged exposure to Alibaba shares. Other ETFs with substantial allocation to Alibaba shares in their portfolio include the iShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ:MCHI) (8.96% Alibaba stock), iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSE:FXI) (9.03% Alibaba stock) and the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (NYSE:KWEB) (11.05% allocation to Alibaba stock).\n\nIf you must dip into the Chinese markets, BABA might be your best bet—just don't expect smooth sailing.\n\nCramer's latest recommendation suggests patience with Nvidia and Apple, letting short sellers have their moment, and keeping a cautious but interested eye on Alibaba's potential for a rebound.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA’s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA’s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in 5th position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock As Its AI Summit Gets Underway? History Says This Will Happen.",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is set to host its 2024 AI Summit starting Oct. 7. The event will bring together leaders from across the industry to see and hear from some of the foremost minds in AI. It's a chance to catch a peek at the future of this potentially revolutionary technology.\n\nWith such a big event upcoming, you might be asking yourself: Should I invest in Nvidia now? History may give us a clue. Let's take a closer look at the company.\n\nNvidia dominates its rivals\n\nThere was a time when Nvidia and its longtime rival, Advanced Micro Devices, were neck and neck in their battle to control the gaming market. By and large, there was parity between both of the company's income statements. That's changed. After AI hit an inflection point in late 2022, Nvidia is dominating AMD, earning more in profits than AMD does in total revenue. Take a look at this chart, which shows just how monumental the recent shift has been. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThat's what you get when you control 90% of a market as valuable as AI silicon. The great news for Nvidia is that it doesn't look like the gravy train will stop anytime soon. The messaging from the rest of big tech, the companies that represent most of its business, is that their spending is likely to accelerate in the near future.\n\nThis is a race of sorts, and none of the big players can afford to be left behind. As Alphabet's CEO, Sundar Pichai, put it in the company's latest earnings call: \"The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here.\" Alphabet expects to spend roughly $50 billion this year in capital expenditures (capex), up from $32 billion the year before -- and it's not alone.\n\nAt present, the bulk of this spending is still flowing through Nvidia as AMD, Intel, and others struggle to match the power and efficiency of Nvidia's chips. There is still enormous demand for its current generation, and the company's next generation will likely ship within the next few months. The massive profits Nvidia has enjoyed means it has large amounts to spend on maintaining its edge. Despite already leading the pack, Nvidia outspent AMD in research and development roughly two to one last quarter.\n\nWhat history has to say\n\nThis will be the third year in a row that Nvidia will host an AI event in this vein. The company began these events in 2022 with a virtual event focused on speech in AI. 2023 was supposed to be the first year of a full-fledged, multi-day AI summit, but the event was moved online for a single day. This year's event will take place in person over three days.\n\nDespite their more modest meeting formats, both of the previous iterations led to a nice bump-up in Nvidia's stock price. In the week that followed 2022's event, shares were up as much as 10%. In 2023, they were up as much as 6.5%. So will this year's conference also lead to a jump in stock price? Maybe.\n\nI know that might be a disappointing answer, but the truth is that we can't know for sure. First of all, two years is a very small sample size from which to draw firm conclusions. Also, even if we had more years to reference, correlation is not causation. Just because two things can be linked -- like an AI summit and a jump in stock price -- doesn't mean one happens because of the other.\n\nBut the event is a chance to remember the power that AI holds. Instead of thinking about possible short-term stock movements, focus on the company's long-term prospects. Don't lose sight of the forest for the trees. This is a company at the top of its game, enabling the adoption of a potentially revolutionary technology.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +21.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 16.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.74 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +85%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.7%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.81 points to a change of +116.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.73 indicates a change of +32.8% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $32.59 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +79.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $124.17 billion and $170.63 billion estimates indicate +103.8% and +37.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $30.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +122.4%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $0.27 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.72%. The EPS surprise was +6.25%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "MakeMyTrip Limited (MMYT) Rose Due to Robust Travel Demand",
        "content": "Artisan Partners, an investment management company, released its “Artisan Developing World Fund” third quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the third quarter, the fund (Investor Class) returned 9.64% compared to 8.72% for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. The Artisan Developing World Fund has returned 149.38% cumulatively, since June 30, 2015, compared to 50.92% for the index. During the quarter, the US labor market's weakness interrupted the steady year-over-year inflation rate improvement, which paved the way for a 50bps interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve at its September policy meeting. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nArtisan Developing World Fund highlighted stocks like MakeMyTrip Limited (NASDAQ:MMYT), in the third quarter 2024 investor letter. MakeMyTrip Limited (NASDAQ:MMYT) is an online travel company, based in Gurugram, India. The one-month return of MakeMyTrip Limited (NASDAQ:MMYT) was 6.39%, and its shares gained 147.07% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On October 4, 2024, MakeMyTrip Limited (NASDAQ:MMYT) stock closed at $99.37 per share with a market capitalization of $10.909 billion.\n\nArtisan Developing World Fund stated the following regarding MakeMyTrip Limited (NASDAQ:MMYT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Top contributors to performance for the quarter included Indian online travel company MakeMyTrip Limited (NASDAQ:MMYT). MakeMyTrip rose thanks to robust domestic travel demand and surprising acceleration in Indian outbound travel despite affordability constraints, while the company’s cost base remains relatively fixed.\n\nThe very nature of our most successful investment outcomes is that they are disproportionate. Thus, having established a degree of permanence, we also have ability to create new pathways for value creation, notably in areas that are underrepresented in the portfolio. We conceive of these pathways as “Blossoms” rather than simply diversification because of their potential to create new avenues for value creation. For example, in July 2023 when Nvidia was in the early stages of its current business trajectory, we used sale proceeds not only to buy correlations but to fund a new investment in MakeMyTrip. Notably, at that time we were not only underrepresented in India but also did not have a single investment in India that we deemed conducive to disproportionate equity outcomes. Since that time, MakeMyTrip has contributed 638bps to portfolio performance. This outcome is significant because it reflects portfolio balance and comes against a backdrop in the most recent quarter of Nvidia consolidation, passport company declines, and relative headwinds to performance from China strength and dollar weakness.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA busy airport terminal with travelers queuing up for flights, revealing the sheer volumes of travelers served by the company.\n\nMakeMyTrip Limited (NASDAQ:MMYT) is not on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 22 hedge fund portfolios held MakeMyTrip Limited (NASDAQ:MMYT) at the end of the second quarter which was 22 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of MakeMyTrip Limited (NASDAQ:MMYT) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

While Nvidia CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang previously got a tattoo to celebrate a company milestone years ago, he didn't add any new ink when the company passed $1 trillion.\n\nDon’t Miss Out:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing.

SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to 3 financial advisors that serve your area in 5 minutes. Each advisor has been vetted by SmartAsset and is held to a fiduciary standard to act in your best interests.\n\nWhat Happened: Shares of Nvidia gained more than 200% in 2023, one of the best returns by a large capitalization stock for the year, helping to add to the wealth of Huang.\n\nThe stock is up over 150% year-to-date in 2024 and, earlier this year, briefly passed Apple Inc and Microsoft Corporation to be the world's most valuable company.\n\nHuang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 and still leads the company today. The soaring stock price helped boost the wealth of Huang, adding $30.2 billion to take his wealth to $44.0 billion in 2023, ranking as the 29th richest person in the world. Today, Huang is the 13th richest person in the world, worth an estimated $107 billion as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nBefore Nvidia hit a $1 trillion market cap, another milestone was hit years ago, with shares passing the $100 level. That level would be reached several times, with shares splitting multiple times since 2000.\n\nTo celebrate the occasion of shares hitting $100, Huang promised company executives he would get the Nvidia logo as a tattoo.\n\nIn a 2017 interview with Fortune, Huang revealed the tattoo and shared more details.\n\n“So, I really want to extend it. I actually kinda do. I would love to. But getting it really, really hurt,” Huang said.\n\nHuang said his family was with him when he got his tattoo.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I was crying like a baby. My kids were with me, and they were like, ‘Dad, you’ve gotta control yourself.'”\n\nHuang mentioned that a semi-annual meeting from years ago was the inspiration behind the tattoo.\n\n“And at one, someone said, ‘What are we gonna do when the stock price hits $100?'”\n\nHuang recalled that others said they would shave their head, paint their hair a new color, get a mohawk and even get a nipple ring.\n\n“So I said, ‘Yeah all right, I’ll get a tattoo.'”\n\nThe first picture that can be found online of Huang’s tattoo comes from the Nvidia Gaming Festival, with a post on Nvidia’s Instagram on Oct. 25, 2014.\n\n“NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsu Huang shows off his NVDIA tattoo at the NVIDIA Gaming Festival,” the post reads.\n\nIt is unknown when Huang got his tattoo, but it doesn’t sound like more will be added to his arms anytime soon.\n\n“Aging gracefully. No more tattoos. It hurts way more than anybody tells you,” Huang said in a 2023 interview.\n\nTrending: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement.

Read them carefully before investing.\n\nInvesting $1,000 in Nvidia Stock: With the date unknown, when exactly Huang got his tattoo, a starting point for when the tattoo was unveiled to the public can be used.\n\nThe Nvidia Instagram post with Huang’s tattoo was shared on Oct. 25, 2014, which fell on the weekend. Shares opened at $18.48 on the following Monday.\n\nA $1,000 investment at the time could have bought 54.11 NVDA shares. Nvidia stock split four-for-one in July 2021 and 10-for-1 in June 2024. This would have turned the initial share count into 2,164.40 shares.\n\nThe $1,000 investment would be worth $268,299.02 today. This represents a potential return of +26,729.9%.\n\nCompare that to a $1,000 investment in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which tracks the S&P 500. A $1,000 investment in the ETF on the same day could have bought 5.11 SPY shares at the time. The $1,000 investment would be worth $2,915.31 today, representing a potential return of 191.5%.\n\nAnother point of reference could have been to buy Nvidia shares after the Fortune interview, which labeled Huang the Businessperson of the Year and made the tattoo more of a storyline for the public.\n\nA $1,000 investment could have purchased 4.67 shares of Nvidia on Nov. 16, 2017, at a price of $214.20. The stock splits would have turned the investment into 186.80 NVDA shares. The $1,000 investment would be worth $23,155.73 today, representing a return of 2,215.6%.\n\nThe same $1,000 invested in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust on the same date could have purchased 3.89 SPY shares, which would be worth $2,219.28.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Hedge Funds Are Bullish On This Momentum Stock Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other momentum stocks.\n\nU.S. Labor Market Remains Resilient\n\nAfter the Fed's rate cut and a positive inflation report, the latest jobs report also showed better-than-expected results. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Elise Gould from the Economic Policy Institute discussed the latest employment data as she highlighted the continued strength of the U.S. labor market.\n\nPayroll employment increased by 254,000 in September, with revisions adding 72,000 jobs from previous months. The unemployment rate remained stable at 4.1% and showed declines among various demographics, especially among men.\n\nGould emphasized that the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is at a 23-year high, which shows a strong economy. Despite wage growth reaching 4%, she downplayed concerns that this could lead to inflation and mentioned improvements in productivity and a low labor share of corporate income.\n\nShe expressed confidence in the labor market's strength and suggested that it may influence the Fed's decisions on interest rates. She also believes that the Fed should normalize rates, which remain high historically given current employment levels.\n\nGould observed that the overall labor market is strong, but not excessively heated, as shown by softer job turnover rates.\n\nEconomic Resilience and Its Impact on the Stock Market\n\nAt CNBC’s Closing Bell, Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel discussed the impact of the recent economic data on the stock market. He noted that while 550,000 jobs were added in the third quarter, wages remained flat, leading to a GDP growth projected at 2.5% to 3%.\n\nSiegel believes that the Federal Reserve will likely implement smaller rate cuts of 25 basis points rather than larger cuts and will aim for a long-term neutral rate of about 3.5% by the second half of next year.\n\nHe expressed optimism regarding the stock market and suggested that the S&P 500 could reach 6,000 by year-end. However, he mentioned that higher yields may present challenges.\n\nDespite concerns about equity valuations appearing high, Siegel pointed out that with cash still abundant and a resilient economy, the market remains attractive. He acknowledged that while the forward earnings ratio for the market is around 21.5x, it is not expensive in the current economic climate. He emphasized the absence of recession indicators and the potential for earnings growth and suggested that while significant market gains may not be expected, there is still room for growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we looked at the October 2 holdings of iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF and narrowed our list to 8 stocks most widely held by institutional investors. The best momentum stocks to invest in are listed in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment which was taken from Insider Monkey's database of over 900 elite hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading company in the technology sector, well known for its work in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence. Originally focused on enhancing the gaming experience, the company revolutionized computer graphics with the release of its GPU in 1999, which significantly improved both video game performance and 3D applications.\n\nOver the years, the company diversified its offerings to include central processing units (CPUs), data processing units (DPUs), and various software solutions for high-performance computing and deep learning. The company now operates in industries ranging from gaming and professional visualization to data centers, automotive, and healthcare. The company tops our list of best momentum stocks.\n\nA major upcoming product from NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the Blackwell line, expected to drive considerable revenue and bring innovations to the industry. With improvements in supply chain conditions, orders for Blackwell products are increasing. CEO Jensen Huang has confirmed that the company is ramping up Blackwell GPU production and aims to begin shipments by the fourth quarter. While some engineering issues may delay certain releases, the company remains on course to scale up production as it moves forward into the next year.\n\nThe company is expected to benefit from significant growth driven by the AI-driven data center expansion. At the GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at around $250 billion, potentially reaching between $1 trillion and $2 trillion over the next decade.\n\nWhile the company will face competition from companies such as AMD and AI accelerators developed by Google, Amazon, and Apple, analysts expect NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) data center market share between 2025 and 2029 to exceed $950 billion. Despite the competition, the company is expected to be the dominant force in the market.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) also recently introduced its new series of multimodal large language models, NVLM 1.0, which performs at the highest level on both vision-language and text tasks.\n\nAccording to the company, it competes with top proprietary models like GPT-4o and open-access ones such as Llama 3-V 405B and also improves on text-only tasks after multimodal training. The model weights and training code are being made open-source through Megatron-Core.\n\nThe model excels in various multimodal tasks, such as following instructions, recognizing humor, reasoning, and solving math problems step-by-step. It uses a hybrid architecture that improves training efficiency and accuracy, along with a unique 1-D tile-tagging design for high-resolution image tasks.\n\nThe company’s LLM stands as a new major competitor in the industry that META and Alphabet dominated.\n\nGeneration Investment Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Recent net performance is behind market averages. However since the fund’s inception, we have spent only about 8% of the time underperforming on a rolling five-year basis.1 We do not enjoy these spells. A number of different factors has contributed to the current period of underperformance. The fact that we do not own NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one. That single company accounted for roughly 25% of returns in the benchmark so far this year, meaning almost everyone who does not own Nvidia has lost out. Year-to-date, not owning Nvidia explains about a third of our relative underperformance.\n\nNvidia is, clearly, an earnings juggernaut. In the past year its revenue has more than tripled, as cloud companies load up on hardware to power AI models. So while its earnings multiple has increased, we are not seeing a repeat of the dotcom mania of the late 1990s. This company’s valuation is backed by cold, hard cash…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best momentum stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Tech war: China advocates use of local AI chips over those from US powerhouse Nvidia",
        "content": "Chinese authorities have informally advised local companies to use domestic-made artificial intelligence (AI) chips over those from Nvidia, according to two sources familiar with the matter, as alternative suppliers on the mainland look to catch up with the US tech giant.\n\nWhile there is no official ban on Nvidia's China-tailored H20 graphics processing unit (GPU), the sources said mainland AI chip users have been informed to prioritise deployment of local alternatives, including those developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nA third source said H20 orders made by mainland enterprises had not been restricted as of August.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nReports about China's tacit rules against the American chip design firm first emerged in May, when US tech media The Information reported that regulators had asked local companies to cut back purchases of Nvidia chips and buy more from domestic suppliers like Huawei. A Bloomberg report last week said that China has called on local buyers to stay away from Nvidia.\n\nThe country's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which oversees the domestic semiconductor and AI sectors, has not made any public announcement regarding that matter. The agency did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nNvidia did not also respond to a request for comment on the reported China restrictions.\n\nNvidia chief executive Jensen Huang presents the company's advanced Blackwell artificial intelligence platform at an event ahead of the Computex trade show in Taipei, Taiwan, on June 2, 2024.

Photo: Reuters>\n\nThe lack of any official confirmation about the matter somehow reflects the highly sensitive nature of the world's AI chip market, which Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co chief executive Hsu Ming-chi has projected to grow annually at a much higher rate than the overall semiconductor industry.\n\nWhen asked about his views on US trade restrictions on China, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang told American media in Washington on September 28 that the US government is \"doing a wonderful job\" in finding the right balance between controls and exporting American technology to the world.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It is really terrific that the world is built on American standards,\" Huang said, \"Nvidia is an American company and our government and administration would love to see us succeed.\"\n\nNvidia's H20 remains popular among users in China, despite its reduced capacity to comply with US sanctions. Sales of the tailor-made chip have steadily picked up since its release earlier this year, as demand from large Chinese cloud services providers enabled them to access Nvidia's technical support and maintenance services.\n\nNvidia is expected to deliver more than 1 million H20 GPUs in China this year, racking up US$12 billion in sales.\n\nState-owned China Telecom is a major user of domestic-made artificial intelligence chips. Photo: Shutterstock alt=State-owned China Telecom is a major user of domestic-made artificial intelligence chips. Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nStill, adoption of alternative Chinese-made AI chips is growing.\n\nState-owned carrier China Telecom, for example, said in a statement on September 28 that it has developed two large language models - the technology behind generative AI applications like ChatGPT - that were trained entirely on locally produced AI chips. While it did not identify the local supplier, China Telecom has a track record of partnering with Huawei.\n\nA week earlier, Huawei had started offering samples of its Ascend 910C processor to large Chinese server companies for hardware testing and configuration, according to a South China Morning Post report. That put the company a step closer to the commercial roll-out of its upgraded version of the 910B, which is on par with Nvidia's popular A100 chips.\n\nNvidia was initially barred from selling its A100 and H100 GPUs - two of the most in-demand chips for training and running AI models - to clients in China in August 2022. It later modified those chips to create the A800 and H800 to get around those restrictions, which Washington barred from being exported to China under tightened curbs announced last October.\n\nNvidia has since developed the H20, L20 and L2 GPUs to maintain its market share in China. Despite several rounds of US restrictions, Nvidia said China was its third-largest market in its financial year ended January 28.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – October 7, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, Netflix NFLX, Nvidia NVDA, Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy and Hold Ahead of Q3 Earnings This Month\n\nToday’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks discusses where the stock market stands as Wall Street prepares for the start of third-quarter earnings season.\n\nThe episode then digs into two of the first major technology stocks set to report earnings in October—Taiwan Semiconductor and Netflix —to see why investors might want to buy the stocks before their upcoming earnings releases and hold for the long haul.\n\nSee the Zacks Earnings Calendarto stay ahead of market-making news.\n\nWall Street sat on its hands on Wednesday and Thursday as it waited for updates on the conflict between Israel and Iran and the dockworkers’ strike.\n\nOctober is a historically weak month during election years, which means investors shouldn’t be surprised if there is more volatility and selling heading into the presidential election.\n\nThankfully, despite partisan politics, Wall Street is largely apolitical in that investors are always looking to make money no matter who is in office. For instance, average annual stock market returns during the Trump and Obama administrations—which included periods of unified and divided governments—were nearly identical: 16.0% and 16.3%, respectively.\n\nThe next major market-mover (not including what might happen in the Middle East or with the longshoremen strike) is almost certain to be the third quarter earnings season.\n\nWall Street knows consumers are under pressure. The Tech and Finance sectors are the only two of the 16 Zacks sectors enjoying positive estimate revisions for third quarter earnings. This backdrop likely puts a lot of pressure on big tech to impress.\n\nThe two stocks we dive into today have soared over the last decade and the past year, and their earnings estimates have greatly improved compared to where they were this time last year.\n\nWhy Taiwan Semiconductor Stock is a Must-Own Tech and AI Investment\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reports its Q3 2024 earnings results on Thursday, October 17.\n\nTaiwan Semi or TSMC is a straightforward long-term investment in technology, spanning data centers, semiconductors, smartphones, artificial intelligence, and the yet-to-be-imagined.\n\nTaiwan Semi physically builds the most advanced chips on the market, boasting clients from Nvidia to Apple. Taiwan Semi is ramping up its industry-leading 3-nanometer production, helping fuel the AI boom. TSMC reportedly grabbed 61% of the semiconductor foundry market in the fourth quarter of 2023, blowing away second-place Samsung’s 14%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semi’s semiconductor foundry-only business model helped TSMC evolve into the most dominant force in an industry that is the bedrock of all modern technology. Taiwan Semi’s moat is growing, and TSMC is addressing geopolitical fears by expanding its manufacturing footprint outside Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan Semi is coming off a beat-and-raise second quarter. TSMC is projected to grow sales by roughly 24% in FY24 and FY25 to soar from $69 billion in 2023 to $106 billion next year. Taiwan Semi is projected boost its adjusted earnings by 25% and 28%, respectively, and its upbeat EPS revisions help it earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy),\n\nTaiwan Semi stock more than doubled the Zacks Tech sector over the last 10 years, including a 73% YTD surge vs. Tech’s 23%.\n\nTSM stock found support at its 21-day moving average and trades 16% below its average Zacks price target. Taiwan Semi stock is also trading at roughly neutral RSI levels despite sitting near its all-time highs.\n\nTaiwan Semi trades at a 34% discount to its 10-year highs at 22.4X forward 12-month earnings and 14% below the Zacks Tech sector—Nvidia trades at 36.6X. TSMC also pays a dividend and its balance sheet is robust.\n\nBuy Netflix Stock Now and Hold the Streaming Giant Forever?\n\nNetflix is set to report its Q3 results on Thursday, October 17.\n\nNetflix revolutionized the entertainment industry. NFLX’s first-in-flight advantage and growing content library have helped it maintain its lead over Apple, Amazon and countless other streaming TV companies.\n\nNetflix’s expansion into live sports (deals with the NFL and WWE), reality TV, blockbuster movies, and more have helped it keep and gain subscribers. Netflix’s lower-cost ad-based tier is also gaining traction.\n\nNetflix added 13.1 million net new paid subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was the most Netflix added in a quarter outside of Q1 2020 when Covid-19 hit. Netflix added 8.1 million net new subscribers in Q2 FY24, up 17% YoY to 277.7 million. Netflix expanded its ads tier membership by 34% quarter on quarter.\n\nNetflix is projected to grow its subscriber base by 14% in the third quarter. The streaming power is expected to boost revenue by 15% in 2024 and 12% in 2025 (adding roughly $10 billion to the top-line vs. 2023). Netflix’s upcoming growth is set to blow away its 2023 and 2022 expansion.\n\nNFLX is projected to grow its adjusted earnings by 59% in 2024 and 19% next year. Netflix’s recent EPS revisions stagnation lands it a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Still, Netflix’s overall outlook for FY24, FY25, and FY26 has surged over the last year.\n\nNetflix shares have soared 1,000% in the last 10 years to triple the Tech sector. Netflix stock has surged 200% the last two years and it finally broke above its 2021 peaks during the last few months.\n\nNetflix stock could break out meaningfully higher if it impresses Wall Street with strong guidance.\n\nValuation-wise, Netflix trades at over a 90% discount to its all-time highs and 50% below its 10-year median at 32.6X forward earnings.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "One of Wall Street's Cheapest Tech Stock-Split Stocks Is Ready to Take Center Stage This Week",
        "content": "For a majority of the last two years, no trend has excited the investing community quite like the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). But in 2024, the euphoria surrounding stock splits has, arguably, played an equally critical role in lifting stock valuations.\n\nA stock split is a mechanism publicly traded companies have available that allows them to adjust their share price and outstanding share count by the same factor. What's worth noting about stock splits is that they're entirely cosmetic. Adjusting a company's share price and share count has no impact on market cap or operating performance.

This is the type of split designed to reduce a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable for everyday investors, and it's almost always undertaken by businesses that are handily out-innovating and out-executing their peers.\n\nIn 2024, more than a dozen prominent companies have announced or completed stock splits, and all but one have been of the forward-split variety.\n\nThis week, one of the cheapest tech stock-split stocks of 2024 will have its moment in the sun as it readies for its first split in nearly a quarter of a century.\n\nAI stock-split stocks have hogged the spotlight for much of the year\n\nWith high-flying stocks often drawing the attention of Wall Street and investors, it should come as little surprise that much of the focus this year has been on artificial intelligence-driven companies completing stock splits. Although Super Micro Computer and Lam Research effected respective 10-for-1 forward splits of their own last week, I'm primarily talking about the buzz AI leaders Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) have created.\n\nNvidia was the first top-tier AI stock to complete a forward split in 2024, with the company's historic 10-for-1 split taking effect after the close of trading on June 7.\n\nThe need for Nvidia to split -- its shares topped $1,200 the day its split went into effect -- is a direct reflection of its dominance in high-compute enterprise data centers. Demand is off the charts for the company's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) and next-generation Blackwell GPU platform, which have sent sales, profits, and gross margin soaring. Nvidia's exceptional pricing power has allowed it to charge between a 100% and 300% premium to competing AI-GPUs.\n\nMeanwhile, Broadcom followed in Nvidia's footsteps five weeks later by completing its first-ever stock split, also 10-for-1, following the close of trading on July 12.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven though Broadcom has a considerably more diverse revenue stream than Nvidia, it's Broadcom's AI networking solutions that have driven investor interest in the company. Broadcom's networking solutions are responsible for connecting GPUs in AI-accelerated data centers in order to reduce tail latency and maximize their computing potential.\n\nBut while Nvidia and Broadcom have been the talk of Wall Street, and are, without question, the highest-profile stock-split stocks of 2024, they're no longer the fundamental bargains they once were. The tech goliath set to complete its stock split later this week certainly fits the definition of cheap. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWall Street's newest tech stock-split stock is a bargain\n\nIn mid-May, consumer electronics juggernaut Sony Group(NYSE: SONY) unveiled plans to conduct a 5-for-1 forward split -- its first split since May 2000. Though the effective date for this split was Oct. 1 in its home market of Japan, it's Oct. 8 for the company's American depositary receipts (ADRs) listed in the U.S. Long story short, when Sony Group opens for trading on Oct. 9, its New York Stock Exchange-listed shares should be closer to $19.\n\nMost consumers are probably familiar with Sony because of its gaming division. The PlayStation 5 is the top-selling ninth-generation video game console and made its debut in late 2020. Even though it's been almost four years since it hit retail shelves, Sony recently increased the price of PlayStation 5 by a double-digit percentage in Japan as a way to boost sales.\n\nWith new gaming consoles typically coming out every six or seven years, excitement is starting to build for Sony's next successor. Though we're still, presumably, at least two years away from the company recognizing sales from its next-gen gaming system, it's not uncommon for investors to somewhat front-run an expected boost in sales and profits.\n\nAdditionally, Sony is enjoying meaningful sales growth from PlayStation Plus. This is the subscription service that allows users to game with their friends, access exclusive games, and store their data in the cloud.\n\nBut the sum of Sony's parts includes more than just gaming. It's also a major player in music, movies, and Imaging and Sensing Solutions (ISS). The latter is particularly important, with Sony being one of the key suppliers of image sensors used in next-generation smartphones. ISS sales surged 21% in the company's fiscal first quarter (ended June 30), with operating income from this segment nearly tripling.\n\nJapan's largest businesses are also known for their capital-return programs -- and Sony is no exception. On the same day its 5-for-1 split was announced, Sony's board authorized the repurchase of up to 30 million shares, representing 2.46% of the company's outstanding count. Buybacks have the ability to increase earnings per share (EPS) for companies with steady or growing net income. Over time, share repurchases can make Sony's stock even more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\n\nLast but not least, Sony Group's stock is reasonably cheap in a generally pricey tech sector. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15 is considerably lower than Nvidia (forward P/E of 30) and Broadcom (forward P/E of 28), as well as the benchmark S&P 500 (forward P/E of 24). With a new console looming and high-margin PlayStation Plus revenue rising, Sony Group has the traits of a cheap stock-split stock that can be bought with confidence by opportunistic long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Sony Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sony Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sony Group wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "There is no company that's benefited more from the artificial intelligence (AI) hype than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nDemand for the company's graphics processing units (GPU), data center services, and compute unified device architecture (CUDA) software have helped propel the stock by an absurd 900% during the past two years.\n\nBelow, I'm going to explore what catalysts I see that could cause Nvidia stock to continue rising while also acknowledging some risk factors that could stymie it. At the end, I'll reveal my final prediction for where Nvidia stock could be headed in 2025.\n\nWhat could cause Nvidia stock to go up?\n\nDuring the past few months, investors gained more insight into the spending plans of many of the technology sector's largest players. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla all acknowledged the need for more AI infrastructure.\n\nRising capital expenditures (capex) from big tech will serve as a tailwind for Nvidia's compute and networking operation. To be more specific, the company's Blackwell GPU introduction is poised to be a major bellwether for Nvidia, and I suspect that big tech will be first in line for these new chips.\n\nNvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang recently said that demand for Blackwell is \"insane,\" while Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said that \"in Q4, we expect to get several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue.\"\n\nBlackwell production into next year, combined with more planned spending from big tech, should bode well for Nvidia. As a result, I would not be surprised to see Nvidia stock rise in 2025. Image Source: Getty Images\n\nWhat could cause Nvidia stock to go down?\n\nOne of my biggest trepidations over Nvidia stems from competition. Although each of the mega cap tech companies referenced above are thought to be some of Nvidia's largest customers, their plans to spend more on AI infrastructure is not all good news for the company.\n\nMany of these tech giants have already started developing their own chips in an effort to move away from their dependence on Nvidia. These moves could have a ripple effect on Nvidia in the form of decelerating revenue and profit growth. As a result, shares of Nvidia could slide.\n\nIt's this particular dynamic that has me curious about why big-name hedge funds such as Ken Griffin's Citadel and David Shaw's D. E. Shaw have been trimming their Nvidia positions. Even amid the backdrop of the Blackwell launch, so-called smart money hedge funds seem to be taking profits on Nvidia stock.\n\nI think that part of the selling activity is influenced by the fact that with each passing earnings report, expectations are becoming higher for Nvidia. Gauging the success of the Blackwell launch is pretty subjective. Even if these new GPUs help generate further record growth for Nvidia, investor expectations may be disconnected from reality.\n\nStory continues\n\nSubsequently, both individual and institutional investors could punish the stock, and Nvidia shares could witness a sharp sell-off.\n\nMy prediction for Nvidia's 2025 price action\n\nI know this may come across like I'm trying to avoid making a firm prediction, but I think Nvidia stock is going to wind up being little changed in 2025. There are several factors that could inspire additional buying and selling of Nvidia stock next year, yet I do not find any of these material enough to cause an annual gain or decline.\n\nWhat I would be thinking about is if Nvidia stock could rise by another 900% over the next year or even 10 years. In my eyes, I firmly think the answer is \"no.\" So, although there probably is good money to be made owning Nvidia stock in 2025, I think timing is going to be a big factor here.\n\nHowever, as a long-term investor, I try to avoid timing stocks and instead look for quality businesses that can post consistent gains over the course of many years.\n\nCan Nvidia continue doing that? Maybe. But for me, I think there's a good chance that Nvidia stock has peaked, and that it's best days are entering the rearview mirror.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) The Best Morgan Stanley Overweight &amp; Quality Stock?",
        "content": "We recently made a list of Morgan Stanley’s Best Overweight & Quality Stocks: Top 25 Stocks. In this piece, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks on the list of the top overweight and quality stocks.\n\nThe close of September has cemented the paradigm shift on Wall Street. With the Federal Reserve’s first interest rate cut being all that investors could hope for as it reduced rates by 50 basis points, since the cut, the flagship S&P stock index and the broader NASDAQ stock index are up by 2% and 3%, respectively. The rate cut has also now moved Wall Street’s focus to the next big catalyst for the stock market, i.e, the third quarter earnings season.\n\nFor a market that has touched new highs this year due to artificial intelligence, the second quarter earnings season was nothing short of fireworks. It saw the AI narrative wobble temporarily after mixed results from the world’s leading AI GPU designer and the semiconductor industry reckoned with the fate of the semiconductor manufacturing stock that ranked 5th on the list of Jim Cramer’s Top 12 Must-Watch Stocks.\n\nStarting with the chip maker, its second quarter earnings were nothing short of a bloodbath. They saw the firm’s non GAAP net income drop by a whopping 85% annually and turn a year ago GAAP net income into a non GAAP loss of $1.6 billion. At the same time, its gross margins dropped by 0.4 percentage points, and in the worst example of the cherry on top, the firm also announced that it will be suspending dividends starting from the fourth quarter. As a result, its shares tanked by 30% after the earnings, and since then, we’ve seen multiple reports claim that other companies are interested in acquiring it.\n\nAs for the GPU designer, its second quarter revenue jumped by 122% – a no small feat considering that the year ago quarter’s revenue was $13.5 billion. However, even as the Q2 revenue of $30 billion beat analyst estimates of $28.7 billion which was fueled by its AI data center division’s revenue jumping by 154% annually, the shares fell by 6% in extended trading. At the heart of the fall was a tepid third quarter guidance of $32.5 billion (analyst estimates were $31.77 billion), a gross margin miss by 0.1 percentage point, a Q3 margin guidance miss by 0.5 percentage points, and the delay of its Blackwell GPU to the fourth quarter. For investors already worried about the ability of AI to generate a profit, the margin miss in particular wasn’t comforting. Consequently, since the earnings report, the firm’s shares are down by 1%.\n\nHowever, investment bank Morgan Stanley sent the GPU designer’s shares soaring by 6.8% in September in a bullish note that shared that the firm could earn $10 billion in its fourth quarter alone from the latest Blackwell chips. This upgrade came on the back of MS remaining consistent in its analysis of the stock market this year. The key themes that it has identified are the labor market, commercial real estate, and the split in the stock market between large and small cap stocks.\n\nIn July, the bank shared that there was “ample room for equities performance to broaden, but this requires a cyclical recovery.” In simpler terms, it means that MS believed that for small cap equities to catch up to large caps in performance, the economy has to perform well. If you’re wondering how wide this gap is, data shows that for small and medium cap and large cap stocks which are in the top 20% in terms of free cash flow margins, the small and mid caps have a forward price to earnings ratio of 0.74x relative to large caps as of April 2024, which is quite low when compared to the April 2009 peak of 1.62x. MS reiterated this belief in its August report, which shared that small cap outperformance “requires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates. While recent inflation data and the resulting decline in rates was a lift to small cap, softer economic data may constrain its continued outperformance.”\n\nHowever, MS’ September report took somewhat of a different tune. It focused on the clean energy and infrastructure investments in the US to share that these could help some segments of the American stock market that are typically dependent on growth in economic activity. Government spending through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and the CHIPS and Science Act have led to roughly $500 billion in commitments by the private sector to invest in a diverse set of areas ranging from roads, to clean energy manufacturing and heavy industry.\n\nAs per the bank, “Government policies such as the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the Infrastructure Act are sponsoring growth in many areas of U.S. manufacturing. These trends could offer through-the-cycle structural support to areas of the economy that are traditionally very cyclical.” On the data front, MS reveals that while in 2022, US manufacturing capacity as a percentage of 2017 output sat at ~126%, this has jumped to nearly 129% as of 2024.\n\nShifting gears, the third quarter earnings season will soon start to shape how investors view the market. Data from LSEG shows that the flagship S&P index is expected to deliver 5.4% annual earnings growth during Q3. FactSet is more cautious, as it shares that the index should grow earnings by 4.6% annually to mark its sixth straight quarter of growth. MS is of the view that the economy has to continue to deliver on the data front if the stock market is to perform well.\n\nIn a recent podcast, the bank’s chief investment officer and chief strategist, Mike Wilson, shared that “the unemployment rate will need to decline and the payrolls above 140,000 with no negative revisions to prior months. Meanwhile, I am also watching several other variables closely to determine the trajectory of growth. Earnings revision breadth, the best proxy for company guidance, continues to trend sideways for the overall S&P 500 and negatively for the Russell 2000 small cap index. Due to seasonal patterns, this variable is likely to face negative headwinds over the next month.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of Morgan Stanley’s best Overweight and quality stocks, we ranked the bank’s recent list of 66 stocks with Overweight ratings, a higher than median quality score, and one month upward EPS revisions by their percentage one month average analyst revisions. The average EPS data was sourced from Yahoo Finance as of September 26th 2024, and the top 25 stocks with non zero percent revisions were selected.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nNiloo / Shutterstock.com\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 179\n\nAverage Analyst EPS % Revision: 4.2%\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the GPU designer that has led the surge in Wall Street surrounding artificial intelligence. Its GPUs are the mainstay of the AI industry, as they are the most advanced in the world for computing AI workloads. Additionally, another key to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s meteoric rise is its GPUs’ ability to power accelerated computing which enables heavy duty non AI workloads to be processed faster despite the physical limitations of CPU manufacturing. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also allows GPU users the ability to control their chips to a greater extent through CUDA, and its success depends on maintaining market dominance. As long as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s GPUs are needed by most companies, and no viable rivals or alternatives exist, the firm can continue to grow. Morgan Stanley believes that the firm is capable of generating $10 billion in revenue in Q4 alone courtesy of its Blackwell GPUs due to strong competitive advantages.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“More recently, however, we’ve entered the period of doubts and questioning, some of which is real and normal in the first stages of a new paradigm, and some of which is prompted by short sellers. Given the explosive returns of NVIDIA and other AI leaders, AI bears and fear mongers have been comparing the current AI market winners with the internet bubble of the late 1990s/early 2000s, and NVIDIA’s stock move today with Cisco’s back then. First, while many stocks were trading at nosebleed valuations and on made up metrics (such as price per eyeballs) before the bursting of the internet bubble, as we’ve said many times, the internet proved to transform our world and create the digital age we are now living in. Second, while NVIDIA’s stock price inflection has been nothing short of unprecedented for a company of its size, it was fueled almost entirely by explosive growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows– not multiple expansion. Over the last 12 months, NVIDIA’s stock has effectively tripled, but its forward P/E multiple has remained essentially flat, because NVIDIA blew away Wall Street expectations despite being covered by over 60 sell-side analysts, who have increased their forward projections every single quarter. In my career, the only comparative analogue is when Apple first introduced the iPhone and stunned Wall Street with its growth. In contrast, most of Cisco’s move in the late 1990s was due to multiple expansion. At its peak, Cisco traded at a P/E ratio over 130 times, more than quadruple its five-year average of 37 times. At the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA traded at a P/E ratio of 40 times, equal to its five-year average, and at a P/E to growth (or PEG) ratio for 2025 of 0.8 times, as consensus expectations are for NVIDIA to grow earnings per share 40% next year.\n\nMoreover, investor concerns have arisen about the financial impact AI is having and whether surging capital expenditures (capex) across the technology landscape, particularly the large cloud players (Microso, Google, Amazon, and Meta), known as the hyperscalers, will be justified and earn reasonable returns on invested capital (ROIC). First, the adoption and penetration of new technology typically traces a classic S-curve–or more precisely, in our view, a series of S-curves or phases. For at least the past year and a half, we’ve been in what might be called the AI infrastructure- build phase – building the AI factories, as NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has articulated it, and this phase has been dominated by the infrastructure- layer players – the accelerated computing chips suppliers like NVIDIA and Broadcom, as well as data center, cloud infrastructure and energy companies. The hyperscalers, other enterprises, and sovereign entities investing ahead understand that if you want to be in the AI game, you must invest now – build the infrastructure, build the factories – or else you’ll find yourselves disrupted on the sidelines or playing catch up in the biggest game, the most important race in a technology generation. Only those who invest today even have the chance to be the winners of the future.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th when we look at Morgan Stanley's top overweight stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The S&P 500 has historically pulled back 5% to 10% around election time but tends to recover afterward.\n\nInstead of cashing out, investors are encouraged to take advantage of any market pullbacks. Historically, when the Fed cuts rates without an impending recession, it creates a favorable environment for broader market performance. Mona Mahajan, Edward Jones senior investment strategist, recently appeared on CNBC to discuss her similar sentiment on these latest market trends, and where investors can find opportunities right now. We talked about this in our article about the 10 Best WallStreetBets Stocks To Buy Right Now, here's an excerpt from it:\n\n“When asked if investors should consider cashing out and taking a holiday for the remainder of the year, Mahajan advised against such a move. Instead, she suggested that if there are pullbacks or corrections in the market, it would be prudent to lean into those opportunities... Additionally, rate cuts typically lead to expanded valuations, particularly for sectors that have lagged behind in this regard. She emphasized that lower borrowing costs from Fed rate cuts would benefit both consumers and corporations.\n\nIn terms of investment strategies during potential downturns, she recommended focusing on cyclical sectors such as utilities and industrials while also maintaining exposure to technology and the artificial intelligence sectors. Mahajan underscored that diversification would be key over the next 12 to 18 months.”\n\nGlobal Investment Strategist at ProShares Advisors, Simeon Hyman, appeared on CNBC on October 2 to emphasize 'income' as a key focus, highlighting the opportunity in fixed-income markets, which could provide 10-15% returns if geopolitical tensions worsen. He thinks that the US economy is stronger than the rest of the world despite tensions.\n\nSimeon Hyman emphasized the importance of the term 'income' in the context of current market conditions, noting that the market was just 1% off its all-time highs. This situation presents a salary cut for income-oriented investors, highlighting the challenges they face. However, the fixed-income market offers a silver lining; it currently provides enough yield to cushion against worsening geopolitical tensions. For instance, the yield on the 10-year bond is nearly 4%, and there is potential for it to drop to 3% or lower if significant negative events occur. This scenario presents an opportunity for investors to realize gains of 10% or 15% on bonds in a tumultuous environment, a situation not seen in over a decade.\n\nDespite the current market being down by 3.7%, which is slightly less than 4%, Hyman insisted that rounding was at play. He expressed surprise at this performance given ongoing geopolitical tensions but pointed out that positive economic news in the US persists. Specifically, there has been a 50-basis point cut and indications of a soft landing for the economy. A month-over-month increase of just 0.1% suggests that if one can overlook geopolitical issues, the US economy is faring better than many others globally and remains on solid economic footing.\n\nAdditionally, Hyman proposed a covered call strategy focused on the Russell 2000 index, which has been underperforming compared to the S&P 500. He described this strategy as beneficial because it allows investors to generate income that could offset recent losses while maintaining a bullish position in small caps. Historically, rate cuts have positively impacted small-cap stocks, and this strategy enables investors to capitalize on that trend while also generating income through covered calls.\n\nFor risk-averse investors, the current emphasis on fixed-income markets as a viable investment option aligns well with the insights shared by Simeon Hyman, who highlighted the potential for 10-15% returns in bonds amid geopolitical tensions. Additionally, they may also explore quality stocks with reliable growth histories, which can provide stability in uncertain market conditions, similar to the defensive strategies Hyman suggested. As investors try to track stock performances to find strategies, we're here with a list of the 10 Best Quality Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list, we first sifted through Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF holdings to find the ones with an upside potential of over 15% as of October 4, 2024. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their analysts' upside potential.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 22.10%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is known for its high-performance GPUs, which are widely used in gaming, artificial intelligence, data centers, and professional visualization. Its GPUs are essential for powering advanced graphics and computing tasks, and they are a key component in many modern technologies, such as self-driving cars, virtual reality, and supercomputers.\n\nThe company recently partnered with Accenture. Management recently talked about this partnership and its new AI chip, Blackwell. Blackwell is now being made in large numbers, and there is a lot of demand for it. AI will help businesses innovate faster through the partnership with Accenture. In late August, management also approved a $50 billion share buyback program.\n\nNetApp released a new AI tool on September 25 that uses NVIDIA technology to help businesses manage their data. Elon Musk's company, xAI, is using 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for its AI project, Colossal. Colossal may grow to use H200 GPUs and Blackwell chips in the future.\n\nIts networking platform for AI, Spectrum X, is expected to be worth billions of dollars within a year. The company recently partnered with Salesforce to help businesses use AI and data better. In September, the company also introduced a new AI tool called Aerial to improve wireless networks for mobile devices, robots, self-driving cars, and 5G.\n\nIts software called CUDA gives it an advantage over competitors. However, the company's future depends on continuing to innovate and find ways to make money from AI. CUDA is a tool that helps developers use GPUs for different kinds of computing. Experts think the company should focus more on robotics to grow.\n\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) – Following the release of first-quarter earnings in May featuring record revenue growth of 262% year over year, NVIDIA continued its upward march. On June 10, shares of the company began trading on a split-adjusted basis following a 10-for-1 forward stock split, making stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors alike. Just one week later, the company officially surpassed Microsoft in market cap to become the most valuable publicly traded company (although it would relinquish the title not long after). While other companies have also stood to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) trend this year, NVIDIA stands out as the unquestionable leader in the space and that is unlikely to be challenged for many years ahead. NVIDIA continues to see extremely strong levels of demand and the recent introduction of the Blackwell system looks to be an exciting next phase of growth for the stock.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the best quality stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI Superstars According to Goldman Sachs.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nUS technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk.\n\nWhile tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nThis has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave — particularly in software and cloud services.\n\nStory continues\n\nTheir scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants.\n\nLet's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry.

William Blair analysts Sebastien Naji and Jason Ader recently released an investor note on the AI landscape, placing the chipmaker among the top picks for large cap generative artificial intelligence companies. The note detailed that the company had already seen tremendous growth for its GPU and parallel computing systems, and there was time for continued growth, driven by robust training demand from hyperscalers and enterprises, and a ramping inference opportunity. Per the analysts, Nvidia had also created a sustainable moat as its CUDA software stack was the standard interface for working with GPUs and AI, and there was room for growth in both training and inference as the new Blackwell cycle began.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang expects billions of dollars in revenue from Blackwell sales in the coming months. Blackwell is expected to cost between $30,000-$40,000 per unit and is in demand from major companies like Microsoft and Meta, as well as other firms building AI data centers to power products like ChatGPT and Copilot. Huang recently called Blackwell demand insane during an appearance on CNBC.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.

(NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 108\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) operates as a semiconductor manufacturer. Lisa Su, the CEO of the firm, is set to appear at an upcoming AI event hosted by the chipmaker that will outline the future growth plans. Su has been a driving influence at the company as it transitions into an AI powerhouse. Previous history suggests that she is up to this task. When Su took over the company in 2014, the stock was at $3. In the decade since, it has climbed to above $170. The increase is attributable to the focus on manufacturing of central processing units (CPUs) used in laptops and PCs, and graphics processors used in gaming consoles and now AI clusters. AMD recently closed the purchase of Xilinx and the $1.9 billion acquisition of data center networking company Pensando.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is seeking to rival NVIDIA in the manufacture of GPUs. So far, the MI300X chip of the company competes with the H100 chip of NVIDIA in terms of power and efficiency, but AMD still lags behind NVIDIA when it comes to more advanced chips like the H200, as well as Blackwell. Su recently told Time that the chipmaker wants to become a high-performance computing leader.\n\nOverall AMD ranks 10th on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nPower demand from infrastructure technologies in the US is expected to more than double by 2030 thanks to use of AI, according to consulting firm McKinsey & Co.\n\n\"Because of how much more power we're going to need —if the projections are accurate to power data centers — to power AI applications, Vernova is definitely a winner,\" he added.\n\nOne Wall Street analyst dubbed the $72 billion company the \"supermarket\" for the electric power industry — from natural gas turbines used to generate electricity to servicing of power plants, modernizing electric grids, and building wind turbines.\n\n\"This company does everything,\" Raymond James managing director Pavel Molchanov told Yahoo Finance in an interview this week.\n\n\"Because the buildout of electric power infrastructure is an all-of-the-above story, that means all of these solutions are going to be needed,\" he added.\n\nVernova's reach is global, with roughly 30% of its revenue stemming from the US. Some of its biggest competitors, like Siemens Energy, Schneider Electric, and ABB, are based abroad.\n\nVernova expects to deliver 70 to 80 heavy-duty gas turbines per year in 2026, up from roughly 55 for the last few years. Servicing those units is also expected to grow substantially.\n\n\"We're seeing increasing demand for power generation, driven by manufacturing growth, industrial electrification, EVs, and emerging data center needs,\" Vernova CEO Scott Strazik said during the company's latest earnings call over the summer.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe recent deal between software giant Microsoft and nuclear power provider Constellation Energy (CEG) to restart a reactor at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island is one recent example of the growing energy demand among Big Tech.\n\nThe partnership has made Morgan Stanley analysts more bullish on the prospects of gas-powered plants adjacent to data centers.\n\n\"We believe a co-located data center and gas-fired power plant utilizing GEV's gas-turbine equipment could be announced in 2025,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Percoco wrote in a note last week.\n\nThe analyst reiterated an Overweight rating and increased his bull case scenario price target on the stock to $397 from $371.

If that sounds a little bit like certain other AI-related companies that people are familiar with, well, that’s not a coincidence,\" said Molchanov.\n\nCalling the AI-fueled rally \"overstretched,\" the analyst and his team downgraded the stock from Outperform to Market Perform based on valuation. Much of the enthusiasm over AI is already baked into Vernova's share price, he said.\n\n\"The bottom line is that we think the stock could use a period of consolidation after its sentiment-driven gains, and we look forward to revisiting our rating if and when the trade becomes less crowded,\" he said.\n\nThe stock has 19 Buy, six Hold, and two Sell analyst recommendations.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Is This Company an \"Nvidia Killer?\" What to Know About Cerebras' IPO",
        "content": "Conventional wisdom is that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) will continue to dominate the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, as it has since the introduction of ChatGPT. Yet, there's a barrage of competition coming not only from merchant competitors and cloud giants producing their own in-house accelerators but also from AI chip start-ups.\n\nOne such start-up, Cerebras, just filed a prospectus ahead of an impending initial public offering (IPO). After reading, I think Cerebras is a name every Nvidia investor should monitor closely. But is it really a threat to the graphics processing unit (GPU) giant? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat is Cerebras?\n\nCerebras was founded in 2016 by current CEO Andrew Feldman and a group of technologists who had founded and/or worked at a company called SeaMicro over a decade ago. SeaMicro made efficient high-bandwidth microservers and was later acquired by Advanced Micro Devices in 2012.\n\nCerebras sold its first AI chips in 2019 and has recently seen a big acceleration in demand, leading to this recent IPO filing.\n\nCerebras' giant chip\n\nCerebras' big differentiator is that its AI chips, which it calls wafer-scale engines (WSEs), are huge. And by huge, we're talking a chip that takes up an entire semiconductor wafer. A foundry usually produces many chips per wafer, some of which have defects and are discarded. But Cerebras goes for one giant chip per wafer.\n\nThe result is a massive processor 57 times larger than an Nvidia GPU, with 52 times more compute cores, 880 times the on-chip memory, and 7,000 times more memory bandwidth. One Cerebras WSE has a remarkable 4 trillion transistors -- that's 50 times the 80 billion transistor count of Nvidia's H200! Like Nvidia, Cerebras' chips are produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\n\nThe theory behind making a giant chip is that by doing more processing on the chip, the WSE does away with the need for the Infiniband or Ethernet-based networking connections that string hundreds or thousands of GPUs together. According to Cerebras, this architecture allows WSEs to achieve over 10 times faster training and inference than an 8-GPU Nvidia system.\n\nIn a recent interview, Feldman said recent tests showed Cerebras chips were 20 times faster for inference than Nvidia's. Sound impressive? When Feldman was asked at a summer conference how much market share Cerebras planned to take from Nvidia, he answered, \"All of it.\"\n\nFinancials show a big acceleration\n\nNot only does Cerebras talk a big game, but it's also shown impressive revenue acceleration and improving profitability this year, as you can see:\n\nStory continues\n\nCerebras (Nasdaq: CBRS) H1 2023 H1 2024 Hardware revenue $1,559 $104,269 Service revenue $7,105 $32,133 Total revenue $8,664 $136,402 Gross profit $4,378 $56,019 Operating profit (loss) ($81,015) ($41,811)\n\nData source: Cerebras S-1. H1 = first half of the corresponding year.\n\nAs you can see, between the first half of 2023 and the first half of 2024, Cerebras' revenue jumped a whopping 1,474%. While gross margin technically declined, from 50.5% to 41.1%, that was mainly because virtually all of last year's revenue came from higher-margin services. Cerebras' hardware gross margins actually went up over that time. Even better, operating losses narrowed by $40 million, a great indication that the company will be profitable if it scales.\n\nThat exponential scaling should continue into next year. According to the filing, Cerebras' largest customer, Abu Dhabi's G42, agreed to purchase $1.43 billion of equipment through the end of 2025. That's sixfold growth over the current 2024 run rate.\n\nRisks to the Cerebras story\n\nThere are a couple of risks to the Cerebras story, however. One is that producing one massive chip can lead to lots of defects. Whereas Nvidia or any other chipmaker can throw out all the bad chips on a wafer, Cerebras has to take the whole thing, opening its WSEs to imperfections.\n\nTo get around this, Cerebras says it has created \"redundant\" cores and interconnects on its chips, as Cerebras assumes many chips will have defects. \"Flaws are designed to be recognized, shut down, and routed around,\" the filing says.\n\nHowever, building redundancy also means Cerebras can't get all the potential the surface area of its chip could otherwise get. Obviously, management believes the \"big chip\" architecture more than makes up for this inefficiency.\n\nA second risk, and likely the biggest, is Cerebras' customer concentration. Right now, AI company G42 from the United Arab Emirates accounts for 87% of Cerebras' sales in the first six months of 2024. G42 and affiliated entities are also behind next year's $1.43 billion order, meaning that concentration will only grow.\n\nConcentration is somewhat expected in the early stages of a company's growth. But should anything go wrong with the relationship or G42 itself, it could seriously derail Cerebras' plans. G42's close affiliation with a foreign government -- the UAE's national security advisor is the company's founder and largest shareholder -- certainly poses a risk should there be a geopolitical flare-up.\n\nCerebras is one to watch\n\nWhen it goes public, Cerebras will be a new AI player on the block and will probably sell for a high valuation. So, investors should be cautious about how much they pay for the stock when it comes to market.\n\nNevertheless, the company has a differentiated architecture from the rest of the pack. Therefore, it's certainly worth watching whenever it goes public -- especially if you're a big Nvidia or AMD shareholder.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA): Hedge Funds Are Bullish On This NASDAQ Stock Right Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Performing NASDAQ Stocks in 2024.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other great performing NASDAQ stocks.\n\nMarket Expectations for the Year-End\n\nFed's recent cut has resulted in significant outperformance in the tech sector, signaling a positive sentiment among investors. Tech stocks are thriving in this lower interest rate environment, which has contributed to a broader market rally. The strength of small-cap stocks and cyclical sectors was noticeable even before the reduction, suggesting that market confidence was building. Analysts expect ongoing growth driven by advancements in AI, which continues to be a key theme influencing investor behavior.\n\nThe occurrence of rate cuts while markets are at record highs raises important questions about potential volatility. Historically, markets have shown resilience and often continue to rise even when rate cuts occur near market peaks. This suggests that much of the current optimism may already be reflected in stock prices. The recent rate cut is generally viewed as a preventive measure rather than a direct response to economic weakness, which could further enhance consumer confidence and spending.\n\nTowards the end of September, RaeAnn Mitrione, Investment Management Partner at Callan Family Office, appeared in an interview and highlighted significant market developments following the Fed’s unexpectedly larger-than-anticipated rate cut. We covered this in detail in our article on the 7 Cheap Technology Stocks To Buy Right Now, here's a short excerpt from it:\n\n“...Mitrione emphasized that the market is reacting favorably to lower interest rates, particularly benefiting the tech sector... Pointing at a chart, Mitrione remarked that it is unusual to see rate cuts while markets are at record highs, raising questions about potential volatility ahead. Historically, even when rate cuts occur near market peaks, stocks often continue to rise. Much of this positive sentiment has been priced in due to prior indications of the rate cut. She explained that the economy remains strong, and the rate cut serves as a preventive measure rather than a reaction to economic weakness. This supportive environment could enhance consumer confidence and spending, further improving market performance.”\n\nOn September 28, DataTrek Research co-founder, Nick Colas, joined an interview on CNBC to discuss the trading day and highlight that the tech rally will have to wait until year-end. As September ended, the S&P 500 saw a remarkable increase of 20% year-to-date. In light of this performance, market participants began revisiting the post-Fed rate cut playbook following the initial easing. Nick Colas noted that one of the most encouraging aspects of September is that the market has not experienced a decline, which is typically expected during this month known for its volatility. Instead, the S&P had risen by 1.6% so far in September, demonstrating resilience despite some initial choppiness, which is particularly noteworthy given September's historical reputation for turbulence.\n\nAs Colas noted, on the macroeconomic front, positive indicators are emerging. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model has revised its Q3 growth estimate upward to 3.1%, signaling that the economy is performing well. Additionally, gasoline demand has increased by 6% year-over-year, reflecting strong consumer activity. Initial jobless claims reported recently also show a solid performance, falling below the three-year average. These data points support the mid-cycle playbook employed by DataTrek, suggesting that the economy is continuing to progress without any significant cracks or fissures in its foundation.\n\nDespite these positive trends, questions remain about whether the market can sustain its momentum without new positive catalysts. Colas pointed out that historically, price-to-earnings multiples and stock prices tend to rise together as long as there are no major negative catalysts to disrupt the economic recovery. This correlation indicates that investor confidence remains intact and is likely to persist through the remainder of the year. Furthermore, as the market approaches traditionally strong months following elections, there are expectations for a potential old Santa Claus rally in December.\n\nHowever, with the volatility index elevated at around 17 and geopolitical tensions looming, especially as elections approach, investors are likely to remain cautious. Over the past two years, the NASDAQ 100 has surged approximately 67%, marking a significant recovery since its lows in October two years ago. This performance is substantially above the historical average return of around 25%. Colas emphasized that while such returns are impressive, they do not yet indicate speculative excess; historically, a doubling of the NASDAQ over two years would signal potential trouble for investors.\n\nLooking back further, Colas noted that since peaking before the bear market in November 2021, the NASDAQ 100 has only risen about 20% over three years. This suggests that there may still be room for growth compared to prior bubbles when returns were much more pronounced within shorter time frames.\n\nThe ongoing rotation away from technology stocks has been observed recently, with cyclical sectors and financials performing well. Colas believes this trend may continue for now, with a potential resurgence in tech stocks expected closer to November and December as year-end approaches. Investors appear to be favoring cyclical sectors at present, which offer more immediate upside opportunities.\n\nWhile there are challenges ahead, the current economic indicators suggest a robust environment for continued growth in equities as long as investor confidence remains high and no major negative catalysts emerge to derail progress. Despite a recent rotation away from tech stocks, the market remains resilient, with the potential for a tech resurgence as we approach year-end, setting the stage for a bullish outlook for both tech and the NASDAQ in the coming months.\n\nWhen optimism about economic conditions or technological advancements rises, tech stocks typically perform well, boosting the NASDAQ.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe used stock screeners to look for companies listed on NASDAQ that were trading over $10 billion. We then selected the top 10 NASDAQ stocks with the best year-to-date performance and that were also the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their year-to-date performance.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nYear-to-Date Performance as of October 2: 136.26%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading player in the semiconductor industry that designs and manufactures GPUs for the gaming, data center, and professional visualization markets. Its GPUs are widely used for rendering graphics, accelerating AI applications, and powering HPC workloads. The company has also expanded into other areas, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality.\n\nThe company holds ~80% of the global market share in GPU semiconductor chips. In the second fiscal quarter of 2025, the company achieved a remarkable 122.40% year-over-year revenue growth. Data center revenue surged 54% year-over-year, fueled by robust demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers accounted for approximately 45% of data center revenue.\n\nCollaborations with healthcare institutions and the growing demand for AI-driven diagnostic solutions have fueled this robust financial performance. In late August, management also approved a $50 billion share buyback program.\n\nOn September 25, NetApp introduced a new AI-powered data solution utilizing NVIDIA technology, enhancing its unified storage operating system and benefiting thousands of enterprises. Elon Musk's xAI launched Colossal is powered by 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Colossal is expected to expand with H200 GPUs and potentially Blackwell chips. Despite challenges in product launches and GPU pricing, NVIDIA's focus on AI monetization and sustainability positions it for long-term growth.\n\nAlthough CUDA software provides a competitive edge, the company's future relies on continued innovation and effective AI monetization. CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and API that allows developers to utilize the power of GPUs for general-purpose processing. Market analysts anticipate a shift toward robotics for the company's growth. Management forecasts low-double-digit billion AI revenue this year.\n\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) – Following the release of first-quarter earnings in May featuring record revenue growth of 262% year over year, NVIDIA continued its upward march. On June 10, shares of the company began trading on a split-adjusted basis following a 10-for-1 forward stock split, making stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors alike. Just one week later, the company officially surpassed Microsoft in market cap to become the most valuable publicly traded company (although it would relinquish the title not long after). While other companies have also stood to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) trend this year, NVIDIA stands out as the unquestionable leader in the space and that is unlikely to be challenged for many years ahead. NVIDIA continues to see extremely strong levels of demand and the recent introduction of the Blackwell system looks to be an exciting next phase of growth for the stock.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best performing NASDAQ stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "What's up with the economy? Insights from Walmart's CEO",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nI have never been a monthly jobs report guy.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nThe first Friday of each month, the government releases its non-farm payrolls report — as it did this past Friday, where we saw a surprisingly strong gain of 254,000. As soon as the report hits the newswires, we (media + investors) tear apart each line to get a sense of what's happening in the economy. These days the report is really used to try and predict the direction of Fed policy.\n\nAfter the initial reading frenzy, we aim to put context around it and see how it applies to the companies powering the stock market. By later in the afternoon, we shuffle along to the next market-moving story. If you are an investor, that probably means obsessing over Nvidia's (NVDA) daily price swings.\n\nBy Saturday, the jobs report is a distant memory. By Monday, it's ancient history.\n\nThe hoopla over a single data point has always seemed a bit much, especially since I've long wondered if it truly captures the real health of the economy. This thing is always revised up and down. (The prior two months were revised higher by 72,000 jobs!)\n\nIn recent years, I've rolled with the punches — reported on the numbers, asked execs about it, and tried to keep it in mind as I browse the grocery aisles.\n\nBut I still question its usefulness and accuracy, and so am forever looking for better insights into the economy.\n\nTo that end, here's the byproduct of that pursuit.\n\nThis week, I spent two days in Bentonville, Ark., meeting with the Walmart (WMT) team and walking stores. The final day concluded with an interview with its veteran CEO, Doug McMillon.\n\nI first interviewed Doug in 2017 when he was still early in his CEO tenure (he started in 2014). He appeared to be the same guy I initially met — deep thinker, fiercely competitive, and passionate about retail and Walmart's mission to save people money.\n\nWalmart may offer the best insight into the US economy, especially as its improved assortment and online marketplace is sucking in high-income shoppers and profit. Its stock is up more than 50% this year versus rival Target's (TGT) 4.3% gain.\n\nHere's my economic exchange with Doug:\n\nSozzi: How challenged is the average Walmart shopper?\n\nMcMillon: People at lower income levels are always more challenged. They have to make trade-off decisions, and that's been, I think, more acute since this inflationary cycle on the heels of the pandemic. So, a household income below $100,000 feels pressure in a way that they might not have a few years ago, and you can see that in their behavior. And we are trying to get prices down ... some of the more stubborn inflation has been in the prepared foods, dry grocery type, consumable categories, like paper goods, cleaning supplies.\n\nStory continues\n\nSozzi: Do you see prices coming down and beginning to ease?\n\nMcMillon: The rate of inflation is less. But after a couple of years of inflation in dry grocery and consumables, they're settling out at a higher level, and we at Walmart don't want to accept that. We want to keep finding ways to be more efficient to get them back down. And we're not seeing those categories come down in the short term.\n\n(I normally don't take pics with executives, but Doug's office is the original one used by Sam Walton, who I'm told used to keep a shotgun behind the door — he was a nature guy). Walmart CEO Doug McMillon (right) shares his views on the retailer and economy from inside his office in Bentonville, Arkansas with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi (left). (Brian Sozzi)\n\nAfter I got off the plane from Arkansas, I headed into the office to get ready for an Opening Bid podcast taping with my favorite chief economist Michelle Meyer from Mastercard Economics Institute (previously Bank of America). You can watch the full episode in the above video.\n\nMichelle has access to a wealth of data on the economy and consumer, notably how people are spending on their credit and debit cards (she's forecasting a very solid holiday shopping season).\n\nHere's an interesting economic takeaway from our chat:\n\nSozzi: Why is the labor market slowing?\n\nMeyer: Think about pre-pandemic. If we got 250,000 jobs [each month], it would be like, oh my God, that's a statistical error. Like, how did the Bureau of Labor Statistics report that? Because the belief prior to the pandemic — and that's given the data we had seen in the labor market — trend job growth was probably in the order of 100,000, give or take a few in either direction.\n\nSo we in a way had this period of volatility in the labor market when we went from the extreme amount of job dislocation when the pandemic hit to this massive rehiring and reengagement in the workforce. Now we have to settle into something that should be more sustainable and probably more moderate as well.\n\nThe jobs report is probably useful, but I hope this piece is a reminder that there are more ways to get a clearer sense of the economy. Find them, and prosper.\n\nRewind\n\nLast week on this digital canvas, I recommended you go out and read three books on AI to become a more informed investor (and dare I say, human being). A reader subsequently asked me to shed light on the best books related to AI.\n\nSo, I tapped my vast network of sources in the AI industry for their suggestions. The interesting thing is I was told not many great books existed yet (somewhat worrisome?) on the technology, more so online technical white papers.\n\nHere are a few that will take you the weekend (if not longer) to get through:\n\nWhat Is ChatGPT Doing … and Why Does It Work? by Stephen Wolfram What’s Really Going On in Machine Learning?

        "title": "Nvidia's CEO Says Demand for Its New Chips Is \"Insane.\" Is It Time to Buy the Stock?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best performing stocks the past few years, as demand has skyrocketed for its graphics processing units that help build out artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\n\nThe company is used to seeing high demand for its products, so it was noteworthy when in a recent CNBC interview, CEO Jensen Huang called demand for chips based on its new Blackwell architecture \"insane.\"\n\nLet's take a closer look at Huang's comments and what it could mean for the stock.\n\n\"Insane\" Blackwell demand\n\nBlackwell is the newest architecture for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). The company introduced it earlier this year, saying it was the world's most powerful chip and that it would help customers run their real-time generative AI large language models (LLMs) at much lower cost and energy consumption than its predecessor chips.\n\nHuang told CNBC that after an initial delay due to a minor design flaw that affected manufacturing, Blackwell is in full production and going as planned.\n\nHe then explained why the company decided to accelerate the pace of its innovation cycle to once a year, saying that if it can increase performance by two to three times each year, it will increase revenue and decrease costs and energy consumption for its customers each year.\n\nUndoubtedly this will also benefit Nvidia. It will keep it in the lead in a fast-moving technology, while also maintaining high demand and pricing power. The company already announced its next GPU architecture, called Rubin, scheduled for 2026.\n\nAt an estimated cost of $30,000 to $40,000 per chip, having \"insane\" demand for Blackwell bodes very well for the company. When it introduced the technology, it said that a number of leading tech companies were already set to adopt Blackwell, including Alphabet, Amazon,Dell, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla, and xAI. That's a lot of large companies fighting over Nvidia's latest GPUs. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDemand is unlikely to slow\n\nBased on the actions of Nvidia's customers, it does not appear that demand for its GPUs is likely to slow down anytime soon.\n\nFor example, Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison was asked on the company's second-quarter earnings call whether the demand for computing power would slow if there is a transition from AI training to AI inference. He replied that there was likely no end in sight over the next five to 10 years for demand as companies battle for AI technical supremacy. His company, for example, plans to double its own capital expenditures (capex) for fiscal 2025, which ends next May.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet and Meta Platforms said there's more risk by underinvesting in AI infrastructure than by overinvesting. Both companies are spending heavily on AI-related capex, with Meta already saying it expects its 2025 budget to be significantly higher than in 2024.\n\nCloud computing leaders Amazon and Microsoft are pouring money into data centers to keep up with AI demand, while start-ups OpenAI and xAI are spending a boatload of money to develop more-advanced AI models.\n\nThis race for more sophisticated AI models is creating the need for exponentially more computing power to train them. That power is provided by GPUs, which most likely were designed by Nvidia.\n\nFor example, Meta says its Llama 4 LLM would likely need 10 times the GPUs as its predecessor Llama 3, while xAI's Grok-3 AI model requires five times as many GPUs to be trained as Grok-2 needed.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\n\nAll of this points to a need for a lot more GPUs in the future. In the world's race for more and more computing power, no company is in a better position than Nvidia. Besides the domination of its chips, there's the wide moat created by its CUDA software, which long ago became the de facto platform to program GPUs.\n\nAt the same time, the stock is still reasonably priced despite its parabolic performance the past few years. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of about 31 based on next year's analyst estimates, and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of 0.87, the stock is attractively priced given the demand that appears to still be ahead for its GPUs. A PEG under 1 is usually viewed as undervalued, and growth stocks will often have PEGs well above 1.

        "title": "Do NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Earnings Warrant Your Attention?",
        "content": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA's Improving Profits\n\nStrong earnings per share (EPS) results are an indicator of a company achieving solid profits, which investors look upon favourably and so the share price tends to reflect great EPS performance. Which is why EPS growth is looked upon so favourably. It's an outstanding feat for NVIDIA to have grown EPS from US$0.41 to US$2.16 in just one year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. This could point to the business hitting a point of inflection.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The good news is that NVIDIA is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 28.8 percentage points to 62%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of NVIDIA's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.\n\nAre NVIDIA Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of NVIDIA, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$120b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\n\nIs NVIDIA Worth Keeping An Eye On?\n\nNVIDIA's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, NVIDIA is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. You still need to take note of risks, for example - NVIDIA has  2 warning signs  (and 1 which can't be ignored)  we think you should know about.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Nvidia, Microsoft, SoftBank, and Cathie Wood's Ark Invest Are Betting Big on This AI Startup",
        "content": "OpenAI was founded in 2015 by a team of researchers and entrepreneurs which included Sam Altman, Peter Thiel, and Tesla Chief Executive Offficer Elon Musk. It was established as a not-for-profit research organization with a mission to develop artificial intelligence (AI) technology that benefits all of humanity.\n\nOpenAI planned to raise $1 billion through donations to achieve its research and development goals. After only taking in $130.4 million in donations during its first few years, the organization decided to create a new subsidiary in 2019 which was capable of generating capped profits to attract investors instead.\n\nSince then, OpenAI has developed some of the world's most advanced AI models, which are at the foundation of its ChatGPT chat bot application. Now, OpenAI wants to extend its leadership in the AI industry by fully committing to a for-profit structure, and it just accepted a whopping $6.6 billion in new investment from the likes of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), SoftBank (OTC: SFTB.Y), Cathie Wood's Ark Invest, and more. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe shift to a for-profit AI powerhouse\n\nThis isn't the first mega-capital raise OpenAI has closed. Shortly after opening its capped-profit subsidiary in 2019, it entered a strategic partnership with Microsoft that included a $1 billion cash injection. The two companies agreed to collaborate on AI development, with a specific goal to help expand the AI capabilities of Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform.\n\nThen, at the beginning of 2023, Microsoft said it would invest a further $10 billion, spread across several payments over time.\n\nSince the deal terms were never fully disclosed -- and given OpenAI's current structure -- it's unclear whether Microsoft received an equity stake for its money. But it was widely reported that Microsoft would be entitled to 49% of OpenAI's future profits, if and when it's able to generate any.\n\nThe $6.6 billion capital raise that OpenAI just completed, however, could involve equity. According to Reuters, the participating investors will receive convertible notes, which are a debt instrument, and they will convert into equity after OpenAI officially establishes a \"public benefit corporation.\" It's a corporate structure that will let OpenAI make money while maintaining its social mission.\n\nThe investors in this latest round (according to The Wall Street Journal and Business Insider) include:\n\nNvidia, which invested about $100 million. Cathie Wood's Ark Venture Fund, which invested a reported $250 million. SoftBank, which invested $500 million. Microsoft, which invested less than $1 billion. Thrive Capital, which invested a reported $1.25 billion, with an option to invest a further $1 billion next year if OpenAI meets a specific revenue target. MGX, a venture firm backed by the United Arab Emirates. Altimeter Capital, which is run by veteran tech investor Brad Gerstner. Tiger Global. Fidelity. Khosla Ventures.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere is no guarantee that OpenAI can make the shift to a for-profit enterprise\n\nThe establishment of the for-profit entity is subject to approval from the board that oversees OpenAI's nonprofit arm. Typically, due to the nature of convertible notes, the investors would be entitled to their money back if the transition fails to proceed.\n\nPlus, the nonprofit arm owns the intellectual property (IP), which includes all of the AI models and infrastructure that led to ChatGPT, and the formation of a for-profit entity can't leave the nonprofit side worse off (legally speaking). In other words, even if investors own equity in the new for-profit corporation, it's unclear whether they will own a stake in any of the actual IP or anything else that makes OpenAI so valuable.\n\nOn Oct. 3, CNBC reported that OpenAI was granted a $4 billion line of credit from a collection of banks including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and more. That will give the start-up a buffer if it runs into any issues with its equity transaction.\n\nOpenAI is growing like a weed\n\nChatGPT has about 350 million monthly active users. Most of them use it for free, but a small fraction pay a subscription of $20 per month for early access to new features, higher file limits, and more message tokens. OpenAI also licenses its AI models (like GPT-4) to developers, who can use them to create their own AI software applications in exchange for a fee.\n\nOpenAI is reportedly poised to generate $3.7 billion in revenue in 2024. Considering its recent capital raise values the company at $157 billion, that places it at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 42.4 -- in other words, it's even more expensive than Nvidia.\n\nHowever, OpenAI expects its revenue to grow by a whopping 213% to $11.6 billion in 2025, and according to its long-term forecast, its revenue could top $100 billion per year by 2029. If it hits those targets, its current valuation won't look so bad in hindsight.\n\nHowever, OpenAI will require a significant amount of capital to get there. Reports suggest it will have a loss of $5 billion this year, which means the $10 billion in combined funding it's about to receive from investors and banks will barely last two years.\n\nCan regular investors buy shares in OpenAI?\n\nNot yet. OpenAI is a private company, so it can choose which investors it wants to work with. Accepting large sums of money from a small number of backers is much easier than offering slivers of the company to millions of smaller investors. Plus, having partners like Nvidia and Microsoft on board as equity holders creates important synergies, as I highlighted earlier.\n\nBrad Gerstner from Altimeter Capital says the start-up's next move should be an initial public offering (IPO), which would let regular investors participate in its future success.\n\nFor now, one way investors could gain exposure to OpenAI is by purchasing shares in Microsoft, Nvidia, or even SoftBank. This strategy isn't perfect because those companies are so big that their investment in OpenAI won't move the needle much even if the start-up is wildly successful from here.\n\nAs a result, investors who want to get involved directly might have no choice but to wait.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Prediction: These 2 Stocks Will Join Nvidia, Meta, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft in the Trillion-Dollar Club by 2030",
        "content": "Getting to a $1 trillion market cap is such a challenging milestone that only a handful of corporations have done it. The list includes several tech giants, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Though this elite club is highly exclusive, more companies will eventually join it. Stocks that are headed that way might be worth serious consideration. Let's look at two: Visa(NYSE: V) and Novo Nordisk(NYSE: NVO). These companies could be trillion-dollar stocks by 2030.\n\n1. Visa\n\nVisa runs one of the largest payment networks in the world, helping facilitate millions of daily credit card transactions. The company has delivered excellent returns during the past decade as cash transactions continue to be replaced by other payment forms. Visa's market cap is just under $550 billion as of this writing -- so it needs a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 10.5% to become a trillion-dollar company by the end of 2030. That's well within the company's powers. For one, Visa has performed much better than that during the past decade. V Total Return Level Chart\n\nOf course, that doesn't guarantee the company will deliver the same returns in the future, but some of the underlying factors that led to such solid performances in the past for the business are still in place. Visa remains a leader in its industry, with its only true noteworthy competitor being Mastercard(NYSE: MA). Visa still benefits from network effects: The more people carry credit cards that bear its logo, the more attractive its ecosystem becomes to merchants, and vice versa. That helps ensure that it will remain a major player in this industry for a while.\n\nVisa also still has plenty of room to grow. Credit card penetration is relatively high in many developed countries, but not so in others. In developing countries, there is even more potential. Visa sees a $20 trillion opportunity across a range of payments it can capture. The company's revenue of about $35 billion in the trailing 12-month period is a tiny percentage of that total. If Visa can make headway in its addressable market, the company's revenue, earnings, and stock price should move in the same direction they have during the past 10 years.\n\nThe company is well-equipped to deliver a CAGR of more than 10.5% through 2030.\n\n2. Novo Nordisk\n\nAs of this writing, Novo Nordisk's market cap is about $400 billion. To hit $1 trillion, it would need a CAGR of about 16.5%. That would be an impressive average to maintain for six years, but Novo Nordisk has been more than impressive recently. Brand names like Wegovy and Ozempic have become famous. Both are GLP-1 medicines that treat obesity and diabetes, respectively. Novo Nordisk has been one of the pioneers in the GLP-1 weight loss market, which is now attracting pharmaceutical companies left and right.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome analysts estimate that the weight loss drug market will hit $150 billion by the early 2030s -- it was worth just $24 billion last year. And although there will be plenty of challengers, Novo Nordisk's pipeline in this field is second to none. The company's most promising programs include an oral medicine called amycretin, and CagriSema, which some have estimated could generate as much as $20.2 billion in revenue by 2030.\n\nThat barely scratches the surface of Novo Nordisk's pipeline, though. Semaglutide (the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic) is being tested in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, two areas with high unmet needs. The company is developing several other diabetes and obesity medicines, and a range of treatments for various rare diseases. Novo Nordisk's revenue has grown rapidly during the past five years, as have its stock price and market cap. NVO Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nThe drugmaker should earn important approvals during the next few years, which will help it continue generating excellent financial results through the end of the decade. Becoming a trillion-dollar stock by 2030 is well within Novo Nordisk's reach, and it should continue beating the market beyond that.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Before They Soar as Much as 215%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Over the past few years, there's been a resurgence in the popularity of stock splits. The practice was commonplace in decades past, but had fallen out of favor, only to rebound in recent years. Companies will typically embark on this course after years of strong business and financial results, resulting in a surging stock price.\n\nEvidence suggests that the strong performances that precipitated stock splits tend to continue. Companies that conduct stock splits deliver stock price gains of 25%, on average, in the year following the announcement, compared with average increases of 12% for the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bank of America analyst Jared Woodard.\n\nHere are three stock-split stocks that still have a long runway ahead, with upside of as much as 215%, according to select Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Broadcom: Implied upside 36%\n\nThe first among our stock-split stocks that represents a compelling opportunity for investors is Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). The company offers a host of software, semiconductor, and security products that run the gamut in the mobile, broadband, cable, and data center spaces.\n\nIndeed, the company reports that \"99% of all internet traffic crosses through some type of Broadcom technology.\" This means that Broadcom's technology will be instrumental in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe company's recent results are telling. In Broadcom's fiscal third quarter (ended Aug. 4), revenue jumped 47% year over year to $13 billion, driving adjusted earnings per share (EPS) up 18% to $1.24. The company continues to integrate VMWare, which has pressured earnings, but management is expecting a more meaningful contribution in fiscal 2025. Broadcom also increased its full-year revenue guidance to $51.5 billion, which would represent growth of nearly 44%.\n\nThe company's track record of solid, consistent growth led to a 10-for-1 stock split in July. The stock has more than tripled since the start of 2023 -- which coincided with the onset of the AI revolution -- but many on Wall Street believe the best is yet to come. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann maintains a buy rating on Broadcom stock and a Street-high, split-adjusted price target of $240. This represents potential upside for investors of 36% compared to Friday's closing price.\n\nMosesmann suggests that management's guidance is conservative, leaving the potential for upside revisions. He sees particular opportunities in Broadcom's application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and ancillary products that support networking and switching, which will see increased AI-related demand. He also posits that the integration of VMWare will boost Broadcom's results.\n\nStory continues\n\nMosesmann isn't alone in his bullish prediction. Of the 39 analysts who rated the stock in September, 35 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nInvestors might be surprised to learn that Broadcom stock trades for less than 28 times next year's expected earnings, which I believe is a bargain, considering its long track record of growth and expansive opportunity.\n\n2. Nvidia: Implied upside 85%\n\nThe second stock-split stock with a long runway ahead is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard for a variety of applications, including video games, cloud computing, and data centers. This technology is also instrumental in processing generative AI, providing the computational horsepower that makes it possible.\n\nThis has, in turn, fueled blockbuster results for Nvidia. For its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), Nvidia delivered record quarterly revenue that climbed 122% year over year to $30 billion, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) soared 168% to $0.67. The results were propelled higher by the company's data center segment -- which includes the chips used for AI -- as revenue surged 154% to $26.3 billion.\n\nThat marked Nvidia's fifth consecutive quarter of triple-digit sales and profit growth, while its stock has risen 754% since the start of 2023, leading to a 10-for-1 stock split. The stock has been on a roller-coaster ride in recent months, first losing more than a quarter of its value, then staging a remarkable recovery, and now sits less than 8% off its all-time high.\n\nThere's likely more to come -- but don't just take my word for it. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated his buy rating and Street-high price target of $200 on Nvidia, which represents potential gains of 60% compared to Friday's closing price.\n\nThe analyst believes investors are missing an important element of Nvidia's success, saying: \"The real narrative lies in the software that complements all the hardware goodness. We anticipate this software aspect will significantly increase in the next decade in terms of overall sales mix, with an upward bias to valuation due to sustainability.\"\n\nHe isn't the only one who believes Nvidia has further to run. Of the 60 analysts who issued an opinion in September, 55 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nI don't have any doubts about the potential for Nvidia stock to go higher from here. In fact, I think the analyst's price target might well be conservative.\n\n3. Super Micro Computer: Implied upside 215%\n\nThe last of our trio of stock split stocks is admittedly the most controversial. Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro, has been a leading provider of custom-designed servers for more than 30 years.\n\nThe company's secret weapon is the building-block architecture of its rack-scale servers. By designing interlocking major components, Supermicro customers can create the system that's best suited to their specific needs -- and price range -- rather than simply taking something off the \"rack.\" The company is also a clear leader in the area of direct liquid cooling (DLC), which is uniquely suited to handle the rigors of AI. CEO Charles Liang estimates that Supermicro controls between 70% and 80% of the DLC market.\n\nIn its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended June 30), Supermicro generated record revenue that climbed 143% to $5.3 billion. At the same time, the company delivered adjusted EPS that jumped 78% to $6.25. While declining profit margins raised eyebrows, Liang blamed a temporary bottleneck of component parts and product mix for the decline and expects a rebound in due course. That said, the company's track record of strong results preceded a 10-for-1 stock split, which was completed earlier this week.\n\nSupermicro has become a battleground stock in recent weeks, however. In late August, a short report by Hindenburg Research alleged accounting irregularities, sanctions violations, and undisclosed third-party transactions, among other accusations. The following day, Supermicro delayed the filing of its annual report, citing a need to assess the \"design and operating effectively of its internal controls.\" If that weren't enough, a report emerged suggesting the U.S. Justice Department was investigating the company, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nDespite the resulting uncertainty, some on Wall Street are undeterred. In the wake of these revelations, Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann maintained a buy rating and a split-adjusted Street-high price target of $130 on the stock. That represents potential upside of 215% compared to Friday's closing price. The analyst suggests the recent stock price correction \"seems over the top when considering the Hindenburg dynamic as old news or inaccurate.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, others on Wall Street have taken a \"wait and see\" approach. Of the 18 analysts who covered the stock in September, nine still rate the stock a buy or strong buy. The rest recommend holding, and none recommend selling.\n\nAs a short seller, Hindenburg Research has a vested interest in driving the stocks it targets lower, so its motives are suspect. Furthermore, it has a mixed track record, so its conclusions shouldn't be considered gospel.\n\nFor investors with the stomach for a little risk, I think the opportunity of owning Supermicro stock outweighs the risk represented by the -- as yet -- unsubstantiated claims by a short seller. And as a Supermicro shareholder, my money is where my mouth is. Finally, at just 21 times earnings, Supermicro stock is a bargain.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence boom has sent shares and net worths to new heights this year, meaning some billionaires have only been getting wealthier.\n\nWhile most eyes have been on AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and its CEO Jensen Huang, some of his fellow tech billionaires have also seen their net worths grow as their companies invest more in the technology.\n\nHere are four billionaires getting even richer this year thanks to AI.\n\nJensen Huang Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at the Bipartisan Policy Center on Sept. 27, 2024, in Washington, DC. - Photo: Chip Somodevilla (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia founder and chief executive Jensen Huang has seen his net worth skyrocket during the AI hype due to demand for the company’s AI chips, which power some of the world’s leading AI models.\n\nHuang’s net worth has climbed $63.5 billion so far this year to $107 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The majority of Huang’s net worth comes from his 3.5% stake in Nvidia, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAccording to the Forbes Billionaires List, Huang’s real-time net worth was $108.6 billion as of Friday afternoon.\n\nIn September, Nvidia rejoined the $3 trillion market-cap club during an uptick in its shares, adding about $2.3 billion to Huang’s net worth.\n\nEver since shares of Nvidia reached an all-time high in June, the chipmaker’s stock has experiencedsometurbulence. However, the company’s shares have climbed around 158% so far this year, and compared with a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up over 180%.\n\nIn June, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple in total market cap and crossed the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. Weeks later, Nvidia overtook both Apple and Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable public company. Despite since falling back into third place, Nvidia remains the most valuable semiconductor company in the world. In February, it became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after reporting record fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nMichael Dell Dell CEO Michael Dell at the 2013 Oracle Open World conference on September 25, 2013, in San Francisco, California. - Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) founder and CEO Michael Dell has seen his net worth gain $31.6 billion so far this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The majority of Dell’s $110 billion net worth comes from his stake in the computer company of which he owns about half, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe company’s shares have risen about 58.4% so far this year. In March, Dell beat analysts’ earnings expectations in its fourth-quarter results, which were driven by demand for AI optimization in its server business.\n\n“Our strong AI-optimized server momentum continues, with orders increasing nearly 40% sequentially and backlog nearly doubling, exiting our fiscal year at $2.9 billion,” Jeff Clarke, Dell’s vice chairman and chief operating officer, said in the company’s earnings report.\n\nClarke said Dell is only at the start of its venture into AI and believes it’s “uniquely positioned with our broad portfolio to help customers build GenAI solutions that meet performance, cost and security requirements.”\n\nIn August, Clarke said that Dell’s “AI momentum accelerated” during the second quarter and that the company has “seen an increase in the number of enterprise customers buying AI solutions each quarter.”\n\n“AI-optimized server demand was $3.2 billion, up 23% sequentially, and $5.8 billion year to date,” Clarke said about the second quarter.\n\nAccording to the Forbes Billionaires List, Dell’s real-time net worth was $104.9 billion as of Friday afternoon.\n\nMark Zuckerberg Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 31, 2024, in Washington, D.C. - Photo: Alex Wong (Getty Images)\n\nMeta (META) founder Mark Zuckerberg has seen his net worth soar $78.1 billion so far this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Friday, Zuckerberg surpassed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as the world’s second-richest person, according to Bloomberg.\n\nZuckerberg’s net worth reached $206 billion — just $1 billion above Bezos’s $205 billion. According to the Forbes Billionaires List, Zuckerberg is the third-richest person in the world, with a real-time net worth of $204.3 billion as of Friday afternoon.\n\nShares of Meta have climbed around 69.5% so far this year. The company’s stock jumped 5% in July after it announced second-quarter earnings results that beat expectations.\n\n“We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. “We’ve released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we’re driving good growth across our apps.”\n\nLarry Ellison Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison at the Rebels With A Cause Gala on October 24, 2019, in Los Angeles, California. - Photo: Phillip Faraone (Getty Images)\n\nIn September, Oracle (ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison saw his net worth surpass that of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, making Ellison the second-richest person in the world.\n\nEllison’s real-time net worth was $206.8 billion as of Friday afternoon, according to the Forbes Billionaires List. The Oracle executive chairman is the fifth-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nOracle’s shares have climbed around 62.7% so far this year due to its cloud businesses. Ellison owns just under 40% of Oracle’s outstanding stock, according to Forbes.\n\n“As Cloud Services became Oracle’s largest business, both our operating income and earnings per share growth accelerated,” Oracle CEO Safra Catz said in a statement after Oracle’s first-quarter earnings results.\n\nThe company’s total quarterly revenues in USD were up 7% from the previous year, while its revenues were up 8% in constant currency, it said. In its cloud services division, Oracle’s revenues in USD were up 12% year-over-year, while the company was up 22% in constant currency.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia's AI summit, Tesla's robotaxi, Amazon Prime Day, inflation: What to watch in the markets this week",
        "content": "Last week closed on a positive note, with two key developments easing concerns about the economy. A strong jobs report helped calm fears of a weakening labor market, while the resolution of the dockworkers’ strike alleviated worries about supply chain disruptions. In addition, oil prices, which had surged early in the week due to Middle East tensions, saw a welcome pullback by the weekend.\n\nThis week promises to be action-packed, with plenty on the horizon. With this wave of optimism, let’s dive into what the coming week has in store.\n\nThree-day Nvidia AI summit\n\nNVIDIA’s AI Summit kicks off Monday, running from Oct. 7-9 in Washington, D.C. The three-day event will bring together industry leaders to explore how AI can tackle some of society’s biggest challenges. With a focus on healthcare, cybersecurity, manufacturing, and more, the summit will highlight AI’s potential to drive innovation across key sectors.\n\nAmazon’s two-day Prime Day sale\n\nAmazon’s (AMZN) highly anticipated two-day Prime Day sale event kicks off Tuesday, offering a valuable glimpse into consumer behavior and e-commerce trends. The sale will provide key insights into what products shoppers are prioritizing, as well as into the broader state of consumer demand. This event is expected to highlight popular categories and pricing strategies and could serve as a bellwether for the coming holiday shopping season.\n\nAmazon’s recruitment strategy is partly driven by expectations that e-commerce spending will surpass overall holiday sales in the fourth quarter. The company’s Prime Day event earlier this year generated over $14.2 billion in online sales, marking one of the biggest e-commerce events of the year.\n\nMusk will finally unveil robotaxi\n\nTesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk will finally unveil the highly anticipated Robotaxi on Thursday at Warner Bros. Studios (WBD) in Los Angeles, California. Dubbed “We, Robot,” the event will show the first look at the prototype and the booking platform for owners and riders. There will be also an update to the company’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, which powers the robotaxis, along with a production timeline and the service launch date.\n\nBeginning of the financial giants’ earnings\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) is set to report its earnings ahead of the closing bell Tuesday. Then, Thursday, Delta Air Lines (DAL), Infosys (INFY), and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) are scheduled to release their earnings before the market opens. The week will close with major banks taking center stage Friday, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), BlackRock (BLK), and the BNY Mellon (BK) lead off the quarterly earnings season for the financial sector.\n\nInflation data due this week\n\nThe Consumer Credit report for September is set to be released Monday. Midweek (on Wednesday), investors will keep an eye on the Wholesale Inventories data for August, along with the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s September FOMC meeting, which could provide insights into the central bank’s next moves.\n\nThursday will bring a trio of key data releases, including initial jobless claims, the consumer price index (CPI), and core CPI, offering a detailed look at inflation and labor market trends. Finally, on Friday, the producer price index (PPI) and core PPI will be released alongside preliminary consumer sentiment data for October, rounding out the week with a comprehensive view of inflationary pressures and consumer outlooks.\n\n– Francisco Velasquez contributed to this article\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Palantir Stock vs. Nvidia Stock: Wall Street Says Sell One and Buy the Other",
        "content": "PalantirTechnologies(NYSE: PLTR) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are two of the hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks on Wall Street. In fact, with year-to-date returns of 132% and 150%, respectively, they rank among the five best-performing components of the S&P 500.\n\nHowever, Wall Street expects the stocks to move in opposite directions over the next year.\n\nAmong the 23 analysts who follow Palantir, the median price target is $27 per share, which implies 32% downside from its current share price of $40. Among the 65 analysts following Nvidia, the median price target is $150 per share, which implies 20% upside from the current share price of $125.\n\nFurthermore, Palantir is the most overvalued stock in the S&P 500 based on the difference between its current price and median price target. Meanwhile, according to FactSet Research, Nvidia ranks among the most highly recommended stocks in the S&P 500 in terms of its percentage of buy ratings.\n\nSuffice it to say Wall Street is overwhelmingly bearish on Palantir but very bullish on Nvidia. Here are the most important details for investors.\n\nPalantir Technologies: 32% downside implied by the median price target\n\nPalantir has deep roots in counterterrorism and clandestine military operations. The company spent its earliest days building analytics software for federal agencies in the U.S. intelligence community. But it has since expanded its customer base to include international governments and commercial organizations.\n\nPalantir's data operations platforms, Foundry and Gotham, let customers incorporate data and machine learning models into analytical applications that improve decision-making. And its AI platform, AIP, allows commercial and government clients to use large language models and generative AI within Foundry and Gotham.\n\nSome analysts have lauded Palantir for its sophisticated technology. For instance, it was a top-ranked vendor in Dresner Advisory Services' 2024 market study on artificial intelligence, data science, and machine learning platforms. Forrester Research recently recognized its leadership in AI and machine learning platforms.\n\nOther analysts are less impressed. Gartner scored Palantir below a dozen other vendors in data integration capabilities, citing overreliance on consulting services. That means some clients find Palantir's software so complex that they struggle to use it independently. Gartner also omitted Palantir in its latest report on data science and machine learning platforms.\n\nPalantir reported second-quarter financial results that exceeded expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 27% to $678 million, the fifth consecutive acceleration in sales growth. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income increased by 80% to $0.09 per diluted share. And management provided better-than-expected guidance for the third quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe only real problem with the stock is its valuation. Wall Street expects Palantir's earnings to increase at 21% annually through 2026. That estimate makes the present valuation of 125 times adjusted earnings look absurdly expensive. As mentioned, Palantir is the most overvalued stock in the S&P 500 based on the discrepancy between its median price target and current price.\n\nSo, either Wall Street analysts have grossly underestimated Palantir, or shares are headed for a significant correction in the future. Either way, investors can save themselves a lot of trouble by avoiding Palantir stock right now, and shareholders should at least consider trimming their positions.\n\nNvidia: 20% upside implied by the median price target\n\nNvidia is best known for inventing graphics processing units (GPUs), semiconductors that perform technical calculations much faster and more efficiently than central processing units (CPUs). Nvidia GPUs are the gold standard in accelerating computationally demanding data center workloads like AI training and inference.\n\nLast year, Nvidia accounted for 98% of data center GPU shipments, and the company currently has more than 80% market share in AI chips, according to analysts. That dominance is partially due to superior hardware. But it's also a product of the company's broad portfolio that spans adjacent hardware, like networking gear and server processors, as well as software and cloud infrastructure services designed to support AI workflows.\n\nTo quote Zoe Thomas of The Wall Street Journal, \"Nvidia already dominates the market for chips powering the artificial intelligence boom. Now the company is playing a growing role in designing AI data centers.\" That affords Nvidia an important competitive advantage. The company not only monetizes AI in multiple ways but can also provide customers with a complete AI system rather than individual components.\n\nNvidia reported strong financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended July 2024). Revenue increased 122% to $30 billion on strong demand for AI hardware and software. Meanwhile, non-GAAP earnings increased 152% to $0.68 per diluted share. Only one metric was moderately disappointing. Gross profit margin declined 3.3 percentage points sequentially, which may signal a slight weakening in pricing power due to increased competition from other chipmakers.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to increase at 35% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends January 2027). Compared to that estimate, the current valuation of 56.6 times adjusted earnings is fair and certainly much more reasonable than Palantir's price tag. Patient investors should consider buying a small position in Nvidia stock today and building a slightly larger position if shares fall 10% to 20% in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Stock to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio.\n\nRay Dalio was born in 1949 and graduated from Long Island University in 1971. After a brief stint as a clerk on the New York Stock Exchange, he attended Harvard Business School and earned his MBA in 1973. That same year, he became the Director of Commodities at Dominick & Dominick LLC and later traded futures at Shearson Hayden Stone for a year. Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates in 1973 in his apartment. In July 2011, he stepped down as CEO but continued to work as a co-CIO alongside Robert Prince and Greg Jensen, taking on the title of “Mentor.”\n\nBridgewater Associates is notable for its focus on transparency and accountability. The firm promotes a culture where team members take responsibility for mistakes and learn from them. It encourages questioning and alignment, ensuring everyone regularly evaluates the validity of their ideas. This approach is crucial to the firm’s management style and investment strategies.\n\nRay Dalio Warns of U.S. Decline\n\nRay Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, emphasized that since 1945, the United States has been the dominant global empire, but it is now in a state of relative decline. This decline isn’t just an opinion, it’s supported by concrete measures such as the nation’s share of global GDP, military strength, and the quality of its education system. These factors indicate that the U.S. is losing its position.\n\nIn addition to these, Dalio points out two other key elements that often disrupt world order: natural events like droughts, floods, and pandemics, which have historically caused more damage and upheaval than wars, and human creativity and technological innovation, which bring about substantial changes. Dalio believes all five factors are influencing the U.S. today. However, he stresses that the most critical issue is how people manage these challenges together.\n\nThe ability to address them intelligently and without creating further conflict is essential. If conflict arises, it could lead to a devastating outcome. But if people can come together and handle the situation effectively, the country can navigate these issues successfully. For Dalio, how society deals with one another is the number one factor in determining the future.\n\nChina Faces Economic Challenges and Urgent Need for Restructuring After Four Years of Change\n\nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Ray Dalio also highlighted significant issues in China that have emerged over the past four years. He explained that China is in need of a major restructuring, as a large portion of individual spending, around 70%, was invested in real estate. With the decline in real estate, stocks, and salaries, people have become more cautious, reducing their spending and holding onto cash. In a deflationary environment, cash has become a relatively safe asset. This situation is affecting both households and businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nDalio also pointed out that the government sector is facing serious challenges. Local governments, responsible for 83% of public spending, previously relied on land sales to generate revenue. With land sales drying up, these governments have accumulated significant debt, and now they’re struggling to pay it off. The key question is how to inject money into these local economies to keep them functioning. Dalio compared the situation to Japan’s struggles in 1990, noting that China’s challenges are even more severe and will require deep restructuring to resolve.\n\nIn addition to economic concerns, Dalio raised questions about property ownership and values. He referenced Deng Xiaoping’s famous statement, “It’s glorious to be rich,” and wondered if that sentiment still holds true in China today. The overall environment in the country is becoming more complex and difficult, as these economic and political issues intensify.\n\nDalio also emphasized the importance of being cautious when investing in China. He made it clear that every country goes through economic cycles, experiencing both highs and lows. According to Dalio, it’s crucial not to invest too heavily in any one country, including China, to avoid having it dominate your portfolio. Despite the challenges China faces, Dalio continues to invest there, but he stressed that the key consideration is the size and structure of the investment. Overall, his experience investing in China has been positive, though careful management is essential.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through Bridgewater Associates’ Q2 2024 13F portfolio and picked the top 10 stocks held by the fund.

        "title": "Should You Forget Apple and Buy These 3 Tech Stocks Instead?",
        "content": "Right now, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the world's largest company by market cap. However, investors need to be aware of some problems under the hood.\n\nInstead of Apple, I think there are much better buys right now, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). These three provide significant long-term upside that should allow them to outperform Apple.\n\nWhat's going on with Apple?\n\nApple reached the top of the rankings of the world's largest companies with shockingly low revenue growth. Sales of iPhones haven't increased meaningfully since the pandemic began, and investors put a lot of hope into the iPhone 16 being the generation that turns it around, mainly because of its Apple Intelligence integration. But the latest reports say that its sales are below expectations, which could spell disaster for the stock.\n\nIt trades at 34 times trailing earnings and 31 times forward earnings. That's a premium investors would expect to pay for a company that's growing rapidly. AAPL PE Ratio Chart\n\nIn Apple's latest quarter, however, sales only grew by 4.9% and earnings per share (EPS) by 10.2%. Those aren't figures that support the stock's lofty valuation.\n\nThe immediate future looks slightly better, but not enough to justify today's price. In fiscal 2025, ending Sept. 30, 2025, Wall Street expects 8% higher revenue and 17% EPS growth. Compared to the following three options, Apple stock doesn't look attractive.\n\nThese tech stocks look to outperform Apple over the next few years\n\nInstead, I would urge you to consider Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms (and many other companies as well).\n\nLet's start with Nvidia. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering artificial intelligence (AI), and demand doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon.\n\nAlphabet is Google's parent company, and its market dominance among search engines allowed it to capitalize on advertising in one of the most lucrative areas on the internet.\n\nMeta Platforms is the parent of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram, and it also generates a lot of its money from ads on its platforms.\n\nAll three of these companies are far outperforming Apple in revenue and EPS growth. NVDA Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nDespite doing substantially better than Apple, two of them don't hold a premium in comparison to it, while Nvidia isn't that much more expensive. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAs an investor, I'm looking for companies with sustainable business models, faster growth, and lower stock valuations. Compared to Apple, both Meta and Alphabet achieve that, so buying those two instead makes a lot of sense.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia isn't cheaper now, but its prospects are far more lucrative. While its days of increasing revenue at a triple-digit pace are over, if it keeps up its current rate, it will still post impressive growth.\n\nIn its 2025 second quarter (ending July 28), Nvidia grew revenue 15% sequentially, and its third-quarter projections indicate sales will rise another 8.3% over the previous period. Apple can't muster this kind of increase year over year, yet Nvidia is doing it one quarter after another.\n\nIf the stock price doesn't move, this will rapidly drive down Nvidia's valuation. However, with AI being such a hot investment topic, the stock will continue to be strong and will likely maintain its premium over other tech stocks.\n\nAs a result, its stock performance will be closely tied to its revenue and EPS growth, which will easily allow it to outperform the iPhone maker.\n\nApple is a great company, but it isn't the juggernaut it used to be. Investors should start looking for other investment opportunities.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Could Nvidia Stock Soar if Kamala Harris Becomes President?",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) share price has skyrocketed more than 800% while Kamala Harris has served as vice president of the United States. That's a bigger gain than the stock delivered when Donald Trump was in the White House. It's also larger than the returns generated during any of the four-year terms of Barack Obama and George W. Bush.\n\nOf course, Harris doesn't set government policies while she is vice president, nor power the Nvidia-buoying AI boom sparked by ChatGPT's release to the public in 2022. But it will be a different story -- for the former -- if she defeats Donald Trump in November. Could Nvidia stock soar if Kamala Harris becomes president? Kamala Harris. Official White House Photo by Lawrence Jackson.\n\nHarris' key relevant policies\n\nHarris has proposed several major economic policies since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee. She wants to cut taxes for working Americans. The vice president seeks to lower food and grocery costs in part by targeting corporate \"price gouging.\" Harris proposes strengthening Obamacare. She wants to address the U.S. housing shortage by offering incentives and tax credits.\n\nNone of those proposals are very relevant to Nvidia. However, the vice president has put forward some policies that could affect the chipmaker. Of course, presidents have to work with others to get things done, so no campaign promise or policy plan is a guarantee.\n\nHarris wants to raise the corporate tax rate that companies pay from 21% to 28%. This would roll back the tax cuts passed during the Trump administration but still leave the corporate tax rate at a lower level than it has been historically. Additionally, she has proposed quadrupling the tax rate on corporate stock buybacks.\n\nHarris says she plans to offer new tax credits to support \"critical industries of the future.\" These tax credits would, among other things, help promote building new data centers for artificial intelligence (AI) and \"revitalizing America's semiconductor industry.\" She also wants to keep in place the AI executive order signed by President Joe Biden that included safeguards aimed at preventing safety and security issues with AI technology.\n\nHow these policies could impact Nvidia\n\nAt first glance, you might think increasing the corporate tax rate to 28% could hurt Nvidia quite a bit. However, that's not necessarily the case. The table below shows how much Nvidia's effective tax rate has been over the last four years:\n\nFiscal Year Effective Tax Rate 2021 1.7% 2022 1.9% 2023 (4.5% tax benefit)* 2024 12%\n\nData source: Nvidia 10-K filings. The company's fiscal year ends in late January. *Nvidia received more back from the government as a result of tax benefits than it paid in taxes in 2023.\n\nMaybe Harris' proposed corporate tax rate increase would negatively affect Nvidia, but over the last four years, the company's effective tax rate has been much less than the 21% tax rate implemented when Trump was president. As the table above shows, Nvidia has demonstrated its prowess at using the tax code to its advantage to have an effective tax rate that's much lower than the standard corporate tax rate. It could very well continue to do so in a Harris administration.\n\nHarris' plans to quadruple the tax rate on stock buybacks could cause Nvidia to change how it allocates capital. The company spent $9.7 billion on share repurchases in its last fiscal year and bought back nearly $14.9 billion of its shares in the first half of the current fiscal year. Nvidia could choose to deploy more money to fund dividends or reinvest in its business instead of repurchasing shares if Harris' plans take effect.\n\nThe bottom line, though, is that significantly higher taxes on stock buybacks probably wouldn't impact Nvidia's business much, if at all. And while buybacks can increase the price of existing shares by lowering overall share count, investors could still benefit if the company boosts its dividend payout or grows more rapidly due to investing more in its business.\n\nWhat about Harris' proposal to provide tax credits to support the building of AI data centers and the U.S. semiconductor industry? These tax credits might benefit Nvidia to some extent. However, the vice president's plans don't include the dollar amounts involved. Without these details, it's impossible to evaluate how the proposed policy could impact Nvidia.\n\nCould Nvidia stock soar if Harris becomes president?\n\nLet's return to our initial question: Could Nvidia stock soar if Harris is elected president? Yes, the stock certainly could soar during a Harris administration -- but not necessarily because of any specific policies Harris might implement.\n\nBased on what is known at this point, none of Harris' proposed policies would likely make a huge impact on Nvidia's business. And that's assuming she could win enough support in Congress to implement her ideas. Every president faces the challenge of persuading legislators to go along with his or her approach. Sometimes they're successful, but sometimes they're not.\n\nNvidia's fortunes depend much more on the demand for its GPUs than they do on government policies, regardless of who sits in the Oval Office. I think this demand will remain strong for years to come. If so, chances are that Nvidia stock will soar if Harris becomes president.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't bet on the chipmaker's share price rising as much as it did during her tenure as vice president. It's a daunting challenge for any company with a market cap approaching $3 trillion to deliver a 9x return in four years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Think Nvidia Stock Is Expensive? These 3 Members of the S&amp;P 500 Trade at Even Higher Valuations.",
        "content": "Is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock overvalued? This question, while simple on the surface, is extraordinarily hard to answer.\n\nMany investors use a valuation metric called a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This popular metric is useful because it measures the stock price against a company's profits. And in Nvidia's case, its P/E ratio of 57 certainly looks expensive, considering it's roughly double the P/E ratio for the S&P 500.\n\nThen again, context is important. Nvidia stock might look expensive now. But it actually trades at a steep discount to its average P/E ratio valuation over the last five years, as the chart below shows. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nMany say to avoid stocks with a high P/E ratio. But Nvidia's high P/E over the last five years didn't prevent the stock from rising over 2,700%.\n\nNvidia stock is now cheaper than its five-year average valuation. Moreover, it's not even the most expensive constituent of the S&P 500. In fact, Axon Enterprise(NASDAQ: AXON) and CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) trade at higher P/E ratios, as of this writing. And even Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) has been more expensive than Nvidia at times in recent weeks.\n\nAxon provides hardware and software to law enforcement agencies. CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity specialist. And Costco is a grocery and home-goods retail chain known for its membership-business model and low prices. As the chart below shows, none of these companies are necessarily cheap when looking at the P/E ratio. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nShould investors sell stocks when their valuations are high? Should they only buy stocks that trade with below-average valuations?\n\nIf the path to long-term wealth were this simple, all investors would be rich. The entire investing process could be automated to sell when a P/E ratio was high and buy when a P/E ratio was low. But it's not that simple. As I said at the start, it's extraordinarily hard to say when a stock is actually overvalued.\n\nFamous investor Bill Miller succinctly explains why valuing a stock is difficult. Miller has said, \"100% of the information you have about a company represents the past, and 100% of the value depends on the future.\"\n\nImagine for a moment a company valued at $10 billion and that has only made $1 million in profit. That stock would look extremely overvalued using the information we have from the past. But Miller reminds us that value has to do with the future. If this same $10 billion company earns $100 billion in profit over the next five years or so, then the stock is a screaming value stock.\n\nIn my opinion, whether Nvidia is overvalued or undervalued today largely depends on how sustainable its profit margins are. As the chart below shows, its margin has soared as artificial intelligence has fueled demand for its hardware products.\n\nStory continues NVDA Profit Margin Chart\n\nI believe it's reasonable to expect more growth from Nvidia in coming years. And if the company can defend its current profit margins, then the stock likely has more upside. But if its margins drop back down to more normalized levels, the stock might not fare as well. That's a question that every Nvidia investor needs to answer.\n\nBut what about the other three companies that are as expensive or more expensive than Nvidia when looking at the P/E ratios? Well, here's how I think about their valuations.\n\nTwo stocks I'm not so sure about today\n\nCostco is a fantastic business, enjoying stability from 137 million membership card holders with a greater-than 90% renewal rate. But one thing it's not is high growth. It only had 5% top-line growth in its fiscal 2024, which ended Sept. 1. This led to 14% growth for operating income, which is respectable. But investors shouldn't expect these growth metrics to materially improve in its fiscal 2025.\n\nThat's why I'm not a fan of the valuation of Costco stock today. Its valuation implies better-than-average long-term growth with the business whereas it's more likely to be modest.\n\nTurning to Axon, its growth is far superior to Costco, and it should stay robust for quite some time. The company has a competitive advantage because it sells its hardware in a package with its cloud-software services. Agencies are eager to renew their contracts with Axon because they don't want to find a new solution for all their data. And there are still plenty of places that aren't using Axon yet that could in the future.\n\nHowever, I still think there's room for caution with Axon stock today. Its growth rate has been higher at times in the past. But by contrast, its price-to-sales valuation is almost double its 10-year average. AXON PS Ratio Chart\n\nA clear winner?\n\nCrowdStrike stock is by no means the cheapest stock on this list when using various valuation metrics. But once again, value is about the future. And CrowdStrike's potential is still so large because of its market. Management projects that the market for its security platform will skyrocket from $100 billion in 2024 to $225 billion in 2028.\n\nFor perspective, CrowdStrike only has $3.5 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. In other words, it doesn't even need to grab a significant portion of this market to have significant growth. Moreover, it has an easy path to growth. Only 29% of its customers use seven or more of its software products, whereas it has more than 20 options to chose from.\n\nCross-selling to existing customers is an easy path for growth for CrowdStrike. And what's stunning is that its pipeline for new deals has completely recovered from its catastrophe earlier this year when a software defect caused a massive IT outage. The speed of its rebound strongly implies that its customers love its cybersecurity platform and products.\n\nCrowdStrike stock is quite expensive when looking at the valuation metrics that measure its past results. But when considering its path for future growth, I believe the stock could still be a good value today and perhaps the best value of the four stocks mentioned here.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CrowdStrike wasn’t one of them.

First, we're at the beginning of the growth story for a promising new area, and that's artificial intelligence (AI). JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has even said that AI could be as transformational for the world as the steam engine and the internet. And analysts predict that in just the time frame of today through 2030, the AI market could grow from $200 billion to more than $1 trillion.\n\nSecond, some of these players are trading at reasonable valuations right now considering their long-term prospects. That offers investors an opportunity to get in on this exciting growth story at a fair price.\n\nSo, if you have $50,000 to invest and are looking to buy growth stocks, it's a great idea to pick up technology players that operate in the AI space, from designers of AI products to those who use them or sell AI services to others. I would spread this investment across several players and of course, make sure that this is in the context of a diversified portfolio; it's always best to invest across a few sectors in case one falls on hard times.\n\nTo increase the safety of this bet, I favor companies that don't rely uniquely on AI and prior to this boom, already built profitable businesses. Considering all of this, here are the best stocks to invest $50,000 in right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) may be the safest of all AI bets thanks to its diversification across high-growth industries. The company is a leader in e-commerce and in cloud computing through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. These two major areas have helped Amazon generate billions of dollars in revenue and profit in recent years. And today, Amazon's investment in AI is adding to the gains.\n\nThis market giant is benefiting from AI in two ways. First, Amazon uses the technology to increase its own efficiency in e-commerce -- for example, selecting the fastest delivery routes for packages. This should lower Amazon's costs and in turn, boost profit. Second, AWS is going all in on AI, offering a wide range of products and services to fulfill just about every need of a customer launching an AI project. AWS recently reached a $105 billion annual-revenue run rate thanks to this focus on AI.\n\nToday, Amazon shares trade for 39 times forward-earnings estimates. This isn't dirt cheap but remains very reasonable considering the company's solid market position.\n\nOracle\n\nOracle(NYSE: ORCL) is an up-and-coming AI powerhouse. Originally known for its database software, Oracle has shifted to prioritizing cloud infrastructure in recent times -- and it's been a worthwhile bet because the company has seen demand and revenue take off.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the most-recent quarter, for example, cloud-infrastructure revenue soared 45% to $2.2 billion, and total remaining-performance obligations (RPO) -- representing contract backlog -- surged 53% to $99 billion. All of this offers investors a reason to be optimistic about growth ahead.\n\nAnother positive point is Oracle has signed multicloud agreements with market giants AWS, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. These allow customers to use Oracle's database technology through any of these cloud providers. So Oracle has made itself easy to access and on top of this, gives customers additional types of flexibility, such as Oracle Alloy, which allows partners to customize their cloud experience.\n\nOracle shares trade for 26 times forward-earnings estimates right now, higher than in the past but a deal considering Oracle's AI growth.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nYou may use a Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) service daily if you message a friend on WhatsApp or Messenger, or post something to Instagram or Facebook. Meta owns these top social media apps and thanks to advertisers on these platforms, the company has generated billions of dollars in earnings.\n\nI expect this to continue since Meta has a solid moat, or competitive advantage. It's very difficult for users to switch to other platforms, knowing that many of their contacts may not follow. After all, about 3.2 billion people worldwide use at least one of Meta's apps daily.\n\nBut Meta isn't stopping there. The company has made AI its biggest investment area this year and already has launched its first virtual assistant. In fact, the company aims to create AI tools for professional and leisure purposes to suit the needs of every Meta user. And that may be just the beginning, as Meta is exploring a wide array of AI products and services with the aim of being a leader in the space.\n\nAll of this makes the stock look particularly cheap at only 26 times forward-earnings estimates.\n\nNvidia\n\nThis article wouldn't be complete without mentioning the star of the AI market right now, and that's Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Some investors have worried about investing in this chip designer since earnings and share performance have soared so much in recent years. Profit has climbed in the triple digits into the billions of dollars quarter after quarter, and the stock has advanced more than 400% over the past three years.\n\nSo, the worry is Nvidia's strongest wave of growth may have passed, and rivals may slip ahead. I wouldn't expect Nvidia to register such earnings or share performance non-stop. But I think the growth opportunity is far from over, and a new wave of growth may be just ahead. It's important to remember that Nvidia is the market leader, and its focus on innovation should keep it there.\n\nThe company now is planning for the launch of new architecture Blackwell, a platform that should supercharge growth and could lead to more share performance down the road.\n\nAnd that's why Nvidia's valuation at 42 times forward-earnings estimates looks fair, and it's worth picking up this winning stock at these levels.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers are the largest in the industry, typically developed by technology giants based in the US, and offer massive networking capacity and often consume as much power as a big city or even a small country.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAs technology stocks stage a comeback on the back of Fed rate cuts and AI optimism, the news coming from the commerce department in the US has buoyed investors further.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Could Soar Another 561%, According to a Wall Street Analyst",
        "content": "If you invested $100 in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) at the beginning of 2023, you would now have $830 thanks to the remarkable surge in the company's shares fueled by artificial intelligence (AI). Even so, the stock could jump from about $120 now to around $800 by 2030, according to one analyst.\n\nPhil Panaro, a former senior advisor at the Boston Consulting Group, believes that the continuing growth of AI and the arrival of Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell processors could lead to annual revenue of $600 billion in 2030 from $61 billion in fiscal 2024.\n\nLet's look at the catalysts mentioned by Panaro and check if they are strong enough to help Nvidia sustain its phenomenal growth in the long run.\n\nThe increasing demand for accelerated computing\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on his company's August earnings conference call that accelerated computing is going to be a long-term growth driver. Huang said the transition from general-purpose computing -- using central processing units (CPUs) -- to accelerated computing based on graphics processing units (GPUs) could help reduce computing costs by 90%.\n\nBecause GPUs speed up demanding workloads in data centers that would have otherwise taken longer using CPUs, Nvidia says, accelerated computing is not only faster, but it is also more sustainable because of its smaller energy footprint.\n\nHuang projected \"$1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing\" based on their energy efficiency.\n\nData centers are estimated to account for 1% to 2% of global energy consumption, a figure expected to double by the end of the decade. So the much faster pace of GPUs compared to CPUs is expected to help reduce energy consumption long term.\n\nThe demand for data center accelerators is forecast to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28% through the next five years. And the massive end market that the transition to accelerated computing is likely to create, Huang said, could mean that his company is at the beginning of a phenomenal growth curve.\n\nThat's because Nvidia is the dominant player in the data center GPU market. It reportedly controlled 98% of this space at the end of last year, so it stands to win big from the secular growth in accelerated computing even if it loses some of that market share.\n\nThe outlook for Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell AI GPUs seems to be solid, with the company saying demand is tracking ahead of supply, a trend that's likely to continue next year as well.\n\nWhy a $600 billion top line seems achievable\n\nNvidia's solid prospects discussed above help explain why the company's revenue estimates have received a nice bump for the next three fiscal years.\n\nStory continues NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAs shown in the chart above, Nvidia's top line is expected to cross $207 billion in fiscal 2027, more than triple its fiscal 2024 revenue. The company's fiscal 2027 will coincide with the majority of calendar year 2026. So to hit $600 billion in revenue by calendar year 2030 (Nvidia's fiscal 2031), it will need an annual growth rate of 30% over a four-year period.\n\nNvidia serves multiple fast-growing markets such as AI chips (expected to grow at an annual pace of 41% through 2032), digital twins, and cloud gaming, so there is a good chance that it could indeed hit $600 billion in revenue by the 2030 calendar year. But it remains to be seen if that growth translates into the potential upside that Panaro predicts for the stock.\n\nAssuming Nvidia does reach $600 billion in sales in 2030, the stock will have to maintain its current price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 32 to generate 561% returns from this level. That would translate into a market cap of $19.2 trillion, compared to the current level of just under $3 trillion.\n\nIf we don't give Nvidia such a rich sales multiple and assume that it is trading at a P/S of 8 (in line with the U.S. technology sector's average) by 2030, its market cap would jump to $4.8 trillion.\n\nSo, Nvidia could deliver 61% gains from current levels assuming it trades at a more reasonable valuation. But if the market decides to keep rewarding the company with a rich multiple because of its healthy growth, there is a good chance that it could deliver a much stronger upside in the long run -- and might even get close to Panaro's ambitious estimate.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Before October 7",
        "content": "It's no secret that Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks have dominated the market for the last few years. With firms like PwC -- one of the \"big four\" accounting firms -- making claims that AI could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 -- the hype makes sense.\n\nThe revolution's poster child, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), saw its stock skyrocket nearly 1000% from late 2022 to today, but the last few months have not been as kind. After reaching its highest peak in June, shares of Nvidia are down about 10%. More significant market fears mixed with slower growth have caused some to cool on the once red-hot stock. So, where to go from here?\n\nNvidia's AI Summit is a big day for the company and the industry\n\nAs the de facto leader of the entire industry, Nvidia needs to continue to do just that: lead. The 2024 AI Summit, which begins October 7, is a chance for the company to bring together some of the biggest faces and best minds in the industry to help push AI forward, all while keeping itself front and center. It's a chance to communicate Nvidia's vision not just to other industry leaders, but to the public at large.\n\nOne of the primary questions investors have for the company -- and it's a very legitimate one -- is: Are the real-world applications of AI that impactful? Is the incredible cost of AI hardware worth the investment? The summit will be a chance for Nvidia to showcase the myriad ways AI can be used to return real value. It's a chance to justify the enormous cost of its chips and, ultimately, the price of its shares.\n\nThe event in and of itself is unlikely to move the needle, but it may help ease some fears and get investors thinking about the possibilities and power of AI. Luckily, the event isn't happening in a vacuum. Here are a few reasons why Nvidia is in a prime position to capitalize on the event.\n\n1. Nvidia's Blackwell chips are coming\n\nIn Nvidia's only major snafu since the AI boom took off, the company announced its latest line of chips, dubbed Blackwell, was delayed. Issues in its manufacturing meant they wouldn't be shipped on time. Nvidia assured that shipments would only be delayed a quarter. Despite these reassurances, some investors worried the issues were more fundamental and the delay would be longer.\n\nIt seems those fears were unfounded. According to a recent report by ​​Tom's Hardware, the company is ready to ship the first batch as early as December, only about six weeks behind the original schedule, although these reports have yet to be confirmed by Nvidia. If true, it would do a lot to ease investors' fears and show that the company went above and beyond in fixing its mistake.\n\nStill, even if they don't ship until later in the quarter, the rollout will be huge for the company regardless. Their impact will be felt immediately, with billions in sales expected before the end of its Q4.\n\n2. Nvidia's vision is its greatest asset\n\nIt's easy to get bogged down in numbers and fixate on balance sheets and income statements, and while these are extremely important when evaluating a business, certain intangibles are often what makes a company great, like vision. Nvidia has it in spades. Under the leadership of CEO Jensen Huang, the company has been at the forefront of several macro movements in tech. Huang saw back in the early 90s that computer graphics would be huge. The company's GPUs -- graphics processing units -- are a big part of what enabled the video game industry to evolve to where it is today.\n\nThis vision is why the company controls roughly 90% of today's AI chip market. Nvidia saw that its GPUs could do much more than push the bounds of computer graphics; they could power a new technological revolution. It's why the company caught its competition sleeping. Since the current AI boom took off in late 2022, Nvidia's chips have consistently been miles ahead. Other chipmakers have been playing catch-up ever since.\n\nThere was relative parity between Nvidia and its longtime rival AMD for decades. Not so anymore; last year, Nvidia made more in profit than AMD made in total revenue. The difference right now is stark, but remember, if Nvidia is profiting much more than its rival, it can then afford to spend more on research and marketing to widen its moat and fend off competitors.\n\n3. Considering its prospects, Nvidia is reasonably priced\n\nI know I just said not to get bogged down in the numbers, but they are still important. How is the market valuing Nvidia right now? At a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 56, Nvidia isn't cheap, but given its current pace of growth, a trailing P/E isn't really the best metric for us. Its forward P/E -- that is, a P/E that accounts for its expected earnings in the next 12 months rather than the last 12 -- is just above 30. That's not bad in the world of tech. It's just about where Apple and Amazon sit.\n\nAnother useful valuation is the PEG ratio, which you get by dividing a company's P/E by its expected earnings growth. This is an excellent metric for companies with a lot of growth potential. As a very general rule, a PEG under 1 is what we're looking for. Nvidia's is 0.94.\n\nNvidia has plenty of room to deliver the kind of growth that can justify its current valuation. To be sure, metrics are not the be-all and end-all. They are imperfect instruments, and of course, metrics that rely on expected earnings are especially imperfect -- the future is anything but guaranteed. I believe Nvidia will continue to outperform the market for some time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "4 Crypto Stocks With Most Upside Before the Next Bitcoin Rally",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market, which was trying to rebound after the Federal Reserve announced a rate cut in September, has again started facing roadblocks. Bitcoin (BTC), which surged past $63,000 in the days following the rate cut announcement, has retreated this week and fell below $60,000.\n\nSeveral factors have been responsible for this sudden decline. However, Bitcoin still has a lot of potential and the recent decline is temporary. With the Federal Reserve indicating more rate cuts in the near term, the crypto market is poised to benefit.\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in Bitcoin-centric stocks such as Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD, BlackRock, Inc. BLK, CME Group Inc. CME and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, which have strong growth potential in the near term.\n\nBitcoin Price Retreats From Recent Highs\n\nBitcoin was trading at $61,136.95 on Thursday. However, the cryptocurrency had slipped below $60,000 earlier in the day after the second straight day of outflows from the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, down 4.5% from last week.\n\nBitcoin’s price has now declined for the sixth consecutive day amid the ongoing crisis in the Middle East owing to the Iran-Israel conflict.\n\nBitcoin’s price remained rangebound under $57,000 following the halving event after the cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of $73,750 on March 14. Bitcoin tried to stage a comeback after the Federal Reserve announced a 50-basis-point rate cut, the first since March 2020. Despite the recent decline, Bitcoin has returned 44.6% year to date.\n\nCryptocurrency Stocks Poised to Grow\n\nBitcoin’s sharp rebound from below $60,000 to nearly $61,200 on Thursday follows Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s dovish comments. Powell hinted at more rate cuts this year noting that inflation has been steadily declining.\n\nLower interest rates generally benefit growth assets like cryptocurrencies, as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding assets that don't generate yields. In a low-interest-rate environment, investors tend to look for assets with higher potential returns, even if they involve more risk.\n\nInvestors are optimistic about a total rate cut of 50 basis points this year, which is a positive sign for the cryptocurrency market.\n\n4 Crypto Stocks With Growth Potential\n\nRobinhood Markets\n\nRobinhood Markets operates a financial services platform in the United States. Its platform allows users to invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options, gold, and cryptocurrencies.

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) The Most Active US Stock To Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 8 Most Active US Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the most active US stocks to buy now.\n\nMarket Will Likely Remain Resilient\n\nAmid economic uncertainty and upcoming elections, analysts are adopting a cautious stance due to market volatility driven by mixed investor sentiments. It’s being noted that while the Fed’s easing cycle could yield positive market outcomes in the coming months, immediate stock performance remains uncertain as many investors prefer to wait until after the elections to commit capital.\n\nVance Howard, CEO of Howard Capital Management, is of a similar view, as he is predicting a significant rate cut in early 2025 due to declining inflation. He emphasized that markets typically rise following initial rate cuts and advised investors to remain optimistic despite current market fluctuations. Howard recommended focusing on resilient sectors like utilities, real estate, and technology, while also considering financials as likely beneficiaries of future rate cuts as we approach 2025. We actually covered his opinion in more detail in our 8 Best Inexpensive Stocks To Invest In Now article, here’s an excerpt from it:\n\n“Howard pointed out that historically, after the first rate cut, markets tend to rise, with a perfect record of being higher 7 out of 7 times following such cuts. He also noted that if the S&P 500 has already gained 10% in the first half of the year, there is an 83% chance of continued upward movement in the second half. Therefore, he advised investors to remain optimistic and not be overly distracted by current market noise.”\n\nLiz Young Thomas, SoFi head of investment strategy, joined ‘Squawk Box’ at CNBC on September 30 and shared her insights regarding the market’s trajectory as it approaches an easing cycle. She acknowledged that while there has been a significant run-up leading to this cycle, much of the substantial gains may have already been realized.\n\nHowever, she noted that this does not necessarily mean the market will slow down immediately. Historically, after the first rate cut, markets tend to remain flat or slightly up in the following 30 to 60 days. 3 months post-cut, the market evaluates whether these cuts were necessary due to cooling economic conditions or if they were merely opportunistic adjustments.\n\nYoung highlighted several positive factors contributing to the current market rally. Despite a slight pullback in technology stocks, she observed that many other stocks are performing well, with 80% of the S&P 500 trading above their 200-day moving averages. This indicates a strong internal market dynamic. Additionally, optimism surrounding potential stimulus measures from China adds further support to market sentiment.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen discussing valuation concerns, Young agreed that while US market multiples are relatively high, hovering around 21 to 22, this is not unprecedented when compared to historical standards. She pointed out that current valuations are above both the 5-year and 10-year averages but not at overbought levels. Young referenced Warren Buffett’s long-term investment philosophy, emphasizing that he does not focus on timing market multiples but rather on fundamental growth.\n\nYoung expressed a desire for the market to shift towards trading based on fundamentals rather than multiple expansions. She noted that while earnings stability is crucial, there are signs of strength in sectors outside of technology, particularly in industrial stocks. However, financials have shown mixed signals.\n\nAs for identifying sectors with potential for faster earnings growth, Young emphasized the importance of thorough research and analysis rather than relying solely on top-down market movements. She identified healthcare, especially biotech and pharmaceuticals, as a promising area for growth. Healthcare tends to perform well in environments characterized by a steepening yield curve, which has been observed recently.\n\nMoreover, she cautioned against assuming certainty in market outcomes. With prevailing confidence in a soft landing scenario from both the market and the Fed, she advised investors to remain vigilant and consider protective strategies. She suggested exploring opportunities across the Treasury curve, particularly in shorter-duration bonds, as a hedge against potential faster-than-expected rate cuts by the Fed.\n\nYoung’s insights propose that by focusing on sectors with strong fundamentals and remaining adaptable to changing conditions, investors can position themselves for potential gains while being mindful of risks associated with high valuations and economic uncertainties. With that said, we’re here with a list of the 8 most active US stocks to buy now.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe sifted through Yahoo Finance’s list of the most active US stocks that are experiencing high trading volumes. We looked at the top 15 US stocks to find the ones that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We then narrowed down our list to the 10 stocks with high trading volumes and those that were the most popular among hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their trading volumes, as of September 30.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nVolume: 271.009 million\n\nAverage Volume (3-Month): 326.28 million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading technology company known for its high-performance GPUs, making it a major player in the gaming, artificial intelligence, and data center markets. Its GPUs are widely used for demanding applications such as gaming, machine learning, and scientific computing.\n\nChinese regulators are discouraging businesses from purchasing NVIDIA chips, according to Bloomberg reports. While the US government restricts the sale of advanced chips to Chinese entities, some models, like the H20, are permitted for export. NVIDIA generates approximately 12% of its revenue from low-end chips and software sold to Chinese companies.\n\nThe company still experienced significant growth in FQ2 2025, with revenue surging 122.40% compared to the previous year. The data center segment drove this growth, with revenue increasing 54% due to strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers accounted for approximately 45% of data center revenue. Partnerships with healthcare institutions and rising demand for AI-powered diagnostic solutions contributed to this impressive financial performance.\n\nOn September 25, NetApp unveiled its new AI-powered data solution, leveraging NVIDIA technology, which enhances NetApp’s unified storage operating system, benefiting thousands of enterprises that rely on NetApp for their data infrastructure.\n\nElon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, has launched Colossal, the world’s most powerful AI training system. Powered by 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, Colossal is expected to expand further with the integration of H200 GPUs and potentially Blackwell chips. While the company faces challenges in product launches and GPU pricing, its focus on AI monetization and sustainability initiatives positions it for long-term success.\n\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) – Following the release of first-quarter earnings in May featuring record revenue growth of 262% year over year, NVIDIA continued its upward march. On June 10, shares of the company began trading on a split-adjusted basis following a 10-for-1 forward stock split, making stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors alike. Just one week later, the company officially surpassed Microsoft in market cap to become the most valuable publicly traded company (although it would relinquish the title not long after). While other companies have also stood to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) trend this year, NVIDIA stands out as the unquestionable leader in the space and that is unlikely to be challenged for many years ahead. NVIDIA continues to see extremely strong levels of demand and the recent introduction of the Blackwell system looks to be an exciting next phase of growth for the stock.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of most active US stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "After a brief lull, the fervor for artificial intelligence (AI) investments is back with a bang on Wall Street. In the past few days, there have been several upbeat updates in the space. This puts focus on AI-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ, First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF ROBT, Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF CHAT and Themes Generative Artificial Intelligence ETF WISE.\n\nLet’s delve a little deeper.\n\nOpenAI Raises $6.6 Billion, Valuation Soars to $157 Billion\n\nOpenAI, the mastermind behind ChatGPT, has secured $6.6 billion in funding from investors, which could push its valuation to $157 billion, positioning it as one of the world's most valuable private companies, per Reuters, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe funding round attracted both old and new investors. Notable returning venture capital firms include Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, alongside OpenAI's major corporate backer, Microsoft MSFT. New participation came from NVIDIA NVDA, with other investors such as Altimeter Capital, Fidelity, SoftBank, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX state-backed investment firm joining.\n\nMicron’s Strong Earnings\n\nMicron stock jumped as much as 16% before the bell on Sept. 26, 2024, after the chipmaker forecast higher-than-expected revenues for the upcoming quarter.Management attributed its raised guidance to a more favorable pricing environment as well as robust demand for Micron's memory chips used in data centers to power artificial intelligence. Per management, the company is entering fiscal 2025 with \"the best competitive positioning in Micron's history.\"\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nMassive Demand for NVIDIA’s Blackwell AI Chip\n\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said in an interview with CNBC that demand for the company’s next-generation artificial intelligence chip Blackwell is “insane.” Blackwell chip is in huge demand from companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta and other firms that build AI data centers to power products like ChatGPT and Copilot. Jensen said NVIDIA plans to update its AI platform each year to boost performance by two to three times.\n\nMicrosoft to Invest $1.3 Billion in Mexico for AI and Cloud Expansion\n\nTech giant Microsoft has recently announced a $1.3 billion investment over the next three years to enhance its cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in Mexico. The investment will focus on improving connectivity and fostering AI adoption among small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).\n\nMicrosoft’s initiative looks to reach 5 million people and support 30,000 SMBs within three years. Mexican companies such as breadmaker Bimbo and cement producer Cemex are already utilizing Microsoft’s AI tools to enhance their operations.\n\nCerebras Systems Plans IPO Amid AI Chip Boom\n\nCerebras Systems is preparing to go public during a surge in AI technology, aiming to become the first chip maker to debut in this environment. The company recently filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and plans to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker CBRS. However, Cerebras has not yet disclosed the timing or financial details of the IPO. Cerebras intends to market its chips as alternatives to NVIDIA’s AI-focused hardware.\n\nAmazon's AI Strategy Poised to Deliver a Competitive Chip Advantage\n\nAmazon’s cloud division, AWS, has made huge investments to close the gap with the industry's first mover, Microsoft, and may now be in a favorable position. A key advantage for Amazon is its ability to use its own chips in its data centers, reducing costs compared to relying on NVIDIA's technology. Amazon expects AI to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business in the years ahead.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Jensen Huang Was Once Told 'NVIDIA Can Never Be Larger Than A Billion Dollars.' Here's What They Did To Shatter That Ceiling 1,000X Over",
        "content": "Jensen Huang Was Once Told 'NVIDIA Can Never Be Larger Than A Billion Dollars.' Here's What They Did To Shatter That Ceiling 1,000X Over\n\nIn the early days of NVIDIA, CEO Jensen Huang was told the company would never be worth more than a billion dollars. This bold claim might have discouraged some leaders, but for Huang, it was just the start of a journey to prove the skeptics wrong. Today, NVIDIA has not only surpassed that billion-dollar mark – it has blown past it by a factor of a thousand.\n\nSo, how did NVIDIA pull off this incredible feat?\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\nNVIDIA started out making powerful gaming processors. Still, Jensen Huang had a bigger idea and saw that NVIDIA’s technology could be applied to more than just graphics for video games. In an interview, Huang shared, \"A long time ago, I was told that NVIDIA could never be larger than a billion dollars. Obviously, that was an underestimation, underimagination of the size of the opportunity.\"\n\nInstead of limiting itself to producing chips, NVIDIA has created platforms for particular sectors, including health care, AI or the metaverse. NVIDIA now offers complete solutions that integrate hardware, software and AI models, allowing it to capture massive new markets that extend far beyond its origins in graphics processing.\n\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\n\nAt a GTC conference a few years back, Huang clarified that platforms – not just chips – are NVIDIA's future. For example, the Omniverse Enterprise platform allows companies to collaborate in a 3D digital space, creating \"digital twins\" of everything from cars to entire factories. These digital simulations are revolutionizing industries by increasing accuracy and speeding up development.\n\nHowever, NVIDIA’s most significant shift came when the company moved into AI. Huang's vision for AI was far bigger than just building chips for computers. Instead, he saw the potential for AI to reshape industries entirely. He explained that rather than just thinking about how many chips are needed for AI, it's about what those chips do.\n\nTrending: ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\nStory continues\n\n\"If you built a system that assisted in the driving of the car, what's the value of an autonomous chauffeur every now and then? Now the opportunity becomes much larger,\" said Huang. This thinking allowed NVIDIA to tap into enormous markets, from self-driving cars to AI-driven health care.\n\nStill, one of the most exciting areas where NVIDIA has extended its platform leadership is in autonomous vehicles (AVs). NVIDIA has created a comprehensive AV platform with tools for everything from data gathering and mapping to simulation and driving assistance. A synthetic data replicator is also included in their AV platform to expedite the training of AI models for self-driving automobiles.\n\nSee Also: Unlock a $400 billion opportunity by investing in the future of EV infrastructure on this startup already valued at $50 million with just $500.\n\nNVIDIA has been developing an end-to-end platform for AVs for several years now. Nobody comes close. This platform approach ensures NVIDIA is well ahead of competitors, who are still trying to get their chips to market. By offering a complete solution, NVIDIA has established itself as a leader in the autonomous vehicle space.\n\nNVIDIA’s growth is continuing as the company develops. From just making chips, they have evolved into a platform business that provides solutions for some of the most innovative technology available today, such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars. Huang noted that \"the market size is enormous. It's measured in trillions,\" and NVIDIA is positioned to capture a significant share of that.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 20 Trending AI News And Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) startups have taken the finance world by storm in the past few months. This interest was sparked by the blockbuster launch of ChatGPT by California-based OpenAI in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has raised tens of billions of dollars in new funding and reached a valuation of over $150 billion. OpenAI revealed earlier this week that it had secured more than $6.6 billion in new funding through a financing round led by prominent names including Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures, and Tiger Global, among others.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPerhaps one reason the startup is so popular is that it is projecting more than $3.5 billion in revenue this year and over $11 billion in 2025. AI startups in general have been quicker at making revenues than previous technology booms, according to an analysis of payment information by fintech firm Stripe. The report underlines that top AI groups are reaching millions of dollars in sales within a year. This timeline is far faster in the life cycle of a startup than comparable non-AI tech groups. The report relies on annual revenue data for the 100 highest-grossing privately held AI companies using Stripe, compared with a comparable basket of prominent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) start-ups as of July 2018.\n\nThe report has gained a lot of traction since Stripe customers include OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, GitHub and Midjourney, among others. Stripe claims, per Financial Times, that AI start-ups took a median 11 months to hit $1 million in annual revenue after their first sales on Stripe, compared with 15 months for the previous generation of SaaS companies. AI start-ups that have scaled to more than $30 million in annual revenue achieved the milestone in 20 months — five times faster than past SaaS companies. Emily Sands, the head of information at Stripe, highlights that unlike past generations of software companies, AI companies paid compute costs straight out of the gate, and were under pressure to build monetisation faster.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the firm, recently appeared on news platform CNBC to discuss a partnership that his firm was entering into with IT company Accenture. During the discussions around Blackwell - the latest, fastest, and most powerful AI chip developed by NVIDIA that has been hit with production delays recently - Huang revealed that Blackwell was in full production now and the demand for it was insane as everyone wanted a lot of these chips and also wanted to be the first ones to get it. Regarding the Accenture partnership, Huang claimed that AI would supercharge enterprises to scale innovation at greater speed.\n\nJPMorgan has an Overweight rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock with a $155 price target. In a recent investor note, issued after hosting a meeting with investor relations at the chipmaker, the advisory underlined NVIDIA remained on track to ship its next-generation Blackwell graphic processing unit platform in high volume production in Q4, with the company still expecting several billion dollars in Blackwell revenues during the time. The note also cautioned investors on paying too much attention to the noise around rack scale portfolio changes for the chips.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the trending AI stocks now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "SMCI Gains 46.2% YTD: Should You Buy the Stock for Its AI Drive?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer SMCI shares have jumped 46.2% year to date, outpacing the Zacks Computer – Storage Devices industry, the broader technology sector and the S&P 500 index’s returns of 2.4%, 22.6% and 20%, respectively.\r\n\r\nThis impressive performance can be attributed to the company's solid position in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure market. SMCI boasts technology and product leadership in Generative AI training and inferencing.\r\n\r\nThe company’s diversified AI portfolio and strong AI integrations into its storage systems are positives. It is continuously witnessing solid demand for its server and storage solutions, thanks to the growing proliferation of Generative AI.\r\n\r\nWith such fundamental strength, Super Micro Computer has outperformed its peers NetApp NTAP and Pure Storage PSTG, which have rallied 39.2% and 39.6%, respectively, in the same period.\n\nYear-to-Date Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, macroeconomic uncertainties and supply-chain challenges are headwinds. The company expects shipments to be constrained due to supply-chain bottlenecks for key new components for advanced platforms, which is a major negative. It is not seeing any significant boost in the shipment of NVIDIA's NVDA Blackwell Graphic Processing Unit (“GPU”) until March 2025, which is a severe concern.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro Computer's technical indicator suggests that further downside could be ahead. The stock has been trading below the 50-day moving average, a key technical level often used by traders to gauge short-term momentum. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAre these near-term uncertainties and challenges a bother for investors, or does SMCI’s strong AI drive offer further growth opportunities?\r\n\r\nLet us dig deeper to find out.\n\nSMCI Rides on AI Drive\n\nSuper Micro Computer stands to capitalize on the current AI boom on the back of its diversified AI portfolio and strong AI integrations into its storage systems.\r\n\r\nGiven that AI is accelerating the need for liquid cooling, Super Micro Computer is investing heavily in high-quality, optimized Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC) solutions for high-end applications.\r\n\r\nThe company is building and optimizing Rack-Scale Plug and Play (PnP) solutions with the latest DLC liquid cooling technology in order to help customers achieve the best time-to-deployment and time-to-online with their AI solutions.\r\n\r\nSMCI is experiencing the solid adoption of its Rack-Scale PnP Total AI solutions, which is contributing well to its server and storage revenues. It expects 5,000 rack capacity per month by the end of this year.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro Computer’s strength in its Datacenter Building Block Solutions is boosting its presence in the data center market. With the rapid deployment of large-scale AI infrastructure, datacenters worldwide are facing power shortages and cooling inefficiency challenges.\r\n\r\nSMCI is making strong efforts to scale up its production in order to capitalize on AI prospects and drive its momentum among cloud service providers.\r\n\r\nIt has recently added three manufacturing facilities in Silicon Valley to support growth of AI and enterprise rack-scale liquid-cooled solutions and capitalize on the rising demand for liquid-cooled data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrong Partner Base Drives SMCI’s Growth\n\nSuper Micro Computer’s strong partner base, which includes the likes of major chipmakers — NVIDIA, Intel INTC and Advanced Micro Devices — remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nSMCI is benefiting from solid momentum across the NVIDIA GPU product lines. Many Super Micro Computer servers are explicitly designed for high-performance NVIDIA GPUs for AI processing, such as the very-high-density 4U-8GPU systems, the Intel CPU-based SYS-421GE-TNHR2-LCC and the AMD CPU-based AS -4125GS-TNHR2-LCC.\r\n\r\nTo further capitalize on the growing proliferation of AI, Super Micro Computer has deployed NVIDIA HGX H100 SuperCluster solutions to deliver enhanced experience to its customers.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro Computer also offers several products that support Intel’s Sapphire Rapids data center CPU and AMD’s Genoa data center CPU.\r\n\r\nSMCI is now deepening its focus on developing generative AI and inference-optimized systems based on the next-generation NVIDIA H200, B100, B200, GH200 and GB200 GPUs, as well as Intel’s Gaudi2/3 and Advanced Micro Devices’ MI300X/A GPUs.\n\nSMCI’s Long-Term Projections\n\nSuper Micro Computer’s technology and product leadership in the AI infrastructure market is expected to benefit its long-term prospects. It remains optimistic about its robust pipeline of new products, as well as existing products.\r\n\r\nFor fiscal 2025, the company expects net sales of $26-$30 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth between 74% and 101%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $28.01 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 87.5%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $3.35 per share, indicating a year-over-year rise of 51.6%. The figure has been unchanged over the past 30 days.\n\nAttractive Valuation: A Silver Lining for SMCI\n\nThe SMCI stock is trading at a discount, with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 0.08X compared with the industry’s 1.9X and lower than the median of 0.18X, reflecting a good opportunity for investors. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nSuper Micro Computer’s long-term prospects are likely to benefit from its significant investments in production, operations, management software, AI portfolio, cloud features and customer service, which are expected to bolster its customer base in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nIts attractive valuation presents a compelling case for buying the GRPN stock at its current levels.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro Computer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "content": "ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its “ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy” third quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the third quarter, increased volatility was caused by weak employment reports, leading to a brief correction in parts of the U.S. equity market. However, after a 50 basis point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, stocks rallied, with the S&P 500 Index rising by 5.89% and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index jumping by 9.27%. Leadership in equities broadened beyond the Magnificent Seven companies. In the quarter, profit-taking among large-cap companies and early signs of a possible market rotation caused growth stocks to underperform value stocks. The benchmark Russell 1000 Growth Index increased by 3.19%, falling behind the Russell 1000 Value Index, which saw a growth of 9.43%. The strategy outperformed in the quarter driven by broader participation among stable and cyclical growth positions in health care, communication services, and industrials. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy highlighted stocks like Global Equity Strategy highlighted stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in the third quarter 2024 investor letter.

The quarter saw us continue to trim NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), reducing the GPU chipmaker from an active weight in the portfolio to an underweight versus the benchmark. We continue to believe in Nvidia’s 10-year trajectory as hyperscaler and enterprise customers invest in GPU architecture. However, we have reduced our Nvidia position as its valuation now more fully reflects the company’s robust growth path and as estimates have risen to levels that require a very steep growth trajectory to drive further stock appreciation.\"\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in 5th position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "content": "Nvidia's Top Brass Unloaded Significant Stock In 2024 Amid AI Spending and Chip Delays\n\nThroughout 2024, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) insiders have been actively selling shares, tallying transactions over $1.8 billion, with expectations of more to come, Bloomberg reports.\n\nThe most notable of these insiders, CEO Jensen Huang, executed sales of approximately $713 million through a predetermined trading arrangement known as a 10b5-1 plan. Director Mark Stevens' trust has filed to sell 3 million additional shares in addition to the 1.6 million it sold in 2024.\n\nThis massive wave of stock sales occurs amid market anxieties surrounding Nvidia's delayed Blackwell chips and ongoing investments in AI technology.\n\nDespite these concerns, insiders maintain a robust holding, illustrating a potentially strategic timing rather than a loss of confidence. Still, Nvidia stock is up 179% in the last 12 months, and its outstanding shares stand at 23.5 billion.\n\nAlso Read: Amazon's Profitable Essential Merchandise, Efficiency Gains Set To Drive Growth: Analyst\n\nRecently, Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chief Jensen Huang dispelled Wall Street concerns by acknowledging massive demand for Nvidia's Blackwell GPU, whose production and progress are going as planned.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia is applying spatial AI in autonomous driving and warehouse automation, using robots to simulate real-world scenarios.\n\nNvidia's recent launches include open-source AI models and new Unreal Engine 5 plugins enabling AI-powered MetaHuman characters, catering to AI-driven gaming.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives projected Nvidia as a beneficiary of the trillion-dollar AI spending by the U.S. hyperscalars.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Nvidia through SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).\n\nNvidia Stock Prediction For 2024\n\nEquity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at NVIDIA, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For NVIDIA, the 200-day moving average sits at $95.76, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $122.85. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\n\nStory continues\n\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.\n\nPrice Action: NVDA stock is up 0.39% at $123.33 premarket at the last check Friday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Has Soared 96% But Geopolitical Risks Persist\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "title": "Corporate adoption is turbocharging the AI market, says top tech analyst",
        "content": "Good morning. Big tech has been making headlines this week. For starters, OpenAI is raising even more money and shaking up its management structure to become more corporate as it digs in for what is shaping up to be a battle for AI dominance. Then there is Nvidia, whose CEO reminded businesses that his company is the only game in town when it comes to advanced AI chips—including the new Blackwell line, which is a top priority for many firms.\n\nAnd speaking of Nvidia, the chip maker and professional services company Accenture announced an expanded partnership on Wednesday. Accenture will create what it calls an “Nvidia Business Group,” which will help clients lay the foundation for AI use with its AI Refinery platform built on the Nvidia AI stack. Nvidia Business Group will consist of 30,000 employees focused on assisting clients scale enterprise generative AI adoption.\n\nI asked Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, what this move by Nvidia signifies. “We believe enterprise adoption of AI is one of the most important drivers of the market over the next few years,” Ives told me on Thursday. And $1 trillion of AI CapEx is on the horizon in the next three years with “the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia torch bearers of this AI Revolution,” according to Ives.\n\nDuring Nvidia’s earnings call in August, CFO Colette Kress said that the “Enterprise AI wave has started.” Enterprises drove sequential revenue growth for the company in the quarter that ended July 28, and Nvidia is working the most with Fortune 100 companies on AI initiatives, Kress said.\n\nThe fundraising news for OpenAI, the company that launched ChatGPT, came on Wednesday in the form of $6.6 billion in new funding, bringing the startup’s valuation to $157 billion. The company did not disclose the investors. But venture capital firm Thrive Capital had invested in and led this latest round, Fortune reported. Microsoft and Nvidia were also among the investors as well, Wedbush Securities analysts wrote in a Thursday note.\n\nAs a result of the funding round, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar told employees on Wednesday that the company could offer a tender event to provide an option for liquidity, The Information reported. Friar, former CEO of Nextdoor, joined OpenAI in June. She also previously served as CFO of the tech company Square and oversaw its IPO.\n\nThe funding drive is happening as OpenAI overhauls its board structure to be a for-profit corporation accountable to shareholders, and as it contends with ongoing C-suite exits, including that of CTO, Mira Murati.\n\nStory continues\n\nWedbush analysts said in a Thursday note to investors that OpenAI has been the “linchpin” to AI success and adoption. “We also believe OpenAI now has a much more functional corporate structure which is a positive for the broader tech industry,” the analysts wrote.\n\nMany CFOs are determining the business case for generative AI to help drive continuous change and create value. But, the rapid pace of technological change may be speeding up that process. And, the enterprise level is the beginning of a broader AI Revolution and demand adoption into 2025 and beyond, Wedbush analysts predict.\n\nHave a good weekend.\n\nSheryl Estrada\r\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\n\nThe following sections of CFO Daily were curated by Greg McKenna\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Magnificent Stocks That Turned $20,000 Into $4.5 Million in 10 Years",
        "content": "The great thing about investing is you don't need to start with a big fortune to eventually build a portfolio worth a life-changing amount of money. It is challenging, of course, to find in advance the big growth stocks that can generate those kinds of transformational returns. But the one key ingredient that is usually necessary is patience: Significant gains don't often come quickly. The longer you hold, the better your odds will be that you'll earn a great return.\n\nTwo of the best growth stocks you could have owned during the past 10 years are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH). Here's a look at just how much you could have earned from these two investments during that stretch, why they did so well, and why they can continue to be excellent stocks to own in the years ahead.\n\nNvidia\n\nIt's not much of a surprise for Nvidia to be on this kind of list given how significant a role the tech company has played in artificial intelligence (AI), and with so many companies relying on its chips to power their next-generation technologies and software. Yet even before the surge in its financial results and stock price set off by the AI boom, Nvidia was an outstanding investment.\n\nThe sheer growth that Nvidia has generated in recent years is evident just by looking at its financial statements. During its past four reported quarters, it generated more than $53 billion in net income. That's nearly double the $26.9 billion in total revenue it generated in its fiscal 2022, which ended Jan. 30, 2022 -- before all the AI hype began. During that fiscal year, its profit totaled $9.8 billion.\n\nNvidia's impressive growth has sent the company's market cap to about $2.9 trillion. But because its earnings have increased rapidly, it's trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 31, which doesn't seem all that high for a stock that has risen by 26,000% during the past 10 years. A $10,000 investment in the company a decade ago would be worth $2.6 million today.\n\nGiven its still fairly modest valuation and the growth potential in AI, it may not necessarily be too late to invest in Nvidia. Although the stock isn't likely to generate the same type of returns during the next decade as it did in the last one, it can still be an excellent buy.\n\nCelsius Holdings\n\nEnergy drink maker Celsius Holdings has also been a growth machine for investors over the past decade. Although the stock has been struggling this year as the company's sales growth rate slipped, this business has achieved significant growth over the years.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the past four quarters, the company has generated close to $1.5 billion in sales -- that's nearly five times the $314.3 million in revenue it reported back in 2021. The company was struggling with profitability at the time, and incurred losses as recently as 2022, but it's firmly in the black these days, with net earnings coming in at $241.3 million during its past four reported quarters.\n\nIf you invested $10,000 in this stock a decade ago and held on, your stake would be worth more than $1.7 million today. Combine that with another $10,000 investment in Nvidia made at the same time, and the value of these two holdings would approach $4.5 million. And if not for the recent sell-off in Celsius stock, your returns would have been even greater than that.\n\nThere's still a bullish case to be made for Celsius these days. Trading at a forward P/E of 26, it's not egregiously overvalued. And with it now being a more prominent name in the energy drink market, there's still room for it to go higher in the future, especially as it enters more international markets.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "What's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy With the Fed Cutting Rates?",
        "content": "Interest rates are at long last coming down as the Federal Reserve announced a significant 0.5% rate cut in September. More reductions in the interest rate are likely on the way.\n\nLower rates are usually viewed as good news for smaller businesses. However, they benefit huge corporations, too, including the market-leading group known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. What's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy with the Fed cutting rates?\n\nHow rate cuts could benefit the Magnificent Seven\n\nLet's first look at how lower interest rates could help the members of the Magnificent Seven. Three ways are the most important, in my view.\n\nFirst (and most obvious), lower interest rates reduce Magnificent Seven companies' borrowing costs. This makes it cheaper to refinance maturing debt. They also enable companies to fund new projects that could lead to future growth.\n\nSecond, lower rates can boost customer spending. This can happen whether the customers are individual consumers or organizations.\n\nThird, lower interest rates can lead to a weakening of the U.S. dollar. This benefits Magnificent Seven companies that export to other countries by making their products more competitive in international markets.\n\nEvaluating the Magnificent Seven\n\nRate cuts should help all of the Magnificent Seven stocks. However, some will benefit more than others.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has the most debt on its books in the group -- $157.8 billion. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) trail behind with debt of $101.3 billion and $97.8 billion, respectively. Lower rates could help these companies the most when it comes to reducing interest expenses when their debt matures (assuming rates are still lower at that point).\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) are in the middle of the pack, with debt totaling nearly $38 billion and $28.7 billion, respectively. Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) debt load is only $12.5 billion, while Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) debt of $10 billion is the lowest of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nI suspect that increases in customer spending fueled by lower interest rates would likely be most pronounced for the companies with the most expensive products. Tesla's electric vehicles can cost in the ballpark of $40,000 at the lowest, with the pricey models costing over $113,000.\n\nCompanies spend significant amounts to buy Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), too. Lower rates could especially help start-ups and smaller businesses afford to expand their artificial intelligence (AI) development efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft operate cloud service platforms that could benefit from increased customer spending, driven by lower rates. All three companies market consumer products that could see sales increase, as well. It's the same story for Apple and, to a lesser extent, Meta.\n\nApple and Tesla would arguably be helped the most by a weaker U.S. dollar. Sales outside the U.S. are greater for both companies than their U.S. sales. However, all of the other Magnificent Seven also have significant international sales.\n\nThe best Magnificent Seven stock to buy with falling rates\n\nI think that Amazon and Tesla will probably be helped the most by the Fed's rate cuts. Which is the better stock to buy? I'd go with Amazon.\n\nTesla is much more expensive than Amazon based on forward earnings multiples and facing increasing competition. Even worse, consumer interest in electric vehicles seems to be waning.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon's AWS cloud platform has a massive AI tailwind at its back. Advertising on Prime Video has become an important new growth driver for the company. Amazon's technology investments should continue to pay off in increased profitability for its e-commerce business. Project Kuiper, a new satellite internet service, is poised to be another new source of growth.\n\nAll of these would be positives for Amazon without lower interest rates. However, lower rates should put an extra bounce in the company's step -- and send its stock higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Processors and Graphics Chips Stocks Q2 Results: Benchmarking Allegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM)",
        "content": "Processors and Graphics Chips Stocks Q2 Results: Benchmarking Allegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM)\n\nThe end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let’s take a look at how processors and graphics chips stocks fared in Q2, starting with Allegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM).\n\nThe biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\n\nThe 9 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.9% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 12.9% below.\n\nAfter much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank’s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\n\nWhile some processors and graphics chips stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 4.9% since the latest earnings results.\n\nAllegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM)\n\nThe result of a spinoff from Sanken in Japan, Allegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM) is a designer of power management chips and distance sensors used in electric vehicles and data centers.\n\nAllegro MicroSystems reported revenues of $166.9 million, down 40% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 1.2%. Despite the top-line beat, it was still a slower quarter for the company with a decline in its operating margin.\n\n“We delivered results toward the higher end of our commitments while making progress on inventory rebalancing across the Automotive and Industrial markets. First quarter sales were $167 million, above the midpoint of our outlook, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.03, at the high end of our outlook,” said Vineet Nargolwala, President and CEO of Allegro.\n\nStory continues Allegro MicroSystems Total Revenue\n\nAllegro MicroSystems delivered the slowest revenue growth of the whole group. Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 10.2% since reporting and currently trades at $21.59.\n\nRead our full report on Allegro MicroSystems here, it’s free.\n\nBest Q2: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nFounded in 1993 by Jensen Huang and two former Sun Microsystems engineers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading fabless designer of chips used in gaming, PCs, data centers, automotive, and a variety of end markets.\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $30.04 billion, up 122% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 4.5%. The business had an exceptional quarter with a significant improvement in its inventory levels and an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS estimates. Nvidia Total Revenue\n\nNvidia delivered the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth among its peers. Although it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 4.8% since reporting. It currently trades at $119.64.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia?

It was a disappointing quarter as it posted underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decline in its operating margin.\n\nLattice Semiconductor delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group. As expected, the stock is down 5.4% since the results and currently trades at $51.95.\n\nRead our full analysis of Lattice Semiconductor’s results here.\n\nQorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO)\n\nFormed by the merger of TriQuint and RF Micro Devices, Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO) is a designer and manufacturer of RF chips used in almost all smartphones globally, along with a variety of chips used in networking equipment and infrastructure.\n\nQorvo reported revenues of $886.7 million, up 36.2% year on year. This number beat analysts’ expectations by 4.1%. It was a strong quarter as it also put up an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS estimates and a significant improvement in its operating margin.\n\nThe stock is down 13.8% since reporting and currently trades at $102.89.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Qorvo here, it’s free.\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nHaving been at the forefront of developing the standards for cellular connectivity for over four decades, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading innovator and a fabless manufacturer of wireless technology chips used in smartphones, autos and internet of things appliances.\n\nQualcomm reported revenues of $9.39 billion, up 11.1% year on year.

        "title": "2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Before They Soar as Much as 71% According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "The rise to prominence of artificial intelligence (AI) since early last year has been nothing short of phenomenal. The potential applications for generative AI continue to grow by leaps and bounds, and it has become clear that the companies at the cutting edge of this technology stand to profit from early adoption.\n\nLeading the pack are the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks, which have outpaced the broader market by a wide margin since the advent of AI at the start of last year (in order by returns, as of this writing):\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): Up 700% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): Up 379% Tesla: Up 120% Amazon: Up 109% Alphabet: Up 89% Microsoft: Up 75% Apple: Up 74%\n\nTo put those gains in the context of the overall market, the S&P 500 has increased 49% during that time, so the difference is stark.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that each of these companies is a leader in AI adoption and development. What is surprising is that a growing chorus on Wall Street -- which seldom agrees on anything -- is almost universal in its support of several of these stocks. And despite triple-digit gains, two of them still have a fair degree of upside ahead, according to select Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms: Implied upside 41%\n\nThe first stock with plenty of upside potential is Meta Platforms. The social media specialist has lately turned its gaze on the vast potential of generative AI, but the company has a long history of developing and deploying state-of-the-art algorithms.\n\nMeta has a treasure trove of user data from its multiple social media sites, which supplies the information necessary to develop its own large language models -- which form the foundation of generative AI. While the company doesn't have a cloud infrastructure service of its own to monetize its LLaMA AI, Meta hawks its AI models on the cloud platforms of its rivals -- for a fee.\n\nThe company makes the lion's share of its revenue from the advertising that appears on its social media platforms. To that end, Meta has also developed a suite of tools to help those advertisers succeed, helping secure its share of those ad dollars.\n\nDespite notching stock price gains of 379% since early last year (as of this writing), Wall Street remains firmly behind Meta. Just last week, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett assigned a Street-high price target of $811 and a buy rating on the shares. This represents potential upside of 41% compared to Tuesday's closing price.\n\nCrockett believes that Meta's unrivaled spending on virtual reality, augmented reality, and the Metaverse is a strength rather than a weakness. It gives the company \"an ability to make effective price/performance choices.\" He notes that Meta \"is uniquely delivering category products that could be described as leading in consumer adoption.\" He's also impressed with Meta's latest advances in AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe analyst isn't the only one bullish on Meta. Of the 64 analysts who covered the stock in June, 56 rated it a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling. Furthermore, Meta is selling for just 29 times earnings, a discount to the multiple of 30 for the S&P 500.\n\nMeta boasts more than 3.2 billion users that visit its social media platforms every day, giving the company a steady of ongoing stream of relevant data. It's the world's second-largest digital advertiser, which provides the company with plenty of cash flow to pursue its AI ambitions.\n\nAdd in the opportunity represented by AI, and it's no wonder Wall Street is enamored with Meta.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside 71%\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven stock with a boatload of potential is Nvidia. The chip specialist has been one of the biggest early beneficiaries of the AI revolution as its graphics processing units (GPUs) make the technology possible. Nvidia's processors have long been the gold standard for video games, cloud computing, data centers, and other forms of AI. The dawn of generative AI in early 2023 have resulting in triple-digit gains in its revenue, earnings, and stock price.\n\nIt's easy to understand why. Nvidia is the undisputed leader in the discrete desktop GPU space, controlling 88% of the market, according to data compiled by Jon Peddie Research. The company also continues to dominate the data center GPU market, with a mind-boggling 98% of the market last year, according to semiconductor analyst firm TechInsights. If that weren't enough, Nvidia dominates the market for machine learning -- an earlier branch of AI -- with 95% of that market, according to business analytics company CB Insights. This helps to illustrate that when it comes to the data center and AI market, Nvidia is the undisputed leader.\n\nDespite stock price gains of roughly 700% since the start of last year (as of this writing), Wall Street is still rallying around Nvidia. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann maintains a buy rating and Street-high price target of $200 on the stock. This represents potential upside of 71% compared to Tuesday's closing price.\n\nMosesmann believes the chipmaker's software -- which complements and accelerates its industry-leading processors -- doesn't get enough credit. \"We anticipate this software aspect will significantly increase in the next decade in terms of overall sales mix, with an upward bias to valuation due to sustainability,\" Mosesmann wrote.\n\nThe analyst isn't the only one bullish on Nvidia. Of the 60 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in September, 55 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nWhile some investors might be leery of Nvidia's valuation, that view is myopic. For Nvidia's fiscal 2026, which begins in February, analysts' consensus estimates are calling for earnings per share of $4.02. With a current share price of $117, that works out to roughly 29 times forward earnings, cheaper than the current multiple of 30 for the S&P 500.\n\nGiven the company's industry dominance and cutting edge technology, I think it's clearly a bargain.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $728,325!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "5 Super Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Heading Into 2025",
        "content": "The world's biggest technology companies are spending an enormous amount of money building data centers, and they are filling them with graphics processing chips (GPUs) designed for artificial intelligence (AI) development.\n\nGPUs are built for parallel processing, meaning they can handle large volumes of data and multiple workloads at once, which is key to training AI models and performing AI inference. Based on recent financial reports:\n\nMicrosoft spent $55.7 billion on capital expenditures (capex) during its fiscal 2024 year (ended June 30), most of which went toward AI data center infrastructure and chips. Amazon spent $30.5 billion on capex during the first half of 2024, mostly related to AI. Alphabet spent $25 billion on AI capex in the first half of 2024. Meta Platforms plans to spend between $37 billion and $40 billion on AI capex for the whole of 2024. Oracle spent $6.9 billion on AI capex in its fiscal 2024 year (ended May 31).\n\nMicrosoft, Amazon, Meta, and Oracle have explicitly said they plan to spend even more money in the coming year. That spells opportunity for the semiconductor industry, so here are five top chip stocks to buy heading into 2025. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWhen it comes to data center GPUs, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the undisputed leader. Its H100 GPU set the benchmark for the AI industry last year, and the company is now gearing up to ship an entirely new generation of chips based on its Blackwell architecture.\n\nBlackwell-based systems like the GB200 NVL72 will perform AI inference at up to 30 times the speed of equivalent H100 systems. Plus, individual GB200 GPUs are expected to sell for between $30,000 and $40,000 each, which is in line with what data center operators originally paid for the H100. In other words, Blackwell paves the way for a substantial improvement in cost efficiency for developers, who normally pay for computing capacity by the minute.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang expects Blackwell GPUs to start contributing billions of dollars to the company's revenue in the final quarter of fiscal 2025 (which runs from November to January), and shipments will scale up from there.\n\nNvidia is on track to generate an estimated $125.5 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2025, representing a 125% increase from the prior year. Its stock isn't cheap, but it does trade at a reasonable forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 29.1 when measured against the company's forecast fiscal 2026 earnings per share.\n\nSimply put, investors who are willing to hold Nvidia stock for at least the next 18 months are likely paying a reasonable price today.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Micron Technology\n\nMicron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) is a leading supplier of memory and storage chips for data centers, personal computers, and smartphones. In AI data center settings, memory chips complement GPUs by storing data in a ready state so it can be called upon instantly for training and inference. Since AI requires mountains of data to learn and improve, demand is soaring for more memory capacity.\n\nMicron's latest HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) 36 gigabyte (GB) units for the data center deliver up to 50% more capacity than any competing product today while consuming 20% less energy. It was selected to power Nvidia's H200 GPU, and potentially also its Blackwell GB200 GPUs. In fact, Micron is now completely sold out of HBM3E until 2026.\n\nBeyond the data center, every tier-1 manufacturer of Android-based smartphones uses Micron's LP5X DRAM memory. Many of them have launched AI-enabled devices this year with minimum memory capacity requirements doubling compared to their non-AI predecessors from last year. There is a similar trend in personal computing, with most AI-enabled PCs launching with a minimum DRAM capacity of 16GB compared to 12GB last year.\n\nHigher memory requirements directly translate into more revenue for Micron. In its recent fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Aug. 29), the company's revenue surged 93% year over year to $7.7 billion, and it's forecasting more strength to come.\n\n3. Axcelis Technologies\n\nAxcelis Technologies(NASDAQ: ACLS) isn't a semiconductor producer. Instead, it makes ion implantation equipment which is critical to the fabrication process for central processing units (CPUs), memory chips, and power devices that regulate the flow of electric power in high-current applications.\n\nAI data centers have become a new opportunity for power device makers (and Axcelis' equipment) because they consume substantial amounts of energy. Some of Axcelis' customers have started using trench MOFSET (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) power devices with a silicon carbide chemistry, which is more robust and heat-efficient than traditional silicon chemistries. Silicon carbide power devices are more implant intensive, which is a direct tailwind for Axcelis' business.\n\nAdditionally, Axcelis is benefiting from the growing demand for high-capacity memory chips in the data center, computers, and smartphones. As manufacturers of memory chips expand production to meet that demand, they will need more of Axcelis' equipment, and the company has already started building inventory in anticipation for a strong 2025.\n\nIn fact, Axcelis' guidance suggests 2025 could be the strongest year in the company's history with a record $1.3 billion in revenue potentially in the cards.\n\n4. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is a multifaceted AI organization with a presence in semiconductors, equipment, cybersecurity, cloud software, and more. Its semiconductor business is the focus for investors right now because several of its products are experiencing significant demand from companies building AI infrastructure.\n\nBroadcom makes AI accelerators (data center chips) for hyperscale customers (which typically include Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet). During its recent fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Aug. 4), the company said that business grew by a whopping three-and-a-half times compared to the year-ago period. Similarly, it saw fourfold sales growth in its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI Ethernet switches for the data center. These regulate how quickly data flows from one point to another.\n\nComing into Q3, Broadcom is expected to deliver $51 billion in total revenue for fiscal 2024, with $11 billion attributable to AI. However, following the strong results I just highlighted, the company revised those numbers higher to $51.5 billion and $12 billion, respectively.\n\nBroadcom is currently knocking on the door of the exclusive $1 trillion club, which is home to just six U.S. technology giants right now.\n\n5. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) is one of the world's top chip suppliers in the consumer electronics industry. Its hardware can be found in everything from Sony's PlayStation 5 to the infotainment systems in Tesla's electric vehicles. However, the company is now trying to compete with Nvidia in the data center segment with its new MI300 GPUs.\n\nThe MI300 was designed as an alternative to Nvidia's H100, and it's attracting top customers like Oracle, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. However, with Nvidia set to launch its Blackwell lineup, AMD is already gearing up to release a faster GPU called the MI350 next year. It will be based on a new architecture called Compute DNA (CDNA) 4, which could deliver 35 times more performance than CDNA 3 chips like the MI300. AMD intends for this architecture to compete directly with Blackwell.\n\nAMD is already a leader in AI chips for the personal computing segment, with an estimated market share of 90%. It recently launched the Ryzen AI 300 series for notebooks, which features the fastest neural processing unit (NPU) in the industry. The company says more than 100 platforms will launch with those chips from leading PC manufacturers like Asus, Acer, HP Inc., and more.\n\nAMD is coming off a whopping 115% year-over-year growth in its data center revenue and 49% growth in its client segment revenue (which is home to Ryzen AI chips) in the second quarter of 2024. But the AI revolution is just getting warmed up, so the best might still be to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – October 4, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM and Accenture ACN.\n\nAI News: Blackwell Demand, OpenAI Raise\n\nWill the AI Sugar High Wear Off?\n\nSince OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot became the fastest-growing consumer app in history, big tech companies have been spending money furiously in hopes of profiting from the coming artificial intelligence (AI) revolution or at least avoiding being disrupted by it.\n\n“I am telling you, the world’s first trillionaires are going to come from somebody who masters AI and all its derivatives and applies it in ways we never thought of.” ~ Mark Cuban\n\nDespite Wall Street’s concerns of an AI bubble or an overhyped innovation, several of the world’s brightest tech minds, and those who participated in the last meteoric technological revolution have weighed in. Everyone whose anyone in tech, from Peter Thiel to Bill Gates to Elon Musk has weighed in on AI and believes the hype is real.\n\nMag 7 AI Spending Explodes\n\n“Magnificent Seven” stocks have trounced the broader market regarding earnings growth and stock prices. The success of America’s big tech juggernauts has led to massive cash hoards.\n\nNevertheless, big tech CEOs are not resting on their laurels regarding the next big revolution. In fact, the largest tech firms spent an eye-popping $100 billion on AI during the first six months of 2024 alone (up nearly 50% vs. 2023). However, with little in the way of revenue to show for the spending, many analysts on Wall Street are wondering if the expenditure will slow down, leading to an AI stock correction.\n\nJensen Huang Blackwell Update\n\nTo answer those concerns, no better AI proxy exists than Nvidia, the undisputed AI leader. In a television interview Thursday, CEO Jensen Huang quelled concerns. Huang updated investors on Blackwell, Nvidia’s most sophisticated and next generation chip, saying that demand for it is “insane.” He also divulged that Blackwell is in “full production” after a brief delay attributed to Nvidia supplier Taiwan Semiconductor.\n\nAccenture, Nvidia Ink Landmark Partnership\n\nHuang’s primary reason for making the TV appearance was to tout the company’s deal with consulting giant Accenture. Accenture will leverage Nvidia’s AI suite to scale its AI applications, spur innovation, drive efficiency, and cut costs.\n\nOpenAI Valuation Swells to $150 Billion\n\nIn other news, OpenAI officially changed its business structure from a non-profit to a for profit entity last week. This week, OpenAI announced a successful fresh round of funding that values the start-up at $150 billion. Cathie Wood’s Ark is one notable investor who reportedly participated in the round.\n\nArk, best known for investing in disruptors, invested $250 million in OpenAI. A recent chart shared by Ark Invest shows that large language models like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Bing are potentially eating into Google’s dominant search engine share.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMany Wall Street analysts are concerned that the AI spending sugar high will wear off. However, Nvidia’s “insane demand” and OpenAI’s massive valuation suggest that the bull market in AI spend is unlikely to subside soon.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Oil Stocks To Watch As Middle East Conflict Intensifies",
        "content": "Crude oil futures surged as much as 5% in Thursday’s intraday session after President Biden said his administration would support Israel striking Iran's oil facilities, adding that the option is being discussed. Brent crude for November delivery gained 4.8% to trade at $77.44 per barrel at 12.50 pm ET while WTI crude was changing hands at $73.65 per barrel after gaining 5.1%.\n\nCiti analysts have provided estimates that a major strike by Israel on Iran's export capacity could take 1.5M bbl/day of crude off the market, while an attack on downstream assets and other relatively minor infrastructure such as could take out 300K-450K bbl/day. According to ANZ Bank, Iran's oil output hit a six-year high of 3.7M bbl/day in August.\n\nMeanwhile, Clearview Energy Partners has predicted that oil prices could gain as much as $28/bbl if flows are blocked in the Strait of Hormuz; $13/bbl if Israel strikes Iranian energy infrastructure and $7/bbl if the U.S. and its allies placed economic sanctions on Iran.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if the latest developments will finally snap oil markets out of their seemingly never-ending bearish stupor. As commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have noted, oil markets are going through a period of major dislocations wherein oil price movements are largely unrelated to changes in fundamentals, with market behavior over the past few weeks suggesting this dislocation is likely to continue. Oil market sentiment is exceptionally weak, with the number of short positions held by money managers in Brent futures now exceeding the number of longs for the first time on record.\n\nRelated: Nigeria Looks To Jumpstart Natural Gas Sector with Tax Cuts\n\nLuckily for the bulls, this trend clearly is not sustainable, with the extreme positioning raising the risk of a sharp unwind. Here are some oil and gas stocks that have been outperforming not only the energy sector but the market in general.\n\n#1 Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP)\n\nMarket Cap: $33.6B\n\nYear-to-Date Returns: 79.0%\n\nTexas-based Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP) owns general and limited partner interests in a limited partnership that provides midstream natural gas and natural gas liquid services. The company gathers, compresses, treats, processes, and sells natural gas. TRGP has earned a Buy recommendation from Goldman Sachs thanks to a strong return on equity (or ROE).\n\n“Stronger-than-expected economic growth represents the clearest upside risk to ROE. [It] would create upside to asset turnover through faster sales growth and to profit margins through operating leverage. Stronger growth has recently coincided with hotter-than-expected inflation, however,” wrote GS analyst David J. Kostin. “\n\nStory continues\n\nGS estimates that Targa Resources will be able to grow its ROE by 17% in the current year. TRGP has been an exceptional performer and is currently trading at a decade-high with only Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) boasting a higher return amongst the famous FAANG group of stocks.\n\n#2 The Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB)\n\nMarket Cap: $58.1B\n\nYear-to-Date Returns: 38.1%\n\nThe Williams Companies Inc. (NYSE:WMB) is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in the United States, operating 33,000 miles of pipelines in total, which it says account for a third of the transported gas in the U.S. The company has been posting solid results, with the recent pop in electricity demand growth, particularly from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, likely to keep demand for the company’s gas pipelines high.\n\nWMB has continued to expand its gas infrastructure. Earlier in the year, the company completed the purchase of facilities with transport links from Hartree Partners for $1.95 billion. The gas assets include six underground natural gas storage facilities in Louisiana and Mississippi with a total capacity of 115B cf, 30 pipeline interconnects to attractive markets including connections to Transco, and 230 miles of gas transmission pipeline. Transco is the largest U.S. natural gas transmission pipeline\n\n\"Importantly, this storage will also allow us to provide value to customers in markets with growing renewables adoption as daily peaks for natural gas increases the need for storage,\" Williams President and CEO Alan Armstrong said in a press release.\n\n#3 ONEOK Inc. (NYSE:OKE)\n\nMarket Cap: $54.6B\n\nYear-to-Date Returns: 34.7%\n\nTulsa, Oklahoma-based ONEOK Inc. (NYSE:OKE) is another midstream infrastructure company that engages in the processing, storage, transportation, and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids.\n\nSimilar to its peers, ONEOK has been looking to expand its gas assets through mergers. The company has announced the acquisition of 43 percent of Enlink's outstanding common units for $14.90 per unit and 100% of the interests in the managing member for $300 million, for a total cash consideration of approximately $3.3 billion. The acquisition includes a crude infrastructure platform capable of processing 1.7 billion cubic feet per day of Permian gas and 1.6 million barrels per day of Permian crude gathering capacity.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Morgan Stanley upgraded OKE shares to Overweight from Equal Weight with a $111 price target, up from $103 (17.3% upside), expecting a positive estimate revision cycle over the next year. Morgan Stanley's Devin McDermott expects the company to achieve strong execution in growth and synergy realization with EnLink and Medallion, following strong execution in integrating the Magellan acquisition.\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\n\nOil Price Rally Continues Despite U.S. Inventory Build Russia Not Confirming Reports of Energy Sector Nationalization Plans Oil Explodes 4% Amid Talk of Israel Attacking Iranian Oil & Gas\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "ETFs in Focus as Cerebras Systems Plans IPO Amid AI Chip Boom",
        "content": "Cerebras Systems is preparing to go public during a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, aiming to become the first chip maker to debut in this environment. The company recently filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and plans to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker CBRS. However, Cerebras has not yet disclosed the timing or financial details of the IPO.\n\nIf Cerebras Systems goes public, Cerebras Systems stock may find a place in semiconductor ETFs like VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF FTXL and SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF XSD. Renaissance IPO ETF IPO may also include the Cerebras stock in its portfolio.\n\nBusiness Model and Competitive Position\n\nCerebras \"design(s) processors for AI training and inference,\" the filing said, as quoted on investors.com. \"We build AI systems to power, cool and feed the processors data. We develop software to link these systems together into industry-leading supercomputers that are simple to use, even for the most complicated AI work.\"\n\nCerebras markets its chips as alternatives to NVIDIA’s NVDA AI-focused hardware. While NVIDIA and other major players like Advanced Micro Devices AMD dominate the AI chip market, Cerebras has drawn some notable supporters, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who is an investor. The company has experienced rapid growth, reporting a revenue jump from $24.6 million in 2022 to $78.7 million in 2023. In the first half of 2024, its revenues soared to $136.4 million, per barrons.com.\n\nAny Challenge?\n\nDespite revenue gains, Cerebras remains unprofitable, with a net loss of $127.2 million in 2023. This was an improvement from its $177.7 million loss in 2022. The company continues to face challenges in customer diversification, with its largest client, Abu Dhabi-based G42, making up 87% of its revenues in the first half of 2024.\n\nOne of Cerebras' biggest hurdles is its limited presence among U.S. tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta Platforms, who are significant customers of NVIDIA. While Cerebras claims to be in discussions with large U.S. hyperscalers, it has yet to secure substantial deals in this space.\n\nCompeting With Nvidia\n\nCerebras faces stiff competition from NVIDIA, which dominates the AI chip market by offering not just chips but a full-stack solution, including supercomputers, processor connections, networking and crucial software for AI workloads.\n\nIPO Market Conditions\n\nCerebras' decision to go public comes during a slow recovery in the IPO market. Though IPO activity has increased in 2024, it remains below the highs of 2021. Despite this, we can expect AI-related businesses to generate significant investor interest.\n\nStory continues\n\nAny Future Threat to NVIDIA & AMD Stocks?\n\nCerebras is banking on its third-generation Wafer-Scale Engine, the largest chip ever sold, to distinguish itself from competitors. The company claims that the size of its chip allows for more efficient processing by reducing the need for data movement, which is both time-consuming and power-hungry.\n\nThe company projects that the market for AI-related chips and services will grow from $131 billion in 2024 to $452 billion by 2027, per investors.com. Cerebras believes that its unique approach and hardware will help it capture a significant market share from industry biggies like NVIDIA.\n\nBottom Line\n\nCerebras Systems aims to create a niche in the booming AI chip market, but it faces hurdles in scaling its business and competing with industry giants like NVIDIA. Its success will depend on securing a more diverse customer base.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Nvidia stock rises after Jensen Huang says demand for its new AI chips is 'insane'",
        "content": "Nvidia’s (NVDA) next-generation artificial intelligence chip is in full production, and demand for it is “insane,” according to CEO Jensen Huang.\n\n“Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first,” Huang said about the company’s highly anticipated AI platform, Blackwell, during a Wednesday evening appearance on CNBC.\n\nShares of the chipmaker were up almost 3% during midday trading Thursday. Nvidia’s stock has climbed over 152% so far this year.\n\nWhen the company reported second-quarter earnings in August, Huang said that the company had shipped samples of Blackwell to customers during the period and that Blackwell’s production will ramp up in the fourth quarter into fiscal year 2026.\n\nTo “improve production yield,” Nvidia made a change to Blackwell’s GPU mask, the chipmaker said. However, “there were no functional changes necessary,” Huang said on a call with analysts.\n\nIn early August, the chipmaker saw its shares fall after a report that Blackwell was delayed due to design flaws, possibly pushing deliveries back by at least three months. However, during its earnings call, Nvidia said it expects to “ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue,” in the fourth quarter. The company added that demand for its Hopper chips remains strong and that it expects shipments to increase in the second half of the fiscal year.\n\nHuang said demand for Blackwell, which he previously said “is well above supply,” was making customers “emotional” and “tense,” during an interview at Goldman Sachs’s (GS) technology conference in September.\n\n“At a time when the technology is moving so fast, it gives us an opportunity to triple down, to really drive the innovation cycle so that we can increase capabilities, increase our throughput, decrease our costs, decrease our energy consumption,” Huang said during his interview on CNBC (CMCSA). “We’re on a path to do that, and everything’s on track.”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Nvidia and TSMC Stocks Just Popped, but Intel Dropped Today",
        "content": "Semiconductors star Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shot higher on Thursday morning, rising nearly 5% before retreating to about a 3% gain as of 11:11 a.m. ET. According to CNBC, there's no great mystery as to why. Citing comments made on the network's own Closing Bell: Overtime broadcast, CNBC quoted CEO Jensen Huang saying demand for Nvidia's new Blackwell chip for artificial intelligence (AI) functions is going \"insane.\"\n\nOh, and Blackwell is still on schedule to go on sale in Q4, just a few months away.\n\nThe good news is having a (good) knock-on effect on Nvidia's contract chips manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), which is up 2%. However, it's having a less salutary effect on Nvidia rival Intel(NASDAQ: INTC). That stock is still down 0.9% after getting knocked for a 3.3% loss earlier in the day.\n\nCatalysts abound\n\nCommenting on how Blackwell might boost Nvidia yesterday, investment bank J.P. Morgan predicted this new chip will add \"several billion\" dollars to Nvidia's sales in Q4, as TheFly.com reports. Those sales should also ramp as production rates build, bringing additional billions to Nvidia and TSMC as well.\n\nBut that's not the only catalyst at work today. Yesterday, OpenAI announced it had just raised $6.6 billion in new cash \"to accelerate progress\" on its AI software. OpenAI specifically stated that some of this money would go toward \"increas[ing] compute capacity\" (i.e., buying AI chips, most likely from Nvidia, and with TSMC doing the grunt work).\n\nOn top of the extra revenues these two companies can expect to receive from OpenAI's chip purchases, Nvidia will also benefit from the growing valuation of OpenAI itself, in which it is an investor. At last report, this latest funding round grew OpenAI's private market value to $157 billion.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\n\nSo, what does this mean for Nvidia stock? Well, Nvidia next reports earnings on Nov. 19, and the outlook is good. Analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence forecast generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings to rise by better than 75% to $0.65 per share. Sales should be up 82% to $32.9 billion.\n\nWhat investors are really going to be looking at, though -- especially in light of these comments from J.P. Morgan and Huang himself -- is what kind of forecast Nvidia gives in its Q3 report for Q4. Right now, analysts think earnings growth will slow to only 43%, but if Blackwell sales cause growth to beat that number, things could be looking very bright indeed for Nvidia stock going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs TSMC stock a buy? And what about Intel?\n\nWhat's good news for Nvidia will likely be good news for Taiwan Semiconductor as well. And with TSMC stock selling for a much cheaper valuation than Nvidia (31 times trailing earnings versus 56 times), TSMC may be the smarter play on Nvidia's \"insane\" growth rate. It doesn't hurt, either, that TSMC manufactures chips for a whole lot of semiconductor companies not named Nvidia (Intel among them). So, if for some reason Blackwell is delayed or its growth doesn't pan out as planned, the effect on TSMC's revenues will be blunted.\n\nIn this respect, diversification can be a virtue.\n\nAll this being said, I see much less reason to feel optimistic about Intel. Priced at a steep 93 times earnings, it's the most expensive chips stock of the three and seems to be steadily losing ground to its archrival, Nvidia. Blackwell's on-time arrival in Q4 can only make things worse for Intel, I fear.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia stock surges as CEO touts ‘insane’ demand for new Blackwell AI chips",
        "content": "Nvidia is still the only game in town for companies spending hundreds of billions in the AI arms race—and both the firm's customers and investors are well aware of that. The latest reminder came on Thursday when, on an otherwise tough morning for stocks, Nvidia shares jumped over 3% after CEO Jensen Huang touted blistering demand for its next-generation Blackwell line.\n\nHuang’s comments on Wednesday coincided with a company announcement that it is partnering with IT consulting giant Accenture to sustain corporate AI adoption.\n\nNivida controls roughly 90% of the market for advanced AI chips. The company has been shipping as many of its now-famous GPUs, which are all but essential for firms training AI models, as it can make. Huang admitted earlier this month that managing customer relationships can be “emotional.”\n\nClients see acquiring Nvidia’s product as a zero-sum game: Chips bought by the competition are vital inputs they waste time waiting for. That’s likely even more true for the Blackwell chips, which are bigger and more powerful than those in the current “Hopper” lineup.\n\n“Blackwell is in full production, Blackwell is as planned, and the demand for Blackwell is insane,” Huang told CNBC on Wednesday. “Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.”\n\nReports of design flaws and engineering snags delaying Blackwell’s rollout may have weighed on the stock in recent months, but Nvidia is expected to begin selling the chips at the end of this year.\n\nThe insatiable demand should not be a surprise, Angelo Zino, a senior vice president and tech equity analyst at CFRA Research, recently told Fortune.\n\n“When you kind of look at the performance boost that you're getting on Blackwell versus Hopper, every hyperscaler is going to aggressively buy this stuff up,” he said, “not to mention enterprise customers and tier-two cloud players.”\n\nNvidia makes deal with Accenture to boost AI adoption\n\nThe Gen AI boom, of course, quickly made Nvidia, which has added more than $2 trillion to its market cap in just over a year, one of the world’s largest companies. The stock accounted for roughly 30% of the S&P 500’s gains in the first half of the year, with shares up over 154% year to date.\n\nA dip earlier in the month saw the company shed almost $300 billion in market cap over a single day, the biggest ever drop for an American company, which Zino attributed largely to a mix of both profit-taking and what he called “AI fatigue.” As tech giants tout the hundreds of billions they’ve recently spent on AI, some have questioned how long it will take for shareholders to see returns on that investment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are also worries about whether companies outside of Big Tech are prepared and have the resources to adequately invest in AI adoption, even as they fear being left behind.\n\n“The Fortune 500 is not ready for Gen AI, that's the real issue,” Ted Mortonson, a managing director and tech desk strategist at Baird, recently told Fortune. “So, we're building infrastructure right now, but if you look at even the Accenture numbers, they basically said that 10% of the Fortune 500 [has] moved to the cloud and [is] Gen AI ready.”\n\nNvidia’s partnership with Accenture, which Huang said had been in the works for four months, bolsters the company’s efforts to make AI tools more accessible to a broader set of clients.\n\nAs part of the new deal, Accenture will create what it calls an “NVIDIA Business Group,” which will consist of 30,000 employees focused on helping clients scale enterprise AI adoption and use tools like so-called “digital agents.” Accenture, which has credited $3 billion in new business to clients demanding help deploying Gen AI, saw its stock rise 2% Thursday morning.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Bank of America (BofA) analysts reiterated a Buy rating for AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock ahead of the company's “Advancing AI” event scheduled for October 10.\n\nAnalysts highlighted that AMD's previous AI event on December 6 was followed by significant stock gains of 19% and 80% over the subsequent one and three months, outperforming the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index index's 10% and 37% increases.\n\nThe upcoming event, where AMD is expected to unveil roadmap updates in AI and server CPU alongside supporting cloud customer comments, “could reinvigorate AMD stock,” which has seen a modest year-to-date (YTD) increase of 9%, lagging behind SOX's 22% rise.\n\nDespite the competitive landscape in AI accelerators becoming increasingly crowded, BofA highlighted the potential for AMD to increase its market share.\n\nThe current market consensus estimates AMD's AI sales to reach $5.1 billion in 2024, with a potential to double year-over-year to $10 billion in 2025.\n\nThe current consensus for AMD's AI sales in 2024-2026, estimated at $5.1 billion, $9.7 billion, and $12.8 billion, suggests the company’s market share in accelerators will likely remain around 5-7%, significantly lower than its 20%+ share in consumer CPUs and gaming GPUs.\n\nWhile AMD has made an impressive start, BofA cautions that expanding its share further could be challenging given NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominant 80-85%+ market share and strong position in the cloud, alongside competition from cost-optimized custom ASICs from companies like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL).\n\nHowever, if AMD can demonstrate a credible path to securing over 10% of the AI market share by 2026, it could add approximately $5 billion to its sales, with potential earnings per share (EPS) of around $8-$9, compared to the consensus estimate of $7.37.\n\n“Faster growth could also help AMD rerate towards 30-55x forward price-to-earnings (PE) it managed to trade during prior periods of rapid share gains and 40%+ annual sales growth,” BofA analysts said.\n\n“We expect AMD to emphasize its improving end-end positioning including recent acquisitions (ZT Systems, Silo AI), open-source software (ROCm) and networking (infinity fabric),” they added.\n\nBofA also reflected on the broader debates affecting AMD's stock performance, including competition from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), sluggish PC demand, rising competition from ARM-based servers and PC CPUs, challenges in raising prices for AI silicon, and the pace of recovery in non-AI embedded and gaming markets. These segments are crucial as they represent 20-25% of AMD's sales and are considered the most profitable yet cyclical.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAMD stock: Upcoming AI event ‘could be catch-up catalyst’, says BofA\n\nBlackstone seeks to raise at least $10 billion in new Asia PE fund, focusing on India, sources say\n\nUS stocks lower; jobless claims rise more than expected\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Ken Fisher’s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024. Since Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 7th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Ken Fisher regularly shares his investing wisdom on his YouTube channel, sharing market insights and lessons he’s learned over the decades. Commenting about the Fed’s rate cut, Fisher recently advised investors not to focus on what the central bank is doing and instead pay attention to long-term investing.\n\n“The fact is, and I’ve said this for a long time, I won’t live forever, but I hope to live a long time and keep saying it: central bankers are crazy.

We have analyzed the AI-related growth catalysts for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) Shines with Data Center Growth and New AI Chips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nBillionaire Ken Fisher’s Stake: $3,755,355,818\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) impressed Wall Street with solid second-quarter results amid strong data center revenue. Data center revenue in the period grew 49% year over year.\n\nBut can Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) continue gaining in the coming months? Analysts are hopeful amid the launch of its Instinct™ MI300 Series accelerators that are designed for AI and HPC workloads.  The new chip competes with Nvidia’s H100 AI chip. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) now plans to release new AI chips annually, including the MI325X in Q4 this year, the MI350 in 2025, and the MI400 in 2026. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) said MI350 would be a competitor to Nvidia’s Blackwell.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) data center business doubled its revenue but this growth was not at the cost of profits. The segment’s operating income increased by 405% compared to the year-earlier period. However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  data center business is still very small compared with NVDA. It generated about $2.8 billion in revenue vs. $22.6 billion in quarterly revenue for NVDA.  However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  CPU and GPU businesses are also thriving. Ryzen CPU sales increased 49% over year and slightly quarter over quarter. Although gaming revenue declined 59% due to decreased PlayStation and Xbox sales, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  Radeon 6000 GPUs saw a year-over-year sales increase.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  is trading 17% below its 3-year average P/E ratio. The company is estimated to grow its EPS by 43% in the long term, compared to 33% for Nvidia. During the third quarter, its revenue growth is expected to come in at 15% on a QoQ basis.  Amid growth forecasts based on new chips and an expected increase in AI spending by other companies, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) forward P/E of 38 makes the stock undervalued at the current levels.\n\nMeridian Contrarian Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.”\n\nOverall, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 7th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Ken Fisher’s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Faces Short-Term Setbacks but Long-Term Growth Remains Strong\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nBillionaire Ken Fisher’s Stake: $11,543,247,605\n\nNvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\n\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\n\nAt Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\n\nOf course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\n\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“If Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA’s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\n\nAs a result of the unusually strong stock price performance from NVIDIA and a few other large companies, equity markets have become increasingly concentrated. You can see this in the chart below, which shows that on 30 June, 27% of the market value of the 500 largest US companies was attributable to just five companies, more than twice the average of the last 20 years.\n\nThe composition of the Aoris International Fund will always be very different to that of the broader equity market. There will be periods, such as the most recent quarter, where this contributes to our performance lagging that of our benchmark. When it comes to NVIDIA and other AI-centric companies, rapid growth is exciting, but it makes it difficult for us to judge what is normal. Our preference is to own established leading companies where we can make a more confident, evidence-based judgement about their growth and profitability.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Ken Fisher’s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. insiders have cashed in on shares worth more than $1.8 billion so far this year — and more selling is on the horizon.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Corner Store Comeback A Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda’s Capital City Gang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon’s Fast-Growing Cities A 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai’s Sky-High Rents\n\nNearly 11 million shares have been sold by Nvidia executives and directors in 2024, the most in a year since at least 2020 after adjusting for stock splits, according to data compiled by the Washington Service. It represents a tiny percentage of the company’s 24.5-billion outstanding shares, but the sales are coming at a time when investors are already on edge about Nvidia’s delayed Blackwell chips and the longevity of artificial intelligence-related spending.\n\nMore sales are planned. While Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang recently completed the sale of 6 million shares under a pre-arranged trading plan, a trust controlled by director Mark Stevens has filed to sell 3 million additional shares, on top of the 1.6 million he sold this year prior to that filing.\n\nA representative for Nvidia declined to comment on insider sales.\n\n“It definitely doesn’t inspire confidence when you see that level of insider sales but I would definitely couch that in what else is going on,” said Mike Bailey, director of research at Fulton Breakefield Broenniman. For investors looking at whether now is a good time to buy Nvidia shares “this is probably one less reason for someone to make a new purchase.”\n\nThe biggest seller this year has been Huang, whose 10b5-1 plan was adopted in March. These plans pre-determine sales on certain dates and aren’t tied to news or share-price moves. There is typically a three-month waiting period before the first sale is allowed under a 10b5-1 plan.\n\nHuang unloaded about $713 million of shares between mid-June and mid-September under that plan — a period when Nvidia shares fell about 5% amid a rotation out of Big Tech and increased scrutiny of the AI frenzy.\n\nEven after executing the plan, Huang still holds Nvidia shares worth more than $100 billion.\n\nOther big sellers include Stevens and fellow director Tench Coxe, who have sold shares this year worth a total of about $390 million and $525 million, respectively.\n\nThere have been numerous other pressures on Nvidia shares in the past few months. The biggest factor has been concerns about how long heavy spending on AI computing will continue, according to Denny Fish, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We’ll get the verdict as we start getting into 2025 and see the numbers as Blackwell is released,” he said, referring to the new processor line which Nvidia has projected will contribute several billion dollars in sales in the fourth quarter.\n\nNvidia shares have been on a roller coaster ride since June, when the company’s market capitalization briefly topped Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. to become the world’s most valuable company. Since then, they’ve suffered two drawdowns of more than 20% amid concerns about tech giants’ spending on AI. Still, the stock has rallied back each time and is now about 10% from the June 18 peak.\n\nAnd while more insider selling is on the horizon, investors shouldn’t necessarily read sales — especially pre-planned ones — as a sign of bearishness.\n\n“Whether CEOs are buying or CEOs are selling in the long run, it’s not a really good correlation to how the stocks can perform,” said Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer at Mahoney Asset Management. “The CEO of Nvidia is not selling stock because he thinks the growth is slowing down. He thinks just the opposite.”\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nOpenAI has completed a deal to raise $6.6 billion in new funding, giving the artificial intelligence company a $157 billion valuation and bolstering its efforts to build the world’s leading generative AI technology. SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son sketched out one of the most aggressive timelines for the adoption of artificial intelligence yet, envisioning a near future where the technology would run entire households. Global semiconductor makers are monitoring supplies of high-purity quartz, a material critical to the industry, after Hurricane Helene halted production at two North Carolina mines that produce most of the world’s supply. US prosecutors are broadening a probe of potential price-fixing by German software maker SAP SE and tech reseller Carahsoft Technology Corp., seeking to examine the companies’ work with almost 100 government agencies, according to new court records that show the scope of the investigation is far greater than previously known.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAdam Neumann’s Latest Project Is a WeWork Competitor The Great €3 Billion Shipping Container Heist Elon Musk’s Role in Reanimating the Far-Right Term ‘Remigration’ How a Short Seller’s Attack Threatens This Spanish Family Company Sports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) remains under pressure as several key investor debates continue to swirl around the company's long-term outlook.\n\nAccording to Bank of America analysts, who maintain an Underperform rating with a $21 price target on the stock, Intel faces \"a unique confluence of competitive, financial, and strategic threats\" with no immediate positive catalyst on the horizon.\n\nOne of the biggest questions concerns Intel's manufacturing capability, according to the bank in a note.\n\nThey explain that the company's reliance on external foundries, such as TSMC, has grown as its ambitious \"5 nodes in 4 years\" roadmap struggles.\n\nIntel's success in developing its 18A process is seen as critical to its turnaround, but \"so far, there has been no external proof points of success,\" according to BofA.\n\nThe company's recent deal with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which some saw as a win, was described by BofA as \"a framework with no guarantees of any revenue.\"\n\nAnother debate centers on Intel's talent retention, especially in light of frequent restructuring.\n\nBofA highlights that Intel's revenue per employee, at $454,000 per year, significantly lags behind competitors like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), and TSMC.\n\nThey believe it suggests that the company may face challenges in retaining and attracting top talent, which could further hinder its recovery efforts.\n\nFree cash flow (FCF) generation is also a pressing concern. Intel's high operating and capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated, with BofA warning that the company \"would not work without a credible gross margin path to 50%+.\"\n\nIntel's current debt load of $53 billion adds further pressure on its ability to generate meaningful FCF, said BofA.\n\nLastly, the bank says Intel's position in the x86 CPU market is being challenged by the rising adoption of ARM processors in PCs and servers.\n\nBofA notes that ARM's market share in PCs could triple by 2028, further eroding Intel's dominance.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nIntel stock: These are the key investor debates\n\nAmazon plans to hire 250,000 workers for the holidays, same as last year\n\nUpcoming AI features to fuel stronger iPhone 16 demand: BofA\n\nView comments",

        "title": "This Incredibly Cheap Tech Stock Has Crushed Nvidia in the Past 3 Months, and It Is Still a Solid Buy",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in 2024, with stunning gains of 145% as of this writing, but the semiconductor giant's performance has been patchy over the past three months despite its impressive quarterly results.\n\nMore specifically, Nvidia stock has lost 2% of its value in this time frame. That may be attributed to various reasons, such as the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to keep driving elevated levels of growth for the company, the viability of AI to justify the huge amounts of money that corporations and governments are pouring into this technology, and the rich valuation that Nvidia commands.\n\nNow, a closer look at Nvidia's prospects suggests that those concerns may not hold much water in the long run. The company's focus on diversifying its business, as well as the sustained spending on AI infrastructure and software, are likely to help it keep growing at a healthy pace. However, investors who are looking for a cheaper AI alternative may want to look at options beyond Nvidia to invest their money.\n\nThis is where Check Point Software Technologies(NASDAQ: CHKP) comes in. The Israeli cybersecurity specialist has jumped 17% in the past three months, outshining Nvidia's returns by a big margin. Let's see why that has been the case and check if this company has the potential to sustain its impressive rally.\n\nCheck Point Software's steady growth has been driving its recent rally\n\nCheck Point Software may not be as well known as other cybersecurity providers such as Palo Alto Networks or CrowdStrike because of its slow pace of growth, but a closer look at the company's recent financial performance tells us that it is moving in the right direction.\n\nThe company released its second-quarter results back in July, reporting a 7% year-over-year increase in revenue to $627 million. Its adjusted earnings increased by 8% from the same period last year to $2.17 per share. The numbers exceeded the midpoint of the company's revenue forecast of $622 million and earnings per share estimate of $2.15 per share.\n\nCheck Point attributed its stronger-than-expected performance to the healthy growth of its security subscription business, which is being driven by the growing adoption of its AI-powered Infinity security platform that recorded double-digit revenue growth in the previous quarter. Check Point management pointed out on the company's July earnings conference call that the increased bookings from the Infinity platform are driving an improvement in its billings.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company says that it struck \"nice eight-figure deals in Infinity,\" a momentum that's likely to continue thanks to the growing usage of AI within the cybersecurity space. The company is offering multiple AI-focused tools such as a generative AI assistant known as Infinity AI Copilot that is aimed at helping reduce the time taken to perform administrative tasks and improve the effectiveness of cybersecurity analysts.\n\nIt also offers another product known as Infinity ThreatCloud AI, using which organizations can completely automate their firewalls using real-time data. More importantly, Check Point says that it plans to come up with a new AI-focused offering every quarter. That's a smart thing to do as the market for generative AI-based cybersecurity products is expected to generate $40 billion in revenue by 2030 as compared to an estimated $7 billion this year.\n\nSo Check Point's focus on generative AI-based cybersecurity could eventually help improve its growth rate in the future. It is worth noting that the company's security subscriptions business recorded 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the previous quarter to $272 million, accounting for 43% of its top line. That was an improvement over the prior-year period, when subscriptions accounted for 40% of its top line.\n\nThe faster growth of the subscription business and the potential room for growth here suggest that Check Point could be poised for stronger growth going forward. Not surprisingly, the company is expected to deliver double-digit earnings growth over the next couple of years, following this year's estimated jump of 8% (it delivered $8.42 per share in earnings in 2023). CHKP EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe valuation makes the stock an attractive bet right now\n\nCheck Point is trading at 27 times trailing earnings. Its forward earnings multiple of 19 points toward a significant improvement in the company's bottom line. The stock is currently cheaper than the Nasdaq-100 index's earnings multiple of 31 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks), which means that investors are getting a good deal on the stock right now.\n\nWhat's more, the company has a solid balance sheet with just $36 million in debt and a cash position of $1.66 billion. Assuming Check Point's bottom line does increase to $11.12 per share in 2026, as per the chart, and it trades at 31 times earnings at that time (in line with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple), its stock price could jump to $345. That would be a 78% increase from current levels.\n\nSo investors looking for an attractively valued tech stock that could capitalize on the growing adoption of AI and deliver healthy gains in the long run can consider buying Check Point as it looks all set to jump higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Check Point Software Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Check Point Software Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Check Point Software Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nThe CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday that demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips was \"insane\".\n\nHuang said that Nvidia's AI Blackwell chips were now in \"full production\", following much speculation about the production of the chips.\n\nShares were up 1.5% in pre-market trading on Thursday morning.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks mixed as BoE governor points to 'more aggressive' rate cuts\n\nHuang was speaking alongside Accenture (ACN) CEO Julie Sweet, with the two businesses having announced details of their expanded partnership on Wednesday.\n\nThis included Accenture's formation of an Nvidia Business Group, which the professional services company said was aimed at helping businesses \"rapidly scale their AI adoption\".\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia was widely reported to be one of the investors in the $6.6bn (£5bn) new funding raised by Chat-GPT maker OpenAI, which the company said took its valuation up to $157bn.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nTech company Microsoft was said to be another investor behind OpenAI's latest fund raise, having already been a major backer of the AI company.\n\nMicrosoft also unveiled PC updates to its Copilot AI platform at a press event on Tuesday.\n\nNew features include Copilot Voice, which is designed to let users speak directly to their PC and for it to respond.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\n“We think that Copilot Voice is going to be really a big unlock in terms of how you interface with technology,” Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi told Yahoo Finance.\n\nAnother feature that Microsoft is working on is called Copilot Vision which will allow the platform to see what users are doing on their screen and answer questions and make suggestions based on the content they’re viewing.\n\nDespite this shares saw little movement on Wednesday, closing less than 1% in the red.\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nElectric carmaker Tesla closed Wednesday's session 3.5% in the red, after it announced third-quarter deliveries that missed expectations.\n\nTesla delivered 462,890 vehicles in the three months ending 30 September, which was up 6.4% quarter-over-quarter and did mark the first quarter of delivery growth this year. However, Wall Street had expected the business to deliver a figure closer to 463,900 according to Bloomberg.\n\n\"The stock’s been on a booming run of late, so anything short of knockout results was always likely to draw more attention than usual,\" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, who does hold Tesla shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Pound, gold and oil prices in focus: commodity and currency check\n\n\"Taking a step back, deliveries returning to growth was the most important thing to come from today’s numbers, especially given the major push on promotions and financing terms to stimulate demand in a tricky auto market,\" he said.\n\nAttention now turns to Tesla's robotaxi event on 10 October, when EV maker will showcase its fully autonomous taxi.\n\nBritzman said that with the stock \"still up around 20% in the last month, there’s a lot of expectation and volatility going into and coming out of the event is pretty much nailed on.”\n\nLevi Strauss & Co (LEVI)\n\nShares in denim maker Levi Strauss & Co were down nearly 11% in pre-market trading on Thursday morning, after the company trimmed revenue guidance.\n\nIn its third-quarter results, the company said it expected net revenues to grow by around 1% for the 2024 fiscal year. This was lower than the guidance given in its second-quarter results, when it expected net revenues for the year to grow between 1% and 3%.\n\nLevi's also said net revenues were flat in the third quarter at $1.5bn.\n\nThe company posted an operating margin 2% in the third quarter, which was slightly lower than the 2.3% it recorded for the same period last year, but pointed out that included an impairment charge of $111m relating its acquisition of activewear brand Beyond Yoga.\n\nLevi's said it had also initiated a review into alternatives for the Dockers clothing brand, \"which could include a potential sale or other strategic transaction\".\n\n“Looking to Q4 and beyond, we will amplify our focus on the Levi’s® brand, exemplified by our new campaign with Beyoncé and an innovative product pipeline designed to build momentum with our fans around the world,\" said Michelle Gass, president and CEO of Levi Strauss & Co.\n\nTesco (TSCO.L)\n\nUK supermarket Tesco raised its guidance on adjusted operating profits for the year to around £2.9bn, up from \"at least £2.8bn\", on the back of strong first-half results.\n\nTesco reported group sales were up 3.5% in the first half to £31.5bn, compared to the same period last year, while adjusted operating profits had risen nearly 16% to close to £1.7bn.\n\nKen Murphy, CEO of Tesco, said the supermarket had been the \"cheapest full-line grocer for nearly two years\".\n\nThat said, the supermarket had seen greater demand for its Finest premium products, with volumes up nearly 15% year-on-year and over 20 million customers shopping the range in the first half of its fiscal year.\n\nRead more: How to protect your investments in unstable markets\n\nAhead of the Christmas season, Murphy said the supermarket was in \"good shape, with volume growth delivering strong financial performance\".\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \"The challenge put forward by the German discounters hasn’t gone away, but Tesco has managed to absorb it in a way which other mid-market groceries outfits like Asda and Morrisons have found more difficult.\n\n\"The growing appetite for its Finest range also suggests it may be starting to appeal to shoppers who previously would have frequented higher end rivals.”\n\nShares were up nearly 3% on Thursday morning following the release of the results.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Before Oct. 7?",
        "content": "Investors have flocked to artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in recent times thanks to the technology's promise of revolutionizing everything from our daily lives to how businesses are run. And we're just at the beginning of this high-growth story. Today's $200 billion market is forecast to reach beyond $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nAll of this has translated into double-digit gains this year for many companies that support the development of AI -- or are developing AI themselves. At the head of the pack is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The global AI chip leader has seen its stock price soar about 135% so far this year. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the fastest on the market, and customers have recognized this, helping push Nvidia's revenue to triple-digit gains quarter after quarter.\n\nIt's no surprise that Nvidia shareholders and potential investors closely watch this company's every move for clues about what's ahead -- and use this to make investing decisions. And now, they may be looking to Nvidia's AI Summit beginning Oct. 7 as a potential catalyst. Should you buy Nvidia stock before the event? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Nvidia AI Summit\n\nFirst, a few details about the summit. It's happening on site in Washington D.C. as well as virtually from Oct. 7 through Oct. 9. The event is looking like a popular one because general conference passes are sold out at this point -- but limited quantities of exhibit-only passes still are available as of this writing.\n\nAt the summit, I wouldn't expect updates on Nvidia's latest products or announcements of new products or services. Instead, this event is designed to show exactly how the company's technology -- and AI in general -- is revolutionizing many industries. A variety of speakers, from Nvidia's own vice president of enterprise platforms Bob Pette to The Weather Company's chief executive officer Sheri Bachstein will talk about the latest AI developments.\n\nWhile this event probably won't offer us news about Nvidia's upcoming release of its new Blackwell architecture, for example, it will give investors some important information. And this is how AI actually is being used right now. Topics to be covered include cybersecurity, robotics, healthcare, and many more. Nvidia's event also will feature live demos such as Earth-2, the company's climate forecasting tool.\n\nAll of this is a big plus for Nvidia because it shows AI isn't just a technology of hopes and dreams, but it actually is in use and driving major results across industries today. This should lead to ongoing revenue for Nvidia, as it sells the tools and services necessary to keep this progress going, and that's positive news for Nvidia shareholders and potential shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs this a catalyst for Nvidia stock?\n\nNow, let's get back to our question: Should you buy Nvidia shares before Oct. 7? While the AI Summit may put Nvidia in the spotlight next week, I don't expect it to act as a catalyst for stock performance. What generally drives the stock's performance is news regarding product releases, earnings reports, or economic news that could affect the company -- positively or negatively.\n\nAll of this means it won't make much of a difference if you buy Nvidia shares today or after Oct. 7, especially if you hold on for the long term. Day-to-day fluctuations won't change your overall return if you hang on to the shares for five or 10 years.\n\nSo, the next question is: Whether you make the move now or in a few days, is Nvidia really a buy? After all, the stock has roared higher not only this year, but for quite some time. It's gained 2,500% over five years.\n\nThough Nvidia shares, at 41 times forward earnings estimates, aren't the cheapest around, they're worth the price considering the company's earnings track record, solid market position, and focus on innovation to keep it in the lead. Nvidia shares may not continue at the same pace uninterrupted -- stocks don't rise in a straight line forever -- but Nvidia still has plenty of room to run over the long term. And that makes Nvidia a fantastic AI stock to buy today -- or after next week's AI summit.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Spotting Winners: AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) And Processors and Graphics Chips Stocks In Q2\n\nQuarterly earnings results are a good time to check in on a company’s progress, especially compared to its peers in the same sector. Today we are looking at AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and the best and worst performers in the processors and graphics chips industry.\n\nThe biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\n\nThe 9 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.9% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 12.9% below.\n\nAfter much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank’s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\n\nAmidst this news, processors and graphics chips stocks have had a rough stretch. On average, share prices are down 5.5% since the latest earnings results.\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nFounded in 1969 by a group of former Fairchild semiconductor executives led by Jerry Sanders, Advanced Micro Devices or AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the leading designers of computer processors and graphics chips used in PCs and data centers.\n\nAMD reported revenues of $5.84 billion, up 8.9% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 2%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with a significant improvement in its gross margin.\n\n“We delivered strong revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter driven by record Data Center segment revenue,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su.

The business had an exceptional quarter with a significant improvement in its inventory levels and an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS estimates. Nvidia Total Revenue\n\nNvidia achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth among its peers. Although it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 4.8% since reporting.

It was a disappointing quarter as it posted underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decline in its operating margin.\n\nLattice Semiconductor delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group. As expected, the stock is down 5.4% since the results and currently trades at $51.95.\n\nRead our full analysis of Lattice Semiconductor’s results here.\n\nQorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO)\n\nFormed by the merger of TriQuint and RF Micro Devices, Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO) is a designer and manufacturer of RF chips used in almost all smartphones globally, along with a variety of chips used in networking equipment and infrastructure.\n\nQorvo reported revenues of $886.7 million, up 36.2% year on year. This print surpassed analysts’ expectations by 4.1%. It was a strong quarter as it also put up an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS estimates and a significant improvement in its operating margin.\n\nThe stock is down 13.8% since reporting and currently trades at $102.89.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Qorvo here, it’s free.\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nHaving been at the forefront of developing the standards for cellular connectivity for over four decades, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading innovator and a fabless manufacturer of wireless technology chips used in smartphones, autos and internet of things appliances.\n\nQualcomm reported revenues of $9.39 billion, up 11.1% year on year.

        "title": "Wall Street's Newest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Split Has Arrived -- and It's Following in the Footsteps of Nvidia and Broadcom",
        "content": "For the better part of two years, Wall Street and the investing community have been captivated by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The prospect of AI-driven software and systems having the capacity to learn and evolve over time comes with eye-popping dollar signs.\n\nBut it's not just AI that's helped lead the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and growth-powered Nasdaq Composite to multiple record-closing highs in 2024. Stock-split euphoria has also been a defining catalyst. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA stock split is a tool publicly traded companies can lean on that gives them the option of superficially adjusting their share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. Splits are surface scratching in the sense that they don't impact a company's market cap or its operating performance.\n\nSince this year began, a little over a dozen prominent businesses have announced or completed a stock split, four of which are high-flying AI stocks. Although most investors have been eyeing the two leading businesses in the artificial intelligence arena, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), today, Oct. 3, marks the arrival of Wall Street's newest AI stock-split stock.\n\nNvidia and Broadcom have monopolized Wall Street's attention in 2024 -- and with good reason\n\nFor much of the year, Nvidia and Broadcom have been the center of both the AI revolution and stock-split euphoria. Nvidia completed its largest-ever forward split, 10-for-1, following the close of trading on June 7. Meanwhile, Broadcom enacted its first-ever split, also 10-for-1, when trading ended on July 12.\n\nThere are valid reasons both companies have been the center of attention in 2024.\n\nIn the relative blink of an eye, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) became the overwhelming top choice by enterprise data centers. The analysts at TechInsights estimate that 2.67 million GPUs were shipped to data centers in 2022, along with 3.85 million in 2023. Nvidia is responsible for roughly 98% of these shipments, with the company's H100 GPU (commonly known as the \"Hopper\") seeing backlogged demand.\n\nOne of the great things about demand swamping supply is that it tends to have a positive impact on pricing power. Nvidia's Hopper has been commanding roughly $30,000 to $40,000 per chip, which represents a 100% to 300% premium to competing AI-GPUs. For Nvidia, it's meant a rapid increase in its gross margin.\n\nTo boot, Nvidia's CUDA software platform has done its job in keeping businesses loyal to its product and service ecosystem. CUDA is the toolkit used by developers to maximize the computing capacity of their Nvidia GPUs, as well as to build large language models.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom's newfound popularity has everything to do with the role it's playing in AI networking. The company's products, such as the Jericho3-AI fabric, are capable of connecting large quantities of GPUs to reduce tail latency -- a critical aspect of the split-second decision-making required of AI-driven systems -- and maximize the computing ability of AI-GPUs. The lion's share of Broadcom's growth can be traced to its AI networking solutions.\n\nBut it's important to recognize that the sum of Broadcom's parts is much more than just AI networking solutions. For instance, it's a core supplier of wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. Broadcom also provides optical components for industrial equipment, networking solutions for new vehicles, and cybersecurity solutions via Symantec, which it acquired in 2019.\n\nWhile Nvidia and Broadcom have rightly held the attention of investors, Wall Street's newest AI stock split is ready for its moment to shine. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWall Street's newest artificial intelligence stock split has arrived\n\nEarlier this week, following the close of trading on Sept. 30, customizable rack server and storage solutions specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) completed a 10-for-1 forward split. Although Super Micro's stock has soared since 2023 began, its shares have come under pressure following the release of a short-seller report from Hindenburg Research, which the company has refuted. Additionally, reports suggest the U.S. Justice Department is in the early stages of probing the company's accounting practices.\n\nBut Super Micro isn't the only AI stock split of significance for investors this week.\n\nFollowing the close of trading on Oct. 2, semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment provider Lam Research(NASDAQ: LRCX) followed in the footsteps of Nvidia and Broadcom and completed a 10-for-1 forward split. This marks the company's third stock split since going public in May 1984, and is its first since March 2000!\n\nWhen shareholders check their portfolios today, Oct. 3, they'll see Lam Research trading closer to $80 per share after beginning the week at north of $800 per share. There's no question this split will make it easier for everyday investors who don't have access to fractional-share purchases to buy shares of Lam Research.\n\nAlthough Lam provides wafer fabrication equipment used in AI and non-AI solutions, it's getting most of it buzz right now for the role is plays in packaging high-bandwidth memory (HBM). HBM is a practical necessity in high-compute data centers for the high bandwidth and generally low power consumption that it provides. As demand for AI-GPUs increases, so should the need for HBM and Lam's equipment.\n\nThe consensus forecast from Wall Street pegs Lam's sales growth at 17% in fiscal 2025 (ended June 30, 2025), and nearly 19% the following year. Likewise, earnings per share (EPS) is expected to increase by annual average of 11% through fiscal 2029.\n\nLam's management team is backing up its aggressive growth forecasts with a plan to return between 75% and 100% of free cash flow to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and/or dividends.\n\nWhen the company initially announced plans to conduct a 10-for-1 split in May, it also unveiled a $10 billion share buyback that supplements existing repurchase authorizations. For companies with steady or growing net income, like Lam Research, buybacks have a tendency to boost EPS.\n\nBut the one concern to be mindful of is Lam Research's reliance on revenue from China. The June-ended quarter saw 39% of the company's $3.87 billion in net sales originate from the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. U.S. regulators haven't been shy about curbing exports of AI chips and related equipment to China over the last two years. The potential for U.S. regulators to impose a ceiling on Lam's overseas growth is a tangible concern that shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nNevertheless, today is all about Lam Research's moment in the sun as it begins trading at a split-adjusted price for the first time in almost a quarter of a century.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lam Research right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lam Research, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lam Research wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News Investors Probably Missed.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have been looking for smart ways to play the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has swept the global financial markets over the past two years. Most of the attention in this regard has been confined to obvious choices in semiconductors, software, and biotechnology. Even within these sectors, prominent companies and their AI initiatives have dominated headlines. However, there are several hidden gems within these sectors that offer the same bang for the buck, given present macro context, but are not in limelight as such. For example, Bernie Ahkong, an analyst at UBS, recently noted that the first phase of AI was interest towards chipmakers. In the second phase, investors moved towards the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centers. The present tilt towards utility and power firms is quite possibly the third phase of this AI focus.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nA recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Susquehanna analyst Chris Rolland recently released an investor note on the chipmaker, detailing that pricing on the Hopper line of products for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) had remained strong ahead of the upcoming Blackwell line. Per the analyst, aftermarket prices for the H100 had been relatively stable at slightly less than $30,000. down 0.6% in the third-quarter. He further added that there had not been any rise in H100 supply in the secondary market, suggesting that companies were holding on to their purchases. At current pricing and 70% utilization, there was a relatively short five-month hardware payback period for cloud service providers renting the H100, which would justify the continued spending, Rolland added.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "In 2012, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) declared its first dividend. At the time, the payout was worth around $0.001875 per share on a split-adjusted basis, equating to a dividend yield of around 2%.\n\nSince then, the dividend payment per share has risen dramatically. But the total amount the company is paying in dividends today might surprise you.\n\nThis is how much Nvidia is paying out in dividends\n\nFollowing a recent raise, Nvidia's dividend payout has climbed to $0.01 per share each quarter -- five times its original payment. But due to a rapid rise in its share price -- over the past decade, shares have increased in value by more than 27,000% -- the dividend yield has actually fallen to just 0.03%. Nvidia's management team simply believes that the best use of its cash today is to grow the business, not to distribute it to shareholders.\n\nAssuming the new higher rate is sustained, the next 12 months should see the company pay out $0.04 per share. That works out to roughly $1 billion in dividends -- a quarterly rate of around $246 million.\n\nBut given its much-higher profits, where is Nvidia investing its resources, if not in dividends? Over the past 12 months, around $1.9 billion has gone to capital expenditures. But research and development has seen the lion's share of spending, with more than $10 billion deployed over the last year.\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence has just begun, and Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are a critical component of the industry's growth. Not only will Nvidia need to invest in new manufacturing facilities to meet burgeoning demand, but its research and development budget will likely need to expand even further to fend off rising competition. Suffice it to say: Don't expect Nvidia to become a dividend juggernaut anytime soon. Nearly all of its excess cash will be used to defend its leadership in the nascent but rapidly growing AI industry.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI has completed a deal to raise over $6.5 billion in new funding, giving the artificial intelligence company a more than $150 billion valuation, and bolstering its efforts to build the world’s leading generative AI technology.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai’s Sky-High Rents Gang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon’s Fast-Growing Cities A Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda’s Capital City New Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century The Corner Store Comeback\n\nThe deal is one of the largest-ever private investments, and makes OpenAI one of the three largest venture-backed startups, alongside Elon Musk’s SpaceX and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd., according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information.

        "title": "OpenAI closes $6.6 billion funding haul with investment from Microsoft and Nvidia",
        "content": "By Krystal Hu\n\n(Reuters) -OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has raised $6.6 billion from investors, which could value the company at $157 billion and cement its position as one of the most valuable private companies in the world.\n\nThe funding has attracted returning venture capital investors including Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, as well as OpenAI's biggest corporate backer Microsoft, and new participation from Nvidia.\n\nThe closing of the funds coincides with the company's ongoing restructuring efforts and executive changes, including the abrupt departure of its longtime Chief Technology Officer, Mira Murati, last week.\n\nAltimeter Capital, Fidelity, SoftBank, and Abu Dhabi's state-backed investment firm MGX also participated in the round.\n\nOpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told employees on Wednesday that the company will be able to provide liquidity for them through a tender offer to buy back their shares in the company following the funding, although no details and timing have been decided, according to a source. Earlier this year, the company allowed some employees to cash out their shares at a valuation of $86 billion.\n\nThrive Capital, which committed about $1.2 billion from a combination of its own fund and a special purpose vehicle for smaller investors, negotiated the option to invest another $1 billion next year at the same valuation if the AI firm hits a revenue goal, sources added.\n\nApple, which was in talks to invest in OpenAI, did not end up joining the funding, sources said, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe funding came in the form of convertible notes, and the conversion to equity hinges on a successful structural change into a for-profit that would no longer be controlled by the non-profit board and the removal of cap on returns for investors.\n\nThe personnel changes haven't deterred enthusiasm from most investors, who are anticipating significant growth based on the projections by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is on pace to generate $3.6 billion in revenue this year on mounting losses of over $5 billion. It projects major revenue jump next year to $11.6 billion, according to sources familiar with the figures.\n\nInvestors have also secured some protections as OpenAI undergoes the complex corporate restructuring that would grant Altman equity. The talks are still ongoing, and no timeline has been determined yet.\n\nInvestors have negotiated terms that would allow them to claw back their capital or renegotiate the valuation if the changes are not implemented within two years, sources said.\n\nOpenAI's meteoric rise in terms of product popularity and valuation has captured the world's imagination. Since the launch of ChatGPT, it has attracted 250 million weekly active users. The company's valuation has also risen from $14 billion in 2021 to $157 billion as it grew revenue from zero to $3.6 billion, far exceeding Altman's own projections at the time.\n\nThe company has told investors it is still actively pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI), meaning developing AI systems that surpass human intelligence, as it ramps up commercialization and tries to be profitable.\n\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by Ken Li and Lisa Shumaker)",

        "title": "Is Nvidia (NVDA) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think \"Yes\"",
        "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 67.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 117.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -23.1%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 2.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.5% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Nvidia a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News Investors Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nCompanies are investing heavily in AI infrastructure to meet the growing demands of machine learning, data processing, and AI-driven applications. This spending is largely concentrated on building data centers, acquiring specialized hardware, and optimizing cloud infrastructure. According to a report by McKinsey, global AI infrastructure spending could reach up to $500 billion by 2027, highlighting the critical role it plays in the future of AI development. A large part of this investment is focused on AI-specific hardware like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are crucial for training and deploying AI models. NVIDIA, a dominant player in AI chips, has seen demand for its GPUs soar, largely due to their centrality in deep learning tasks. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the firm, has remarked that the AI boom is underpinned by massive infrastructure needs, and the market is just at the beginning of this growth curve.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nData centers are another focal point for AI infrastructure spending. AI workloads are highly demanding, requiring specialized facilities that can support high-density computing environments. Blackstone’s $16 billion acquisition of AirTrunk, a leader in AI-driven data centers, underscores the increasing importance of such infrastructure. The deal will add 800 MW of data center capacity, with projections to grow beyond 1 GW, a testament to the rising demand for infrastructure to support AI-driven applications. Cloud infrastructure is also a major area where companies are pouring resources. Cloud giants are increasing their investments in AI infrastructure. These companies are developing new AI-optimized cloud services to cater to businesses adopting AI. Gartner predicts that by 2026, cloud AI infrastructure spending will surpass $200 billion, as enterprises increasingly shift from on-premise AI deployments to scalable cloud-based solutions.\n\nThomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, recently remarked that AI is unlocking entirely new revenue streams for enterprises, and cloud infrastructure is the backbone enabling this transformation. Beyond just hardware, organizations are also investing in data management platforms and storage solutions to handle the massive amounts of data AI systems require. In fact, estimates suggest that the global AI data infrastructure market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18%, driven by increased data volumes and the need for real-time data processing capabilities. Companies are significantly ramping up their investments in AI infrastructure, focusing on hardware, data centers, and cloud computing. With projections showing continued growth in AI workloads, this spending will only increase in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases.

        "title": "The Ultimate Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist Right Now (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) has turned out to be a huge catalyst for the semiconductor industry, and that's not surprising as training and moving AI models into production is possible only through chips that are being deployed in huge numbers in data centers.\n\nThis is the reason why Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has witnessed a massive spurt in demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). The ability of GPUs to process huge amounts of data simultaneously has made them the default choice for cloud service providers to train large language models (LLMs). This explains why Nvidia's data center business has been growing at a phenomenal pace over the past few quarters and is expected to get even bigger in the future.\n\nHowever, GPUs aren't the only kind of chips that are in terrific demand thanks to the surge in AI adoption. Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU), a manufacturer of memory chips, has also been winning big from the growing adoption of AI. This article takes a closer look at how AI has been driving Micron's business and examines why this memory specialist looks like a better AI stock to buy right now when compared to Nvidia.\n\nMicron Technology is benefiting from AI adoption in multiple areas\n\nMicron Technology released its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results (for the three months ended Aug. 29) on Sept. 25. The company's revenue shot up 93% year over year to $7.75 billion, exceeding the consensus estimate of $7.65 billion. Additionally, Micron swung to a profit of $1.18 per share last quarter as compared to a loss of $1.07 per share in the same period last year. Analysts were expecting the company to deliver $1.11 per share in earnings.\n\nIt wasn't surprising to see Micron crushing Wall Street's estimates as the memory market's dynamics have been improving because of AI. For instance, the demand for Micron's data-center memory chips is exceeding supply, and that's not surprising as these chips are used by the likes of Nvidia while manufacturing their GPUs. More specifically, AI-focused GPUs are equipped with high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips thanks to their ability to process huge amounts of data quickly.\n\nThis is the reason why Micron expects the HBM market to generate annual revenue of $25 billion in 2025 as compared to just $4 billion last year. The company also adds that it sold \"several hundred millions of dollars\" worth of HBM last year, and it has sold out its HBM capacity for next year already.\n\nMeanwhile, the adoption of AI is also leading to an improvement in the demand for solid-state drives (SSDs) used in data centers. Micron's data center SSD revenue tripled in fiscal 2024. It won't be surprising to see Micron maintaining impressive growth in this segment in the future as the deployment of AI servers is expected to drive an average annual growth of 60% in data-center SSD demand in the coming years, according to market research firm TrendForce.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, this isn't where Micron's AI-related catalysts end. The adoption of AI-enabled PCs is going to be another solid growth driver for the company, driving impressive growth in volumes in both compute and storage-memory chips. On its latest earnings conference call, Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra remarked:\n\nAI PCs require a higher capacity of memory and storage. As an example, leading PC OEMs have recently announced AI-enabled PCs with a minimum of 16GB of DRAM for the value segment and between 32GB to 64GB for the mid and premium segments, versus an average content across all PCs of around 12GB last year.\n\nA similar scenario is unfolding in the smartphone market, where Micron points out that Android original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are launching AI smartphones with 12 gigabytes (GB) to 16GB of dynamic random access memory (DRAM), up from the average capacity of 8GB seen in 2023 flagship smartphones.\n\nIDC estimates that the market for generative AI smartphones could grow at an annual rate of 78% through 2028. On the other hand, Gartner estimates that AI PC shipments could jump a whopping 165% next year. The stunning growth of these end markets presents a bright multiyear opportunity for Micron to grow its sales and earnings thanks to the increase in memory consumption by AI-enabled edge devices, such as smartphones and PCs.\n\nAll this indicates that Micron is a more diversified AI stock than Nvidia, as it stands to gain from the adoption of this technology in several ways beyond just data centers. Even better, Micron's forecast suggests that it is about to clock faster growth than its illustrious peer.\n\nMicron's guidance and valuation make it a top AI stock to buy right now\n\nMicron is coming off a terrific fiscal Q4 with remarkable growth in its top and bottom lines. The company expects the momentum to continue in fiscal 2025's Q1. It has guided for $8.7 billion in revenue in the current quarter along with adjusted earnings of $1.74 per share at the midpoint.\n\nThe top-line guidance points toward an 85% year-over-year increase, while the bottom line would be a big improvement over the year-ago period's non-GAAP loss of $0.95 per share. For comparison, Nvidia is expecting its top line to grow 80% year over year in the current quarter. That was one of the reasons why investors pressed the panic button after its latest results as the chipmaker has been consistently delivering triple-digit growth in the past few quarters.\n\nWhat's more, Micron's valuation means that investors looking to add an AI stock to their portfolios right now would do well to buy it right away over Nvidia. Micron's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11 is significantly lower than Nvidia's forward-earnings multiple of 44, making the former a no-brainer investment right now, considering its eye-popping growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Markets were spooked overnight as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East sent investors towards safer assets amid fears that the situation might escalate, disrupting oil supply chains.\n\nTraders are being cautions as there is a lack of clarity on how the Middle East situation will evolve, with gold and oil prices surging after Iran's missile attack on Israel.\n\nAs tensions rise, market analysts are closely watching the risk of disruptions to oil production and exports, particularly if the conflict spreads or targets vital infrastructure in key oil-producing nations.\n\nInvestors are considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran \"will pay for it\".\n\nChris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said: “In the chain of potential market volatility shocks, geopolitics will typically trump economics, corporate earnings, or a central bank response — largely because most market players are poor at pricing risk around these events.\n\nRead more: Petrol prices may jump higher as oil spikes amid Middle East tensions\n\n“While these events typically reconcile in a market positive fashion, the tail risk it can throw up is clearly significant.\n\n“The situation remains fluid, and the slightest calming or increased aggression in the rhetoric from Israel or Iran could result in a sizeable impact on sentiment in markets.”\n\nRegardless of how the situation evolves, investors should prepare their portfolios for geopolitical risks.\n\n\"It's not just about reacting to headlines, but positioning yourself for both immediate market volatility and long-term impacts. In this increasingly fragmented world, staying strategically prepared is essential,\" Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy and global market strategist at Saxo, said.\n\nEconomists at Jefferies suggest adopting a low-risk investment profile amid the unpredictability.\n\nHow to protect your portfolio from geopolitical risks\n\nThe magnitude of Israel’s retaliation against Iran will determine the inclination of markets to price in more geopolitical risk. But for those who want to act now or just be prepared for future volatility, these are the sectors of the market more resilient against geopolitical tensions, according to Chanana.\n\nCore sectors for geopolitical resilience\n\nArtificial intelligence and semiconductors\n\nThe race for technological supremacy is intensifying, with AI positioned as a pivotal player in global power dynamics. Investors should consider allocating to:\n\nStocks: NVIDIA (NVDA)), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) ETFs: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)\n\nStory continues\n\nDefence\n\nWith escalating tensions, defence budgets are on the rise, underscoring the necessity for advanced military technology. Investors can explore:\n\nETFs: iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA), SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR)\n\nCybersecurity\n\nAs cyber threats loom large, robust cybersecurity solutions have become integral to national defence and corporate integrity. Suggested investments include:\n\nStocks: Palo Alto Networks (PANW), CrowdStrike (CRWD) ETFs: First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR), Global X Cybersecurity ETF (BUG)\n\nRenewable Energy\n\nIn a bid to reduce reliance on unstable fuel sources, renewable energy is emerging as both an environmental imperative and a matter of national security. Potential investments include:\n\nStocks: NextEra Energy (NEE), Enphase Energy (ENPH) ETFs: iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN), Invesco Solar ETF (TAN)\n\nStrategic equity sectors for long-term growth\n\nWhile geopolitical events may trigger short-term market fluctuations, they also have lasting implications. In our interconnected world, it’s crucial to prepare for these persistent risks. Key sectors poised for sustained returns include:\n\nHealthcare: iShares Healthcare Innovation ETF (HEAL.AS), Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) Technology: Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), Vanguard Information Technology (VGT) Financials: Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), iShares Global Financials (IXG) Energy: United States Oil Fund (USO), Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE)\n\nEssential portfolio safeguards\n\nIn times of geopolitical instability, incorporating safe-haven assets can bolster portfolio resilience against conflict and inflation. Safe havens, which are expected to retain or appreciate in value during economic downturns, include:\n\nGold: SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), iShares Gold Trust (IAU (IAU) Bonds: iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP), Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF (BSV) Defensive Stocks: Coca-Cola (KO), Procter & Gamble (PG), Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) Currencies: US dollar (Betashares US Dollar ETF) (USD.AX), Japanese yen (Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust ETF) (FXY), Swiss franc (Invesco CurrencyShares Swiss Franc Trust ETF) (FXF) Cash or cash equivalents: Money market funds\n\nSaxo cautioned that in a world where geopolitical shocks are an ongoing concern, proactive portfolio positioning is not merely wise — it’s essential. By thoughtfully allocating investments across these key sectors, stocks, and ETFs, investors can mitigate risks while also seizing opportunities that arise amidst volatility. Chanana said: “Don’t wait for the next crisis — be prepared for it.”\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy Ahead of a Potential Chip Shortage",
        "content": "Consulting group Bain & Company recently published a sweeping report on the state of technology, which included the prediction of a possible chip shortage in the coming years. This shortage could come as demand for semiconductors needed for the current artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout continues to surge, combined with the potential of a smartphone and PC upgrade cycle.\n\nGiven the comments from large tech companies involved in the AI infrastructure buildout and the exponential need for more computing power from AI models, combined with the need for more powerful smartphones and PCs to run AI applications, there certainly appears to be a lot of chip demand coming in the future. At the same time, increasing chip manufacturing capacity takes time, with it taking years to build a new foundry.\n\nAs such, this prediction doesn't seem like a big stretch. Let's look at three stocks that could nicely benefit from a chip shortage.\n\nNvidia\n\nThe graphic processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are the most sought-after semiconductor chips in the market today. Its chips are used for AI model training and inference within data centers, and their demand is currently insatiable. If there is a chip shortage in the coming years, you can bet that the demand for Nvidia's chips would be partly responsible.\n\nThe company currently has an over 80% market share in the GPU space. Nvidia has created a wide moat through its CUDA software platform, which long ago became the standard on which developers would program GPUs and is what most developers have been trained to use. At the same time, it has sped up its development cycle for GPUs from two years to one to help ensure that it stays at the technological forefront. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIf there is an impending chip shortage, it would demonstrate that the bearish case against Nvidia, which is that demand will slow after an initial burst of AI infrastructure spending, likely falls flat. At the same time, a chip shortage likely gives Nvidia even more pricing power than the considerable amount it already wields.\n\nAs an added bonus, Nvidia's stock is relatively inexpensive, trading a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of only about 31 based on next year's analyst estimate and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of about 0.8. A PEG under 1 is typically considered undervalued, and growth stocks often have PEGs well above 1.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturer\n\nAs the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturer(NYSE: TSM), or TSMC for short, produces more chips than any other company. If there is a chip shortage, that means that demand for its services would be strong and that its foundries (chip manufacturing plants) would likely be running at or near full capacity.\n\nStory continues\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing is a high fixed-cost business, so high demand and capacity utilization are a must to keep margins high. A tight supply and demand environment also increases pricing power. TSMC has already been driving prices higher for its newer chip manufacturing processes over the past few years, and the company is expected to nicely raise prices next year as well. A very tight supply demand environment will only enhance its pricing buyer.\n\nA chip shortage caused by high demand also means the need for more capacity, which TSMC is working to increase. It is building new fabs in the United States, Japan, and Germany. However, new fabs aren't built overnight and can take a couple of years to build. So if there is a chip shortage that means its new fabs would likely ramp to capacity pretty quickly once they come online. The company is also working to shrink chip sizes. While this benefits chip designers with lower power consumption and higher speeds, it also allows more chips on a wafer, increasing capacity.\n\nWith Apple, Nvidia, and AMD as its three largest customers, TSMC would benefit from continued AI infrastructure spending and a hardware upgrade cycle.\n\nUltimately, though, if there is a chip shortage, as the leading semiconductor contract manufacturer in the world, the company would likely play a big role in being part of the solution to fix the shortage.\n\nTSMC stock is also attractively priced with a forward PE of 22 based on next year's analyst estimate and a PEG of about 1.\n\nASML\n\nIf there is a short shortage due to a lack of capacity, that means chip manufacturers are going to need to increase capacity, and in order to do that they will need more of the equipment used to manufacturer chips. And the company at the forefront of semiconductor manufacturing equipment is the Netherlands' ASML(NASDAQ: ASML).\n\nThe semiconductor equipment manufacturing business is a lumpy one, and ASML is currently in the midst of a more transitional year as the industry digests the current supply of certain logic and memory chips. Part of this stems from weaker smartphone and PC sales, but if AI leads to a refresh cycle as more powerful hardware is needed to run AI applications, then some of these markets should improve.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has recently introduced a new high numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet lithography, or high NA EUV, system to help improve chip manufacturing productivity and lower production costs. It shipped its second of these systems in Q2 and said interest is high for the pricey new system.\n\nASML expects an industry upturn in 2025, and any chip shortage would likely lead to further increased demand for its equipment.\n\nAs with Nvidia and TSMC, ASML trades at an attractive valuation. Based on 2025 analyst estimates, its forward P/E is 26, and its PEG is 0.8.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Accenture has trained 30,000 experts on the use of Nvidia’s technology to help their customers deploy and get benefits from it rapidly.\n\nWhile Nvidia’s chips dominate deployments of AI hardware, orders are mainly coming from a handful of owners of large data centers, such as Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Analysts and investors have expressed concern that tens of billions of dollars they’re spending on new infrastructure hasn’t yet provided a financial return that justifies the outlay.\n\nNvidia has responded by launching a flurry of software, services and hardware aimed at making the technology accessible and valuable to a broader set of customers, all aimed at perpetuating what Nvidia’s Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang says is a new industrial revolution.\n\nAccenture has already invested heavily in generative AI and in July launched its so-called AI Refinery using Nvidia’s technology, to allow its clients to build custom large-language models to power AI tools tailored to their industries. The company credited its most recent quarterly earnings beat to strong demand for its help in deploying generative AI.\n\nAccording to Accenture’s head of AI, Lan Guan, nine out of ten organizations recognize the impact that generative AI is having but less than 10% have found a way to make it work for them yet.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Great €3 Billion Shipping Container Heist Adam Neumann’s Latest Project Is a WeWork Competitor Investors Hot on India Shrug Off Adani Short Seller Attack Sports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought How a Short Seller’s Attack Threatens This Spanish Family Company\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Cerebras could restart a stagnant IPO market, but clear risks abound",
        "content": "This year’s IPO market has been a stalled car.\n\nYou know the feeling. You turn the key, the engine hums, you’re about to hit the road…and then the car stops. That’s sort of what’s happened in 2024, as the scattered IPOs of companies like Reddit and Astera Labs inspired hope that IPOs were back to the races. But in the end, while the IPO engine has hummed, the car hasn’t started.\n\nAt least, not yet. This week, AI chipmaker Cerebras filed its S-1, marking the beginning of its journey to the public markets. There’s hope that a runaway-success debut for Cerebras could finally get things motoring again. On the surface, that makes sense—entrenched in the AI boom, Cerebras is backed by big-name VCs like Benchmark and Altimeter, billing itself as a prospective challenger to Nvidia.\n\nThe company’s top line provides some strong support for that story. Cerebras’s 2023 revenue came in at $78.7 million, more than triple the prior year’s $24.6 million, with momentum on the rise. Revenue in the first half of this year surged to $136.4 million, up more than 1,400% from the first half of 2023.\n\nWhat’s more, as deep tech investor Patrick Beatty pointed out to me, the company’s got a “proven team,” led by Andrew Feldman, who cofounded and sold SeaMicro, a server startup, to AMD for $357 million in 2012.\n\nLook a little closer at Cerebras’s S-1, however, and it’s difficult to ignore some big questions. Cerebras has narrowed its losses, but they’re still substantial, totaling $127.2 million in 2023 versus $177.7 million in 2022. But there’s something else that every person I’ve spoken to brought up almost immediately when discussing the filing—Cerebras is heavily reliant on one customer.\n\nIn the first half of this year, a staggering 87% of Cerebras’s revenue was accounted for by G42, an Abu Dhabi-based company backed in part by Mubadala, Silver Lake, Microsoft, and Ray Dalio’s family office. (Microsoft reportedly has sought to pull back on its partnership with G42.) G42, an AI-focused data-center and cloud-services business, also led Cerebras’s $250 million Series F in 2021. (That round valued the company at $4.25 billion.)\n\nI’ve seen some commentary out there that says something to the effect of “well, that’s a problem Nvidia has too.” And, again on the face of it, you’d be right. About 46% of Nvidia’s revenue links back to four unnamed customers, a group that reportedly includes Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet. So, yes, customer concentration is perhaps a feature that Cerebras shares passingly with the world’s most famous chipmaker—but there’s a difference. The stability of your customers matters deeply when so few mean so much. G42 is private, backed by the United Arab Emirates’ sovereign wealth fund among others, and was only founded in 2018. (Mired in geopolitical risk, G42 divested from China earlier this year amid U.S. pressure.) Nvidia’s mega-customers, by contrast, are established Big Tech businesses that generate hundreds of billions of dollars in annual revenue in aggregate.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Cerebras’s ‘Nvidia Challenger’ moniker is going to be hard to live up to—the company would have to substantially take on Nvidia in AI training, while Cerebras’s inference business (an area less well-trod by Nvidia) is still nascent.\n\nIt’s still possible that public markets investors ultimately bite, but it would likely be more about AI generally than about Cerebras specifically.\n\n\"If you’re talking about chip investors who’ve done due diligence, I’d be surprised,” said Thomvest Ventures managing director Umesh Padval. “It may end up being about the FOMO of missing out on chip companies, in the market of AMD, Broadcom, and Nvidia. So, if they feel ‘I’m getting the next Nvidia,’ that could be the primary reason why there would be so much demand.”\n\nIn the end though, the name of the game is growth—and if Cerebras can convince investors that its own business and the broader market fueling it are real and expanding, the IPO engine may very well start.\n\n“You have to continue to provide growth to keep investors excited,” said Simon Yu, Listed Ventures managing partner. “So, you don't go public to just be stagnant, because then you'll just die on the vine.”\n\nSee you tomorrow,\n\nAllie Garfinkle\r\nTwitter:@agarfinks\r\nEmail: alexandra.garfinkle@fortune.com\r\nSubmit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter here.\n\nNina Ajemian curated the deals section of today’s newsletter.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Hard earned truth: One stock can ruin your returns",
        "content": "Picking the wrong stocks can ruin your returns. (Credit: Financial Post photo illustration)\n\nWith a small number of high-performing stocks having an outsized effect on market returns, missing out on buying the right ones could cost you.\n\nSo could picking the wrong ones. It’s easy to make the wrong predictions. So what can investors do?\r\n The stock market is known for its volatility, oscillating between bull runs bringing large portfolio windfalls and sharp downturns that can wipe out those gains, or worse, rack up massive losses.\n\nAs a recent S&P Global study shows, in any given year, a small selection of high-performing stocks can drive the bulk of market returns, leaving those who fail to own them at a considerable disadvantage.\n\nThis phenomenon, which has grown in recent years, underscores a critical reality for investors: missing out on the next big winner can dramatically undermine your potential gains, no matter how well diversified your portfolio.\n\nMajor winners in Canada and the U.S.\n\nFor example, as highlighted in S&P’s year-end report for 2023, Shopify Inc in Canada and Nvidia Corp. in the United States played a major role in driving their indexes’ overall performance, significantly affecting portfolios that included or avoided these names.\n\nShopify’s large weighting in the S&P/TSX Composite Index (about 3.6 per cent), and its poor performance in 2022 negatively affected the index’s returns. Actively managed funds that had low or no exposure to the Canadian e-commerce giant handily outperformed the index during that period.\n\nThe situation flipped in 2023. Shopify became one of the top-performing stocks, significantly contributing to the Index’s gains. As a result, portfolios that were heavily invested in Shopify vastly outperformed those that avoided the stock.\n\nIt is the same story with AI chip giant Nvidia on the U.S. market. The third company by weight in the Nasdaq Composite Index (7.76 per cent), Nvidia has risen an eye-watering 150 per cent since the start of the year; as of Sept. 27 contributing significantly to the market’s more than 20 per cent return for the period.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Magnificent Seven\n\nThe influence of a grouping of a few dominant mega-cap stocks, such as Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc’s Google, Amazon.com Inc., Nvidia, Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. – dubbed the Magnificent Seven, is even more pronounced.\n\nThe top 10 stocks, which include the seven heavyweights, make up half the Nasdaq’s value.\n\nThe concentration of top-performing stocks is not a new phenomenon, but it has become increasingly pronounced in recent years.\n\n“Investors should be invested in the leaders of the markets, with an understanding of the weightings of each stock in mutual funds and indices,” says Gina Macdonald, a fee-only financial planner and portfolio manager in Vancouver.\n\n“Obviously the swings in the market value and returns will be greater in your portfolio depending on the weightings.”\n\nAs concentration of individual stocks or their groupings varies, it creates opportunities for different investment strategies, such as cap-weighting versus equal weighting, says Joseph Nelesen, head of specialists, index investment strategy, at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\n“We have published some research on concentration and dispersion, including a look at some of the mega-cap stocks, and examination of equal-weight performance following periods of mega-cap dominance,” he says. “We’ve also discussed how the dominance of a handful of names in the index is not unprecedented.”\n\nThe challenge of picking winners\n\nBut most investors don’t have the time or knowledge to pick individual stocks or run cap-weighting strategies. They also may not have a big enough portfolio or lack risk tolerance. They may, however, find they already have significant exposure through an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nCurrently, six stocks (the Magnificent Seven without Tesla) make up the top six holdings in the S&P 500, with a combined weight of nearly 30 per cent.\n\nEven in a global equity index fund, they combine to over 18 per cent of the weight, points out Pauline Shum Nolan, professor of Finance at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Toronto.\n\n“These tend to be volatile stocks, and they contribute a lot of risk to the index,” she says, but adds, “Nvidia, in particular, had contributed handsomely to the returns, gaining 192 per cent over the past 12 months.”\n\nWith the rapid pace of tech innovation, especially in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and the dominance of tech stocks in the top performers, it has become increasingly challenging for both professional and retail investors to consistently identify the next breakthrough stock that will outperform the market.\n\nInvestors are always playing catch-up in understanding technological breakthroughs. Nolan notes that it’s often unclear early on how widespread adoption will be or how fierce the competition might become.\n\n“Unlike other sectors with physical factories that analysts can visit to understand the production process, AI innovation happens on laptops across the globe,” she says.\n\nA few winners can boost the overall market\n\nOne of the main risks that retail and professional investors face when trying to pick individual stocks is the positive skew in stock returns. Most stocks will have average or even poor returns, but a small number of “winners” can significantly boost the overall performance of the market, says S&P’s Nelesen.\n\n“From a probability perspective, the odds of randomly picking a losing stock are usually higher than picking a winning one,” Nelesen warns.\n\nVery few professional investors can consistently beat the market over the long term. Retail investors even less so, since they “may exhibit more behavioural biases in stock picking and, arguably, do not have the same time and resources as professional investors,” says Nolan.\n\nPitfalls of stock picking and how to avoid them\n\nPredicting the next breakout stock is nearly impossible. Picking winners consistently is tough for the most seasoned of investment professionals, let alone the average Joe who doesn’t have the time, resources and sophistication to stay on top of all the stocks in the market, Macdonald contends.\n\nExperts recommend a simpler approach for most investors.\n\n“Hold a cheap, well-diversified core portfolio (index ETFs), then your satellites can be your individual stock picks,” Nolan says.\n\nMacdonald suggests “purchasing the main indices and gaining access to the pool of stocks available without doing individual stock picking.”\n\nShe adds, “Investors need to be educated on what the markets have done and may do without the major players and see if they are willing to accept those returns if they don’t’ include them in their investment mandate.”\n\nHard earned truth: Passive investing has changed the game Hard earned truth: Your brain isn't wired to invest properly\n\nAs the investment landscape evolves, understanding the implications of stock concentration and the challenges of individual stock selection becomes increasingly important.\n\nWith the dominance of companies like Nvidia, Shopify and the broader Magnificent Seven, investors must carefully consider their strategies to avoid missing out on major returns without taking on substantial risk.\n\nUltimately, whether through diversified index funds or a structured investment approach, the emphasis should be on long-term growth and stability rather than the allure of get-rich quick.",

        "title": "Meet the Best-Performing Stock in the Entire S&amp;P 500 This Year -- No, It's Not Nvidia",
        "content": "The S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is up 21.5% in 2024 so far, which is more than twice its average annual return since it was established in 1957. But some stocks in the index are performing even better, especially those participating in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock, for example, is up a whopping 145% this year. It's struggling to keep up with demand for its data center chips that are used to develop AI, and that's driving a surge in the company's revenue and earnings.\n\nBut there's one stock in the S&P 500 that is crushing even Nvidia right now. Shares of Vistra(NYSE: VST) have rocketed higher by 205% so far in 2024 -- a single-year performance almost unheard of for a company that operates in the utilities industry. But it's mostly thanks to the AI boom, and here's why.\n\nNvidia was the top-performing S&P 500 stock in 2023\n\nNvidia stock ended 2023 with a 239% gain, making it the best performer in the entire S&P 500 for the year. It benefited from a tidal wave of spending from the world's largest data center operators, including Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Oracle, and more, all of which continue to battle for AI supremacy.\n\nDeveloping the largest AI models -- and therefore the smartest AI applications -- requires significant computing power, and Nvidia's H100 graphics processor (GPU) was the industry's most powerful chip last year. The above data center companies continue to buy the H100, but they are eagerly awaiting a new generation of GPUs based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture.\n\nBlackwell-based GPU systems like the GB200 NVL72 are set to deliver a performance increase of up to 30 times compared to the H100, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expects them to generate billions of dollars in revenue for his company when they start shipping at scale in the final quarter of its fiscal 2025 (which will run from November to January).\n\nNvidia is on track to generate $125.5 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2025, which would be a 125% increase from the prior year. But data center spending is still climbing, and Huang believes operators will allocate $1 trillion toward building new infrastructure over the next five years.\n\nAll of those data centers are going to drive a surge in demand for electricity, and that's where Vistra comes in.\n\nVistra is an unlikely beneficiary of the AI revolution\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs, a typical ChatGPT query consumes 10 times more electricity than a Google search. That's part of the reason AI data centers could represent 4% of all energy consumption worldwide by 2030, potentially doubling from 2% today.\n\nStory continues\n\nVistra is an electricity company based in Texas. It has a generation business that produces electricity through its portfolio of coal, natural gas, solar, and nuclear facilities. It also has a retail arm that distributes electricity to more than 5 million residential, commercial, and industrial customers across 16 U.S. states.\n\nClean energy sources like nuclear, solar, and natural gas are popular among climate-conscious tech companies. Microsoft, for example, wants to be carbon negative, water positive, and zero-waste across its entire organization by 2030, and it appears to be on track to achieve those goals.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Vistra announced it signed two long-term renewable power purchase agreements, one with Microsoft and the other with Amazon. The company will build two large-scale solar facilities to fulfill those deals, but further specifics are not yet available.\n\nHere's something we do know. Microsoft recently signed a 20-year deal for nuclear power with Constellation Energy, and it will pay an estimated $100 per megawatt-hour -- double the going rate today. In other words, Microsoft is anticipating that energy supply will become so tight because of demand from AI data centers that it's willing to pay a premium to secure its needs for the future. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nVistra could end 2024 at the top of the S&P 500, but investors should be cautious\n\nAs I highlighted above, there are very good reasons for the powerful bull run in Vistra stock this year. However, based on the company's trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS) of $1.35, its stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 86.1.\n\nThat might pose a problem, because the average P/E ratio for stocks in the S&P 500 utilities sector is around 18.3, so Vistra is quite expensive from that perspective.\n\nAccording to Wall Street's consensus estimate, Vistra could deliver $4.65 in EPS for the whole of 2024, which suggests its upcoming third and fourth quarters will be much stronger than the year-ago periods. However, that still places Vistra stock at a forward P/E ratio of 25.3.\n\nEven if you calculate Vistra's P/E ratio based on its forecasted 2025 EPS of $6.40, it still comes out to 18.3. In other words, the stock might be fully valued for the next year if Wall Street's projections are accurate (and if the rest of the utilities sector maintains its current P/E ratio).\n\nPlus, many top analysts see limited upside in the stock from here. Morgan Stanley recently lifted its price target to $132, which only represents a potential return of 12% from where Vistra trades today. Analyst firm Jefferies has a slightly higher target of $137, which points to 16% upside.\n\nVistra could deliver the best gain in the entire S&P 500 this year, but it probably won't shoot the lights out again in 2025 based on its current valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vistra right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vistra, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vistra wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Bargain-Basement Stock-Split Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in the 4th Quarter and 1 Highflier to Shy Away From",
        "content": "Since the start of 2023, no trend on Wall Street has garnered more attention from investors than the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). But over the last eight months, the excitement surrounding stock splits in top-notch companies has played a close second fiddle.\n\nA stock split allows publicly traded companies the option of cosmetically adjusting their share price and outstanding share count by the same factor. The \"cosmetic\" aspect of splits has to do with the fact that they don't alter a company's market cap and have no impact on underlying operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIn 2024, just over a dozen high-profile companies announced or completed a stock split -- all but one of which is of the forward-split variety. Forward splits are designed to reduce a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable for retail investors. More importantly, the companies conducting forward splits are almost always doing so from a position of operating strength.\n\nAs we push forward into the fourth quarter, one bargain-basement stock-split stock stands out as ripe for the picking for opportunistic value seekers. Meanwhile, growth investors might be wise to steer clear of another stock-split stock that's been the buzz of the AI movement.\n\nThis historically cheap stock-split stock can be confidently dialed up by patient investors\n\nThe unique stock-split stock that makes for a no-brainer buy in the fourth quarter is none other than satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI).\n\nWhat makes Sirius XM's split \"unique\" is that it's the lone company I alluded to above that didn't complete a forward split.\n\nOn Dec. 12, 2023, Sirius XM unveiled plans to merge with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group. Liberty Media is the majority stakeholder in Sirius XM and its multiple classes of Sirius XM tracking stock have always been somewhat confusing to everyday investors. To add, they never tracked Sirius XM's stock particularly well. The merger of these share classes, which took place following the close of trading on Sept. 9, cleared up some confusion.\n\nIn addition to creating a single class of Sirius XM stock, the company completed a 1-for-10 reverse split following the merger. Though reverse splits are usually enacted to avoid delisting from a major stock exchange, Sirius XM was in no danger of being removed. Rather, its split was designed to increase its share price to make it more attractive to institutional investors and fund managers.\n\nAside from being Wall Street's most-anticipated reverse stock split of 2024, Sirius XM provides investors with three compelling reasons to buy its stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo start with, there's a level of cash flow predictability with Sirius XM that terrestrial and online radio companies can't match. The difference can be seen in how Sirius XM generates its revenue, compared to traditional radio operators.\n\nFor terrestrial and online radio, most of their revenue comes from advertising. While this strategy works well during lengthy periods of economic growth, it can lead to lean times during recessions. Comparatively, Sirius XM brings in only around 20% of its net sales from ads, with the lion's share of its revenue (more than three-quarters) coming from subscriptions. Subscribers are less likely to cancel their service during periods of economic instability than businesses are to pare back their ad spending.\n\nThe second compelling reason to buy shares of Sirius XM is its moat. As the only licensed satellite-radio operator, it possesses meaningful subscription pricing power. In instances where subscriber growth slows or shifts into reverse, the company has an opportunity to raise prices and boost its sales.\n\nLastly, Sirius XM's bargain-basement valuation is highly attractive. As of the closing bell on Sept. 27, the company's shares were valued at 7.5 times estimated earnings per share (EPS) for 2025. Even with sales growth stagnating at the moment, this marks the company's cheapest forward-year earnings multiple since going public in September 1994. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis stock-split stock's parabolic move higher looks unsustainable\n\nHowever, not all stock-split stocks are necessarily worth buying. Even though companies conducting forward splits have historically outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 in the 12 months following their split announcement, the one I'd suggest shying away from in the fourth quarter (and beyond) is artificial intelligence kingpin Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia completed its historic 10-for-1 split in June.\n\nTo be fair, Nvidia has done a lot of things right. Its AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) are the undisputed top choice among businesses building out high-compute data centers. After accounting for an estimated 98% of AI-GPUs that were shipped to data centers in 2022 and 2023, Nvidia looks to have ceded very little market share, thus far, in 2024.\n\nNvidia is also getting plenty of help from its CUDA software platform. CUDA is the toolkit developers use to build large language models and maximize the computing capacity of their Nvidia AI-GPUs. The best way to think of CUDA is as the lure that keeps businesses loyal to Nvidia's ecosystem of products and services.\n\nBut in spite of these early stage advantages, Nvidia offers a number of red flags that should give investors pause.\n\nFor instance, competition is an inevitability for Nvidia. Even if its H100 and Blackwell GPUs maintain their computing advantage, the extensive backlog for Nvidia's hardware, coupled with cheaper price points for competing chips, could have businesses looking elsewhere for their data center needs.\n\nInternal competition shouldn't be overlooked, either. All four of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are developing AI-GPUs for use in their data centers. This looks to be a clear signal that America's most-influential businesses want to lessen their reliance on the AI kingpin's hardware.\n\nAnother reason Nvidia's parabolic ascent is worrisome has to do with what its insiders are telling us. Specifically, CEO Jensen Huang has been a persistent seller of his company's stock since mid-June, and no insider has purchased shares of Nvidia on the open market since December 2020. If insiders don't view their stock as a bargain, why should everyday investors?\n\nPerhaps the biggest red flag with Nvidia is that no game-changing technology or innovation for 30 years has avoided a bubble-bursting event early in its existence. Put another way, the investing community has regularly overestimated the adoption/uptake of next-big-thing technologies. When these lofty expectations fail to come to fruition, the music inevitably stops for hyped innovations.\n\nConsidering that a majority of businesses still lack a clear game plan as to how they'll generate a positive return on their AI investment, we appear to be witnessing the early stages of a bubble-bursting event play out.

        "title": "4 Billion-Dollar Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Right Now",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has soared over the past five years as the company solidified its dominance in the high-growth artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. The tech giant holds about 80% of that market thanks to the power of its graphics processing units (GPUs) -- their ability to process multiple tasks simultaneously makes them perfect for critical AI tasks like the training of models.\n\nSales of chips and other AI products and services has helped Nvidia grow its data center revenue in the triple digits to record levels. In the most recent quarter, revenue from that business topped $26 billion. This is huge, considering that revenue for the entire company totaled $27 billion as recently as fiscal 2023.\n\nAfter such earnings and stock performance, though, you may be wondering if it's too late to get in on this AI player and if the biggest opportunity for gains has passed. It's impossible to predict with 100% accuracy whether Nvidia will repeat its past performance. But it is fair to say earnings growth drivers not only still exist but have multiplied -- and as earnings soar, so could the stock price. Let's check out four billion-dollar reasons to buy Nvidia now -- each is set to add major growth to Nvidia's top line moving forward. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia's growing strengths in networking\n\nNvidia has generally stood behind its InfiniBand platform for networking, or the transmission of data across various devices. But Ethernet networking remains more broadly used due to compatibility across device types. Not to be left out, Nvidia launched its Spectrum-X Ethernet platform last year, a move that allows the company to continue to grow InfiniBand and gain ground in the Ethernet market too.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, Nvidia's Ethernet for AI revenue doubled from the previous quarter as \"hundreds of customers\" signed on for the company's Ethernet offerings. In fact, Spectrum-X is set to become a multibillion-dollar range of products after just one year of commercialization. And since the company aims to release new Spectrum-X products every year, there's reason to be optimistic about future growth.\n\n2. Nvidia is leading the way in sovereign AI\n\nSovereign AI refers to a country's ability to generate AI through its own infrastructure and resources -- it's particularly valuable because it means a nation can preserve and harness the strengths of its culture, traditions, language, and more.\n\nThis new area represented zero revenue for Nvidia last year, but this year it's already on its way to delivering revenue in the low-double-digit billions. Examples of Nvidia's work in the area include projects to build supercomputers with Japan and Italy -- and even a project with a French company to build Europe's biggest supercomputer.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia spoke about the importance of sovereign AI as the movement began, and it's clear the opportunity could bring in major revenue as various nations launch projects -- and turn to Nvidia for help.\n\n3. Nvidia is a key player in the development of autonomous vehicles\n\nWhen Nvidia announced the upcoming release of its new Blackwell architecture and chip, Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk's comment illustrated the importance of the chip designer in his industry: \"There is currently nothing better than Nvidia hardware for AI,\" Musk said. On top of this, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison recently said he and Musk begged Nvidia for more chips during a meeting with CEO Jensen Huang -- Nvidia has said demand for its GPUs has surpassed supply.\n\nThe automotive industry was a big growth driver for Nvidia during the recent quarter because every developer of self-driving technology is using Nvidia products. The company predicts the industry will result in \"multibillion dollars\" in revenue -- and this revenue will climb as more and more compute is needed for next-generation vehicles.\n\n4. AI could transform healthcare, with the help of Nvidia\n\nAI may revolutionize many areas, but Nvidia's Huang predicts the technology will make the biggest mark on healthcare. At the company's GTC conference earlier this year, Huang highlighted that Nvidia is already present in various specialties -- from imaging to gene sequencing and robotics.\n\nAt the conference, Huang announced the launch of about two dozen new services spanning the areas of imaging, speech recognition, and drug discovery. And in the recent earnings report, Nvidia said healthcare is \"on its way\" to becoming a multibillion-dollar business for the company.\n\nAll of these elements show us that Nvidia's revenue growth has much farther to go. And each of these areas represents a long-term opportunity, meaning we're not just talking about a quarter or two of revenue growth but growth that could persist over time. And that's why these are four fantastic billion-dollar reasons to buy Nvidia stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): One of the Most Widely Held Stocks by Hedge Funds",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Widely Held Stocks by Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other widely held stocks.\n\nTwo 25 Point Cuts May be the Most Likely Outcome\n\nThe last trading day of September is upon us and so are many questions about the market. On September 30, Dana D’Auria, Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the financial market.\n\nD'Auria regards employment data to be a major concern at the moment. Since inflation rates are subsiding, employment data is something investors should be on the lookout for, along with other data points including GDP and consumer confidence. She suggests that to ensure a soft landing, the Fed must initiate larger rate cuts, and that recessionary conditions are out of the picture.\n\nSeptember is notoriously volatile along with October, and, with elections in another 35 days, the conditions may be slightly different or even more turbulent. According to D'Auria, the 50 basis point cut is a catch-up for July, and expecting a 50 basis point cut in November is borderline questionable.\n\nOverall, she believes that the market has been overshooting and we may have to settle for two 25 basis point cuts before the end of 2024. She reiterates that the job market is crucial and investors must get out of their comfort zone to invest in non-cash opportunities. Investors concerned about low-risk options may consider equities in the defensive sectors that are innately low volatile.\n\nThe Market is Broadening\n\nWall Street is heading to close September and Q3 on a high note and stocks have experienced their best September in over a decade. On September 30, Kevin Gordon, harles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis.\n\nGordon believes that stocks in the utilities and defensive sectors have caught up to tech stocks amid the AI boom, compared to their financials at the end of FY 2023. However, he does acknowledge that sectors like industrials, financials, and materials are performing relatively well, calling it a case of market broadening.\n\nIn terms of market breadth, most sectors are experiencing an upward trajectory. Almost 81% of the S&P 500 members are experiencing an uptrend, despite the quality bias investors may have towards certain stocks. According to Gordon, large-cap quality stocks will continue to perform well despite the volatility and the Fed's decisions. Speaking of smaller-cap stocks, he believes that some stocks may struggle a bit especially when it comes to earnings growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 10 most widely held stocks by hedge funds, we sifted through Insider Monkey's database that tracks over 900 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. We ranked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the most popular stocks at the moment, also referred to as the AI star. The GPU maker is known for its cloud solutions, chip systems, and growing role in producing artificial intelligence solutions.\n\nThe company logged $26.3 billion in data center revenue, up 16% from the previous quarter and 154% year-over-year. The revenue growth was driven by strong demand for Nvidia’s GPU Computing platform. Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) logged $30 billion in revenue during the FQ2 of 2025, up by 122% year-over-year, well above its outlook of only $28 billion.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. Such can be attributed to its rapid advancements in technology and strategic partnerships. The company’s networking platform for AI, Spectrum X, is projected to become a multi-billion dollar entity in a year. Moreover, the company just closed a deal with Salesforce allowing organizations to benefit from advanced AI and data capabilities. Two weeks ago, NVIDIA launched a new AI tool, Aerial, to optimize wireless networks that will meet the needs of the next generation on mobile, robots, autonomous vehicles, and 5G.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on NVDA and their 12-month median price target of $150 points to a 24% upside from current levels. At the close of Q2 2024, 179 investors were bullish on NVDA, with total stakes amounting to $53.7 billion.\n\nIthaka Group's Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.\"\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley andJim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Global stock markets are now entering what is set to be an eventful fourth quarter, with the US election and more interest rate decisions looming.\n\nMarkets continued to rally to round off a strong end to the third quarter, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) closing at a new record high on Monday.\n\nHowever, US stocks fell on Tuesday, as investors digested the latest jobs and manufacturing data, as well as comments from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, who said policymakers aren't in a hurry to lower rates.\n\nThis tempered traders' bets of another 0.5% interest rate cut, after the Fed recently announced its first rate reduction in four years, lowering its range by a bigger-than-expected 50 basis points.\n\nRead more: UK GDP grows less than first thought over spring\n\nThe European Central Bank also made its second 25 basis-point rate cut of the year in September. And while the Bank of England kept rates on hold at its latest meeting, it had already announced a rate reduction in August, with markets betting on a next cut in November.\n\nKeeping an eye on central bank policy decisions and monitoring how effectively rate setters can navigate a \"soft-landing\" for the economy, as more jobs and inflation data are released, is one focus for asset managers and market strategists in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the major market event on their minds is the US presidential election on 5 November. With the outcome of this still unclear, the theory is that many investors decide to \"move to the sidelines\" in the run-up to that date and await more clarity.\n\n'Significant turnaround' in markets\n\nHenry Allen, macro strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a research note released on Monday that this recent rally marked \"a significant turnaround from earlier in Q3, when there was major turmoil as US recession fears grew\".\n\nOne of the factors behind this shift, he explained, was the pivot in central bank policy.\n\nIn addition to this policy pivot, Allen said the fact that US economic data had started to improve again, had also bolstered market sentiment. For instance, the four-week average of initial jobless claims was now down to its lowest point since May and non-farm payrolls were up by 142,000 in August.\n\nHe added that the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow estimate, which acts a model for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, is now up to 3.1% from 2.9% for the the third quarter, while other \"indicators like retail sales and industrial production have also pointed away from a recession\".\n\nWhat's more, last week's stimulus announcements by China's central bank led to \"phenomenal performance among Chinese equities, along with China- exposed stocks more broadly\".\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Funds set to benefit from falling interest rates\n\nIn fact, the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) index closed Monday's session in China 8% higher, which was its largest daily increase since 2008.\n\nIn the UK, while the FTSE 100's (^FTSE) gains have been smaller year-to-date, up nearly 7%, it still reached an all-time high of 8,445.8 in May and stood at 8,273 on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"Given how strong things have been for markets recently, there's understandably been some scepticism as to whether this can continue,\" said Allen.\n\nHowever, he added that there are \"still clear signs that investors are pricing in a higher-than-usual chance of more negative outcomes like a recession\" in the US.\n\nIf economic growth does hold up and the Fed manages to ease into a soft landing, Allen said that the \"historical precedents from here are very positive for markets\".\n\nFourth-quarter investment outlook\n\nHugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told Yahoo Finance UK: \"I guess the summary for Q4 – there are a number of big unknowns, all with big implications for the outlook for 2025.\"\n\nHe said that the result of the US election is still as unclear as it was at the beginning of year and \"all potential outcomes are still on the table\".\n\nGimber, therefore, said the \"focus should absolutely be on ensuring that investors are avoiding being overly exposed to any one particular outcome\".\n\nHe said that a second key topic for the fourth quarter is \"how much an acceleration in the weakening of the [economic] data do we see\".\n\nAnother topic Gimber said he is focused on in the fourth quarter is a \"broadening out of earnings\".\n\nRead more: The top gold funds to invest in as prices soar\n\nHe expected to see earnings growth in the mid-teens in both the 'Magnificent Seven' group of technology giants, which includes Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), and the rest of the S&P 500.\n\n\"You compare that to Q1 of this year, where the Magnificent Seven were growing earnings by 50% and the rest of the market was in negative growth territory,\" Gimber explained.\n\nEven so, Gimber said artificial intelligence (AI) will continue to be a big driver for markets, but is more focused on some of those \"left behind sectors that stand to benefit from almost a second round effect from AI effectively\".\n\n\"There's a fundamental disconnect today being priced as if they're going to completely revolutionise the economy and then everything else,\" he said. \"That gap has to close one way or another.\"\n\nGimber said that the utilities sector was one example of a \"clear AI beneficiary\" with the increase in electricity demand that going to come from data centres. The healthcare sector was another example of an area he is focused on.\n\nRead more: European Central Bank forecast to cut interest rates to 2.5% in 2025\n\nGoing into the fourth quarter, he said that it's key to ensure portfolios are positioned to be \"resilient to the multiple potential outcomes that can stem from the US election\".\n\nHe explained that inflation risks have faded and central banks stand ready to cut rates in the event of a shock to economic growth and in that scenario \"multi-asset investors have many more tools available to build a well-diversified portfolio, mixing risk assets with high-quality government bonds than they did in 2023 or 2022 when inflation levels were still higher\".\n\n\"This is a good opportunity to be rebalancing portfolios away from the previous winners and tilting into sectors that have been left behind, particularly those with a more defensive tilt – utilities and healthcare being two examples,\" he added.\n\nUS election outlook\n\nAjay Rajadhyaksha, global chairman of research at Barclays (BARC.L), said in a fourth-quarter outlook note in September that the US election would have \"far-reaching consequences\" for the world, explaining that a second presidency for Donald Trump would \"likely see a new global trade war\".\n\nThe former president and Republican candidate has proposed blanket tariffs of 10% on all US imports and tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese goods.\n\n\"Other countries would retaliate, with uncertain but serious effects on economies and markets,\" said Rajadhyaksha.\n\nIf Democratic candidate Kamala Harris is elected, he said that a \"gridlock is more likely ... with far less dramatic policy changes\".\n\n\"But the presidential race is so close, and US politics so partisan, that markets will keep guessing until 5 November,\" said Rajadhyaksha. \"The result could lead to starkly different winners and losers in global markets.\"\n\nRead more: What are share buybacks?\n\nGiven that \"policy paths post-5 November are so binary\", he said that \"many investors will probably move to the sidelines and wait for clarity\".\n\n\"Markets seem to lack conviction going into Q4, and frankly, so do we,\" he added.\n\nIn terms of how this translates into investments, Rajadhyaksha said Barclays' \"bias is to be overweight risk assets, short core fixed income, and own the trade-weighted USD (US dollar)\", which measures its value relative to other currencies.\n\n\"But we would not be surprised if all markets are range-bound in the coming weeks as they wait and watch economic and political developments in the US. For the rest of this year at least, as America goes, so goes the rest of the world,\" he added.\n\nWith regards to equities, Rajadhyaksha and his team said that in the US they maintained their positive outlook on the \"big tech\" sector and had upgraded their outlook on utilities stocks to positive.\n\nPost-election impact\n\nMeanwhile, Themis Themistocleous, head of the UBS (UBSG.SW) EMEA investment office, said to journalists at a recent outlook event that he would expect the \"outcome of the [US] elections is more likely to be felt at a sector level rather than the overall level of the equity market\".\n\nHe said there would be more defence spending irrespective of who becomes president.\n\nHowever, he added: \"I suspect if Trump becomes the next president then the level of noise is going to go up even more and as a result, maybe decisions need to be taken even faster than otherwise. So in some ways I would suspect the defence sector to benefit overall, but obviously a Trump win most probably will accelerate that appreciation.\"\n\nIf Harris wins, on the other hand, Themistocleous believed there would more likely be a continuation of current trends, such as support on the energy transition.\n\nRead more: Top fund picks for self-invested pensions\n\n\"And of course, as we know, a lot of European companies have leading positions in some of these technologies like in green tech, so [there would be] continued support there,\" he said.\n\nIn this scenario, Themistocleous said there were a number of industrial and utilities companies that could benefit.\n\nMeanwhile, he highlighted luxury as a sector that could be impacted in different ways if Trump becomes president.\n\n\"If we have tax cuts in the US that would support the upper consumer segment in the US which buy those things so that could be positive,\" he said, but added that any significant impacts on China could also but pressure on the sector.\n\nFor those investors that might be looking at how to ride through any volatility from the outcome of the election, Themistocleous highlighted consumer staples and utilities as examples of defensive sectors.\n\nHowever, he pointed out that this was very much a six-month to one-year view. Longer-term, Themistocleous also favoured AI as an investment theme with \"multi-year development\".\n\nIn fact, the overriding message going into the fourth quarter seemed to be that, regardless of any short-term volatility on the horizon, investors should continue looking for those companies that facilitate and benefit from structural changes in the economy.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Cerebras hopes planned IPO will supercharge its race against Nvidia and fellow chip startups for the fastest generative AI",
        "content": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI! In this edition…Governor Newsom vetoes SB 1047; ByteDance plans new AI model based on Huawei chips; Microsoft announces AI models will improve Windows search; and the U.S. Commerce Department sets a new rule that eases restrictions on AI chip shipments to the Middle East.\n\nCerebras has a need for speed. In a bid to take on Nvidia, the AI chip startup is rapidly moving toward an IPO after announcing its filing for one yesterday. At the same time, the company is also in a fierce race with fellow AI chip startups Groq and SambaNova for the title of ‘fastest generative AI.’ All three are pushing the boundaries of their highly-specialized hardware and software to enable AI models to produce responses using ultra-fast generative AI that even outperform Nvidia GPUs.\n\nHere’s what that means: When you ask an AI assistant a question, it must sift through all of the knowledge in its AI model to quickly come up with an answer. In industry parlance, that process is known as “inference.” But large language models don’t sift through words during the inference process. When you ask a question or give a chatbot a prompt, the AI breaks that into smaller pieces called “tokens”—which could represent a word, or a chunk of a word—to process its answer and respond.\n\nPushing for faster and faster output\n\nSo what does “ultra-fast” inference mean? If you’ve tried chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, or Google’s Gemini, you probably think the output of your prompts arrives at a perfectly reasonable pace. In fact, you may be impressed by how quickly it spits out answers to your queries. But in February 2024, demos of a Groq chatbot based on a Mistral model produced answers far faster than people could read. It went viral. The setup served up 500 tokens per second to produce answers that were nearly instantaneous. By April, Groq delivered an even speedier 800 tokens per second, and by May SambaNova boasted it had broken the 1,000 tokens per second barrier.\n\nToday, Cerebras, SambaNova, and Groq are all delivering over 1,000 tokens per second, and the “token wars” have revved up considerably. At the end of August, Cerebras claimed it had launched the “world’s fastest AI inference” at 1,800 tokens per second, and last week Cerebras said it had beaten that record and become the “first hardware of any kind” to exceed 2,000 tokens per second on one of Meta’s Llama models.\n\nWhen will fast be fast enough?\n\nThis led me to ask: Why would anyone need generative AI output to be that fast? When will fast be fast enough?\n\nAccording to Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman, generative AI speed is essential since search results will increasingly be powered by generative AI, as well as new capabilities like streaming video. Those are two areas where latency, or the delay between an action and a response, is particularly annoying.\n\n“Nobody’s going to build a business on an application that makes you sit around and wait,” he told Fortune.\n\nIn addition, AI models are quickly being used to power far more complex applications than just chat. One rapidly growing area of interest is developing application workflows based on AI agents, in which a user asks a question or prompts an action that doesn’t simply involve one query to one model. Instead it leads to multiple queries to multiple models that can go off and do things like search the web or a database.\n\n“Then the performance really matters,” said Feldman, explaining that a reasonably slow output today could quickly become painfully slow.\n\nUnlocking AI potential with speed\n\nThe bottom line is that speed matters because faster inference unlocks greater potential in applications built with AI, Mark Heaps, chief technology evangelist at Groq, told Fortune. That is especially true for data-heavy applications in fields like financial trading, traffic monitoring, and cybersecurity: “You need insights in real time, a form of instant intelligence that keeps up with the moment,” he said. “The race to increase speed…will provide better quality, accuracy, and potential for greater ROI.”\n\nIt’s worth noting, he pointed out, that AI models still have nowhere near as many neural connections as the human brain. “As the models get more advanced, bigger, or layered with lots of agents using smaller models, it will require more speed to keep the application useful,” he explained, adding that this has been an issue throughout history. “Why do we need cars to get beyond 50 mph? Was it so we could go fast? Or producing an engine that could do 100 mph enabled the ability to carry more weight at 50 mph?”\n\nRodrigo Liang, CEO and cofounder of SambaNova, agreed. Inference speed, he told Fortune, “is where the rubber hits the road—where all the training, the building of models, gets put to work to deliver real business value.” That’s particularly true now that the AI industry is moving more of its training from training AI models to putting them into production. “The world is looking for the most efficient way to produce tokens so you can support an ever-growing number of users,” he said. “Speed allows you to service many customers concurrently.”\n\nSharon Goldman\r\nsharon.goldman@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Nvidia, Micron, Broadcom, and Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Semiconductor Stocks Slumped on Tuesday",
        "content": "Some of the biggest drivers of the ongoing market rally that began early last year are the advances in artificial intelligence (AI). These next-generation algorithms and the semiconductors that power them could spark a wave of increased productivity.\n\nThe potential to profit from these advances has fueled rapid adoption of AI, which has sent purchases of semiconductors soaring. However, the chip industry could be among the first to feel the impact of the just-announced dockworkers' strike.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, AI chip specialist Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) slumped 3.9%, memory and storage chipmaker Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) tumbled 3.9%, semiconductor specialist Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) fell 3.1%, and database and AI chipmaker Oracle(NYSE: ORCL) dropped 1.9%, as of 2:06 p.m. ET on Tuesday.\n\nA check of all the usual suspects -- financial reports, regulatory filings, and changes to analysts' price targets -- showed nothing in the way of any company-specific news to explain the falling stock prices. This suggests investors were focused on the work stoppage at some of the biggest ports in the U.S. and what that means for the semiconductor industry and the market rally in general. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStrike while the iron is hot\n\nOn Tuesday, the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) began its first widespread strike in almost 50 years. The union said that tens of thousands of its members have begun to hit picket lines at ports along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts beginning at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe ports on those two coasts are the destination for more than half the containerized products imported into the country. If the strike extends for more than a few days, there could be a ripple effect on the supply chain and, by extension, the broader economy.\n\nDelays of everyday products could reignite inflation, cause shortages, and drive up prices. The longer the strike lasts, the more likely the chance of economic upheaval.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul of New York said that \"the food supply is secure right now,\" urging consumers not to stockpile items unnecessarily. While a shortage of essential goods like food and household items is still weeks away, other industries could be affected, including semiconductors.\n\nThe accelerating adoption of AI has already caused many of the most advanced chips to be in short supply. As a result, a shortage of semiconductors resulting from the dockworkers' strike could come sooner rather than later.\n\nYears, not weeks or months\n\nSo, what's the potential impact on our quartet of companies? In the near term, a disruption in the semiconductor pipeline could slow revenue and profit growth. Over the long term, however, any impact would be fleeting at most.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany AI and semiconductor stocks have been bid up since early last year as investors feared missing out on the next big trend. If a shortage of chips comes to pass due to this strike, it will likely be short-lived, and the pent-up demand will remain once the strike has passed.\n\nInvestors should stay focused on the long-term opportunity of AI, which will play out over years, not weeks or months. It takes the most advanced semiconductors to power this technology, so the future remains bright for these pillars of the chip industry.\n\nNvidia created the graphics processing units (GPUs) that provide the computational horsepower used in AI systems. Broadcom creates many of the semiconductors and ancillary technology used in data centers and cloud computing, where much of AI occurs. Oracle is primarily known for its database and cloud infrastructure services, but it also designs and engineers chips used for AI. Micron Technology makes flash memory and storage processors, which are crucial components in the GPUs that are used for AI processing.\n\nSome of these stocks might appear pricey at first glance, but any premium is well deserved. Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle, and Micron are currently selling for 41 times, 35 times, 27 times, and 11 times forward earnings, respectively. However, given the accelerating adoption of AI and the corresponding accelerating growth of these companies (all of which provide components that are crucial to the AI revolution), I would rate them all buys.\n\nThat said, each of these stocks carries increased volatility, and the potential for supply chain disruption could further exacerbate that situation. Investors should hold on for a wild ride.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Over the last three months, the Dow led the major indexes' gains, up 8.2%. The S&P gained 5.4%, and the Nasdaq added nearly 3% (read: 9 Top Global ETF Trends So Far This Year).\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) craze, the Federal Reserve's solid interest rate cut and a steady US economy have boosted investors’ confidence, helping stocks post three successive weekly wins. The final trading day of the month and the quarter also came with profit taking and rebalancing. However, geopolitical tensions and the sell-off in tech stocks weighed on investors’ confidence occasionally.\n\nGold Touches Record High\n\nGold has been on a solid ascent, hitting a series of new highs driven by the Fed rate cut optimism, a likelihood of falling greenback, strong physical buying from central banks and the Middle East geopolitical tensions, which raised the appeal for gold as a store of wealth.

        "content": "Nvidia's Jensen Huang's Wealth Exploded In Five Years To $108 Billion. Here's Why His Philanthropy Is Being Criticized\n\nJensen Huang, the CEO and co-founder of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), has seen his fortune soar to about $106 billion in just five years. Once worth $3.8 billion, Huang is now the 13th richest person in the world, thanks to the surging demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), essential for artificial intelligence (A.I.) products. But as his wealth has skyrocketed, so has the scrutiny over how he gives back to society.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nUnlock a $400 billion opportunity by investing in the future of EV infrastructure on this startup already valued at $50 million with just $500. The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\nThe Rise of Nvidia\n\nNvidia currently has a market capitalization of almost $3 trillion and is the third most valuable company in the world, behind only Apple ($3.4 T) and Microsoft ($3.1 T). The main cause for such a high valuation is that the company now controls between 70% and 95% of the global market for AI processors used in generative models like ChatGPT. Additionally, Nvidia’s shares have jumped over 170% in just the past year, boosting Huang’s wealth and cementing his status in the tech industry.\n\nSee Also: General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.\n\nIt’s amazing to see Huang’s route to success. As a youngster, he worked cleaning toilets and as a dishwasher at Denny’s. He fondly recalls, \"I mean, I cleaned a lot of toilets. I've cleaned more toilets than all of you combined – and some of them you just can’t unsee.\"\n\nHis work ethic and approach to leadership are bar none. He emphasizes, \"To me, no task is beneath me because I used to be a dishwasher [and] I used to clean toilets.\"\n\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\n\nCharitable Focus\n\nDue to his enormous wealth, Huang has significantly increased the amount of money he donates to charity. By 2022, the foundation’s assets had grown from $13.2 million in 2007 to around $1 billion, according to the Observer.\n\nHis altruistic efforts frequently benefit local causes in California, Nvidia’s home state, as well as higher education and diversity in the AI field. Remarkably, his charity, the Jen-Hsun & Lori Huang charity, has contributed significantly to colleges, including Oregon State University and Stanford.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: Teens may never need wisdom teeth removed thanks to this MedTech Company – Be an early investor for just $300 for 100 shares!\n\nHowever, much of Huang's philanthropy has been directed toward donor-advised funds (DAFs) rather than traditional nonprofits. In 2022, the foundation donated $66.3 million, with a significant portion going to a fund at Schwab Charitable, a DAF sponsor.\n\nReports recently indicated that the Huang Foundation controls 69 million shares of Nvidia, currently valued at over $8 billion. This makes it the 20th largest foundation in the U.S. and its assets have increased eightfold since the end of 2022.\n\nIn addition, Huang and his wife manage the GeForce Fund, also a donor-advised fund that holds an undisclosed number of Nvidia shares, with DAFgiving360 estimating that $4.4 billion of Nvidia stock is aggregated in funds controlled by the couple and their foundation.\n\nWhile DAFs provide tax benefits and allow donors to maintain control over their giving, they have come under fire for their lack of transparency and accountability.\n\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\n\nThe Criticism of DAFs\n\nThe main cause of Huang’s charitable criticism is his reliance on DAFs. Unlike traditional charities, which must give away at least 5% of their assets annually, DAFs can hold onto funds for years without distributing them. Because of this, some have questioned whether Huang’s philanthropic methods are truly selfless or just intended to gain tax benefits.\n\nWhile DAFs offer a great deal of control over charity contributions, experts have pointed out that they can also cause money to remain unused for long stretches of time, which can restrict the immediate influence that gifts could have on urgent social issues.\n\nRead Next:\n\nUnlock a $400 billion opportunity by investing in the future of EV infrastructure on this startup already valued at $50 million with just $500.

        "title": "Intel (INTC) Stock Looks Cheaper than NVDA &amp; AMD on a Forward Basis, but I’m Cautious",
        "content": "Intel (INTC) has found itself in a world of trouble in 2024 after years of innovation failures left it significantly lagging behind its peers. A lot has happened in recent months, and there are many more developments possible before the end of the year. Interestingly, analysts still see the business recovering to the extent that the stock becomes quite affordable compared to peers in upcoming years. Despite this, I’m concerned the company will struggle to catch up, and as such, I’m neutral on INTC.\n\nWhat Happened at Intel?\n\nIntel remains a global chip giant, with operations in both the design and manufacturing of chipsets. However, the decline from its once-dominant position in the semiconductor industry is evident, and can be attributed to a variety of factors that have unfolded over the past decade. Those pressures continue, and so I have a neutral rating on the stock.\n\nThe company’s struggle to maintain its technological edge began around 2015 when it simply stopped innovating as quickly as its peers. As the innovation cycles failed to deliver material improvements and other companies transitioned to smaller, more efficient chip manufacturing processes, Intel continued making profits as it produced its less advanced chips en masse.\n\nThis lack of innovation eventually caught up with Intel. The company’s reliance on its x86 architecture also left it vulnerable as the industry shifted towards more energy-efficient ARM-based (ARM) designs, particularly in mobile and emerging artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Intel’s weaknesses were laid bare during the pandemic as supply chain disruptions and increased demand for computing power highlighted the company’s manufacturing limitations.\n\nIntel’s Catch-Up Strategy\n\nIn response to falling behind, Intel brought in CEO Pat Gelsinger in 2021 to spearhead a turnaround strategy, which included massive investments in new fabrication facilities and a renewed focus on technological leadership.\n\nGelsinger kicked things off by announcing his ambitious “five nodes in four years” strategy, with the aim of rebounding as quickly as possible. However, the road to recovery has been challenging, with Intel facing intense competition and a tough climb to regain customer confidence in its ability to deliver cutting-edge products on schedule.\n\nTo date, there’s very little evidence of Intel catching up. The company’s struggles are particularly evident in the Data Center business, where it lags behind competitors AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA). Intel’s Q2’24 results produced a 1% year-over-year revenue decline; a sharp contrast to its peers.\n\nStory continues\n\nDoes Intel’s Future Include Divestments or a Buyout?\n\nTo address its financial issues, Intel has implemented a $10 billion cost reduction program and recently converted its foundry business into a subsidiary. This restructuring aims to drive greater transparency, cost savings, and growth, but it hasn’t led me to adopt a bullish view of Intel stock yet.\n\nThe stock gained on this announcement in September, and then further by a deal with Amazon (AMZN) Web Services to co-invest in a custom AI semiconductor. The company also received $3 billion of U.S. government funding to make chips for the military.\n\nMoreover, recent reports have suggested that a potential $5 billion investment from Apollo Global Management (APO) could be on the cards, and there have also been reports of discussions with Qualcomm (QCOM) about a possible partial or full acquisition.\n\nWhile the $5 billion investment may sound lofty, some analysts have suggested that it would amount to little more than a drop in the ocean given the capital needed in the sector. That may be especially true for Intel, given its technological lag versus peers like TSMC.\n\nIntel Seems Cheaper than Nvidia & AMD\n\nDespite all these issues, reports, and turbulence, Intel appears cheaper than its peers Nvidia and AMD. While INTC stock trades at 91x forward earnings, according to analysts EPS will improve significantly in the coming years. Resultantly, the estimated forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio falls to 20.3x for the year ending December 2025 and to 12.6x in 2026.\n\nBy comparison, Nvidia is trading at 43x forward earnings, and 30.9x earnings for the year ending January 2026. This figure falls to 26.3x for the year to January 2027 and 24.3x for 2028. AMD’s valuation metrics are also higher, with the stock trading at 31x forward earnings for the year ending December 2025, and 21.8x forward earnings for the year ending December 2026. That suggests Intel is actually significantly cheaper than its peers, albeit without taking account of cash positions.\n\nIs Intel Stock a Buy According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, INTC comes in as a Hold based on one Buy, 26 Holds, and seven Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Intel stock price target is $25.47, implying almost 10% potential upside.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Intel Stock\n\nIntel’s recent rally on acquisition rumors has the stock trading within 10% of its share price target. It’s interesting to see that most analysts are neutral despite consensus forecasts that predict a strong recovery in earnings and very competitive forward valuation multiples. I believe the ongoing concerns about Intel’s industry relevancy compound existing concerns. It remains uncertain how much support the business might require to effectively compete with TSMC from a foundry perspective. I have a neutral view of INTC stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Generation Investment Management, an investment management firm, released its “Global Equity Strategy” second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of letter can be downloaded here. The strategy’s recent net performance was behind market averages. Since the fund’s inception, the strategy has underperformed for about 8% of the time on a rolling five-year basis. Several factors have contributed to the current underperformance, including not owning Nvidia, which explains about a third of the relative underperformance year-to-date. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nGeneration Investment Management Global Equity Strategy highlighted stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers graphics and compute and networking solutions. The one-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was 12.44%, and its shares gained 179.06% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On September 30, 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $121.44 per share with a market capitalization of $2.979 trillion.\n\nGeneration Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Recent net performance is behind market averages. However since the fund’s inception, we have spent only about 8% of the time underperforming on a rolling five-year basis.1 We do not enjoy these spells. A number of different factors has contributed to the current period of underperformance. The fact that we do not own NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one. That single company accounted for roughly 25% of returns in the benchmark so far this year, meaning almost everyone who does not own Nvidia has lost out. Year-to-date, not owning Nvidia explains about a third of our relative underperformance.\n\nNvidia is, clearly, an earnings juggernaut. In the past year its revenue has more than tripled, as cloud companies load up on hardware to power AI models. So while its earnings multiple has increased, we are not seeing a repeat of the dotcom mania of the late 1990s.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 66% of the company",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, NVIDIA's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 45% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have sold recently\n\nEvery investor in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 66% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of NVIDIA.\n\nView our latest analysis for NVIDIA  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nNVIDIA already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NVIDIA. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.5% and 4.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. In addition, we found that Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO has 3.5% of the shares allocated to their name.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of NVIDIA\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in NVIDIA Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$117b. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 30% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NVIDIA. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NVIDIA better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for NVIDIA (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Morgan Stanley analysts provided their view on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GB200 server rack production, noting that recent supply chain checks suggest no further delays in shipments.\n\nConcerns had arisen in the market regarding Nvidia's Blackwell platform, specifically about supply and demand uncertainties, but the production process appears to be on track, according to the investment bank.\n\n\"Our latest supply chain checks suggest no further delay for GB200 server rack shipments,\" Morgan Stanley states.\n\nThey also noted that no leakage problems have been spotted, and cable connection issues can be resolved through manufacturing adjustments. Production rollout is scheduled for November 2024, with the first batch of shipments expected by the end of the year.\n\nThe bank highlights that while both NVL36 and NVL72 designs should hit the market by late 2024, \"NVL72 should be the customer preference for high computing power density and better cost-effectiveness in the long term.\"\n\nMoreover, Morgan Stanley says some tier-one server buyers will have access to the Blackwell platform around the year-end, while broader shipments to the rest of the market are likely to begin by the end of the first quarter in 2025.\n\nThey explain that due to the immense power consumption of GB200 server racks, however, most enterprise buyers may prefer HGX/MGX servers for the Blackwell platform.\n\nMorgan Stanley's analysis suggests that Nvidia's supply chain remains strong, with growth expected in high-speed switches and large-scale 800G switch shipments projected for the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n\"We see the supply chain continuing to progress to mass production toward year-end,\" writes Morgan Stanley.\n\nWhile volatility may persist in the short term, the bank remains optimistic, particularly on companies like Wistron, Accton, and Hon Hai for their relationships with Nvidia and contributions to the AI hardware supply chain.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia: Morgan Stanley checks suggest no further GB200 server rack shipment delay\n\nUS East Coast dockworkers strike, halting half the nation's ocean shipping\n\nCVC-backed Moove Lubricants targets up to $1.9 billion valuation in US IPO\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Processors and Graphics Chips Stocks Q2 Highlights: SMART (NASDAQ:SGH)\n\nAs the craze of earnings season draws to a close, here’s a look back at some of the most exciting (and some less so) results from Q2. Today, we are looking at processors and graphics chips stocks, starting with SMART (NASDAQ:SGH).\n\nThe biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\n\nThe 9 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.9% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 12.9% below.\n\nBig picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled.\n\nWhile some processors and graphics chips stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 3% since the latest earnings results.\n\nSMART (NASDAQ:SGH)\n\nBased in the US, SMART Global Holdings (NASDAQ:SGH) is a diversified semiconductor company offering memory, digital, and LED products.\n\nSMART reported revenues of $300.6 million, down 12.7% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations, but overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with a significant improvement in its gross margin but underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter.\n\n\"We are pleased with our Q3 operating results and continued progress in our transformation into a high-performance, high-availability enterprise solutions company,\" said Mark Adams, CEO of SGH. SMART Total Revenue\n\nUnsurprisingly, the stock is down 9.8% since reporting and currently trades at $20.94.\n\nIs now the time to buy SMART? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free.\n\nBest Q2: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nFounded in 1993 by Jensen Huang and two former Sun Microsystems engineers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading fabless designer of chips used in gaming, PCs, data centers, automotive, and a variety of end markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $30.04 billion, up 122% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 4.5%. The business had an exceptional quarter with a significant improvement in its inventory levels and a significant improvement in its gross margin. Nvidia Total Revenue\n\nNvidia scored the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth among its peers. Although it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 3.2% since reporting. It currently trades at $121.57.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free.\n\nWeakest Q2: Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC)\n\nA global leader in its category, Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) is a semiconductor designer specializing in customer-programmable chips that enhance CPU performance for intensive tasks such as machine learning.\n\nLattice Semiconductor reported revenues of $124.1 million, down 34.7% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 4.7%. It was a disappointing quarter as it posted underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decline in its operating margin.\n\nLattice Semiconductor delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group. As expected, the stock is down 4.5% since the results and currently trades at $52.43.\n\nRead our full analysis of Lattice Semiconductor’s results here.\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nInventor of the x86 processor that powered decades of technological innovation in PCs, data centers, and numerous other markets, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is the leading manufacturer of computer processors and graphics chips.\n\nIntel reported revenues of $12.83 billion, flat year on year. This print lagged analysts' expectations by 1.1%. Overall, it was a softer quarter as it also recorded underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decline in its operating margin.\n\nThe stock is down 19.6% since reporting and currently trades at $23.42.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Intel here, it’s free.\n\nQorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO)\n\nFormed by the merger of TriQuint and RF Micro Devices, Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO) is a designer and manufacturer of RF chips used in almost all smartphones globally, along with a variety of chips used in networking equipment and infrastructure.\n\nQorvo reported revenues of $886.7 million, up 36.2% year on year. This result topped analysts’ expectations by 4.1%. It was a strong quarter as it also recorded an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS estimates and a significant improvement in its operating margin.\n\nThe stock is down 12.9% since reporting and currently trades at $104.03.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Qorvo here, it’s free.\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL)\n\nThe world's most valuable company, Apple, closed near its all-time high on Monday. The stock ended the previous session 2.3% higher at $233 (£175) per share, just below the high of $234.82 it hit in July.\n\nThis took the tech giant's market capitalisation up to $3.5tn.\n\nUS markets more broadly notched fresh records on the final day of the quarter, with the S&P 500 closing 0.4% in the green.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European markets cautious as Israel starts ground invasion in Lebanon\n\nLooking at Apple specifically, Barron's reported that a Morgan Stanley note on Monday referred to stabilising lead times for some iPhone 16 models.\n\nThere had been some concern, following the launch of the new iPhone in September, that early demand for the latest model was lagging 2023 levels.\n\nOther megacap tech companies also ended Monday's session in positive territory, with Google-owner Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) up more than 1% and social media giant Meta Platforms (META) up nearly 1%.\n\nGreggs (GRG.L)\n\nShares in sausage roll-maker Greggs dipped 5% on Tuesday morning, after it reported a slowdown in underlying sales growth in the third quarter.\n\nThe food-on-the-go retailer said like-for-like sales in this latest quarter were up 5%, versus 6.5% year-to-date, and slower than the 7.4% growth it reported in the first half.\n\nHowever, Greggs said that it was \"acknowledging ongoing economic uncertainty, [and] the board expects the full year outcome to be in line with its previous expectations\".\n\nThe British baker also said it expected the overall level of cost inflation for the year to be towards the lower end of the 4% to 5% range that it previously mentioned.\n\nRead more: The top gold funds to invest in as prices soar\n\nIn terms of new products, Greggs said it had launched a pumpkin spiced doughnut as part of its autumn menu. The chain said it was also on track to open between 140 and 160 net new shops in 2024.\n\nMamta Valechha, retail equity analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"We continue to like Greggs; the group ranks highly on price perception and quality among coffee shops and quick service restaurants. There is significant growth potential in London and south-east England, and Greggs remains second only to McDonald’s in monthly active app users.\"\n\nDespite Tuesday's fall in share price, Greggs is still up 14% year-to-date.\n\nStellantis (STLAM.MI)\n\nCarmaker Stellantis tumbled in Monday's session, after it cut its outlook for the full-year.\n\nThe company warned adjusted operating income (AOI) margins were now expected to be between 5.5% and 7%, down from the double digits it had previously forecast.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Roughly two-thirds of the reduced AOI margin is driven by corrective actions in North America,\" Stellantis said. \"Other contributors include lower than expected sales performance in the second half of the year across most regions.\"\n\nRead more: What are share buybacks?\n\nThe carmaker also said it now expected to see negative cashflow for the year of between €5bn (£4.2bn) and €10bn.\n\nThe company also reportedly said on Monday that it was recalling 194,000 plug-in hybrid jeeps over fire risk.\n\nStellantis wasn't the only European carmaker to fall in the previous session, as Aston Martin (AML.L) also slumped after warning on profits.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\n\nTechnology company Super Micro Computer underwent a 10-for-1 stock split following the market close on Monday.\n\nStock splits increase the number of shares in circulation, which reduces the share price, broadening accessibility to a wider range of investors.\n\nA number of companies have announced stock splits this year, including chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and retailer Walmart (WMT).\n\nRead more: Funds set to benefit from falling interest rates\n\nShares in Super Micro fell sharply last week after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US Department of Justice is investigating the company over alleged accounting irregularities.\n\nIn August, the company announced that it would be delayed in filing its annual report. A day prior to that announcement, Hindenburg Research disclosed it had taken a short position in the company and claimed it had found \"fresh evidence of accounting manipulation\".\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Exactly five weeks from today, on Nov. 5, voters from across the country will weigh in and decide which presidential nominee -- former President Donald Trump or current Vice President Kamala Harris -- will lead our nation forward over the next four years.\n\nWhat happens on Capitol Hill doesn't always have relevance to Wall Street. But elections ultimately determine which president and political parties will shape fiscal policy over the next, at minimum, two years. Understanding the economic policy proposals of the two presidential candidates does have bearing for the investing community and corporate America. Former President Trump speaking with reporters. Image source: Official White House Photo by Andrea Hanks.\n\nFor former President Donald Trump, his message has remained similar to what he echoed during his 2020 campaign. He's proposed a handful of new personal tax breaks, wants to further reduce the corporate tax rate to spur economic growth, is a big promoter of domestic energy production, and plans to get tougher with China.\n\nWhile there are some pretty clear winners of this potential scenario, there are also time-tested and/or high-flying stocks that can end up as losers.\n\nWhat follows are three market-leading stocks that can plunge if Donald Trump wins in November.\n\nNvidia\n\nThe first widely held stock that may be contending with some difficult headwinds if Trump wins in five weeks is Wall Street's leading artificial intelligence (AI) company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nAs most investors are probably aware, Nvidia's stock has enjoyed a historic ascent, with the company benefiting from a textbook expansion of its operations. In short order, Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) became the undisputed preferred choice for businesses running generative AI solutions and building/training large language models.\n\nThough the prospect of lowering the corporate tax rate could, at least temporarily, juice Nvidia's gross margin and allow it to hang onto more of its income, another key aspect of Trump's economic plan has the potential to limit Nvidia's upside.\n\nSpecifically, Trump plans to take a hardline stance with China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. He's proposed a 60% tariff on goods imported into the U.S. from China. Although Nvidia isn't importing products from China, the global No. 2 economy has consistently been a key generator of sales for Nvidia. The potential for Trump to spark a trade war may eliminate China's desire altogether to purchase chips from California-based Nvidia.\n\nTo add to the above, regulators under the Biden administration have, on two occasions, limited Nvidia's ability to export its high-powered AI-GPUs to China over the last two years. I'd deem it unlikely that Trump or his administration would ease or lift these restrictions, which are capping Nvidia's revenue potential in a key market.\n\nStory continues\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that every next-big-thing technology, trend, and innovation for 30 years has navigated its way through an early stage bubble. Investors consistently overestimate the adoption and utility of game-changing innovations, and AI seems unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule. If the AI bubble were to burst under a Trump presidency, arguably no company would feel the sting more than Nvidia. Electric vehicle tax credits may be eliminated by Trump. Image source: Tesla.\n\nTesla\n\nA second market leader that may be set to plummet if Donald Trump wins a second term is electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nTesla has used its first-mover advantages to build itself from the ground up to producing in the neighborhood of 2 million EVs annually on a run-rate basis. It became the first EV company to generate a recurring profit and is attempting to diversify its operations by expanding into energy storage.\n\nAlthough former President Trump has hinted at giving Tesla CEO Elon Musk a position in his administration if reelected in November, he's also been critical of EV tax credits and tax incentives. While Trump hasn't concretely said he'd do away with the $7,500 EV tax credit for new purchases, his statements suggest this is a real possibility.\n\nTax credits play an important role in providing a potential price advantage for EVs, when compared to internal combustion-engine vehicles. If this credit is removed, arguably the most-enticing competitive edge for EVs goes away -- especially with EV charging infrastructure still somewhat limited.\n\nTo add to the above, Tesla's reliance on unsustainable sources of income -- specifically, interest income earned on its cash and automotive regulatory tax credits -- have rapidly increased as a percentage of pre-tax income. In the June-ended quarter, approximately 66% of Tesla's pre-tax income came from these two sources, with $890 million of its $1.89 billion pre-tax profit from regulatory credits.\n\nIt's also unclear how Trump's tariff policy will affect domestic and international sales of EVs for American-based companies. Tesla has been aggressively reducing the sales price of its EVs (Model's 3, S, X, and Y) since the start of 2023 to counter growing competition and rising inventory levels. Unfortunately, these price cuts haven't stopped inventory levels from rising on a year-over-year basis, and they've clobbered the company's operating margin.\n\nEven if Musk were to land a role in the Trump administration, Tesla is a stock that would likely struggle with the former president back in the Oval Office.\n\nApple\n\nThe third magnificent stock that may be poised to plunge if Donald Trump wins in November is Wall Street's largest company by market cap, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nAlthough Apple's stock has soared in 2024 on the heels of its AI ambitions and excitement surrounding the eventual incorporation of AI tools into its top-selling iPhone, it's the company's Services segment that's been the real highlight for years. CEO Tim Cook is overseeing a transformation that will see Apple become a platforms company. A subscription-driven model should lift its operating margin, smooth out the sales fluctuations that occur during iPhone upgrade cycles, and further enhance the company's impressive customer loyalty.\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, it might also benefit from a further reduction of the corporate tax rate. Apple has repurchased a market-leading $700.6 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013 and reduced its outstanding share count by 42.2% in the process. A lower corporate tax rate may encourage even more buybacks.\n\nOn the other hand, Apple imports some of its products from China, is reliant on a meaningful portion of its iPhone sales from China, and the overwhelming majority of its iPhones (along with Macs and iPads) are assembled in China. Between tariffs and the potential anti-American sentiment caused by a trade war with China, Apple could see its already stalling growth engine come to a complete halt.\n\nThough buybacks have played a key role in lifting Apple's earnings per share over the last 11 years, what ails Apple's growth engine can't be fixed with the market's leading share repurchase program. Even a reduction in corporate tax rates won't be enough offset the persistent sales weakness Apple has been contending with across all of its physical product lines.\n\nWhile tech stocks and all three major stock indexes thrived under Trump's first term in office, it's my prediction that Apple will flounder if Trump wins in November.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Generative AI Is Exploding: 2 Monster Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the world by storm over the last year. Demand for generative AI, which can create intelligent responses, images, and videos from simple text instructions, is booming and expected to grow exponentially in the years to come.\n\nSome of the most widely used generative AI applications are OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot. ChatGPT has more than 200 million weekly active users, but overall, the generative AI market could increase approximately 10-fold to $356 billion by 2030, according to Statista.\n\nHere are two stocks to cash in on this opportunity.\n\n1. Soundhound AI\n\nOne area where demand for generative AI is taking off is conversational voice assistants, where Soundhound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) is emerging as a leader. The company is seeing strong demand from car manufacturers for Soundhound Chat AI, a conversational generative AI assistant. But the company is aiming to expand to more industries.\n\nSoundhound has also gained a solid foothold in the restaurant industry. More restaurants have started to reach out to Soundhound about its product rather than the other way around, which is great validation of the company's technology. Over the last three years, Soundhound's quarterly revenue more than doubled. Revenue grew 54% year-over-year to reach $13.5 million in the second quarter.\n\nSoundhound just acquired Amelia, a leading AI software company, for $80 million. The deal opens more industries for Soundhound to expand into, including healthcare, financial services, smart devices, and retail.\n\nThe stock has soared in value over the last year, but the main negative continues to be uncertainty about Soundhound's profitability. Revenue is booming, but it's still not reporting a profit. The company's adjusted net loss came to $14.8 million last quarter.\n\nHowever, Soundhound spends a lot of money on marketing, which reduces its net profit. The company spent 42% of its revenue on marketing last quarter, but this percentage is gradually falling, which can be attributed to the growing awareness of its voice AI capabilities. Looking ahead, its marketing expense could become a source of profit.\n\nIt's for these reasons the stock, which has climbed 189% over the last year, is still worth buying. Investors are getting in on the ground floor of a small-cap AI stock that could soar along with the generative AI market over the next decade.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a preferred chip supplier for people who play video games for a long time. But in recent years, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been used for mining cryptocurrencies, running cloud services in data centers, and training AI models. This has allowed Nvidia to translate its dominance in gaming GPUs into a similar lead in the AI chip market.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's GPUs are used by every major cloud service provider. It is now working with some of the largest companies in the world on AI initiatives. The company's revenue soared over the last year, up 122% year-over-year last quarter. A key driver of this demand is growing investment in the development of AI-powered chatbots and generative AI copilot assistants.\n\nOne risk for Nvidia is increasing competition from custom AI chip makers. However, Nvidia's steady innovation should protect its lead and keep its momentum going. Last quarter, it released Nvidia Inference Microservices (NIM), which is being used by more than 150 companies to speed up the development of generative AI applications. Nvidia also announced a new AI foundry service with Meta Platforms' Llama family of large language models, which will enable nations and enterprises to use their proprietary data to create custom models and AI applications.\n\nNvidia is well positioned for growth on the hardware side with its GPUs, but software is an overlooked opportunity. For example, AT&T experienced 70% cost savings after using Nvidia NIMs for generative AI call transcriptions and classification. Nvidia expects revenue from software and support services to reach an annual run-rate of nearly $2 billion by the end of the year.\n\nDespite rising nearly 200% over the last year, the stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio on next year's earnings estimate is 30, which is not that expensive for the AI chip leader. While investors shouldn't expect the stock to climb as rapidly as the previous few years, Nvidia investors can expect the stock to continue hitting new highs over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

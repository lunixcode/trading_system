        "title": "Amazon beats third-quarter earnings expectations on strong cloud growth",
        "content": "Amazon’s (AMZN) third-quarter results came in above Wall Street’s estimates thanks to strong growth in its cloud and advertising divisions.\n\nThe retail and cloud giant reported total revenues of $158.9 billion for the quarter that ended in September — an 11% increase from the previous year. Amazon reported net income of $15.3 billion and earnings per share of $1.43 — both increasing year over year.\n\nAmazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud-computing division, reported $27.5 billion in revenue, which was up 19% year over year. A year earlier, Amazon reported 12% year-over-year revenue growth for the division.\n\nAds also played a role in Amazon’s strong showing this earnings season. The retailer’s ad sales surged 19% year over year in the third quarter, to $14.3 billion.\n\n“As we get into the holiday season, we’re excited about what we have in store for customers,” Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said in a statement. “We kicked off the holiday season with our biggest-ever Prime Big Deal Days and the launch of an all-new Kindle lineup that is significantly outperforming our expectations,” he said, adding that the company is looking forward to more deals, Prime Video specials, and “over 100 new cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities that we’ll share at AWS re:Invent the week after Thanksgiving.”\n\nThe company was expected to report revenues of $157.3 billion for the quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Amazon was expected to report EPS of $1.14. In the last quarter, the company issued lower-than-expected guidance for the third quarter, setting revenue expectations between $154 and $158.5 billion — or between 8% and 11% year over year growth.\n\nAmazon shares were down 3.39% at the market close on Thursday at $186.19. After hours, the stock initially shot up by about 5%. The company’s shares are up around 24% so far this year.\n\nAfter it missed Wall Street’s expectations last quarter, Amazon’s shares slid in after-hours trading.\n\nEarlier this month, Amazon announced that it had signed three agreements “to support the development of nuclear energy projects.” The agreements include building “several” small modular reactors (SMRs), which have “a smaller physical footprint, allowing them to be built closer to the grid,” Amazon said. And compared with traditional reactors, SMRs can apparently be put online faster because construction takes less time.\n\nIn April, Jassy outlined how the company is focusing on AI in his annual letter to shareholders. Jassy said Amazon is “optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.” Earlier this year, Amazon completed its $4 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic — its largest investment in an outside company ever, as it steps up its efforts against rivals.\n\nHowever, Amazon’s plans for an AI-powered version of its virtual-assistant, Alexa, are reportedly not close to being ready. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that technical challenges are postponing Alexa AI’s release.\n\nThe company previously disputed doubts about its current Alexa AI efforts, and said its Artificial General Intelligence team has access to the company’s in-house chips, Trainium and Inferentia, and Nvidia’s (NVDA) graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nLooking ahead, Amazon set its fourth-quarter revenue guidance between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion — or between 7% and 11% growth compared to the previous fourth quarter.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon workers were 'appalled' by claims anyone was 'excited' over the in-office mandate",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) Web Services CEO Matt Garman is facing fierce criticism from a substantial segment of his workforce regarding his return-to-office (RTO) remarks.\n\nIn an open letter signed by over 500 workers, employees dispute his claim that “nine out of ten” staff members are “excited” about the shift to a five-day in-office requirement.\n\n“We were appalled to hear the non-data-driven explanation you gave for Amazon imposing a 5-day in-office mandate,” the letter states, urging Garman to rethink the policy, which they argue misrepresents their actual sentiments.\n\nGarman presented the initiative on Oct. 17 at the AWS Global Meeting, with plans to implement the strategy on Jan. 2, 2025. At the time, he stated that innovating could not happen if “we’re not in person.” This assertion has since sparked major backlash from employees who feel their voices are being ignored and believe it does not reflect their reality.\n\nEmployees argue that Garman’s emphasis on traditional brainstorming and “white-boarding” sessions overlooks the effectiveness and success achieved during the remote work period necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic. “To take no lessons from that experience would be extremely disappointing,” the letter emphasizes.\n\nThe letter articulates a growing concern that the rigid in-office policy disregards the “diverse” working styles and personal circumstances of employees, particularly those with caregiving responsibilities, disabilities, or those on work visas. The RTO mandate risks alienating “exceptional talent,” especially among senior employees who may be most affected by this policy.\n\n“We understand the transition back to the office may be challenging, so we’re sharing guidance and resources, including elder care options, pet sitters, and access to caregiver referral services,” An Amazon spokesperson told Quartz in an email, noting that it also offers various commuter benefits, like free shuttles and bike amenities.\n\nFurthermore, the letter argues that culture and innovation could be impacted, as companies that embrace flexible work are often more inclusive and better positioned to harness diverse perspectives, which can lead to enhanced creativity and problem-solving. By reverting to outdated models of work, Amazon risks undermining its potential and the trust of both employees and customers.\n\nWorkers are advocating for a flexible work environment that aligns with the evolving nature of the workplace and the global landscape. The company previously had a 3-day in-office policy. They urge leadership to recognize their concerns as an opportunity for innovation rather than a setback, challenging the company to redefine how it operates in a rapidly changing world.\n\nWith 523 signatures backing this plea for change, the outcome could have implications for Amazon’s internal culture and its standing in the competitive landscape of the tech industry. This RTO trend is not isolated, other companies like Starbucks, Walmart, and Dell have also introduced new in-office requirements.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Jeff Bezos says there is “no connection” between the Washington Post’s decision not to endorse a presidential candidate and his space company’s meeting with former President Donald Trump.\n\nBezos — who founded Amazon and Blue Origin and owns the Post — published an editorial Monday night about the Post’s decision in an effort to halt the flood of subscribers canceling their plans. As of Monday afternoon, more than 200,000 subscribers had canceled their subscriptions to the Post, accounting for about 8% of the paper’s paid circulation, NPR reports.\n\nBesides the general controversy over a newspaper of record declining to endorse a candidate for the first time in almost four decades, subscribers and online commentators alike were angered by Bezos’ reported involvement in the decision. More than that, there was the appearance of a tit-for-tat deal, with reports noting that Blue Origin had met with the former president the day that the publication said it would not make an endorsement.\n\n“I would also like to be clear that no quid pro quo of any kind is at work here,” Bezos wrote, adding that the decision was made entirely internally. “Neither campaign nor candidate was consulted or informed at any level or in any way about this decision.”\n\nThe third-richest man alive said that he sighed when he “found out” that Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp had met with Trump, writing that neither he nor Limp had known about the meeting ahead of time. According to Bezos, it was planned “quickly that morning.” Trump also met with Megan Mitchell, Blue Origin’s vice president of government relations, the Associated Press reported.\n\nBlue Origin has a $3.4 billion contract to build spacecraft for astronauts to travel to and from the moon and is competing with Elon Musk’s SpaceX and the United Launch Alliance for contracts worth up to $5.6 billion across fiscal years 2025 through 2029.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, Amazon (AMZN) sued the federal government after it lost a lucrative contract known as JEDI to Microsoft (MSFT); that $10 billion deal was later canceled by the Pentagon during the first few months of the Biden administration, which announced a new contract. Amazon had argued that Trump had launched “behind-the-scenes attacks” against it, pointing to his criticism of Bezos and the Post.\n\nThe Post’s withheld endorsement was seen as another example of tech executives and billionaires preparing for a potential second Trump administration. Meta’s (META) Mark Zuckerberg, Apple’s Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, and Google (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai have all reportedly spoken with Trump in recent weeks or months.\n\n“Every day, somewhere, some Amazon executive or Blue Origin executive or someone from the other philanthropies and companies I own or invest in is meeting with government officials,” Bezos wrote. “You can see my wealth and business interests as a bulwark against intimidation, or you can see them as a web of conflicting interests. Only my own principles can tip the balance from one to the other.”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies.\n\nHere’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry.\n\nCohere’s multilingual model family, Aya Expanse Aya Expanse - Graphic: Cohere\n\nCohere For AI, the research arm of enterprise AI platform Cohere, announced its family of multilingual models, Aya Expanse, this week.\n\nThe “highly performant” model family performs across 23 languages, and was released as both an 8 billion parameters model and a 32 billion parameters model on Kaggle and Hugging Face. Parameters are the variables a model learns from training data that guide its ability to make predictions.\n\nThe smaller model “makes breakthroughs more accessible to researchers worldwide,” while Cohere’s larger model “offers state-of-the-art multilingual capabilities,” the company said. The multilingual models outperformed open-weight models from Google (GOOGL), Mistral, and Meta (META), according to Cohere.\n\nDenmark’s first AI supercomputer, Gefion Denmark’s King Frederik X, right, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, left, and Danish Centre for AI Innovation A/S CEO Nadia Carlsten power on the supercomputer Gefion at the Vilhelm Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark on October 23, 2024. - Photo: Mads Claus Rasmussen/Ritzau Scanpix (AP)\n\nNvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang and King Frederik X of Denmark unveiled the country’s largest sovereign AI supercomputer, Gefion, this week alongside Danish Centre for AI Innovation A/S chief executive Nadia Carlsten. The country’s first AI supercomputer is named after a goddess from Danish mythology, and is operated by the Danish Center for AI Innovation. The AI supercomputer is an Nvidia DGX SuperPOD powered by 1,528 Nvidia H100 Tensor Core graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nGefion is still being prepared, and will launch in a pilot phase for projects focused on using “AI to accelerate progress, including in such areas as quantum computing, drug discovery and energy efficiency,” Nvidia said.\n\nAmazon One Medical’s new AI tools Amazon One Medical is not pictured. - Illustration: Luis Alvarez (Getty Images)\n\nAmazon One Medical (AMZN) launched new AI tools for its healthcare providers this week to reduce time spent on administrative tasks such as reviewing medical records and taking notes. The new AI tools are integrated into Amazon One Medical’s proprietary electronic health record.\n\nThe AWS HealthScribe takes notes of conversations during patient visits in real-time, which allows providers to engage with patients more, Amazon said. Afterwards, providers can review and update the notes before submitting them.\n\nAnother new AI tool can read, label, and summarize medical records from outside of Amazon One Medical, allowing providers to scan for screening exams, results, and information on medications.\n\nLuminance’s legal AI agent, Agent Lumi Agent Lumi is not pictured. - Illustration: J Studios (Getty Images)\n\nLuminance launched Agent Lumi this week, which combines the company’s proprietary, domain-specific legal large language model (LLM), AI tools, and memory. Agent Lumi “performs tasks and makes decisions without needing human oversight,” the company said.\n\nThe active AI agents can automate legal tasks on top of Luminance’s LLM, which has been trained with over 150 million verified legal documents. Agent Lumi also has short-term and long-term memory, meaning it can “retain and recall information, learning from past interactions with individual users to tailor its actions and responses over time,” according to the company.\n\nLegal AI platform Alexi’s all-in-one platform Alexi’s revamped all-in-one legal AI platform. - Image: Alexi\n\nAI litigation platform Alexi announced an all-in-one platform this week to automate up to 80% of routine legal tasks, allowing litigators more time for “high-impact work,” the company said.\n\nThe upgraded Alexi platform includes new features such as a conversational AI assistant and the ability to analyze and summarize legal documents of any length or format.\n\n“This new Alexi product is built on our strong foundation in AI-generated legal research work products; now, however, we’re revolutionizing the entire litigation workflow,” Mark Doble, chief executive of Alexi, said.\n\nClinical decision support platform, Wound AI Wound AI is not pictured. - Illustration: bymuratdeniz (Getty Images)\n\nReal-time smart application platform Vantiq, Telemedicine Solutions, and NTT DATA launched Wound AI this week, which they call a “state-of-the-art clinical decision support platform” for wound-care treatments. The platform uses generative AI to recommend precise wound care and support for deciding treatments.\n\nWound AI can integrate into existing Electronic Health Records, “and is built on a federated AI model that prioritizes data privacy and security while promoting continuous learning and improvement,” the companies said.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon isn't the only retailer offering gas discounts. Here are others",
        "content": "Deals at the pump are an increasingly popular perk in retail. Amazon (AMZN) recently announced that Prime members can get a discount of $0.10 per gallon at roughly 7,000 gas stations affiliated with BP (BP), including Amoco and Ampm. However, Amazon isn’t the only retailer offering fuel discounts – Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) also provide their loyalty members perks at the pump.\n\nHere’s a look at how these options work and how drivers can potentially save.\n\nAmazon Prime and BP gas stations:\n\nTo snag $0.10 off per gallon, Prime members must sign up for Earnify, BP’s gas loyalty program. They’ll need to activate the offer on a dedicated Amazon page and link their accounts.\n\nUsing the Earnify app, members can locate a nearby BP, Amoco, or Ampm station across the U.S. The discount can then be redeemed by entering the phone number associated with the payment method at the pump, or by using the app to choose the station and pump. Amazon claims this can save members about $70 annually.\n\nThe annual cost of an Amazon Prime membership is $139, approximately $15 a month, and offers a range of services beyond fuel savings.\n\nWalmart+, Exxon, Mobil, and more gas stations:\n\nWalmart+ members can save $0.10 per gallon at over 14,000 gas stations, including Exxon (XOM), Mobil, Walmart, Sam’s Club, and Murphy (MUSA) stations, with a $0.05 discount in Alabama and Oklahoma.\n\nTo redeem, members can use the Walmart app to access member prices and can pay at the pump or inside the store. At Murphy stations, members must enter a 6-digit discount ID from the app, while at Exxon and Mobil, they can scan a QR code before fueling. Savings are reflected in their purchase history.\n\nThe annual cost of Walmart+ is $98, about $12.95 per month, and it also comes with additional benefits.\n\nKroger and Shell gas stations:\n\nKroger members earn fuel points for every dollar spent on groceries using a complimentary Kroger Plus Card. At Kroger stations, customers can use up to 1,000 fuel points for $1 off per gallon, while at Shell (SHEL), 100 points translates to $0.10 off per gallon.\n\nTo redeem points at Shell, customers need to press “rewards” at the pump, then swipe their fuel rewards card or enter an alternate ID. Nearby participating stations can be located via the Kroger app.\n\nKroger offers a Plus membership at no cost. However, for those seeking additional discounts on groceries and more fuel points, the grocer provides two other membership tiers: The first costs $59 annually, while the second is priced at $99 a year. Kroger claims the highest tier can save shoppers $1,057 a year.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) subscribers pony up for Prime in exchange for free two-day shipping, discounts on services such as Grubhub, and access to films and TV shows on Prime Video. Now they can add gas savings to that list.\n\nAmazon announced Wednesday that Prime members can now now save $0.10 per gallon at approximately 7,000 BP-affiliated (BP) gas stations across the country, including Amoco and Ampm.\n\nFor the average U.S. driver, this could translate to nearly $70 in annual savings, according to Amazon. Amazon Prime memberships start at $14.99 a month or $139 a year.\n\n“We’re always asking ourselves how Prime can save members more money, and fuel savings is our latest offer that puts money back into members’ wallets,” the e-commerce giant said in a blog post announcing the perk.\n\nAmazon added that it plans to expand these transportation-related savings to EV drivers in 2025, with an EV charging savings offer at BP pulse, which is BP’s electric vehicle charging business.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nTo unlock $0.10 off per gallon, Prime members will need an account with Earnify, a gas loyalty program from BP. Subscribers then must visit a page set up by Amazon to activate the offer and link their Amazon account with Earnify.\n\nMembers can use the Earnify app’s store locator to find nearby BP, Amoco, or Ampm gas stations. To redeem the offer, members must enter their phone number or linked payment method at the pump. Or, they can use the Earnify app to select the station and pump.\n\nBehind the deal\n\nBP and Amazon started working together publicly at the end of 2019. At the time, BP said it would supply renewable energy to Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers in Europe, while Amazon said BP would migrate data to AWS. In each announcement, the companies cited BP’s environmental efforts.\n\nYet, Reuters reported earlier this month that BP has cast aside its pledge to lower its oil and gas output by 2030.\n\nOther tech and energy giants have recently scaled back some of their own environmental promises, including ExxonMobil, Shell, and Google.\n\nHarri Weber contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nAmazon boss to unhappy remote workers: Go find a new job Walmart is taking on Amazon with prescription delivery.

        "content": "Competition in the pharmacy sector is heating up as Walmart announces it will offer same-day prescription delivery.\n\nThe move comes at time when traditional pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens face significant challenges, including store closures and fierce competition for market share.\n\nWalmart’s (WMT) new delivery service is currently available in six states —Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Nevada, South Carolina, and Wisconsin — with plans to expand to 49 states by January 2025, potentially reaching tens of millions of customers, the company said.\n\nCustomers can bundle prescriptions with other items like groceries for a delivery fee of $9.95 or for free with a Walmart+ membership. The service allows users to order both new prescriptions and refills directly from their local Walmart or online. Multiple delivery options are available, including same-day scheduled delivery, and upcoming on-demand options that can deliver prescriptions within hours or as quickly as 30 minutes. Medications are securely packaged, Walmart said, noting that customers can track the orders in real-time and receive confirmation upon delivery.\n\nKevin Host, Senior Vice President of Pharmacy at Walmart U.S., emphasized that the company’s footprint – it has 4,600 U.S. locations – and pharmacy expertise allow it to meet the diverse needs of local communities.\n\n“Health is not a one-size-fits-all solution,” Host said. “This new offering allows us to serve customers while freeing up our pharmacies for high-touch health services.”\n\nWalmart’s expansion into prescription puts it into direct competition with drugstore chains like CVS and Walgreens (WBA), which also offer delivery options but have struggled lately. It could also help Walmart compete with e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN), which recently announced plans to open pharmacies in 20 new cities across the U.S. in 2025, expanding its same-day delivery prescription service.\n\nEarlier this year, Walmart reported robust quarterly earnings that highlighted it was getting a big sales boost from wealthier shoppers. Still, the company in April said it planned to close all 51 of health care clinics due to a lack of profitability.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) Web Services CEO Matt Garman has a message for the scores of workers unhappy about the return-to-work mandate: find another job.\n\nSpeaking at The Wall Street Journal’s (NWS) Tech Live event, Garman said Monday evening that requiring workers to be in the office five days a week starting in January is necessary for the company.\n\n“Particularly as we really think about how do we want to disrupt and we want to invent on behalf of our customers, we find that there is no substitution for doing that in person,” Garman said, according to Business Insider.\n\nThe CEO believes innovation is best executed with speed in person. “Just the creative energy and how fast you’re able to iterate when you’re sitting there writing on a whiteboard or you’re talking to people in the cubicle next to you or you’re running into people that are in a different department, but you see them at the coffee line or whatever it is,” he said.\n\nThat’s why he happily told his employees: “If it’s not for you, then that’s okay — you can go and find another company if you want to.”\n\nGarman said the three-day-a-week policy didn’t work because people came on different days. He also claimed that most employees were excited to be working in person.\n\nHe made a similar statement in a company-wide meeting last week, telling workers if they “just don’t work well in that environment and don’t want to, that’s okay, there are other companies around.”\n\n“At Amazon, we want to be in an environment where we are working together, and we feel that collaborative environment is incredibly important for our innovation and for our culture,” he said.\n\nWhen the new policy was announced, many employees took to internal forums to post their dissatisfaction. Some even publicly said they were quitting over the change.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Should You Buy Costco Stock? These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Cheaper and Growing Faster",
        "content": "Shares of Costco(NASDAQ: COST) are up 54% over the last 12 months, but most of that return was driven by an increase in the price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple that Wall Street is willing to pay for the shares -- not actual growth in the company's earnings per share.\n\nAnalysts expect Costco to report annualized earnings growth of 9% over the long term, yet the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio that is usually reserved for the best growth stocks. Costco's forward P/E of 45 is even more expensive than some of the world's strongest tech companies, including top Magnificent Seven stocksAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which are expected to grow earnings faster and trade at lower valuations. COST PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nCostco is a retailer trading at a growth tech stock valuation, and Wall Street has made this mistake before. In the late 1990s, shares of Coca-Cola and Walmart traded at over 50 times earnings. The subsequent returns over the next decade were disappointing, as these stalwarts couldn't deliver enough earnings growth to support their high valuation.\n\nThe key to success in the stock market is to always go for strong businesses that offer the best growth prospects at a relatively attractive valuation. This framework says to pass on Costco right now, because there are plenty of growth stocks offering better value. These Magnificent Seven stocks are a good place to start.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon is one of Costco's chief competitors in e-commerce. To its credit, Costco is growing its online sales faster than Amazon. Costco's e-commerce business grew sales 19% year over year on an adjusted basis in the fiscal quarter ending Sept. 1. This beats Amazon's single-digit growth from online stores.\n\nCostco has the benefit of growing from a smaller base of online sales than Amazon. Amazon controlled 37% of the domestic e-commerce market in 2023, according to Statista, compared to 6% for No. 2 Walmart. Costco was in a distant seventh place with 1.5% share.\n\nHowever, considering all of Amazon's revenue sources -- including advertising, cloud services, subscription services, and physical retail locations -- it's better positioned to deliver superior returns to investors. Amazon's total revenue grew 10% year over year in the second quarter. Over the last 10 years, Amazon grew sales at a 22% compound annual rate, compared to just 8% for Costco.\n\nMoreover, Amazon is implementing several cost-cutting initiatives to bolster its profits. Operating income grew 91% year over year last quarter, as management continues to shorten transportation distances between fulfillment centers and customers' doorsteps. In contrast, Costco's operating profit grew just 9% year over year last quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nImportantly, most of Amazon's operating income comes from its cloud services business. Amazon Web Services is the top cloud provider in a $297 billion market that grew 22% in Q2, according to Synergy Research. The lucrative revenue streams Amazon generates from non-retail services like cloud computing are a major advantage over traditional retailers. They allow Amazon to be more aggressive in investing in e-commerce infrastructure to protect its lead.\n\nAnalysts expect Amazon's earnings per share to grow 23% on an annualized basis over the long term. The stock's forward P/E is 39 on 2024 earnings estimates, which is a discount to Costco shares, and should lead to better returns. COST EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia shares have delivered incredible returns of over 2,700% over the last five years. Some investors might look at that amazing run and assume the stock is overvalued. But this top semiconductor company is benefiting from powerful trends in artificial intelligence (AI) and data center growth that could fuel more market-beating returns.\n\nWall Street has underestimated the market for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs were originally used in the 1990s for playing video games and running other graphics-intensive computer software. But in recent years, Nvidia's chips have run some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.\n\nThe company estimates that there is about $1 trillion worth of data center infrastructure in the process of switching from legacy computing hardware to more powerful GPUs that are needed to accelerate computer processing for AI workloads. As a result, Nvidia's revenue has accelerated over the last few years, as data centers build more optimized infrastructure to train AI models, which require tremendous amounts of data and computing horsepower. COST Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIt's important to be aware that, as a leading company in a cyclical chip industry, Nvidia's revenue growth hasn't been as consistent as Costco's. But investors are being well compensated for accepting a more bumpy ride.\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia to deliver 38% annualized earnings growth over the next several years. Nvidia's earnings jumped 168% year over year in the most recent quarter. This is thanks to a shortage in AI chips relative to demand, which is allowing Nvidia to charge high prices. Over the last 10 years, Nvidia's earnings grew at a compound rate of 51%. The opportunities ahead in the data center market should continue to drive stronger growth and returns for shareholders than Costco shares.\n\nNvidia currently trades at a forward P/E of 49. But using next year's earnings estimate, the stock trades at a forward P/E of 34, compared to a more expensive 45 multiple for Costco.\n\nDon't pay a high P/E for below-average growth\n\nThere is a right time to pay a high valuation for a stock, but there are also wrong times. To justify a high P/E, the company needs to deliver lots of earnings growth. Amazon and Nvidia are meeting those expectations, but investors should think twice before paying a high P/E for Costco's single-digit sales and earnings growth.\n\nThere are plenty of expensive-looking growth stocks that have crushed the stock market's average return, but Costco can't be considered a growth stock when it's not growing earnings higher than the average company in the S&P 500 index.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,285!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $44,456!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $411,959!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 14, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI news investors should not miss.\n\nAccording to Ark Invest, an investment manager focused on disruptive technologies, artificial intelligence breakthroughs are expected to increase the share of the global equity market associated with disruptive innovation from 16% to 60% by 2030. With inflation transitioning to deflation in several sectors, the firm believes that five innovation platforms, namely robotics, energy storage, AI, blockchain, and multi-OMIC (biological analysis) sequencing will be profoundly impacting macroeconomic metrics over the next few years.\n\n“Interest rates are likely to surprise on the low side of expectations, broadening the equity rally from a narrow subset of stocks and reinforcing the need for diversified AI investments.” -Catherine Wood, CEO and CIO\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOne of the firm's ETFs with the investment theme of next-generation internet outperformed broad-based global equity indices in the third quarter, benefiting from its holdings in companies involved in innovative technologies. The year-to-date performance of the fund is 16.81%, outperforming its category by 1.59 percentage points year-to-date.\n\nIn light of this trend, joining CNBC’s “The Exchange”, technology reporter Kate Rooney revealed how Wall Street is trying to cash in on the AI craze using AI itself. According to Rooney, the new world of generative AI is starting an “arms race for hedge funds”. Modern versions of AI today are better than human traders in ways more than one. They learn from mistakes and get smarter along the way, and they ultimately require minimal human intervention. Combining this with the rise of OpenAI and Anthropic, these “off-the-shelf” models tend to be cheaper.\n\nMoreover, while human traders may be capable, they often succumb to emotions and tend to make mistakes. This is why Intelligent Alpha CEO Doug Clinton believes that a “lack of emotion” is actually the edge or “superpower” of AI. That said, the program revealed how hedge funds are now looking into AI to “get ahead of the markets”, where their use of AI will ultimately help them improve decision-making in the field. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, which have raised significant capital along the way, ultimately need enterprise clients to scale, and Wall Street is an ideal fit due to its reliance on data and analysis.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntelligent Alpha has launched a first-of-its-kind ETF named after famed stock trader Jesse Livermore. The ETF uses OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini to construct a global equity portfolio. As per Clinton, firms that get on board with AI could gain an edge with a price tag of millions of dollars.\n\n“What it does is it adds some intelligence to indexes, which are just definitionally sort of a set of rules that can’t be smart. And they also take that emotion out of the active side where human beings are still making decisions, but we get caught up. You know, we make mistakes and sometimes those compound. And so I think by fixing those two issues, AI has the potential to really capture a lot of value in terms of assets flowing to these new AI-powered funds.” - Intelligent Alpha CEO\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Collaborates with Databricks on Generative AI, Aiming for Competitive Edge in Cost and Performance with AWS\n\nKen Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American technology company offering e-commerce, cloud computing, and other services, including digital streaming and artificial intelligence solutions. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) uses artificial intelligence for everything from reinventing shopping experiences to automated ad creatives, streamlining healthcare access, and more with generative AI powered by Amazon Web Services.\n\nIn its latest step in advancing its reach towards AI, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has struck a five-year deal with startup Databricks, a data and artificial intelligence company. This deal can potentially help businesses looking to cut costs when building their own artificial intelligence capabilities by developing custom generative AI models built with Databricks Mosaic AI on AWS.\n\nDatabricks will be using Amazon’s Trainium AI chips for powering the training and serving of their large language models, providing joint customers with unmatched scale, performance, and cost-efficiency for their generative AI applications. While many tech analysts and business leaders don’t consider Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a leader in AI innovation, its AI chips, Trainium and Inferentia, are helping it change the narrative and that too, cost-efficiently.\n\n“Generative AI is disrupting every industry and a company’s data will ultimately be its competitive advantage. Strengthening our collaboration with AWS allows us to provide customers with unmatched scale and price-performance so they can bring their own generative AI applications to market more rapidly”. -Ali Ghodsi, Co-founder and CEO at Databricks.\n\nOverall, AMZN ranks 1st among the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Best American Stocks To Buy and Hold in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024.\n\nNeutral Stance Amid Uncertainties\n\nThe tech sector has been showing positive performance amid market concerns, driven by improved earnings estimates and substantial investments in artificial intelligence. Approximately 40% of operating cash flow is currently allocated to AI, raising questions about when these investments will begin to yield returns. The strong profit margins of mega-cap stocks, averaging over 23%, compared to just over 8.5% for other sectors, suggest continued capital inflows into tech companies demonstrating earnings strength. While some consolidation and growth slowdown may occur, there is confidence that investor sentiment will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.\n\nAs sentiments shift regarding major tech stocks, other profitable tech companies are maintaining positive momentum in the market. There was a conversation regarding this, covered a few days back in our article about the 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In, where Jason Snipe, Odyssey Capital Advisors principal, discussed the tech sector’s mega-cap momentum, particularly in light of recent mega-cap stock downgrades and significant investor outflows. Here’s an excerpt from his sentiment:\n\n“…This focus on AI has contributed to some recent downgrades but also suggests continued upside potential for select names within the sector.\n\n…He acknowledged that while there may be some consolidation and a slowdown in growth, he believes that investors’ muscle memory will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.\n\nSnipe’s analysis underscores the complexities facing the tech sector amid market volatility and evolving economic conditions. While challenges persist, particularly with mega-cap stocks experiencing downgrades, there are also significant opportunities driven by innovation and strong profit margins that could support continued growth in this space…”\n\nKatie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on October 17 and highlighted that there’s a likelihood that the markets could move into choppier territory. Katie Stockton characterized her stance as neutral regarding the indices despite the strength of the trend and the participation of most stocks on the upside. She noted that while short-term momentum is currently positive, particularly behind major indices, there are concerns about potential problems if key players like NVIDIA falter. She highlighted that sentiment appears overly bullish or greedy, as evidenced by the Fear and Greed Index reaching an extreme level of 5%. This situation makes it challenging for the market to sustain overbought conditions, which are prevalent across various timeframes.\n\nStory continues\n\nStockton anticipates a pullback or possibly a more significant corrective phase in the fourth quarter for the S&P 500, suggesting that this could mark the beginning of a range-bound environment. She pointed to indicators such as the VIX, which has entered a new higher volatility cycle, and mentioned signs of long-term exhaustion indicated by the DeMark indicators, levels not seen collectively since late 2021. While this does not necessarily signal an impending bear market, it does enhance the likelihood of experiencing a choppier trading environment.\n\nWhen asked about the recent performance of banks and cyclical stocks compared to defensive stocks, Stockton acknowledged that while there has been a positive move from the financial sector contributing to the S&P 500’s recent gains, it is too early to conclude that this represents a breakout in relative strength for financials. She indicated that most metrics suggest financials will likely perform in line with broader market trends rather than leading them. Furthermore, she expressed concern that mega-cap sectors are poised to lose their leadership position, which could pose challenges to overall market performance.\n\nRegarding small-cap stocks, Stockton noted that while the Russell 2000 index made another attempt at an upside move, closing close to 2,300 with a 1.6% increase, long-term trends still indicate underperformance relative to the S&P 500. She pointed out that there has not been a breakout in the Russell 2000, which remains stalled below resistance levels established during summer highs. Consequently, she does not see actionable opportunities in small caps at this time and anticipates neutral trading conditions for this segment.\n\nOn the topic of bonds, Stockton mentioned that Treasury yields have shown some upside momentum but backed off recently. She sees potential entry points in Treasury bond proxies like TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF), suggesting signs of short-term downside exhaustion within a broader long-term uptrend for fixed income. She believes there is an opportunity for investors to enter Treasury bond proxies now, while also expecting yields to stall without significant long-term declines.\n\nHer insights highlight her focus on maintaining balance amid prevailing uncertainties in both equity and bond markets.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo find the best American stocks, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database to find US stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): A Prime Choice for AI and Cloud Investment in 2024\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a multinational technology company that revolutionized e-commerce, offering a vast selection of products, from books and electronics to groceries and clothing. Beyond retail, it provides cloud computing services through AWS, streaming content through Prime Video, and offers voice-enabled smart devices powered by Alexa.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the company saw a 10.12% jump in revenue as compared to the year-ago period, driven by a 19% rise in AWS and $14.7 billion in operating income. The company now expects continued growth of 8-11% in Q3 2024. It has poured $30.5 billion into AI this year, with plans to increase spending. This reflects the growing demand for generative and non-generative AI.\n\nThe company partnered with Databricks for a five-year deal to create a data warehouse startup using Amazon.com Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Trainium AI processors. This will help businesses develop AI models more efficiently and cost-effectively, leveraging the benefits of Amazon.com Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AI chips.\n\nOn October 16, it introduced a new Kindle device with a color display, the Kindle Colorsoft. This is a significant update as the company has been criticized for lacking a color e-reader. Additionally, the Kindle Scribe now has AI features for summarizing notes, and the Kindle Paperwhite has been slimmed down while maintaining its long battery life.\n\nIts diverse business model, led by its dominant cloud division and growing advertising segment, positions it for continued success. Record-breaking Prime sales further solidify its position as a leading e-commerce and technology giant, making Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) a strong investment option.\n\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.”\n\nOverall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best US Stocks For Foreign Investors Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other US stocks.\n\nOptimism Amid Market Strength\n\nDespite previous recession predictions, the market has shown resilience and continued to rise, largely due to multiple expansions rather than just earnings growth. Current market valuations are trading at approximately 22 times earnings during an easing cycle, raising questions about future earnings growth. There seems to be a disconnect between expectations for significant easing and projected strong earnings growth.\n\nInvestors are encouraged to remain vigilant and consider the evolving economic landscape as they navigate potential market shifts. Earlier in October, Jason Trennert, Strategas Research Partners chairman and CEO, joined CNBC to discuss the latest market trends and the state of the economy, highlighting that the bar is high to get bearish now. We covered his opinion in our article about the 8 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Invest In Now in much more detail. Here's an excerpt from that discussion:\n\n“Despite the challenges of 2022 and early 2023, which made it difficult to envision a market recovery, he noted that the market has defied expectations and continued to rise. Trennert attributed a significant portion of this upward movement to multiple expansions rather than just earnings growth. He marked a pivotal moment in 2023 as the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, which led to increased liquidity in the market and a subsequent rally. He recalled that around eleven months ago, the S&P 500 briefly hit 4,100 when ten-year yields reached 5%, suggesting that market dynamics have shifted considerably since then.\n\n....He expressed skepticism about future earnings growth, as expectations for a 14% increase in S&P earnings next year seem inconsistent with the anticipated six rate cuts from the Fed. He emphasized that if the market is expecting such significant easing while also projecting strong earnings growth, there may be a disconnect.\n\n...Despite these concerns, Trennert acknowledged that it is challenging to adopt a bearish outlook given current market conditions. He noted that ten-year treasury yields above 4.5% typically lead to market indigestion, while yields below this threshold make it hard to remain pessimistic.”\n\nOn October 16, J.J. Kinahan, IG North America CEO, joined CNBC's 'Squawk Box' to discuss the latest market trends, highlighting that he has never seen investors this afraid of a market that's doing so well. J.J. Kinahan noted that the upcoming weeks would be particularly interesting due to the convergence of earnings reports and the impending election, alongside uncertainty surrounding the Fed's next moves. He remarked on the market's resilience, highlighting that there have been 46 new highs for the S&P 500 this year, despite a general sentiment of skepticism among investors. He expressed that it is unusual for a market to perform so well while simultaneously being viewed with caution and fear.\n\nStory continues\n\nKinahan pointed out that many investors are hesitant, particularly those in their mid-30s and younger, who have not experienced a significant downturn in the market. He explained that this demographic often perceives any market decline as temporary, lasting only a few days. He emphasized the importance of taking risks when young and noted that many younger investors are excited about their opportunities in the current market environment. This positive sentiment is particularly significant given their parents' experiences during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.\n\nHe also speculated that part of the reason for the market's strong performance might be attributed to older investors who have been burned in previous downturns and are now waiting for a pullback that has yet to materialize. Kinahan suggested that as these investors gradually capitulate, they may start to invest more actively in the market.\n\nDiscussing interest rates, Kinahan acknowledged that while the Fed is in a massive easing cycle, there seems to be a disconnect with the bond market recently. He mentioned a study indicating that volatility during election years is not significantly greater than in non-election years. Currently, volatility is relatively low, hovering around a historical average of 20, and only recently rising to this level. He explained that typically, volatility tends to increase after elections, when political changes begin to take effect and policies, are implemented. He anticipated that January would bring more clarity regarding how these changes might impact the markets.\n\nKinahan's insights reflect a complex interplay between investor sentiment, market performance, and external economic factors as they navigate through earnings season and an election year. His perspective underscores a cautious optimism about the market's ability to maintain its upward trajectory despite prevailing uncertainties.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo find the best US stocks for foreign investors, we used Insider Monkey's proprietary database to find US stocks that were the most popular among elite and that analysts were bullish on.

The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their average analysts' upside potential, as of October 16.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 17.14%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) originally started as an online bookselling company and then later morphed into an internet-based business enterprise that is largely focused on providing e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence services. Its logistics network ensures efficient delivery, and it continues to expand into new areas like healthcare and digital advertising.\n\nAWS, its cloud computing division has over 30% profit margins and a projected growth rate of 15-21% annually until 2028. This impressive growth was exemplified by a recent 18.8% increase in Q2 2024. Another key driver of the company's profitability is Amazon Prime. With 200 million global members, its revenue reaches ~$100 billion annually. The advertising business has also become a major source of income, now valued at $50 billion.\n\nOverall, its Q2 2024 results were encouraging, with a 10.12% year-over-year revenue jump driven by strong performance across all segments. AWS, in particular, led the way with a 19% increase. Operating income also soared to a healthy $14.7 billion. Looking ahead, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) anticipates continued sales growth of 8-11% in Q3 2024.\n\nOn October 10, the company revealed that its Prime Big Deal Days event set new records for October shopping events. Year over year, a greater number of Prime members participated, taking advantage of early holiday promotions. The two-day event kicked off the holiday shopping season with record sales, surpassing all previous October events in terms of items sold.\n\nOne key area of investment is AI. It has already allocated $30.5 billion to capital expenditures this year and plans to increase this spending in the second half. This significant investment is driven by the surging demand for both generative and non-generative AI technologies. By investing heavily in AI infrastructure, the company is demonstrating its commitment to staying at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field. The focus on high-growth areas positions it for continued dominance in the e-commerce and technology landscape.\n\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 8th on our list of the best US stocks for foreign investors right now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of AMZN, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Amazon.com (AMZN): Among the Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other profitable stocks.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on October 14, Michael Kantrowitz, Chief Investment Officer at Piper Sandler noted that while the market is expensive, it's not a reason to get bearish and that unless a risk arises, the market will likely stay expensive. Kantrowitz explains that the market's valuation is driven by the pricing out of risks that existed two years ago, such as inflation and higher interest rates. He believes that if these risks were to resurface, it would be a reason to get worried, but currently, that's not the backdrop.\n\nHe also notes that investors should focus on stocks with continued earnings momentum, as these names will likely see the best outperformance and can hold their expensive multiples for longer. Kantrowitz is not too concerned about higher bond yields but notes that they can be a problem at some point. He thinks that yields would need to reach 4.25% to show up in the broader market.\n\nRegarding earnings revisions, Kantrowitz believes that revisions coming down have not overdone it and that it's normal to see estimates from the sell-side start out high and then trickle down throughout the year. He expects to see more downward earnings revisions but notes that large-cap stocks have held up far better in terms of earnings, which is why they continue to outperform.\n\nTom Lee, Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors discussed the markets and his recent observations. Lee believes that the market's resilience is due to the large amount of cash on the sidelines. He thinks that investors have been under-invested in stocks and that the market is becoming less dependent on macro data.\n\nLee pointed out that the market has been able to shrug off negative news and that the recent PPI and CPI reports were not enough to knock the market off track. He believes that the Fed will continue to be dovish, especially since inflation is still tracking towards the 2% target. Lee also thinks that the election, which is becoming less of a coin toss, is also contributing to the market's conviction.\n\nRegarding the impact of the election on the market, Lee believes that markets like visibility, but they also need to like what they see on the other side of the election. He thinks that whether Trump or Harris wins, stocks will do well next year, but there will be differences in sector and asset class performance depending on who wins.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile some may be concerned about the market's expensive valuation, others see it as a sign of strength and resilience, with that in context, let’s take a look at the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 30 largest companies by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to companies with positive TTM net income and 10-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 10-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income. Our list is sorted in ascending order of the 10-year net income growth rates.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 smallcap and largecap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\n10-Year Net Income CAGR: 73.38%\n\nTTM Net Income: $44.42 Billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\n\nAmazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global e-commerce and cloud computing giant, offering a wide range of products and services. The company’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the market leader in cloud infrastructure, contributing significantly to the company’s profitability. Amazon.com’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) growth has been driven by its diverse business model, which includes e-commerce, logistics, entertainment (Prime Video), and artificial intelligence (Alexa). The company’s focus on customer satisfaction and innovation continues to fuel its dominance in multiple industries and is one of the largest companies in the world.\n\nOne of the key drivers of Amazon.com’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) growth is its leadership in the cloud computing market, with a 31% market share. The company's cloud business is expected to continue to drive growth, driven by the increasing adoption of cloud computing and the growing demand for data storage and analytics. Additionally, Amazon.com’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) e-commerce business is expected to continue to benefit from the growing trend of online shopping, with the company's strong logistics and supply chain capabilities allowing it to offer fast and reliable shipping to its customers.\n\nAmazon's innovative technologies, including its artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics capabilities, are also expected to drive growth and improve the company's operating efficiency. The company's AI-powered advertising platform, for example, has improved the effectiveness of its advertising business, while its robotics division has improved the efficiency of its logistics operations.\n\nFurthermore, Amazon's international expansion is expected to drive growth, with the company having lower penetration in certain regions. The company's international segment has already started to show signs of improvement, with an operating margin of 5.63% in North America and 0.5% in international markets.\n\nAmazon.com’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strong fundamentals, diversified revenue streams, and innovative technologies make it an attractive investment opportunity. The company’s earnings are projected to increase by almost 48% in the current year. Industry analysts have reached a consensus on the stock’s Buy rating, with an average target price of $218.90 that suggests an 15.35% upside potential from its current levels.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the most profitable stocks of the last 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "3 Must-Watch Tech Earnings Reports Coming Up",
        "content": "Three major players—Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon—are set to release their quarterly earnings reports, and all eyes will be on these updates to assess their growth, resilience, and ability to drive future trends.\n\nThese earnings reports are particularly important as they will reveal how these tech leaders are leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence, expanding cloud computing services, and navigating macroeconomic challenges such as changing consumer habits, monetary policy, and geopolitical uncertainties.\n\nInvestors will also be watching closely to see whether these companies can help sustain the rally in the U.S. stock market. Last week, the S&P 500 reached a new all-time high, marking a 23% year-to-date gain, while the Dow Jones closed above the 43,000 mark for the first time, signaling continued optimism about market growth.\n\nAccording to Bank of America, as earnings season kicked off, 30 companies in the S&P 500 surpassed earnings expectations by an average of 5%, up from 3% at the start of the last quarter. An additional 41 S&P 500 companies reported results last week. However, with the S&P 500 currently trading at around 21.8 times forward earnings—well above its long-term average of 15.7—some analysts caution that stock valuations may be stretched. Any disappointment in these reports could trigger a market correction as investors reassess valuations.\n\nAs we look ahead to big tech’s upcoming releases, here’s what to watch for:\n\n1# ​​​​Will Microsoft’s Azure Unit Miss Expectations Again?\n\nMicrosoft delivered stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter, with total revenue rising 15% year-over-year. Net income climbed to $22.04 billion, up from $20.08 billion in the same quarter last year, translating to $2.69 per share.\n\nWhile these results were solid, investor attention was focused on Azure’s performance, which fell below expectations for the first time since 2022. Azure and other cloud services posted 29% revenue growth, but this missed consensus estimates, sparking concerns about whether Microsoft’s cloud unit is losing momentum in an increasingly competitive market.\n\nDespite the Azure miss, Microsoft’s management remains optimistic about future growth, suggesting potential acceleration in the coming quarters. However, investors remain cautious, as Azure’s performance is now a critical driver of Microsoft’s overall growth, especially as cloud computing continues to gain importance across industries.\n\nAs Microsoft prepares to release its fiscal Q1 2025 earnings on Tuesday, Oct. 22, after market close, all eyes will be on Azure once again. Analysts are forecasting a profit of $3.10 per share, with total revenue expected to dip slightly from $64.73 billion to $64.54 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far this year, Microsoft shares are up 12.75%, hovering around $418. Daily Microsoft Chart – Source: ActivTrader\n\n2# Can IBM’s Share Price Hit New Highs with a Strong Earnings Surprise?\n\nIBM has made notable progress in its business, particularly with its focus on generative artificial intelligence, which played a key role in its strong performance last quarter. In its second-quarter earnings report from July, IBM exceeded analysts’ expectations, reporting a 1.9% revenue increase to $15.48 billion compared to the previous year. Net income also rose significantly to $1.83 billion, or $1.96 per share, up from $1.58 billion, or $1.72 per share, a year earlier.\n\nDespite these gains, IBM faces several macroeconomic challenges, including higher interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical uncertainties, which may impact its growth. Still, the company remains confident in its tech-driven approach, particularly in AI and cloud computing, which it believes will fuel future success.\n\nAs IBM prepares to release its Q3 2024 earnings on Wednesday, Oct. 23, investors are eager to see if the company can once again exceed expectations. Analysts forecast a slower profit of $2.22 per share, down from $2.43 in the previous quarter, and a slight revenue dip from $15.77 billion to $15.06 billion. If IBM delivers a strong performance—boosted by AI adoption or robust hybrid cloud growth—it could reignite investor confidence and push the share price to new highs.\n\nSo far this year, IBM shares are up 43.78%, hovering around $232. Daily IBM Chart – Source: ActivTrader\n\n3# Is Amazon Still Losing Ground to Its Peers?\n\nAmazon reported softer-than-expected revenue for the second quarter, alongside a disappointing forecast for the third quarter. Net sales grew 10% year-over-year to $148.0 billion, up from $134.4 billion in the same period last year, but fell short of the $148.56 billion projected by analysts at LSEG. Despite the revenue miss, Amazon saw a significant boost in profitability, with net income climbing to $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per diluted share, compared to $6.7 billion, or $0.65 per diluted share, a year ago.\n\nThe underwhelming revenue performance is largely attributed to sluggish growth in Amazon’s core retail business, where competition from discount platforms like Temu and Shein has intensified. These rivals, which allow Chinese merchants to sell low-cost products to U.S. consumers, are eating into Amazon’s market share. Sales in Amazon’s online stores segment grew just 5% year-over-year, reflecting consumers opting for cheaper products and leading to a decline in the company’s average selling price (ASP).\n\nOn the cloud front, Amazon Web Services (AWS) performed well, growing 19% year-over-year and generating $26.3 billion in revenue, surpassing estimates of $26 billion. However, AWS is expanding at a slower pace compared to its major competitors, Microsoft and Google, whose cloud divisions are growing more rapidly.\n\nAs Amazon looks ahead, the company faces the challenge of balancing slow retail growth with rising competition in both e-commerce and cloud computing, adding pressure to innovate and find new growth opportunities in the next quarter.\n\nSo far this year, Amazon shares are up 26.05%, hovering around $188.

        "title": "Tesla, Boeing, UPS highlight earnings rush: What to know this week",
        "content": "[ADD WHAT TO WATCH VIDEO]\n\nStocks secured their sixth straight week of wins on Friday as strong earnings from Netflix (NFLX) boosted the overall tech sector. The attention now turns to other Magnificent Seven names, with EV maker Tesla (TSLA) set to report quarterly results on Wednesday.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led markets higher, up about 1% over the past week. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) followed, each securing weekly gains of around 0.9% and 0.8% respectively.\n\nBoth the Dow Jones and S&P 500 reached all-time highs throughout the course of the week as well.\n\nMeanwhile, the rotation out of megacap tech and into other areas of the market was on display this week as Utilities (XLU) ripped higher to end the five-day period up 3.4%, followed by Real Estate (XLRE) and Financials (XLF) with gains of 3% and 2.4%, respectively. Small caps also outpaced the major indexes, with the Russell 2000 (^RUT) finishing the week up around 2%.\n\nThe market moves come as investors have enjoyed a particularly strong start to earnings season, with Big Tech giants like Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) still yet to report.\n\nSo far, 79% of S&P 500 companies have delivered a positive earnings surprise for Q3, which is above the overall five-year average of 77%, according to FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters.\n\nThe earnings season party will continue this week, with reports from Tesla, Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), American Airlines (AAL), and UPS (UPS) among names set to highlight a busy calendar.\n\nOutside of earnings, investors will also be monitoring a slew of economic data, including the final reading of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan due Friday. The Fed Beige Book, slated for Wednesday, will provide another pulse check on current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve districts.\n\nThe housing market will also be top of mind after mortgage rates increased for the third consecutive week, with the 30-year fixed rate inching closer to 6.5%.\n\nA weekly update on jobless claims is also on the schedule, as well as activity checks from the services and manufacturing sectors.\n\nCan Tesla drive strong earnings growth?\n\nTesla is set to deliver quarterly earnings on Wednesday following the much-anticipated \"We, Robot\" event that took place on Oct. 10.\n\nWall Street analysts polled by Bloomberg expect the EV giant to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 on revenue of $25.42 billion. Global deliveries, which improved sequentially for the first time this year, along with a potential tick-up in automative gross margins, should help boost profits in the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, investors remain on edge when it comes to the company's future investments after last week's robotaxi unveiling fell short of expectations. Tesla's robotaxi is displayed at an unveiling event in Los Angeles, Calif., U.S. Oct. 10, 2024. (Screenshot, Tesla/Handout via REUTERS) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nIn a note to clients following the event, Jefferies analysts called the $30,000 driverless robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, a \"toothless taxi,\" adding that Tesla has \"ambitious targets\" with \"little evidence of feasibility.\"\n\nThe new Cybercab, designed to be fully autonomous, has no steering wheel or pedals. Production is slated to begin \"before 2027,” according to CEO Elon Musk, and will likely be a big talking point on the earnings call.\n\n\"Investors may seek details on the rollout of Tesla's sub-$30,000 vehicle,\" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man wrote on Friday. \"For high-volume sales, the automaker might need to include traditional features like a steering wheel and pedals in its Cybercabs.\"\n\nTesla shares, which have seen volatile swings over the past few months, are down about 10% since the start of the year.\n\nConsumer, labor checks\n\nRetail sales for the month of September came in marginally above consensus expectations earlier last week, signaling that the US economy remains strong. But investors will have more data points to chew on, with the final reading of the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index due Friday.\n\nFor the final reading of October, sentiment is expected to tick up to 69.5 after the index's preliminary reading unexpectedly fell for the first time in three months to 68.9 in September.\n\nAccording to the University of Michigan, consumers have continued to express frustration over high prices despite moderating inflation data. This had offset more optimistic views of the jobs market, which remains a critical focus point for the Federal Reserve after it slashed interest rates by 50 basis points at its last meeting.\n\nMarkets are currently pricing in another 25 basis point cut in November, but Fed officials seem split on the path forward.\n\nEarlier this week, San Francisco Federal Reserve president Mary Daly said one or two more rate cuts this year would still be a \"reasonable thing to do\" if inflation pressures continue to cool and the job market remains on solid footing.\n\n\"The work to achieve a soft landing is not fully done,\" Daly said in her speech on Tuesday. \"We are resolute to finish that job.\"\n\nBut just one day prior, Federal Reserve governor Chris Waller said the central bank needs to be more cautious when it comes to rates, saying in a speech at Stanford University, \"Data is signaling that the economy may not be slowing as much as desired.\"\n\nAnother round of jobless claims, due Thursday, will be closely scrutinized after the number of people filing for unemployment benefits fell back to earth in the week ending Oct. 12.\n\nUS jobless claims fell by 19,000 to 241,000, but economists have warned the labor market could be skewed in the near term following the aftermath of both Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton in the Southeast regions, along with the labor strike at Boeing.\n\n\"Hurricanes Helene and Milton and the Boeing strike are starting to distort the economic data, but given the timing of those storms — with Helene making landfall September 26 and Milton on October 10 — the most significant impact on the data is still ahead of us,\" Oxford Economics wrote in a note on Friday.\n\nWeekly calendar\n\nMonday:\n\nEconomic data: Leading Economic Index, September (-0.3% expected, -0.2% prior)\n\nEarnings: SAP SE (SAP), Nucor Corporation (NUE), HBT Financial (HBT), Zions Bancorporation (ZION), Nucor Corporation\n\nTuesday:\n\nEconomic data: Philadelphia Fed Non-Manufacturing Index, October (-6.1 prior); Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, October (-21 prior); Richmond Fed Business Conditions (-3 prior)\n\nEarnings: General Motors (GM), 3M Company (MMM), RTX Corporation (RTX), Verizon Communications (VZ), GE Aerospace (GE), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Quest Diagnostics (DGX), Philip Morris (PM), Denny's Corporation (DENN), Sherwin-Williams (SHW), Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG), Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC), RTX Corporation (RTX), Texas Instruments (TXN), PulteGroup (PHM), Enphase Energy (ENPH)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Oct. 18 (-17.0% prior); Existing Home Sales, Sept.

        "title": "2 Stocks That Could Join Nvidia in the $3 Trillion Club",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best stocks to profit off the artificial intelligence (AI) boom over the last two years. Shares of the AI chip leader have surged more than 820% since 2022 and currently have of a market cap of nearly $3.3 trillion -- trailing only Apple's $3.5 trillion.\n\nThe following \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are not far behind and could deliver exceptional returns in the next few years to join Nvidia and Apple in the $3 trillion club.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) shares have delivered life-changing returns to investors over the last few decades and continue to generate market-beating gains. The stock has doubled over the last five years, bringing its total market cap to $2 trillion. Based on the company's opportunities, the shares could climb another 50% in the next few years to reach $3 trillion in total market value.\n\nWhen you deliver billions of orders each year, every last mile of cost adds up. Amazon was able to reduce the cost to serve retail customers in 2023 for the first time since 2018. It continues to find ways to strip costs out of the retail business. The company's operating profit has doubled over the last year, as it shortens and optimizes delivery routes.\n\nReducing costs can benefit Amazon more than simply boosting its short-term profitability. It also can allow Amazon to gain market share in online shopping by lowering prices on select goods. Shortening transportation distances also means customers receive their orders faster, and that can lead to more frequent shopping.\n\nAmazon says it has plenty of opportunities to reduce costs by using automation and robotics and continuing to build its same-day delivery network. The company already controlled 37% of the U.S. e-commerce market in 2023 -- 6 times the share of No. 2 Walmart, according to Statista. Amazon's efforts to improve efficiencies and speed up order delivery show a relentless competitor continuing to look for ways to protect and stretch its lead. This is the kind of business you want protecting and growing your savings for retirement.\n\nAnalysts expect earnings to reach $7.30 per share by 2026, an increase of 52% over 2024 estimates. Amazon investors can expect the stock to climb along with that increase and reach a $3 trillion market cap within two years.\n\n2. Alphabet (formerly Google)\n\nShares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) also doubled in the last five years. The company's market cap is currently hovering around $2 trillion, putting it within striking distance of Nvidia's market value.\n\nWhile Amazon Web Services is the leading cloud service provider for enterprises, many businesses prefer Google Cloud. Google has been steadily gaining share of the cloud market in recent years. New AI services offered in Google Cloud are fueling its momentum.\n\nThe company credited strong demand for AI infrastructure and generative AI services for driving recent growth in the cloud. Google Cloud's revenue grew to more than $10 billion in the second quarter, but equally important, the segment's operating profit nearly tripled to surpass $1.1 billion last quarter. This shows Alphabet is earning a high return on investment on AI tools offered to Google Cloud customers like Vertex and the Gemini AI model.\n\nIt's also impressive that Alphabet can make the necessary investments to drive strong demand for cloud services and AI while producing solid earnings growth. Earnings grew 31% year over year in Q2, and analysts expect Alphabet's earnings to grow 16% over the long term.\n\nBy 2026, the consensus estimate has Alphabet's earnings reaching $10. If Alphabet earns a market average price-to-earnings ratio of around 27, the shares could be worth $270, implying upside of 62%. It could easily hit a $3 trillion market cap in two years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Among the Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks owned by hedge funds.\n\nWall Street stocks surged this month after the Federal Reserve released minutes of its September meeting, which resulted in the first interest rate cuts in over four years. The details disclosed a ‘substantial majority’ of central bankers backing the 0.5 percentage-point cut, raising optimism among investors for further cuts ahead.\n\nThe broader market hit record highs on October 11, driven by several financial stocks reporting stronger-than-expected results during the recently concluded quarter. Another factor encouraging investors has been the downturn in US inflation, which fell to 2.4% in September and is inching toward the Federal Reserve’s goal of a two percent annual rate. This has raised hopes of a quarter-point cut in the central bank’s next meeting in November.\n\nHowever, some analysts warn against diving into stocks after interest rate cuts, citing uncertainty around the upcoming presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider in early September discussed historic patterns in US markets towards the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth.\n\nShe noted how the market performs well between June and August due to thinner volumes when traders are on vacation, while volatility picks up with an uptick in activity after they return to their desks in September. However, during the election year, this volatility peaks around mid-October, instead of September, according to Young Thomas.\n\nFundstrat Global Advisors’ co-founder, Tom Lee, has also cautioned investors against election-related uncertainty. Here is what he stated in an interview with CNBC late last month:\n\nThis Fed cut cycle I think is setting the stage for markets to be really strong over the next one month or next three months. But, what the stocks do between now and let’s say election day, I think is still a lot of uncertainty. And that’s the reason why I’m a little hesitant for investors to dive in.\n\nEarlier that month in the weeks leading to the interest rate cuts, Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, forecasted a 7-10% dip between September and October amid nervousness around the presidential elections. However, Lee urged investors to ‘buy the dip’, indicating that he sees the likely fall as an opportunity to buy stocks while they trade for a lower value.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdam Turnquist from LPL Financial also anticipates seasonal volatility in the weeks ahead but reiterated what Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes. Turnquist advises investors not to readjust their existing portfolios because seasonal volatility has short-term effects and is difficult to forecast.\n\nWith that said, let’s now shift focus to hedge fund sentiment on the stock market and discuss some of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Seattle, Washington. It engages in e-commerce, online advertising, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and digital streaming. According to Insider Monkey, Amazon is the most owned stock by hedge funds right now. As of Q2 2024, 308 hedge funds held stakes in the company.\n\nDuring Q2, the company posted a robust revenue of $148 billion, up 11% from last year. Operating income for the quarter also soared 91% to reach $14.7 billion. AWS revenue grew 18% to a total of $26.3 billion. The segment now has an annualized revenue run rate of over $105 billion. The advertisements segment continued its impressive run, with revenue crossing the $2 billion mark during the quarter. Amazon has now earned over $50 billion from advertising revenue over the last 12 months.\n\nThe company has been spending heavily on capital expenditure and has incurred $30.5 billion during the first half of the year. The figure is expected to be slightly higher during the back half of 2024, fueled by the need for AWS infrastructure as demand surges for both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads. The company’s leadership is optimistic about the long-term impact AI investments will have on its business.\n\nWall Street analysts also remain bullish on Amazon. There is a consensus among them on the stock’s Buy rating with a share price upside potential of 18%. There is good reason for their optimism, given the strong demand anticipated for AWS. The segment's backlog was up 19% from last year to $156.6 billion at the end of Q2. It is also seeing improved profitability, having jumped from the mid-20% range in 2023 to over 30% this year as Amazon eliminates inefficiencies and clamps down on costs.\n\nHaving said that, there have been some investor concerns stemming from the fluctuating operating margins of AWS. However, that is likely due to the investments that the company has been making to improve efficiency and build new products.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "The third-quarter earnings season is here, and on October 31, 2024, Amazon (AMZN) is set to report its financial results. As a long-term bull on AMZN, I believe Q3 could be another strong quarter, with more realistic market expectations compared to Q2. The focus will likely be on Amazon’s shift toward higher-margin services and its crown jewel, Amazon Web Services (AWS). I expect the success of the quarter will depend significantly on the company’s ability to sustain sales growth and stabilize its high margins.\n\nIn this article, I will focus on the expectations for the September quarter and explore whether Amazon stock is a good investment ahead of its earnings report. I’ll also review where investors are likely to focus their attention.\n\nA Quick Amazon’s Q2 Recap\n\nBefore diving into why I have a slightly bullish outlook for Q3, let’s first review what happened in Q2. Amazon, along with other Big Tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL), reported solid results but failed to meet the market’s lofty expectations following a consistent period of strong growth fueled by AI. This growth had led to a significant rally in tech stocks during the first half of the year. After reporting earnings, Amazon’s stock dropped 8% to $167 per share but has since rebounded to over $190.\n\nFor Q2, the Seattle-based giant posted mixed results. It beat EPS estimates but fell short of revenue projections, reporting $148 billion in revenue, slightly below the forecasted $148.8 billion. Despite this, it wasn’t a bad quarter for Amazon. Operating income surged to $14.7 billion, nearly doubling the $7.7 billion reported in the same quarter last year. A major contributor was AWS, which accounted for $9.3 billion of that figure. The cloud segment grew by 19% year-over-year, surpassing Wall Street’s 17.5% growth estimate.\n\nHowever, with the market expecting a nearly flawless quarter for Amazon (and AI leading stocks in general), a few weak spots emerged. For instance, advertising revenue came in at $12.8 billion, reflecting 20% annual growth but falling short of the 24% growth reported in the previous quarter. In my view, the biggest downside came from Amazon’s guidance for Q3, where it projected revenues between $154 billion and $158 billion, translating to 9.5% growth at the midpoint. That was shy of the double-digit growth analysts had expected.\n\nAdditionally, concerns about capital expenditures (CapEx) were raised. Amazon’s spending on property and equipment jumped to $17.6 billion, up from $11.5 billion in the same quarter last year—a 54% increase, primarily driven by AI investments. This raised concerns that these investment flows could put pressure on margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Cautiously Optimistic Outlook for Amazon’s Q3 Earnings\n\nI hold an cautiously optimistic view on Amazon’s Q3 earnings, largely because market expectations have become more realistic compared to Q2. Over the last three months, 21 out of 33 analysts have revised their Q3 EPS estimates downward, and 30 out of 38 analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts. As a result, the consensus EPS estimate for Amazon’s Q3 is $1.14, representing 21% annual growth, while analysts are expecting to see $157.24 billion in revenue, approximately 10% higher than last year.\n\nAWS Growth and Margins Are Likely to Be the Key Focal Points\n\nA key focal point for Q3 will likely be AWS, which is Amazon’s high-margin business. AWS accounts for two-thirds of the company’s profitability. AWS sales growth has been accelerating, rising from 12% to 19% over the last four quarters, and the company maintained its leadership in the cloud market with a 32% share. The key question is how long this growth can be sustained.\n\nI expect Q3 to be another quarter of accelerating growth, driven by three macro trends noted by CEO Andy Jassy in the latest earnings call. These three macro trends are: (1) companies have largely completed their cost optimization efforts; (2) businesses are refocusing on modernizing infrastructure and transitioning to the cloud; and (3) companies of all sizes are eager to leverage AI.\n\nOn the flip side, concerns remain about how much AWS margins will continue to decline after being unsustainably high earlier in the year. Although AWS operating margins were around 37.6% in Q1, they dropped to 35.5% in Q2. The market now seems to accept that margins will continue to soften. However, even with this probable continued decline, I believe Amazon’s operating income will remain strong. The company has provided guidance for Q3 operating income in a range between $11.5 billion and $15.0 billion. If the mid-range estimate of $13.25 billion is achieved, it would represent an 18.3% annual increase—a strong result for a company of Amazon’s scale.\n\nWith AWS growth and margins under scrutiny, I believe that a demonstration of continued sales growth in Q3 and operating income guidance that exceeds (or at least meets) guidance could potentially lift Amazon’s stock price. This would support the notion that, even with decelerating AWS margins, Amazon’s management could offset this challenge through cost discipline and operational improvements in other areas, such as advertising and the consumer business.\n\nIs AMZN a Buy, According to Wall Street?\n\nAt TipRanks, the Wall Street consensus for Amazon is a Strong Buy, based on 47 analysts. Of these, 45 have a Buy rating, while two analysts rate Amazon stock as a Hold. The average AMZN price target is $224.38, implying potential upside of about 18%.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmazon looks poised for another strong Q3. Investors look sure to recognize Q2 progress and have been adjusting to Q3 guidance, while the stock price has maintained strong bullish momentum. AWS will be key to the quarter’s performance—if sales growth holds and margin declines exhibit signs of stabilizing, that could ease investor concerns. While AWS margins are clearly softening, Amazon’s advertising and consumer businesses offer the opportunity for cost reduction and efficiency. Given this, I still view Amazon bullishly heading into Q3, though some caution is warranted.\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclaimer\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. Since Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWall Street continues to gain momentum amid the latest earnings season and analysts are wondering whether we are still up for soft landing. Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz chief economic advisor, talked about the possibility of a soft landing vs no landing during a program on CNBC. When asked what would it take for the market to have a no-landing scenario, the analyst said:\n\n“I think we need the productivity enhancers from A.I., from life sciences to come earlier, we need to continue to have positive shocks to our labor force. And if we get those two things, you can get the bigger but not hotter economy which actually would be perfect for almost everything you can think of, from households to companies to financial markets.”\n\nThe analyst does not rule out the possibility of a recession, however.\n\n“My probability of a soft landing is 55%, and a recession is 30%. A soft landing is the most likely scenario, but it’s not dominant. Why isn’t it dominant? Because we have weakness in the household sector, particularly on the lower-income side, and the Fed has been unpredictable. Just think, Morgan—at the end of July, the Fed didn’t cut rates because everything seemed fine. By the next meeting in mid-September, it cut 50 basis points. And now it’s talking about cautious cuts. So, the Fed needs to be careful.”\n\nFor this article we picked 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment.

Analysts Say Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) Among Top Beneficiaries of AI Data Center Spend\n\nphotostock77 / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 61\n\nCiti Research predicts that capital expenditures for data centers among the leading four cloud companies will surge by 40% year over year, offering a boost to data center interconnect (DCI) providers. The major players in this segment include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Citi anticipates that these firms will ramp up their data center investments by 40% to 50% in 2025.\n\nCiti analysts, led by Atif Malik, noted in an investor report that “we estimate that the AI networking opportunity is expanding beyond the server connection within a data center to AI platforms connecting multiple data centers through DCI.”\n\nCiti named Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) as one of the beneficiaries of this spending.\n\nMalik emphasized the challenges of containing AI model clusters within a single data center as their size approaches 300,000 GPUs by 2025, stating that “containing models in one data center unit will not be sustainable in the long term amid constraints related to power, regulations, among others.” Consequently, hyperscalers are increasingly adopting and planning to expand the use of a multi-data center training approach.\n\nCiti highlighted that Google has utilized this multi-data center strategy for training its Gemini 1 Ultra, and that OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic are also embracing this model. As a result of increased DCI spending, Citi projects that Arista’s revenue could grow by up to 25% year over year in 2025, primarily driven by Ethernet switching in AI networks.\n\nCisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) earlier this year announced a major restructuring plan that includes a 7% reduction in workforce and an estimated $1 billion in pre-tax cost savings. Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)’s legacy hardware businesses have been stagnating, with average revenue growth lingering at just 1.6%. Job cuts and cost savings will allow Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) to allocate capital to high-growth areas like AI and Cloud networking.\n\nThe expected cost savings, which will cut about 2.4% of total operating expenses, could boost Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) operating margins by more than 220 basis points in FY25. Although the company is ramping up its AI efforts, it only expects AI to bring in around $1 billion in revenue next year, less than 2% of the total. So, while AI isn’t likely to be a game-changer for Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) just yet, the focus on growth markets might accelerate overall revenue in the future.\n\nParnassus Value Equity Fund stated the following regarding Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“During the second quarter, the Fund’s overweight position in the Information Technology sector decreased slightly as we sold our position in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) and used most of the proceeds to buy Broadcom, a leading semiconductor company and provider of custom silicon products. Both stocks provide similar exposure to networking technology, but we believe Broadcom offers more upside from AI infrastructure spend and defensiveness due to its software assets.”\n\nOverall, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. While we acknowledge the potential of Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Nvidia to win the race to $4 trillion market cap, experts say",
        "content": "Buy the dip.\n\nThat was the mindset around chip stocks this week as investors scooped up beaten-down shares, sending Nvidia to a record high. A strong outlook for Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) was enough to revive Wall Street’s enthusiasm for AI as growing confidence in the AI boom overshadowed chip supplier ASML’s sluggish forecast and reports of export caps of advanced AI chips to some Middle Eastern countries.\n\nNvidia closed the week above $138 per share, bringing its market value to $3.39 trillion. It’s now the world's second-largest company behind Apple. But that might not be for long. Experts I spoke with this past week say there’s growing confidence the chip giant will be the first Big Tech firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation.\n\n“There's no question about it,” Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, told me on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts. “The demand for GPU chips is strong, and you're seeing early adopters starting to get some ROI.”\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang fueled the stock’s rally earlier this month after describing demand for the new Blackwell chips as “insane.”\n\nEven amid the stock’s dramatic outperformance, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Tony Wang told me investors still “continuously underestimate” Nvidia’s growth potential. He sees “exceptional” demand for AI making it “definitely possible” that the chip giant crosses that $4 trillion threshold first.\n\nIn the coming weeks, earnings from fellow Magnificent Seven companies will give investors better insight into Nvidia’s market dominance. Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), which account for more than 40% of the chipmaker’s revenue, have all pledged to continue investing in AI.\n\nLast quarter, spending by Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft totaled more than $40 billion, while Amazon said spending in the second half of the year will likely surpass the $30 billion spent during the first half.\n\nBofA analyst Vivek Arya, who views Nvidia as a “generational opportunity,” cites capital expenditure commentary from top hyperscalers among the reasons that he sees Nvidia \"strengthening its position.\"\n\nArya lifted his price target on the chipmaker to $190 this week, implying a rally of nearly 40% from Friday’s closing price.\n\nArya and his team also cited Taiwan Semiconductor’s robust demand outlook as a positive. TSMC — a top supplier for Nvidia and other giants, including Apple — triggered a sector-wide rally after posting a more than 50% jump in net income for the third quarter and forecasting full-year revenue growth of nearly 30%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSafe to say, Big Tech's third quarter numbers will be a crucial test for Nvidia and key to the stock's momentum in the short term. Any disappointment in AI spending plans could lead to volatility for Nvidia and the broader chips market.\n\nBut if that happens, the sell-off may not last long. Niles Investment Management founder Dan Niles recently told me on Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid podcast he remains bullish on Nvidia’s long-term prospects.\n\n“You've got several more years of AI investment before you hit saturation or a more maturing AI landscape,” Niles said. “You'll see Nvidia's revenues double over the next several years, and I think you'll see the stock double over the next several years.”\n\nNvidia shares have rallied 21% so far this month, bringing its gains to 179% year to date.

        "title": "Got $3,000? 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term.",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the hottest topic on Wall Street and is expanding quickly to Main Street as businesses adopt these solutions at lightning speeds. Open AI's ChatGPT caused a search and query revolution, while Nvidia's unprecedented growth helped power the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 to new highs.\n\nAI is a vast field, and investors have oodles of options, from companies that provide tech research, like Gartner, to those providing integrated software, like Microsoft's Copilot, to data center memory suppliers like Micron Technology. But most of us don't have unlimited funds to invest in everything.\n\nIf you have a few thousand dollars in a retirement account or rattling around in the bank, I have a couple of ideas. I thought I would focus on two extraordinarily different companies that could provide long-term profits.\n\nSoundHound AI\n\nRising costs and a lack of available workers have made drive-thru and fast-casual restaurants explore alternatives. Meanwhile, automakers are looking for next-gen conversational intelligence. Voice recognition conversational intelligence solves both problems, and SoundHound's software offers this to many familiar brands, such as White Castle, Jersey Mikes, Stellantis, and Honda.\n\nI've been critical of SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) in the past. At the end of 2022, the company's cash balance bottomed out at just $10 million against $35 million in debt. $10 million makes growth extremely difficult for an unprofitable company with negative cash flow -- it's not a recipe for success.\n\nHowever, management drastically improved its position to $200 million in cash and no debt last quarter, as shown below, although the company increased its share count substantially to do it. SOUN Cash and Equivalents (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe increase in share count is a tough pill for the existing shareholders, but the dilution should drastically slow now that the company is on solid footing.\n\nSoundHound trades for 26 times sales, which seems high for an unprofitable, cash-flow-negative company. However, the valuation drops drastically when accounting for the rapid growth. SoundHound hit $13.5 million in sales in Q2 on 54% year-over-year growth. It expects revenue to leap from $80 million in 2024 to $150 million next year. This brings the price-to-sales ratio to a more palatable 12.5.\n\nSoundHound isn't a stock for everyone; smaller companies are typically riskier, albeit with massive upside potential. Areas like voice-enabled smart TVs, home devices, carryout ordering, and retail are virtually untapped. Still, it's best not to put all your eggs in one basket, so here's a more mainstream idea.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is about 1,000 times larger than SoundHound by market capitalization. It's also a critical cog in the AI machine. We use more data than ever, and the need for it keeps growing. Cloud service providers, like Amazon Web Services (AWS), are critical to power data-guzzling AI applications. As shown below, AWS is the largest provider, with nearly a third of the market. Leading cloud providers.\n\nAWS accounts for a growing portion of Amazon's total revenue -- 18% in Q2 2024 compared to 16% in Q2 2023. This is terrific for Amazon as AWS is highly profitable, posting a 36% operating margin last quarter compared to 10% for the company as a whole. If you still think of Amazon as a product company, think again; 58% of total sales last quarter were from services like AWS, digital advertising, Prime, and third-party seller services.\n\nThis should excite investors since services tend to be more profitable than products. The continued migration to services and the resurgence of AWS on the back of AI pushed operating profits to $30 billion for the first six months of 2024 compared to just $12 billion for the same period of 2023.\n\nAmazon has other irons in the AI fire, like Amazon Bedrock, which provides foundational models that customers can customize to suit their needs, and forays into designing AI chips. The company has the resources to be a major player in the industry.\n\nNow, let's look at the stock, which trades below its recent averages based on earnings, cash flow, and sales, as depicted below. AMZN PE Ratio Chart\n\nInvestors should always consider their risk tolerance (what's yours? Try this quiz to find out) when choosing how to divide their money between investments. In this case, SoundHound is riskier than Amazon but has a more explosive potential upside because of its smaller size.\n\nA typical long-term investor with medium risk tolerance should consider weighting their dollars heavily toward Amazon with a smaller speculative position in SoundHound. In contrast, an aggressive investor could do the opposite.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

Moreover, Disney achieved profitability across its combined streaming business a quarter ahead of its previous guidnace But even the world’s biggest entertainment company needed a page from Netflix’s book when it comes to streaming, as Disney followed Netflix's footsteps in deciding to crack down on password sharing and pursue new opportunities with ad-supporting plans. A year after its prior hikes, Disney is again raising prices for Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN.\n\nNetflix’s Third Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on September 30th, the streaming giant reported revenue grew 15% to $9.83 billion.\n\nThe ad-supported membership tier reported 35% growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis.

        "title": "Netflix Earnings Review: Still Winning the Streaming Wars?",
        "content": "Netflix (NFLX) stock is making new record highs today on the back of a strong quarterly earnings report. Earnings per share of $5.40 beat estimates of $5.12 and revenue of $9.83 billion beat estimates of $9.77 billion. Most notably, Netflix added 5.07 million subscribers last quarter, well above the forecast of 4 million.\n\nWhen it comes to streaming services, Netflix and Amazon’s (AMZN) Prime Video are neck and neck for the top spot, each commanding a 22% share of the market. However, the business models have very different dynamics. Amazon’s Prime Video is part of a broader business ecosystem, while Netflix is a standalone business. Nonetheless, Netflix has evolved into an extremely profitable business today, and as we will see it has strong earnings growth forecasts and a reasonable valuation.\n\nNetflix stock is up nearly 10% on the day and has put up a commendable performance year-to-date, more than doubling that of the broad market. The company also boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNetflix Projects Strong Growth Expanding Content Offerings\n\nIn Q3 2024, Netflix saw revenue grow 15% year-over-year, with its operating margin expanding to 30%, up from 22% a year ago. The company expects to maintain strong momentum, forecasting 15% revenue growth and a 27% operating margin for the full year. Netflix delivered popular new content noted by robust engagement levels, with viewing hours per member rising.\n\nThe advertising segment showed significant growth, with a 35% quarter-on-quarter increase in ad memberships and plans to expand its ad tech platform in Canada and beyond. Looking ahead, Netflix aims to sustain its growth trajectory by expanding its content offerings beyond traditional series and films to include live events, such as NFL games during the holiday season and high-profile boxing matches like the Jake Paul/Mike Tyson fight.\n\nOver the next three to five years, analysts forecast earnings to grow 26.4% annually.\n\nStreaming Wars: NFLX, AMZN or DIS?\n\nThe streaming wars continue to intensify, with major players like Netflix, Disney (DIS), and Amazon Prime Video fiercely competing for subscribers' attention. Netflix, as the longest-standing leader in the space, has faced increasing challenges from newer entrants that are leveraging their vast content libraries and brand power. Disney+, for instance, has rapidly grown its subscriber base since launching in late 2019, riding on the strength of its beloved franchises like Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar. The service’s ability to bundle Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN has made it a compelling choice many.\n\nAmazon Prime Video, while primarily a part of the broader Amazon Prime membership, has also made a strong push in original content and live events. Its investment in epic shows like The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, along with exclusive sports content like Thursday Night Football, positions it as a serious contender. For Netflix, the competition has meant evolving its strategy to include not just traditional series and films, but also live events, such as the upcoming NFL games and boxing matches, in an effort to diversify its content and attract a broader audience.\n\nHowever, Netflix continues to maintain its leadership position in the streaming industry, boasting around 280 million global subscribers, ahead of Amazon Prime Video's 200 million and Disney’s 150 million. Moreover, Netflix's profitability stands out compared to its competitors, as it is currently generating substantial operating profits.\n\nNetflix Valuation\n\nNetflix is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 36x, which is below its 10-year median of 37.8x. It is hard to imagine but in 2022, the stock was trading as low as 15.3x. Nonetheless, the current valuation while higher than the broad market average is not absurd for a market leader growing at the pace Netflix is today. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShould Investors Buy Netflix Shares?\n\nNetflix's latest earnings report reaffirms its position as a leader in the streaming industry, demonstrating impressive growth and profitability amidst a competitive landscape. The company’s addition of 5.07 million subscribers last quarter, well above expectations, indicates strong demand for its content.\n\nAs the streaming wars rage on, Netflix's strategic shift towards live content signals a broader ambition to capture new audiences. While Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video continue to be formidable competitors, each with unique strengths, Netflix's distinct advantage lies in its brand, profitability and subscriber leadership.\n\nWhile the valuation today is above the market average and by no measure is cheap it is supported by an innovative management team with a considerable growth runway ahead. And with the bull market in stocks charging forward, investors looking for a discount may have to be very patient for the next bear market. Thus, for those looking to add exposure to technology and streaming stocks, it may not be a bad time to buy Netflix stock.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Time to Buy Amazon ETFs Following Cathie Wood's Investment?",
        "content": "Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Investment Management, is well-known for her focus on small- and mid-cap technology stocks. She rose to fame after Ark Innovation ETF ARKK delivered a remarkable 73% return in 2020.\n\nHowever, the long-term success of Cathie Wood’s strategy has not been remarkable. ARKK, her flagship exchange-traded fund (ETF) with $5.5 billion in assets, has posted a 25.7% return over the past year, and a modest 12.2% over five years. By comparison, the S&P 500 has returned 35% over one year, and 95.4% over five years.\n\nWood’s investment philosophy thrives on emerging high-tech companies in fields such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics. However, she occasionally taps mega-cap stocks to provide stability for her funds, which primarily consist of higher-risk assets. Sometimes, Wood even buys these stocks during price increases.\n\nCathie Wood’s Recent Moves: Amazon & Meta Stocks\n\nDespite the challenges, Wood has lately made notable moves in the market. On Oct. 8, 2024, Ark Innovation ETF purchased 76,505 shares of Amazon, valued at $14 million. Amazon’s stock has risen 18% since Aug. 5, although it did record a 9.8% decline from Sept. 24 to Oct. 8.\n\nMorningstar analyst Dan Romanoff is also optimistic about Amazon, assigning the company a wide moat tag due to its dominant position in e-commerce and cloud services, and setting a fair value of $195, as quoted on street.com.\n\nPlus, Ark Next Generation Internet ETF acquired 2,365 shares of Meta Platforms, worth $1.4 million at the Oct. 8, 2024 close. Meta’s stock has surged 16% over the past month. Morningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan views Meta as slightly overvalued but believes it holds a wide moat, largely due to its unchallenged social media presence across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, as quoted on street.com.\n\nShould You Play Amazon Stock & ETFs?\n\nAmazon.com has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has the best VGM Score of “A.” The stock comes from the top-ranked Internet – Commerce industry (top 18%). Amazon is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio.\n\nAmazon is often considered as a wide-moat stock. Amazon is the clear leader in e-commerce, with a cost advantage and network effects that attract more buyers and sellers. The company has been disrupting the retail industry for more than two decades, per Morningstar. Thus, picking Amazon stock ahead of the start of the holiday season could be a good idea.\n\nMeanwhile, the growing adoption of Amazon Web Services (AWS) is aiding Amazon’s cloud dominance. In Q2 of 2024, Amazon and Google upped their cloud market share. “Google is bigger than the next four largest players, while Microsoft is twice the size of Google and Amazon is 35 percent bigger than Microsoft,” said John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research Group in an email to CRN.\n\nStory continues\n\nA deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Amazon is developing its own processors to limit its reliance on costly NVIDIA chips. Amazon’s Annapurna Labs, which it acquired in 2015, is spearheading the effort in this area. According to Sinno, the director of engineering at Annapurna Labs, there is a growing demand among Amazon’s customers for cheaper alternatives to NVIDIA’s chips, as quoted on Firstpost in July 2024.\n\nAmazon Stock’s Valuation & Potential\n\nAmazon’s stock trades at a price/earnings (trailing 12 months) ratio of 44.29X versus the underlying industry’s P/E of 57.54X. However, Amazon’s Price/Book (Most Recent Quarter) ratio is pricey. Amazon’s P/B ratio is 8.30X versus the industry average of 2.02X. Amazon’s price/cash flow (most recent fiscal year) ratio is 24.74X versus the industry average of 14.28X.\n\nAmazon’s this year’s growth rate is 63.45% versus the industry’s growth rate of 13.20% and the S&P 500’s 15.67%. Amazon’s next year’s growth rate is 23.21% versus the industry’s growth rate of 23.10% and the S&P 500’s 11.34%.\n\nAMZN Stock Price Target\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 46 analysts, the average price target for Amazon comes to $225.98. The forecasts range from a low of $183.00 to a high of $265.00. The average price target represents an increase of 20.92% from the closing price of $186.89 recorded on Oct. 16, 2024. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon-Heavy ETFs in Focus\n\nGiven the ongoing uncertainties related to competition in the cloud and AI business, it may be better to track the company through an ETF approach. The basket approach minimizes the company-specific concentration risks. Amazon-heavy ETFs include the likes of Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY (weight 22.52%), ProShares Online Retail ETF ONLN (weight 22.33%) and Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF FDIS (weight 22.25%).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Utilities outperform the broader markets amid enthusiasm over AI electricity demand",
        "content": "Utilities have been on fire this year as enthusiasm over booming AI electricity demand pushes the sector higher.\n\nCase in point: The S&P 500 Utilities ETF (XLU) is up a whopping 29% so far this year — the best-performing sector to date.\n\nMuch of the gains stem from power producers that stand to benefit from the electrification boom — Big Tech's massive appetite for AI data centers and electric vehicles.\n\nBy 2050, electricity is projected to become the largest source of energy worldwide, according to a recent McKinsey study.  Utilities have been the best performers this year.\n\nAlso, five of the top 10 returning companies in the S&P 500 this year have been energy companies, noted Matt Sallee, president of Tortoise Capital. “Utilities and midstream infrastructure are going to be secondary beneficiaries of the AI theme,” he said in a recent note to clients.\n\nThere’s no better example of that investor fever than the S&P 500's top performer this year, power producer Vistra Corp (VST).\n\nShares of the Irving, Texas-based electric and power generation company are up 243% year to date, outperforming even AI heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA), up 186% during the same period.\n\nOn Thursday, JPMorgan analysts initiated coverage of Vistra along with two other Wall Street favorites, Talen Energy (TLN) and Constellation Energy (CEG) — all with an Overweight rating,\n\nThe analysts said the independent power producers (IPPs) stand to benefit from \"a paradigm shift in power demand\" amid structural tailwinds like manufacturing on-shoring, electrification trends, and data-center development.\n\n\"We do not see competitive market supply growth matching this demand, enabling IPPs to capture outsized margins for an extended period of time,\" wrote JPMorgan's Jeremy Tonet and his team.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance’s Julie Hyman pointed out, recent headlines like Microsoft (MSFT) teaming up with Constellation Energy to restart a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island and Amazon (AMZN) buying up a data center campus from Talen Energy have put Big Tech and its insatiable need for electricity into the spotlight.\n\nBut XLU's massive performance this year begs the question — has it topped?\n\nWith the broader markets at all-time highs, it may be a good idea to keep investing in defensive stocks like utilities that provide dividends, said Burns McKinney, managing director and senior portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group.\n\n“There does seem to be a little bit more meat on the bone,” said McKinney, referring to more growth in the sector.\n\nIf XLU holds its 29.1% year-to-date gains, it will be the best-ever yearly performance for the sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Overview of Recent Transaction by State Street Corp\n\nOn September 30, 2024, State Street Corp made a notable adjustment to its investment portfolio by reducing its stake in Piedmont Lithium Inc (NASDAQ:PLL). The transaction involved the sale of 6,169 shares, resulting in a remaining total of 363,808 shares held. Despite this reduction, the trade had a minimal impact on the firm's overall portfolio, maintaining a position ratio of 1.90% in Piedmont Lithium.\n\nInsight into State Street Corp\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with PLL.\n\nState Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a prominent financial services provider known for its robust investment strategies. The firm manages a diverse portfolio with a significant emphasis on technology and financial services sectors, holding major stakes in companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). With an equity portfolio valued at approximately $2,285.63 trillion, State Street Corp is a key player in the investment community. State Street Corp's Strategic Adjustment in Piedmont Lithium Holdings\n\nPiedmont Lithium Inc at a Glance\n\nPiedmont Lithium Inc, based in the USA, is a development-stage entity focused on establishing a multi-asset lithium business to support clean energy initiatives. Despite its recent market challenges, the company holds a market capitalization of $218.964 million and is actively involved in projects across North Carolina and Tennessee. However, the company's financial performance has been underwhelming with a GF Score of 34/100, indicating potential risks in future performance. State Street Corp's Strategic Adjustment in Piedmont Lithium Holdings\n\nFinancial Health and Market Performance\n\nPiedmont Lithium's financial health is precarious with a Financial Strength rank of 8/10, yet its profitability and growth metrics are concerning. The company's Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA) stand at -12.20% and -10.98% respectively. Additionally, the stock has experienced a significant year-to-date price decline of 59.58%, although it has seen a 26.2% increase since the recent transaction.\n\nImpact of the Trade on State Street Corps Portfolio\n\nThe reduction in Piedmont Lithium shares by State Street Corp reflects a strategic realignment within its vast portfolio. Although the transaction was minor, it underscores the firm's ongoing portfolio optimization efforts, particularly in a volatile Metals & Mining sector. This move could be indicative of State Street's risk management strategy, considering Piedmont's mixed financial signals and market performance.\n\nMarket Reaction and Sector Outlook\n\nThe market's reaction to State Street Corp's recent transaction has been relatively muted, given the small scale of the trade. However, the Metals & Mining industry, where Piedmont Lithium operates, continues to face significant challenges and volatility. Investors and market watchers will be keenly observing how companies like Piedmont navigate these turbulent times, especially with the growing importance of lithium in the global push towards renewable energy.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nState Street Corp's recent portfolio adjustment with Piedmont Lithium Inc highlights the complexities of investing in the burgeoning but volatile lithium market. As the industry evolves and responds to global energy demands, strategic investment decisions such as these will be critical for long-term success and stability in the sector.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "Overview of the Recent Transaction\n\nOn September 30, 2024, State Street Corp executed a significant transaction involving the sale of 424,517 shares of Nordstrom Inc (NYSE:JWN), a renowned fashion retailer. This move reduced their holding by 6.24%, resulting in a new total of 6,378,848 shares. Despite the reduction, State Street Corp maintains a substantial stake in the company, with the shares valued at $22.49 each during the transaction. This adjustment reflects a strategic shift in the firm's investment portfolio, where Nordstrom now represents a 0.01% position, indicating a minor role in the overall investment strategy.\n\nProfile of State Street Corp\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NUS.\n\nLocated at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, State Street Corp is a prominent investment firm known for its broad portfolio of 4,172 stocks, predominantly in the technology and financial services sectors. With top holdings in major corporations like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), the firm manages an equity portfolio valued at approximately $2,285.63 trillion. Their investment philosophy focuses on leveraging market trends and technological advancements to maximize returns. State Street Corp's Strategic Reduction in Nordstrom Inc Holdings\n\nIntroduction to Nordstrom Inc\n\nNordstrom Inc, symbol JWN, operates a chain of about 93 department stores along with over 260 off-price Nordstrom Rack stores. Founded in 1901 in Seattle, the company has expanded its offerings to include a significant online presence and several smaller retail locations. Nordstrom is known for its diverse range of products, including women's apparel, shoes, men's apparel, and beauty products. With a market capitalization of $4.06 billion, Nordstrom continues to be a key player in the retail-cyclical industry. State Street Corp's Strategic Reduction in Nordstrom Inc Holdings\n\nFinancial and Market Analysis of Nordstrom\n\nCurrently, Nordstrom's stock is priced at $24.7075, which is considered modestly overvalued based on the GF Value of $20.00. The stock has shown a significant year-to-date increase of 35.09% and an impressive gain of 9.86% since the transaction date. Despite these gains, Nordstrom's financial health shows mixed signals with a Financial Strength rank of 5/10 and a Profitability Rank of 6/10.

This strategic divestment could be indicative of the firm's portfolio rebalancing or a shift in investment focus away from retail-cyclical stocks, which may not align with their current investment objectives or market outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nComparative Analysis with Industry Peers\n\nNordstrom operates within the competitive retail-cyclical sector. Compared to its peers, Nordstrom has maintained a robust return on equity (ROE) of 35.19%, significantly higher than many competitors. However, its growth and profitability metrics lag behind industry leaders, necessitating strategic initiatives to enhance these areas.\n\nConclusion\n\nState Street Corp's recent reduction in its stake in Nordstrom Inc reflects a strategic adjustment within its extensive portfolio. While Nordstrom continues to perform well in terms of stock price appreciation and ROE, its growth challenges highlight the need for operational enhancements. Investors and market watchers will likely keep a close eye on Nordstrom's strategies to improve its market position and financial health in the competitive retail sector.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

State Street Corp's Strategic Acquisition of John Wiley & Sons Inc Shares\n\nIntroduction to John Wiley & Sons Inc\n\nJohn Wiley & Sons Inc, trading under the symbol WLY, is a leading provider of academic publishing and online education management solutions. Since its IPO on March 26, 1990, the company has grown to achieve a market capitalization of $2.75 billion. WLY operates through segments such as Research, Learning, and Held for Sale or Sold, with the Research segment being the most significant revenue contributor. The company's headquarters are in the United States, with substantial operations across the United Kingdom, China, Japan, and Canada. State Street Corp's Strategic Acquisition of John Wiley & Sons Inc Shares\n\nAnalysis of the Trade's Impact\n\nThe recent acquisition by State Street Corp has increased its total shareholding in WLY to 1,688,156 shares, representing a 3.70% position in its portfolio. This move not only diversifies State Street Corp's investments but also strengthens its influence in the media-diversified sector. Despite the trade's zero impact on the portfolio's overall percentage, the strategic nature of this acquisition could hint at State Street Corp's positive outlook on WLY's future performance.\n\nMarket Context and Stock Performance\n\nAt the time of the transaction, WLY was trading at $50.66, which is significantly overvalued according to the GF Value of $38.21. The stock has shown a remarkable year-to-date increase of 62.11% and an impressive growth of 7815.63% since its IPO.

However, its strong momentum rank of 9/10 suggests short-term investment attractiveness.\n\nSector and Industry Analysis\n\nThe media-diversified industry is highly competitive, with companies constantly innovating to capture larger market shares. WLY's strategic focus on academic and educational publishing sets it apart, providing a niche advantage. However, comparing its performance with industry standards shows that while WLY holds a strong position in certain aspects, there are areas of improvement, particularly in growth and profitability.\n\nFuture Outlook and Implications\n\nThe increased stake by State Street Corp in WLY could be seen as a vote of confidence in the company's strategic direction and market potential. Looking forward, WLY's ability to innovate and adapt to the changing educational and publishing landscape will be crucial.

        "title": "Amazon has made a big change to how it ships packages",
        "content": "This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.\n\nAfter years ofpressure from environmental advocates, the global retail giant Amazon (AMZN) announced last week that it has eliminated plastic air pillows from its global network of “fulfillment centers,” as Amazon calls its warehouse and distribution facilities. Around the world, products inside the company’s packages are now cushioned by paper-based padding that can be collected in curbside recycling programs.\n\n“We are committed to improving how orders are shipped, for the good of customers and the planet,” Amazon wrote in a blog post.\n\nThe announcement represents the fulfillment of a promise Amazon made in June to work “toward full removal” of plastic air pillows from North America by the end of the year. At that time, the company said it had already replaced 95 percent of its air pillows across the continent with paper filler. Years before that, in 2021, Amazon eliminated plastic air pillows in Australia, and in 2022 it did the same for orders shipped from its warehouses in Europe.\n\nOceana, a nonprofit ocean advocacy group, has dogged Amazon for several years over its use of plastics, largely through a seriesofreportsquantifying the company’s overall plastic footprint and its contribution to aquatic plastic pollution. Matt Littlejohn, Oceana’s senior vice president for strategic initiatives, said Amazon’s announcement is “actually quite significant,” even though the phaseout doesn’t apply to orders shipped by third-party sellers. Amazon hasn’t disclosed what fraction of its sales are fulfilled in that way. “It’s great news for the oceans and for the globe in general that the world’s biggest e-commerce company did this,” Littlejohn said.\n\nStill, Amazon continues to use tens of thousands of tons of plastic every year in other forms of packaging — much of it thin, filmy plastic used in delivery bags and padded mailers. Plastic film is not only virtually impossible to recycle, but also the most common form of plastic litter in coastal waters and the most lethal type of plastic to large marine animals. Oceana and other environmental groups say the company should strengthen its plastic-reduction promises by setting deadlines to move away from all types of single-use plastic packaging, and scaling up reusable alternatives.\n\n“We want the company to make a commitment to do more,” Littlejohn told Grist. He said Amazon’s actions could influence other large retailers to also reduce their plastics use.\n\nAmazon is one of the largest companies in the world, with an estimated value near $2 trillion and annual revenue above $600 billion. It operates in 21 countries and ships to many more. In the U.S., Amazon controls nearly 40 percent of the e-commerce market.\n\nSo far, Amazon’s greatest progress on plastic reduction has happened in international jurisdictions, potentially due to stronger regulations on single-use plastics. The company’s warehouses in India have been plastic packaging-free since 2020, and its European distribution centers stopped using plastic delivery bags in 2022. Those changes contributed to a 9 percent self-reported decline in global plastic use between 2022 and 2023, according to an Amazon spokesperson.\n\nPlastic reduction has been slower in the U.S., perhaps because of the sheer size of its largest market. Oceana has estimated that Amazon generated 208 million pounds of plastic packaging trash in the United States in 2022 — about 10 percent more than the previous year — although this doesn’t account for the company’s most recent efforts to transition to paper. In its recent blog post, Amazon said it has now retrofitted more than 120 automated packing machines across the country so they can make paper bags, rather than plastic ones.\n\nAmazon also hinted in its 2022 sustainability report that it was “phasing out padded bags containing plastics,” presumably referring to its ubiquitous blue-and-white mailers. Littlejohn said Amazon should make this commitment more precise by clarifying its geographical scope and a timeline for accomplishing it.\n\nThe company also said in its most recent sustainability report that it’s “working to reduce our use of single-use plastic packaging in favor of household-recyclable alternatives.” Littlejohn said that the emphasis on curbside recycling — instead of specialty take-back programs at retail stores — is meaningful. Currently, the company’s blue-and-white mailers feature a label directing customers to “store drop-off” recycling receptacles at locations like Kohl’s, Safeway (ACI), and Stop & Shop. But investigations from the media and environmental groups have shown that plastic collected in these receptacles is often sent to landfills and incinerators, rather than to a recycler. Plastic film that does get reprocessed is downgraded into nonrecyclable products like deck chairs.\n\nIn response to Grist’s request for comment, an Amazon spokesperson pointed to previously announced plastic reduction efforts, including the complete elimination of plastic packaging from two U.S. distribution facilities.\n\n“We recognize the importance of reducing single-use plastic, in the U.S. and globally, but this can’t be done overnight,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. They went on to say that Amazon is “obsessed with getting this right for customers, and we’re incredibly proud of the progress so far.”\n\nAmazon also said in its blog post from last week that its first priority is “to remove packaging altogether,” meaning it tries to ship products in their original packaging rather than adding Amazon-branded sleeves, bags, boxes, and padding. As of December of last year, Amazon was shipping one-third of its sales in North America without any additional packaging, and it said it would increase this fraction to two-thirds by December 2024.\n\nAs You Sow is a nonprofit shareholder advocacy organization that has filed several resolutions at Amazon asking the company to disclose and reduce its plastic packaging footprint. Conrad MacKerron, the organization’s senior vice president, noted that there are still plenty of opportunities outside of Amazon’s e-commerce business to cut down on unnecessary plastic packaging. For example, he said, Amazon sells many private-label food and beverage products that are packed in flexible plastic, like bags of nuts and candies. These products contribute to plastic pollution, even if they’re shipped to buyers in a paper envelope.\n\nAmazon also owns Whole Foods, one of the largest grocery chains in the United States, where entire aisles of products are sold in flimsy plastic packaging that is virtually impossible to recycle. Many of these products are sold under the Amazon-owned label 365 by Whole Foods Market. “Unlike PET bottles, that flexible packaging cannot be recycled really anywhere in the world at this point. All of that goes to the landfill,” MacKerron said. He said he’d like to see Amazon “reevaluate” its grocery store plastic use, “given that there’s nothing on the horizon that’s going to provide a recycling option” for it.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Grist at https://grist.org/accountability/amazons-inflatable-plastic-pillows-are-officially-a-thing-of-the-past/.

        "title": "Amazon boss tells workers they can quit if they don't want to come to the office",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) Web Services chief Matt Garman doubled down on Amazon’s new five-day in-office work week, telling any disgruntled employees that they can find work elsewhere.\n\nGarman, one of the company’s top executives, told workers in an all-hands meeting Thursday that if they don’t like the new policy, they can quit, according to a transcript of the meeting first reported by Reuters.\n\n“If there are people who just don’t work well in that environment and don’t want to, that’s okay, there are other companies around,” Garman said.\n\n“At Amazon, we want to be in an environment where we are working together, and we feel that collaborative environment is incredibly important for our innovation and for our culture,” he added.\n\nThat echoes similar comments from top brass at other major companies, who have labelled remote work as an innovation and collaboration killer. In August, former Google (GOOGL) CEO Eric Schmidt blamed remote work for the tech giant losing its edge in the artificial intelligence race. He later walked back the comments.\n\nOther companies that have done away with remote and hybrid policies in recent years include JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Tesla (TSLA), and Walmart.\n\nThe tech giant announced the changes to office policy last month, and workers will have to completely ditch their remote work arrangements starting Jan 2. At the time, CEO Andy Jassy said he believes the move will better set Amazon up “to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business.”\n\nFor their part, workers at the tech giant called the decision “unfortunate” and “disheartening” on social media and internal messaging boards. Many were frustrated, calling the move was a step backward and expressing concerns about the impact it would have on their work-life balance.\n\nPrevious reports showed that Amazon had been keeping tabs on how much its employees were coming into the office and sending messages to delinquent employees.\n\nGarman said at Thursday’s meeting, however, that “nine out of 10 people are actually quite excited by this change.” He added that in the era of hybrid work, there were days when his team “didn’t really accomplish anything” because team members were working remotely.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile executives have taken to bashing remote work, evidence of its impacts on productivity is mixed: Some studies have found that working from home can boost productivity — by as much as 24%, even — while others have said the opposite.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Amazon.com fair value estimate is US$335 Amazon.com's US$188 share price signals that it might be 44% undervalued Analyst price target for AMZN is US$221 which is 34% below our fair value estimate\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nThe Method\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$72.1b US$95.5b US$113.7b US$134.2b US$149.5b US$162.5b US$173.7b US$183.3b US$191.8b US$199.5b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x19 Analyst x11 Analyst x6 Analyst x4 Est @ 11.40% Est @ 8.73% Est @ 6.86% Est @ 5.55% Est @ 4.64% Est @ 4.00% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7%  US$67.6k US$83.8k US$93.5k US$103.4k US$108.0k US$110.0k US$110.1k US$108.9k US$106.8k US$104.0k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$996b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.5%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$200b× (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.5%) = US$4.8t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.8t÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$2.5t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.5t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$188, the company appears quite undervalued at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.026. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Amazon.com\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\nThreat\n\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

        "title": "Amazon boss has a brutal response to staffers who don’t like 5-day RTO mandate: Leave",
        "content": "Amazon's push to get employees back into the office five days a week is boiling down to a rather blunt argument: If staffers don't like it, they can work elsewhere.\n\nIn an all-hands meeting for Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit, CEO Matt Garman bluntly told colleagues that if they didn't like the controversial policy, they should leave.\n\nThe Big Tech giant's push to get employees back to their in-office desks five days a week hasn't been simple.\n\nIn February last year, some 16,000 employees joined a Slack channel and launched a petition to oppose CEO Andy Jassy's call to return to the office for \"the majority of the week.\"\n\nIn February 2023, that only meant three days a week, but by September 2024, it was increased to mandatory in-office attendance every day of the working week starting from January 2025.\n\nIn an internal call this week—first reported by Reuters—Garman doubled down on the decision, saying Amazon didn't want employees who couldn't handle being in the office that frequently.\n\n\"If there are people who just don't work well in that environment and don't want to, that's okay, there are other companies around,\" Garman said, per Reuters.\n\n\"By the way, I don't mean that in a bad way,\" he continued. He said he wanted staff to be \"in an environment where we're working together.\"\n\nGarman said he isn't seeing enough evidence to support the idea that the Jeff Bezos-founded company is innovating fast enough under a hybrid working model, adding: \"When we want to really, really innovate on interesting products, I have not seen an ability for us to do that when we're not in-person.\"\n\nGiven the fact teams were in on three days—and not necessarily the same three days—\"we didn't really accomplish anything, like we didn't get to work together and learn from each other,\" Garman reportedly added.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to Fortune's request for comment.\n\nPopularity problems\n\nAccording to a transcript of the all-hands seen by CNBC, Garman insisted that of the colleagues he has spoken to, \"nine out of ten\" are looking forward to the new mandate being enforced.\n\nPerhaps Garman has just been lucky with the people he has spoken to, as staffers posting on social media sites and internal channels have expressed their fury at the goalposts once again changing—impacting their commute and family dynamics.\n\n“Amazon has announced 5 day RTO, which is unfortunate because I’m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,” an Amazon Web Services engineer posted on LinkedIn, with an accompanying #OpenToWork banner signaling their intention to leave the company.\n\nStory continues\n\n“If you have remote opportunities available, please message me,\" the staffer continued. \"Nothing is off the table. I’d rather go back to school than work in an office again.”\n\nTech staffers looking to leave Amazon for a rival face a tough balance, with layoffs sweeping through companies offering a more flexible office-to-hybrid working structure.\n\nMeta, for example, allows its staff to work from home two days a week, and Googlehas a similar policy.\n\nMicrosoft on the other hand allows staff to work as flexibly as they want, with a VP at the company recently telling staffers the policy will stay in place as long as productivity remains high.\n\nLearning principles\n\nAmazon's culture is very closely linked to its leadership principles, many of which hark back to the days when billionaire entrepreneur Bezos was at the helm.\n\nCurrent CEO Andy Jassy is still a proponent of the principles, with Garman reportedly adding that teams not being together, in-person full-time is getting in the way of these guiding ideas.\n\nSpeaking of the leadership principles, Garman is reported to have said: \"You can't internalize them by reading them on the website, you really have to experience them day-to-day.\"\n\nAlong with well-known ideas like Amazon's \"customer obsession,\" there is the notion of disagree and commit, where individuals voice their opinions but join the general consensus whether or not they agree.\n\n\"I don't know if you guys have tried to disagree via a Chime call,\" Garman continued, referring to an internal messaging platform. \"It's very hard.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The next big AI trade could be nuclear power: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nNuclear power is poised for a renaissance in the US, prompted by Big Tech’s seemingly insatiable need for electricity to power AI-generating data centers.\n\nThree recent headlines have thrown this into focus: Microsoft (MSFT) signed an agreement with Constellation Energy (CEG) to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) partnered with Kairos to buy power from small modular nuclear reactors, known as SMRs. And Amazon (AMZN) is leading a $500 million funding round for another SMR company, X-Energy.\n\nThe nuclear energy industry has largely stagnated in the US. While the country has 94 nuclear reactors, according to the Energy Information Administration, their collective generating capacity has remained at around 20% of total electricity since the late 1980s. When the Vogtle plant in Georgia opened its third and fourth reactors earlier this year, they were the first new units in seven years. One main reason for the slow pace is the stringent safety and design standards imposed by regulators.\n\nIf Big Tech’s investments are any indication, that might be poised to change. Chips and energy are the picks and shovels of the AI movement, making reexamining nuclear power a logical conclusion. But if investors want to follow with their dollars, there are some key things to remember.\n\nOne is that these projects — even the Three Mile Island reactor, which isn’t using new technology — are years away. Three Mile Island is scheduled to get online by 2028. The shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant stands in the middle of the Susquehanna River on Oct. 10, 2024, near Middletown, Pennsylvania. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) (Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images)\n\nThen there’s the newer tech. The goal of small modular reactors is to create mini versions of larger nuclear fission generators at a lower cost and with more flexibility, Kairos CEO Mike Laufer told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut SMRs aren’t yet in use in the US. All of the companies getting investments are in the experimental stages. The privately held Kairos, for example, has received government approval to build a demonstration unit. It will first run it with non-nuclear power to showcase its cooling technology, which Laufer said has safety benefits. That demo is targeted for 2030.\n\nThe second obstacle for investors is that there aren’t many publicly traded ways to get in, especially pure plays. Many of those stocks have skyrocketed this year. NuScale Power (SMR) has soared by more than 450%. Oklo (OKLO), backed by Sam Altman of OpenAI, went public through a SPAC in May and the shares have gained more than 80% since.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe overall demand for electricity that’s expected from data centers has also driven up shares of utility companies by nearly unprecedented levels, not exclusive to nuclear. Their rates are regulated, so the bet depends on the expected expansion in volume of demand. (The ETF that tracks S&P 500 utility companies has risen by nearly 30% this year, which, if it holds, will be a record gain.)\n\nUranium producers have been another outlet for thirsty cash searching for nuclear-linked investments. Vancouver-based Uranium Energy (UEC) and Cameco (CCJ), for example, have been on a years-long tear and are near record highs.\n\nAll of this is supposing that SMRs will get approval and work. Obviously, there’s an increasing amount of money pushing in that direction, with Big Tech motivated to get clean energy-powered electricity generation.\n\n“Right now, these things are unproven,” George Gianarikas, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity who covers renewable energy, said in a phone interview. “We don’t have a lot of examples of small modular reactors working in the world. They’re a promise.”\n\nJulie Hyman is the co-host of Market Domination on Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Amazon and Alphabet: Pivotal Chooses the Best ‘Magnificent 7’ Stocks to Buy",
        "content": "The NASDAQ index has risen 24% year-to-date and is hovering near record highs following a summer lull. Once again, the rally has been powered largely by the ‘Magnificent 7’ – a select group of mega-cap tech stocks that have soared to stratospheric valuations in recent years.\n\nThis group includes the six largest stocks trading on Wall Street – Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta – as well as Elon Musk’s Tesla. Together, these companies have been leaders in innovation, especially of the AI tech that is so rapidly changing the tech world.\n\nPivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak has been closely examining the ‘Magnificent 7’ and is now offering fresh recommendations on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Let’s take a closer look at what makes these two stand out and why they are receiving Wlodarczak’s endorsement.\n\nAmazon\n\nWe’ll start with Amazon, the global leader in online retail. This company is a proven survivor, an original ‘dot.com’ that survived the tech bubble of the late 90s–early 2000s and has grown to become one of the world’s largest publicly traded firms. While the company started out as an online bookseller, today e-shoppers can find virtually anything on Amazon – and the company will guarantee delivery almost anywhere in the world.\n\nAmazon backs up its huge inventory, covering everything from books and toys to pharmaceuticals, clothing, and phone cases, with a network of high-tech warehouses and logistics facilities. The company’s warehouses use AI and robotic tech, backed up by a human workforce, to pack and ship anything to anywhere.\n\nThis combination of huge inventory and fast delivery has made Amazon the world leader in e-commerce – and allowed the company to build up an enormous market cap of nearly $2 trillion, making Amazon the world’s fifth-largest public company. Amazon has used its deep pockets to expand its customer base by expanding its product and service offerings.\n\nOn the product side, Amazon has recently been pushing its ‘digital pharmacy’ business, allowing customers to fill prescriptions online, with fully accredited pharmacists. Earlier this month, the company announced that it will be opening 20 new pharmacies, doubling the number of cities with same-day delivery service available.\n\nOn the service side, the company’s cloud computing platform, AWS, has become increasingly popular. AWS, which is a direct competitor to Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure, has become an important revenue driver for Amazon – and accounted for $26.3 billion of the company’s $148 billion topline in Q2 of this year (the last quarter reported). That makes AWS responsible for almost 18% of the total revenue in a quarter that saw 10% year-over-year revenue growth. Amazon has been consistently reporting year-over-year quarterly revenue growth in the low double digits recently and is expected to do so again in the upcoming Q3 report. The top line for the third quarter is expected to exceed $157 billion, which would translate to another 10% year-over-year gain.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor analyst Wlodarczak, Amazon presents a solid tale of strength and growth. He writes of the company, “Amazon has a deep moat around their core businesses driven by their unmatched scale and has what appears to be the largest organic revenue growth opportunity of any mega cap tech company (other than arguably NVDA (N/R)) driven primarily by their AWS cloud segment (which we expect to grow from 17% of revenue to ~35% in 5 years), extension of their e-commerce/fulfillment arms into new segments/internationally, continued rapid growth in their advertising business and proven ability to develop new successful products/revenue streams.”\n\nLooking ahead, Wlodarczak goes on to explain why investors should continue to buy in on AMZN: “This is all enhanced by what we believe is the highest potential of their peers to materially boost operating margins driven by scale, leveraging robotics/AI and benefits from an increasing % of revenue from high margin cloud computing/advertising combined with what appears to be an attractive valuation.”\n\nAs expected, after comments like these, Wlodarczak rates Amazon stock as a Buy. His price target, set at $260, points toward a one-year upside potential of 39%. (To watch Wlodarczak’s track record, click here)\n\nThis major retailer/tech firm has picked up plenty of attention from Wall Street, and mostly all positive. The Strong Buy consensus is based on a lopsided Buy/Hold split of 45 to 2 among the analyst reviews, and the $224.38 average price target implies a 20% upside from the current trading price of $186.89. (See Amazon stock forecast)\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe second Mag 7 stock we’ll look at is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and the market’s fourth-largest public company, with a market cap of just over $2 trillion. Alphabet, which also owns YouTube and has been developing an ever-growing presence in the AI field, has built its success on its absolute dominance of the global internet search segment – and the advantages that brings in the field of digital advertising. Remember that Google and YouTube are the world’s leaders in online search and online video search, respectively.\n\nIn the last few years, the AI boom has begun to shift the tech landscape in ways that are still not fully clear. Alphabet has been moving to adopt the new technology, seeing it as a multiplier for online search, and as a powerful tool in online and cloud-based applications. The company is using AI tech in its multimodal large language models, which improve both Google’s online translation apps and its search engine functionality. These improvements in generating search results and translation matrixes are a direct response to increased competition from Microsoft’s Bing as well as ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms.\n\nOn the practical side, Alphabet has released its Gemini platform, its most up-to-date offering in AI. Gemini is based on a core of large language models, designed from the start to understand natural language content – in text, audio, images, video, and even in code. The platform uses AI to provide the maximum flexibility for the end user’s application, and Alphabet is working to integrate it into all of its products. That includes the Android operating system, which will make Gemini’s AI available on smartphones – and all of their apps. For Alphabet, the key challenge presented by AI will be maintaining market share in online search as the digital world switches its base to generative AI tools and apps.\n\nFor now, Alphabet is generating solid revenue and income numbers. The company brought in $84.7 billion in 2Q24, a total that was up nearly 14% from the prior-year quarter and was more than $445 million over the forecast. Alphabet’s bottom line of $1.89 per share was 5 cents over expectations. Analysts are expecting to see revenues of $86.23 billion when the company reports earnings for Q3 later this month.\n\nTurning again to Pivotal’s Wlodarczak, we find the analyst taking an upbeat view of Alphabet’s stock, its position and prospects. He says, “If the status quo holds, GOOG appears to be in a very strong competitive position with a deep moat around their dominant core search business model (~90% market share ex China) and an obvious path to leverage 90%+ (ex China) global device presence (which we believe will dominate consumer AI assistant use), a strong AI platform and financial might to increase financial incentives to handset manufacturers for default AI placement. GOOG also holds a strong #3 position in cloud computing, which we believe has dramatic growth potential…”\n\nLooking ahead, Wlodarczak adds, “This position is enhanced by the fact that GOOG appears to have the ability, leveraging their AI investment, to significantly reduce their cost structure (mainly through a material reduction in their ~180K employees) offset partially by the aforementioned potentially higher TAC to extend their search handset dominance to AI (if they are not prohibited in doing so by regulators/courts), which should help drive strong financial growth and help them generate a reasonable AI ROIC even if the development of AI revenue generating applications takes longer than expected.”\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the Pivotal analyst rates GOOGL shares as a Buy, while his price target, $215, suggests an upside of 30% on the one-year horizon.\n\nFor the Street generally, this is another stock with a Strong Buy consensus. The 39 recent reviews include 30 Buys to 9 Holds. Shares are priced at $165.16 and have an average target price of $201.57, implying a gain of 22% by this time next year.

        "title": "South African click-and-collect firm Pargo considers foray into rest of Africa",
        "content": "By Nqobile Dludla\n\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African click-and-collect company Pargo is exploring an expansion into the rest of Africa, its CEO said in an interview, betting on e-commerce growth on the continent.\n\nAfrica is forecast to surpass half a billion e-commerce users by 2025, having shown a steady 17% compound annual growth rate of online consumers in the market, according to the International Trade Administration, a U.S. government agency.\n\nThis growth is driven by increasing internet penetration, smartphone adoption and the growing use of digital financial services, especially mobile money.\n\n\"We're looking at an expansion strategy to move into multiple markets. We're already operational in Egypt as a second country, but we are quite seriously looking at, in the future, building a network across Africa,\" Pargo CEO and co-founder Lars Veul told Reuters.\n\nHe said the options would span the main economies in Africa.\n\n\"We don't know exactly yet. So, it's more about the countries where e-commerce is booming or expected to boom.\"\n\nThe expansion will also be driven by following its existing clients into countries where they operate outside of South Africa, Veul added.\n\nVeul, a Dutch citizen who moved to Cape Town in 2012 from Amsterdam to help set up online marketplace Groupon in South Africa, said he co-founded the company in 2015 after realising last-mile delivery was a serious challenge for e-commerce businesses on the continent.\n\nThe firm has more than 4,000 pick-up points located at retail stores across South Africa, including township \"spaza\" shops, which are informal stores that dot township corners.\n\nPargo has partnered with major listed telecoms, banks and retailers including U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon, which launched in South Africa in May this year. Amazon's customers order online and then collect their parcels at Pargo's pick-up points.\n\nClick-and-collect allows shoppers to avoid delivery costs and the agony of waiting for the delivery. It also lowers costs for last-mile delivery companies, who grapple with fuel expenses, product returns and difficulty in delivering to townships and rural areas.\n\n(Reporting by Nqobile Dludla; Editing by Jamie Freed)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we will look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds.\n\nAnother 50 bps Cut is Still Restrictive\n\nThe labor market has been more resilient than ever. On October 4, Gary Cohn, the IBM vice chairman, and former US National Economic Council director in the Trump administration, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the job report and the US economy.\n\nCohn suggests that the jobs data is the least scientific information the government puts out and therefore, it must be taken with a grain of salt. However, he emphasizes the importance of understanding trends. The number of people entering the workforce is expanding and jobs are being created, deducing that the market is in a neutral place.\n\nCohn believes that the US economy is normalizing. He reveals that we have not lived in a normal economy in over a decade, therefore, relative to history, the status quo is fairly reasonable. He adds that the Fed has orchestrated a soft landing and expects another 50 basis point cut before the end of 2024, which according to him is still restrictive.\n\nPortfolio Manager Highlights High Growth Sectors\n\nAs the AI flame starts to settle, the market may be up for a major shift. On October 7, Keith Buchanan, GLOBALT Investments senior portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his expectations of the market.\n\nExpectations for earnings have been revised from mid-single digits to mid-double digitals, promising robust growth as 2024 comes to a close. Buchanan suggests that most of the growth comes from artificial intelligence and the widening of earnings growth beyond traditional growth sectors like technology.\n\nThis year, the industrial and energy sectors have enjoyed greater returns capturing a large chunk of the market. Buchanan is highly bullish on AI plays and value stocks. He also adds that names in financials, industrials, and consumer discretionary are poised for growth ahead of 2024. He advises investors to consider geopolitical events before making any investment decisions.\n\nNow that we have assessed the future of the financial markets and possible sectors eyeing growth, let’s take a look at the 10 most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo find the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds, we went over multiple rankings over the internet to list long-term blue chip stocks. We then examined the analyst upside and the hedge fund sentiment of these stocks as of Q2 2024 and picked the most popular ones. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024 as a primary metric and analyst upside as of October 13, as a secondary metric.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAnalyst Upside as of October 13, 2024: 17%\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks first on our list of the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds. The technology company is an e-commerce giant that also provides streaming and data cloud services.\n\nThe company launched its e-commerce platform in 1994 and is now close to capturing 40% of the market in the United States. Amazon Web Services (AWS), its proprietary cloud service, reported an 18.8% revenue growth during the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThis year, the company achieved significant milestones. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has not only been actively involved in the development of AI hardware and software but has also signed partnerships with the government and AI startups. Speaking of innovation, on October 11, the company launched its first autonomous robot, Proteus. The autonomous robot fulfills miscellaneous tasks in the Amazon fulfillment centers independently and safely.\n\nOn the artificial intelligence front, AWS is housing the next generation of Llama models from Meta, enabling customers to build and deploy AI applications freely. In addition to that, the company also launched an AI personal assistant in September that helps Amazon sellers meet the unique needs of their customers.\n\nOverall, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is poised to become a complete artificial intelligence company as it adapts to autonomous technologies and AI-backed systems, contributing to its ranking on our list.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "By Greg Bensinger\n\n(Reuters) -One of Amazon's top executives defended the new, controversial 5-day-per-week in-office policy on Thursday, saying those who do not support it can leave for another company. Speaking at an all-hands meeting for AWS, unit CEO Matt Garman said nine out of 10 workers he has spoken with support the new policy, which takes effect in January, according to a transcript reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThose who do not wish to comply can quit, he indicated.\n\n\"If there are people who just don't work well in that environment and don't want to, that's okay, there are other companies around,\" said Garman. \"When we want to really, really innovate on interesting products, I have not seen an ability for us to do that when we're not in-person.\"\n\nThe policy has upset many of Amazon's employees who say it wastes time with commuting and the benefits of working from the office are not supported by independent data.\n\nAmazon has been enforcing a three-day in-office policy, but CEO Andy Jassy said last month the retailer would move to five days to \"invent, collaborate and be connected.\"\n\nSome employees who had not been previously compliant were told they were \"voluntarily resigning\" and were locked out of company systems.\n\nAmazon, the world's second-largest private employer behind Walmart, has taken a harder line on returning to office than many of its technology peers such as Google, Meta and Microsoft who have two- to three-day in-office policies.\n\n\"I'm actually quite excited about this change,\" said Garman. \"I know not everyone is,\" he said, noting it's too hard to accomplish the company's goals with only the mandatory current three days of in-office work.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nGarman said under the three-day policy, \"we didn't really accomplish anything, like we didn't get to work together and learn from each other.\"\n\nIn particular, Garman said the company's leadership principles, which dictate how Amazon ought to operate, were too difficult to adhere to under the current policy.\n\n\"You can't internalize them by reading them on the website, you really have to experience them day-to-day,\" he said.\n\nOne, \"disagree and commit\" -- which is understood to mean that employees can express grievances but then should dive into a project as outlined by leaders -- is not ideal for remote work, Garman said.\n\n\"I don't know if you guys have tried to disagree via a Chime call,\" he said, referring to the company's internal messaging and calling function. \"It's very hard.\"\n\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger; Editing by Sandra Maler)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "On September 30, 2024, State Street Corp executed a significant transaction involving the sale of 129,359 shares in Hasbro Inc (NASDAQ:HAS), a renowned branded play company. This move adjusted State Street Corp's holding to a total of 6,015,965 shares, reflecting a subtle yet strategic portfolio adjustment. The shares were traded at a price of $72.32 each, marking a notable moment in the investment firm's trading activities.\n\nProfile of State Street Corp\n\nWarning!

With a focus on technology and financial services sectors, the firm manages an equity portfolio worth approximately $2,285.63 trillion. State Street Corp's investment philosophy emphasizes long-term growth and stability, leveraging a diverse array of assets to achieve financial success. State Street Corp's Strategic Reduction in Hasbro Inc Holdings\n\nInsight into Hasbro Inc's Business Model\n\nHasbro Inc, with its stock symbol HAS, operates primarily in the consumer products and entertainment sectors.

        "content": "The Uranium stocks have popped as significant tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN, Financial), Microsoft (MSFT, Financial), and Alphabet (GOOGL, Financial) deepen their nuclear power bets. It started with Microsoft's power purchase agreement made last month that will revamp the Three Mile Island Nuclear Station for AI's burgeoning growth.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.\n\nThis week, we saw the spectrum shifting a gear higher as a giant such as Amazon revealed partnerships with Energy Northwest, Dominion Energy, and X-energy to pursue Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), which have thus brightened up investor confidence in the sector. On the same day, Google's parent company Alphabet was revealed to be investing $10 million in Kairos Power to develop the initial 500MW of advanced small modular reactor facilities, all in a sign of a sector switching to more compact and environmentally friendly power generation technology.\n\nThe market confronting them responded sharply and violently. New interesting information about uranium mining and nuclear energy Company Cameco (CCJ, Financial) rocketed 8.2%, Denison Mines (DNN, Financial) and Clean Energy Fuels (CLNE, Financial) went 14.7 % per share higher and 17% higher, respectively. NuScale Power (SMR, Financial, which was revealed earlier had a large stake in the SMR market, rocketed up by a magnificent 31.6% and reached its highest point ever.\n\nThe enthusiasm for nuclear power is underpinned by the IAEA's latest forecasts on nuclear capability, which indicate a probability of a 2.5-fold increase in capacity by 2050. This projection is in line with the rising global push to escalate nuclear deployment as part of the plan to realize net-zero carbon emissions.\n\nClosely following this, tech giants set the pace, investing in nuclear power. They did not merely ignite the upturn of relevant stocks, but they also indicated nuclear energy as a crucial factor that could shape the future energy scenario, generating a cleaner and more sustainable energy mix.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Overview of the Recent Transaction\n\nOn September 30, 2024, State Street Corp made a significant addition to its investment portfolio by acquiring 1,255,819 shares of Wolfspeed Inc (NYSE:WOLF), a key player in the semiconductor industry. This transaction increased State Street Corp's total holdings in Wolfspeed to 6,694,555 shares, marking a substantial investment in the company. Despite the large number of shares purchased, this move did not have a significant immediate impact on State Street Corps overall portfolio, which remains diverse and robust.\n\nProfile of State Street Corp\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with WOLF.\n\nState Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a prominent financial services provider with a strong focus on investment management. The firm manages a vast equity portfolio valued at approximately $2,285.63 trillion, predominantly in the technology and financial services sectors. State Street Corps top holdings include major corporations such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), reflecting its strategic focus on high-growth potential markets. State Street Corp's Strategic Acquisition of Wolfspeed Inc Shares\n\nIntroduction to Wolfspeed Inc\n\nWolfspeed Inc, trading under the symbol WOLF, specializes in the production of wide bandgap semiconductors, focusing on materials like silicon carbide and gallium nitride. These components are crucial for various applications including power supplies and wireless systems. Despite its innovative technology, Wolfspeed has faced financial challenges, as indicated by its current stock price of $16.09 and a market capitalization of $2.04 billion. The company's financial metrics suggest a cautious outlook, with a GF Value suggesting it is a possible value trap. State Street Corp's Strategic Acquisition of Wolfspeed Inc Shares\n\nAnalysis of the Trade Impact\n\nThe recent acquisition by State Street Corp represents a 23.09% increase in their holdings of Wolfspeed shares, reflecting a strategic decision despite the stock's challenging financial indicators. This move has not altered the firm's portfolio significantly in terms of percentage, maintaining a balance across various sectors and investments.\n\nMarket Performance and Investment Rationale\n\nWolfspeed's stock has experienced a significant decline of 62.79% year-to-date, yet it has seen a substantial gain of 65.88% since the transaction date. This volatility highlights the high-risk, high-reward nature of investing in the semiconductor sector. State Street Corps decision to increase its stake could be driven by the potential long-term growth in the semiconductor industry, despite the current financial instability indicated by Wolfspeeds GF Score of 58/100 and a Profitability Rank of 2/10.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroader Market Implications\n\nThis transaction aligns with broader trends in the semiconductor industry, which is seeing increased investment despite current market uncertainties. Other significant shareholders like Gotham Asset Management, LLC, and Jefferies Group (Trades, Portfolio) also maintain substantial positions in Wolfspeed, indicating a general market belief in the sector's recovery and growth potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nState Street Corp's recent acquisition of Wolfspeed shares highlights a calculated risk in a sector poised for future growth. While the immediate impact on State Streets portfolio is minimal, the long-term implications could be more significant, depending on how semiconductor technologies evolve and are adopted in various industries. Investors and market watchers will undoubtedly keep a close eye on Wolfspeed's performance and State Streets strategic moves going forward.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s Amazon Web Services, the world’s biggest cloud-computing provider, said that new systems running Nvidia Corp.’s Blackwell chips probably won’t be online until early next year, a later timeline than originally anticipated.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nInside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided How Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says Mexico Seeks to Halve Permitting Time to Attract More Factories\n\nWhen Nvidia introduced the new generation of processors in March, it said that partners like Amazon would have Blackwell-based products ready by the end of 2024. But after a production change — dubbed a respin — Amazon is still waiting to get major quantities of the chip to put into its data centers.\n\nNvidia’s timelines have “shifted,” AWS Chief Executive Officer Matt Garman said Thursday on Bloomberg Television. “Right now, we’re working with them and we have early samples, but as they get their yields up from the respin of the Blackwell chip, it’ll probably be early next year before we get production samples in real volume.”\n\nInvestors are keenly focused on when Nvidia’s latest product will get into the hands of customers and put to use. The chipmaker has become one of the world’s most valuable companies on the strength of runaway demand for its artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia has said that — even after production delays — it expects to get billions of dollars of revenue from the processor in the fourth quarter.\n\nAWS will be the first to deploy computers based on the new chip in significant quantities, Garman said, giving it a unique view into Blackwell’s progress. Dell Technologies Inc. also has said that Blackwell-based servers will be generally available at the beginning of 2025.\n\nNvidia products have become a prized commodity among data center operators, which use the chips to develop AI software and services. The Santa Clara, California-based company acknowledged in August that Blackwell proved more difficult to produce than anticipated. The company said that it was making changes to improve its manufacturing yield — the number of functioning chips that come out of factories.\n\nSupplies will be plentiful after manufacturing gains momentum, CEO Jensen Huang said in a Bloomberg Television interview at the time. “We’re going to have lots and lots of supply, and we will be able to ramp,” he said.\n\n--With assistance from Matt Day.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nBYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs A Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work How Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium The World’s Central Banks Aren’t Following the Fed’s Lead Anymore Why OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Dominion &amp; Amazon Sign a Deal to Develop SMRs in Virginia",
        "content": "Dominion Energy D has recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Amazon.com AMZN to explore innovative new development structures for enhancing potential Small Modular Reactor (“SMR”) nuclear development in Virginia. This should further boost D’s footprint in the expanding power demand market in the state of Virginia by tapping into the less explored SMR technology.\r\n\r\nThe latest agreement should enable Dominion Energy and Amazon to promote SMR development and financing while reducing the possible risks to consumers and capital sources in terms of cost and development.\n\nThe Need for SMR Development\n\nUtilities, state and federal authorities, as well as top technology companies are investigating SMR as a viable solution that would offer reliable, carbon-free power as the demand for electricity in Virginia and other U.S. areas has been rising at an unprecedented level.\r\n\r\nAlike traditional nuclear, SMRs generate around-the-clock, carbon-free power, but with a significantly smaller footprint and lower upfront capital costs.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, the need for power is predicted to double over the next fifteen years, with an annual growth rate above 5%. To support this remarkable expansion, Dominion Energy is creating an \"all-of-the-above\" mix of new power production sources, including innovative investments in offshore wind, solar, battery storage and natural gas.\r\n\r\nTo this end, Dominion Energy expects SMRs to be an essential component of this \"all-of-the-above\" energy mix in the 2030s. Against this backdrop, the latest MOU seems to be a strategically noteworthy decision undertaken by Dominion Energy to maintain its prowess in the electric utility industry.\r\n\r\nEarlier, in July 2024, the company released a Request for Proposals, inviting proposals from top SMR nuclear technology companies to assess the viability of developing a SMR at its North Anna Power Station in Louisa County, VA.\n\nD Stock’s Growth Prospects\n\nThe development of SMRs can be attributed to the growing desire to include nuclear energy in many countries' clean energy mix due to its potential cost-saving benefits and adaptability.\r\n\r\nAccording to a Wood Mackenzie report, published in March 2024, the SMR project pipeline reached 22 gigawatts (GW) in the first quarter of 2024, requiring an investment of close to $176 billion. This offers ample growth opportunities to utilities like Dominion Energy that are putting efforts to incorporate SMR technology in their infrastructure. The company's latest agreement with Amazon is a bright example of that.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother Utility Involved in SMR\n\nApart from D, another utility provider, Ameren Corporation AEE is set to take advantage of the growing SMR market. \r\nAmeren Missouri, a unit of AEE, joined forces with Westinghouse Electric Company, seeking investment funds from the U.S. Department of Energy for two SMR projects. This funding included plans for the construction of a Westinghouse SMR at Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center.\r\n\r\nAEE’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 6.58%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings per share (EPS) implies a year-over-year improvement of 5.5%.\n\nD’s Stock Price Performance\n\nIn the past three months, shares of the company have risen 18.1% compared with the industry’s 9% growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nD’s Zacks Rank & Stock to Consider\n\nThe company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nA better-ranked company from the same industry is NiSource NI, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

        "title": "Amazon Earnings Preview: The Weakest of the Magnificent 7?",
        "content": "Of all the Magnificent 7 stocks, Amazon (AMZN) has been the most challenging for investors to own over the last several years. While all the other companies in the group excluding Tesla are trading significantly higher than their 2021 highs, Amazon languishes. Amazon’s stock price is at the same price as it was in July 2021. May this lack of progress in the stock price be an opportunity for discerning investors?\n\nAmazon's stock has moved sideways over the past three years, allowing its valuation to become increasingly attractive as the company’s earnings have continued to grow. This period of stagnation in share price, combined with steady profit and sales growth, appears to have positioned the stock at a more appealing level for investors.\n\nToday, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting flat earnings revisions. However, with its historically cheap valuation and strong growth forecasts, it may be an attractive addition to investors’ portfolios. Amazon reports earnings Thursday, October 24. This analysis will examine the upcoming earnings expectations for Amazon's e-commerce and cloud computing segments, as well as the potential impact of artificial intelligence on the business, to assess whether the stock presents a worthwhile investment opportunity. We will also compare Amazon to two other Magnificent 7 members – Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon Earnings Projections\n\nDespite the less than encouraging stock price action, Amazon has continuously posted strong earnings over the past year. During the last four quarterly earnings meetings, Amazon has beaten analysts’ expectations every time with an average beat of 31.13%. Although the Zacks earnings ESP is not projecting an earnings beat this quarter, earnings are projected to grow nicely nonetheless, and sales are expected to progress nicely as well.\n\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, continues to dominate the highly competitive cloud services market, and last quarter reported a $100 billion annual revenue run rate. Most notably, web services revenue growth has been reaccelerating and shows continued expansion in margins. Artificial intelligence is and will continue to be a major catalyst for AWS, as its intense demand for computing power should power more growth in the years ahead.\n\nRegarding the retail business, analysts are expecting close to double digit year over year growth although there are still some concerns. Expanding internationally offers growth opportunities for Amazon but also brings challenges, including the negative impact of currency fluctuations on e-commerce results, especially with the strong dollar putting pressure on profitability. Additionally, competition is intensifying as traditional retailers like Walmart and Target enhance their e-commerce capabilities, while regional rivals such as MercadoLibre, Flipkart, and Alibaba pose significant threats in key international markets.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nComparing AMZN to AAPL and MSFT Stocks\n\nAmazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are all major players in the cloud computing space, with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, respectively. While AWS leads the market share, both Azure and Google Cloud have been rapidly expanding their capabilities, with Alphabet leveraging its AI expertise and Microsoft integrating cloud services with its software ecosystem.\n\nIn terms of valuation, Alphabet appears attractively priced at 21.6x forward earnings, which is below its five-year median of 23.8x. Microsoft, on the other hand, trades at a higher valuation of 32x forward earnings, above its five-year median of 22.3x. Meanwhile, Amazon is trading at 38.5x forward earnings, significantly lower than its five-year median of 70.1x, suggesting potential value as the stock has lagged despite continued growth in earnings and cloud revenues. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShould Investors Buy Amazon Shares?\n\nAmazon's stock has been challenging for investors over the past several years, especially compared to other \"Magnificent 7\" stocks. While companies like Alphabet and Microsoft have climbed well beyond their 2021 highs, Amazon's stock price is still languishing around the same level as it was in mid-2021. This lack of progress could be an opportunity for patient investors who see potential in the company's evolving business and improving valuation.\n\nDespite stagnant stock performance, Amazon's valuation has become more attractive as earnings and revenues have continued to grow. AMZN has also spawned multibillion dollar new businesses like Advertising, Alexa and Prime video which continue to grow nicely and give another reason to never count this technology juggernaut out of the race.\n\nAs Amazon heads into its earnings report on October 24, key segments to watch include e-commerce, where nearly double-digit growth is expected, and Amazon Web Services, which continues to lead the cloud computing market. And while of course risks remain, Amazon's steady business growth, attractive valuation, and leading cloud position make it worth considering for investors willing to look beyond short-term challenges.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "What's Going On With NuScale Power Stock on Thursday?\n\nAfter experiencing a significant surge on Wednesday, NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE:SMR) stock is trading lower, down over 5% on Thursday.\n\nYesterday, nuclear stocks soared following Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) announced a plan to invest over $500 million in nuclear power.\n\nAWS, Amazon’s cloud computing subsidiary, has signed three agreements to support nuclear energy development, including building Small Modular Reactors (SMRs).\n\nRead More: Nuclear Stocks Soar As Amazon Becomes Latest Tech Giant To Invest In Nuclear Power\n\nThis includes a deal with Energy Northwest for four SMRs generating up to 960 MW and a partnership Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D)to explore additional projects in Virginia.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the e-commerce giant also invested in X-energy, an SMR company involved in the Washington reactors, as part of a multi-million funding round that included Citadel CEO Ken Griffin and private-equity firm Ares Management.\n\nMajor nuclear stocks that soared following the deal are NuScale Power, Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO), Nano Nuclear Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:NNE), and Lightbridge Corp. (NASDAQ:LTBR).\n\nThe deal is important as nuclear reactors produce no carbon emissions, per a CNBC report.\n\nIn fact, the Biden administration has invested billions in clean energy production. In conjunction with this AWS announcement, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm stated that $900 million in new funding is now available for those aiming to deploy additional SMRs, CNBC added.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal added that the reactors are not expected to be delivered until between 2030 and 2035.\n\nOn Monday, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced its support for constructing seven SMRs from the startup Kairos Power in a pioneering agreement.\n\nAs the market reacts to these developments, investors will closely monitor how the nuclear sector evolves in response to increased support and funding from major tech companies.\n\nCraig-Hallum analyst Eric Stine maintains NuScale with a Buy and raises the price target from $16 to $21. According to Benzinga Pro, SMR stock has gained over 220% in the past year.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to the stock via Themes ETF Trust Themes Uranium & Nuclear ETF (BATS:URAN).\n\nPrice Action: SMR shares are trading lower by 3.12% to $18.48 at last check Thursday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nMarket ‘Very Convinced’ Of A Trump Win, Says Stanley Druckenmiller: Why Billionaire Investor Thinks Blue Sweep Is ‘Highly Unlikely’\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "title": "Walmart will sell you a tiny house for under $16,000",
        "content": "Big-box retailers seem to have everything for the home these days—including the home.\n\nWalmart has begun selling tiny homes, months after Amazon offered the unusually stylish pop-up abodes. The “expandable prefab house” from Chery Industrial will cost you $15,900 for the 19-by-20-foot option.\n\nThat’s notably less than what Amazon was charging for the same tiny home in April. (Amazon was asking $19,000—though it did offer a $1,000 discount coupon at the time. At the moment, the house is not available on that site.)\n\nBargain hunters, though, should be aware that you can get an even cheaper price on a slightly smaller version of the prefab home by going directly to the manufacturer. A 15-by-20-foot version of the expandable domicile is currently on sale for just under $12,000.\n\nYou will need to supply a few things yourself if you decide to buy one of these homes, like a tract of land to put the house on, along with a foundation, a power source, and water supply. But the house does come equipped with a toilet, shower, and some cabinets. Door locks are included as well.\n\nThe house is shipped in a folded state. Once it arrives, you and some friends will have to fold out the walls and ceiling to expand it to its full size. You’re on your own for furniture, of course, but you can buy that at Walmart or Amazon as well.\n\nThe tiny-home movement has been seeing increased popularity in the last couple of decades, as millennials pushed back against “McMansions” and housing prices soared. One 24-year-old who opted for a tiny home in her parents' backyard managed to save enough money to buy a $250,000 house and gain a substantial TikTok following based on the tiny housing lifestyle.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "First US auction of nature-based carbon credits scheduled for early 2025",
        "content": "The American Forest Foundation (AFF) recently announced that the nonprofit will hold the US's first nature-based carbon credit auction early next year.\n\nIn February 2025, buyers will be able to bid on premium carbon credits from four projects under the Family Forest Carbon Program, an initiative that connects landowners with technical and financial resources to more sustainably manage private forest lands.\n\n\"We are trying to address several pain points that exist in the current voluntary market for buyers of carbon credits, but also for landowners who are seeking to participate in the market,\" Nate Truitt, executive vice president of climate funding at the American Forest Foundation, told Yahoo Finance. \"And we're also seeking to close what is a really substantial financing gap for natural climate solutions, a gap that we're going to have to close globally if we're going to stay on a 1.5- or even a two-degree scenario.\"\n\nPrice volatility, market inefficiency, and a credibility crisis in the voluntary carbon market — along with the AI boom and other factors — have contributed to the recent trend of companies pulling back from their net-zero pledges. Corporations such as Shell (SHEL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Crocs (CROX) have missed, delayed, or weakened their sustainability targets in recent years.\n\nTruitt expects interest in the auction from companies in sectors, such as consumer goods that produce high emissions or are relatively less active in carbon markets but have decarbonization strategies in place. He also anticipates some interest from universities.\n\nAmong companies purchasing carbon credits, Microsoft dominates after setting an ambitious goal in 2020 to become carbon-negative within a decade. Other Big Tech firms such as Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) are consistent buyers. However, Truitt doesn't expect Big Tech companies to ultimately participate in this auction as they already employ large procurement teams.\n\nTruitt instead sees the auction as attracting \"the next wave of carbon credit buyers,\" comprised of actors that currently must navigate confusing spot markets, sift through individual carbon credit offerings, or sign on to long-term purchase agreements in a largely unregulated market.\n\n“It's our hope that by lowering these transaction costs and the friction of this, ... we can get some of those buyers to come to the table,” Truitt said.\n\nAFF is auctioning carbon credits for two types of projects. The first aims to improve forest management and carbon sequestration on 90,000 acres of land from Maine to Alabama held by 700 family landowners enrolled in the project. The second and newer project pays cattle ranchers and pasture owners in Georgia to plant trees on 1,500 acres of land.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother feature of AFF's auction will be an advance funding mechanism. In addition to bidding on the number and price of carbon credits to be delivered at a later date, companies will determine a percentage they are willing to pay for up-front in exchange for a discount.\n\nBuyers have spent roughly $3 billion on durable carbon removal credits since October 2019, according to reporting platform CDR.fyi; however, the market could grow more rapidly with better access to low-cost financing.\n\nTruitt underscored that many projects are ready to get off the ground. But because these projects involve more risk — natural disasters and changing rules around offsets add to uncertainty — they often have a difficult time securing lending.\n\nIf successful, AFF hopes their auction design can be used by other carbon market participants and remove barriers to these transactions.\n\n\"We're not solving climate change, but we're trying to develop a tool that will enable the voluntary carbon market to scale quicker and to produce higher quality carbon credits that can be trusted by buyers, investors, and the general public,\" Truitt said.

(Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images) (Finnbarr Webster via Getty Images)\n\nPreserving 'a messy forest'\n\nTim Stout is one landowner participating in the project. Stout and his family own a 175-acre former dairy farm in Vermont that was passed down from his great-grandfather.\n\nHe and his brother have managed the heavily forested property for the past 40 years, and after evaluating different carbon projects, their family enrolled in the Family Forest Carbon Program.\n\nThe financial benefits are \"fairly modest,\" Stout said. \"I mean, over 20 years, it's a healthy amount,\" he clarified, \"but I think for ... the program to really take off, the price of carbon credits has to go way up.\"\n\nAFF said it uses Verra's verified carbon standard and its own internal methodology developed with the Nature Conservancy to vet the quality of the credits.

(Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images) (ROBYN BECK via Getty Images)\n\n\"A messy forest is better than a clean forest because … all the downed trees, all the branches, all the leaf litter is storing carbon,\" Stout explained about how these plans have changed the way he and his family manage their land. \"We're moving more and more to kind of a messy forest.\"\n\nAt the same time, the cost of managing land has \"gone up significantly,\" Stout said.\n\nExtreme weather attributed to climate change has exacerbated costs. Heavy rainfall and flooding in Vermont, which experienced a 1-in-1,000-year rain event this summer, eroded the foundation of Stout's barn, incurring a large expense, he said. And strong winds toppled 200-year-old maple trees onto roadways, which needed to be removed.

(Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images) (Robert Nickelsberg via Getty Images)\n\nFunding from the auction will go toward expenses related to managing the forest and creating long-term land use plans that are developed by landowners, state foresters, and consulting AFF foresters. These plans and smart forestry techniques help forest owners like Stout increase the amount of carbon their forests can sequester.\n\nStout, who now sits on AFF's board, said he was motivated to sign a contract with the Family Forest Carbon Program by his concerns over climate change. He also feels a strong calling to preserve the woodland for future generations and educate other small landowners about sustainable forestry.\n\n\"I would love to have my four-year-old grandson and two-year-old granddaughter be able to visit that [land] when they're my age and have a healthy, robust, resilient forest that's still playing a role in mitigating climate change,\" he said.\n\n—\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nIf the summer was about the ROI on AI, or really, the absence of it, how much patience does Wall Street have for tech’s fall earnings?\n\nJudging by the surge in chip stocks, investors waiting for details about where all that infrastructure money is going and when new revenue will be coming will have to wait a while longer. An appreciating asset is its own defense.\n\nAs analysts press tech executives for clearer timelines around the supposed AI transformation, chip names continue to climb. Nvidia is once again threatening Apple as the market’s most valuable company. Semiconductor names are amassing gains, reversing a downfall from August. That reflects the intense demand for AI processing and infrastructure and a disregard for short-term worries over ballooning capex. Chasing the dream is expensive.\n\nAnd once again investors are wondering where the limit is — if it exists.\n\nThird quarter reports are primed to test those boundaries with even more money at stake. The longer the capex hose stays open and the more vehemently executives fuse their identities with the AI wave, the harder it will be to turn back. Megacap tech companies are expected to dedicate $215 billion to AI capital expenditures this year, and according to Goldman Sachs, another $250 billion in 2025.\n\nA slowdown in investment isn’t here yet. But we’ll be looking for clues on how long AI growth will last until company whims, preferences, and future spending start to reveal themselves on spreadsheets. It’s only a matter of time before the imagined productivity gains and “innovative AI use cases” come due.\n\nThe tight, symbiotic ecosystem of selling AI hardware suggests that as soon as Big Tech eases spending or pivots elsewhere, previously robust fundamentals might be destabilized.\n\nThe tech giants largely disappointed Wall Street last quarter. Only Meta came out with a clear victory. While reactions to earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) highlighted how heavy AI investment can become a liability, Zuckerberg showed that Wall Street doesn’t mind swelling capex, as long as every other part of the business is exceeding expectations. That’s a high bar to clear. And it will only get harder as the spending side of the ledger gets bigger without surefire revenue to offset it.\n\nSeeing past risk is a virtue at the top of the corporate ladder. So is suppressing bubble chatter. If the upward trajectory of chip stocks is a bellwether then the tech giants will continue to double down on their mega disbursements. That’s what we would expect from tenacious leadership. Even if everyone else is anxious for answers.\n\nStory continues\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Billionaire Ken Griffin's Top 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks: Are They Buys Now?",
        "content": "Ken Griffin subscribes to the theory that you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket. His Citadel hedge fund's portfolio includes over 5,800 holdings. How has this highly diversified strategy worked out for Griffin? Quite well, considering he's currently worth roughly $43 billion.\n\nWith such a big portfolio, it's not surprising that Griffin owns positions in many artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Here are his top three AI stocks -- and whether or not they're good picks to buy now.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ranks as the largest individual stock holding for Griffin and his third-largest holding overall (after two exchange-traded funds). As of June 30, 2024, his hedge fund owned 7.69 million shares of the e-commerce and cloud services giant worth around $1.49 billion. Griffin remains bullish about Amazon, increasing his stake in the stock by nearly 17% in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nAI permeates practically every part of Amazon's business. The company uses AI to recommend products for online buyers. Its Alexa is one of the most popular AI assistants. Amazon incorporates AI into its search, boosting e-commerce sales. AI helps the company optimize its warehouse operations. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a wide array of AI tools to customers.\n\nSure, Amazon (like several of its peers) seemed to be initially caught off-guard by the rapid rise of OpenAI's ChatGPT. AWS also faces stiff competition from Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud in providing cloud services.\n\nHowever, Griffin is smart to have invested so heavily in Amazon, in my opinion. The company is a leader in AI with the resources to remain among the strongest players. Despite the challenges from Microsoft and Google Cloud, AWS remains the top cloud services provider. I think Amazon stock is still one of the best AI picks around.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) trails behind Amazon as Griffin's second-largest individual stock holding. Citadel owned 5.47 million shares of the iPhone maker worth $1.15 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2024. This reflected aggressive buying by Griffin in Q2: He increased his hedge fund's position in Apple by 93%.\n\nI suspect that AI was a major reason why Griffin added so much to Citadel's stake in Apple. The company at long last introduced its generative AI capabilities, which it calls Apple Intelligence. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes that Apple Intelligence could ignite a supercycle of iPhone upgrades that provide a big tailwind for Apple.\n\nOthers aren't so optimistic, though. They think Apple's slow rollout of its generative AI features could backfire. Even if Apple Intelligence does drive incremental growth, much of it could already be baked into Apple's share price with the stock trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of close to 30.\n\nStory continues\n\nI agree to some extent with the skeptics who slam Apple's staggered introduction of its Apple Intelligence capabilities. My hunch is we won't see an overwhelming kick-off of an upgrade supercycle this year. However, I nonetheless expect iPhone sales will increase with momentum potentially accelerating in 2026 and 2027. Apple isn't a slam-dunk near-term pick, in my view, but it's still a stock worth buying for long-term investors.\n\n3. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) is Griffin's third-largest AI position and ranks in Citadel's top 10 holdings overall. At the end of Q2, the hedge fund owned 4.84 million shares of the semiconductor and infrastructure software company worth $776.7 million. Griffin increased Citadel's position in Broadcom by roughly 64% in Q2.\n\nAI is a huge growth driver for Broadcom. CEO Hock Tan said in September that the company expects to generate $12 billion from AI in fiscal year 2024. That estimate reflects 23% of Broadcom's projected total full-year revenue. The company has recently launched multiple new AI infrastructure products, including ethernet networking switches designed to accelerate AI workloads.\n\nHowever, Broadcom's growth story isn't as rosy as you might think. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of VMware, the company's revenue increased by only 4% year over year in the latest quarter.\n\nBut Griffin is bullish about Broadcom. So is Wall Street, with 27 of 29 analysts surveyed by LSEG in October recommending the stock as a \"buy\" or a \"strong buy.\" I agree with the consensus: Broadcom is a great AI stock to buy and hold.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Meet The Low-Cost Vanguard ETF That Has 20% Of Its Holdings in Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is surging once again, passing Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) to become the second most valuable U.S.-based company behind Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Nvidia's new Blackwell graphics processing unit architecture could deliver significant performance improvements and cost efficiency, which would be a win for Nvidia and its customers.\n\nFolks looking to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) could simply buy Nvidia stock as a catch-all way to play a rise in computing power demand. But there are also exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to consider.\n\nWith a more than 20% stake in Nvidia, Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), here's why the Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) stands out as an excellent way to invest in the semiconductor industry without racking up high fees. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe tech sector has evolved\n\nThe technology sector is, by far, the largest sector in the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) -- making up 31.7% of the index. One look at its top holdings and it is easy to see why.\n\nCompany Weight in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF Apple 16.2% Nvidia 14.1% Microsoft 13.9% Broadcom 4.4% Adobe 1.7% Salesforce 1.6% AMD 1.6% Oracle 1.6% Accenture 1.4% Cisco Systems 1.4%\n\nData source: Vanguard.\n\nApple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Broadcom have a combined market cap of over $10.5 trillion -- making the sector very top-heavy.\n\nAnd while the tech sector used to be dominated by software and hardware companies, semiconductors are now the largest industry within the sector, making up 28.9% of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF.\n\nSo, while investors could turn to pure-play semiconductor funds like the iShares Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SOXX), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may be a better long-term investment. For starters, the iShares Semiconductor ETF has a 0.35% expense ratio compared to just 0.1% for the Vanguard Information Technology ETF.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is also highly cyclical, making an ETF that focuses only on chip stocks volatile.\n\nWith the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, an investor gains access to the infrastructure and processing might that is powering AI, as well as AI-driven tools like those deployed by software companies Microsoft, Adobe, or Apple phones with AI chips.\n\nFactors to consider before buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a great way to invest in today's top tech companies. However, its greatest drawbacks are that it offers little exposure to smaller companies (given the size of the largest tech companies), and it leaves out some important names that you may think are in the tech sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Google's parent company, Alphabet, are in the communications sector. So you won't find these four names in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF.\n\nAmazon Web Services is the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure -- which is critical for running global AI models. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms has arguably been the single best example of a company investing heavily in AI (and buying a lot of Nvidia chips) and showing why those investments are paying off.\n\nVanguard offers a low-cost mega-cap growth fund that targets top growth stocks regardless of their sector. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF(NYSEMKT: MGK) may be a better fit for investors who want less exposure to tech stocks and better coverage of the largest growth stocks by market cap.\n\nLet ETFs work for you\n\nNvidia has captured the spotlight as the leader in AI innovation in the semiconductor space. Still, some investors may prefer AMD as an underdog that could take market share from Nvidia over time.\n\nMeanwhile, Broadcom offers a nice blend of value, growth, and income, given its diversified business and growing dividend.\n\nThe fact that the tech sector has a 20% weighting in these three stocks alone shows how valuable these companies have become. Buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a simple way to add to your exposure to these three names and the rest of the semiconductor industry. It's also an excellent way to avoid the risks of betting on a single company to invest in AI or another trend.\n\nThe best way to approach individual stocks and ETFs is to use them to suit your interests, investment objectives, and risk tolerance. Investors who closely follow the sector may prefer to build their tech portfolio around chip stocks and leave out the big software names. But folks looking for a low-cost passive approach may prefer the hands-off nature of simply buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and resting easy knowing it is chock-full of semiconductor stocks -- so they won't miss out if the industry continues to soar higher.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Amazon's Latest Healthcare Move Could Be a Big Problem for Walgreens and CVS",
        "content": "Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has been showing a lot of interest in healthcare in recent years. It launched an online pharmacy in 2020, and last year, it acquired primary care company One Medical. It also got into telehealth before abandoning that business. But one thing's for sure: Healthcare is on the tech giant's radar.\n\nRetail pharmacy giants Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) and CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) have been struggling in recent years, but the looming threat from Amazon hasn't crippled their businesses by any means -- at least not yet. But Amazon's latest move does have the potential to drastically cut into their retail operations.\n\nAmazon is expanding same-day prescription delivery\n\nOn Oct. 9, Amazon announced that it would be opening more pharmacies across the country, and that it would offer free prescription delivery in 20 new markets next year, which more than doubles its footprint. By the end of next year, Amazon says that 45% of people in the U.S. will be able to get same-day delivery for prescriptions. And the company says that in most cases, people can order by 4 p.m. and still receive their prescription the same day.\n\nAmazon already provides customers with plenty of incentives to use its website, as it offers lots of savings on medications. Prime members can also sign up for RxPass, which, for $5 per month, gives customers access to many common generic medications, with free delivery included. By expanding the number of markets where same-day delivery is offered, that could incentivize customers to sign up for Prime and RxPass as well.\n\nWhy this could spell trouble for Walgreens and CVS\n\nNews of Amazon expanding its prescription delivery business could hurt sales at Walgreens and CVS stores, which rely heavily on foot traffic. There was a lot of traffic at the stores during the early stages of the pandemic when people were going there to receive vaccinations, so business was good for the pharmacy retailers. The stores are conveniently located for customers, making it easy for someone to quickly go to a store, pick up prescriptions, and perhaps buy other items on the same trip.\n\nBut if Amazon gives consumers less of a reason to go to their neighborhood pharmacies and instead they just utilize same-day delivery through its site, that could drastically undercut the traffic that Walgreens and CVS rely on. Even though it's just a prescription, that's a big reason why a customer might go to a pharmacy retailer in the first place. Offering quicker delivery in more markets has the potential to put a significant dent in the top lines for both Walgreens and CVS, which have already been coming under pressure of late.\n\nStory continues WBA Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) ChartWBA Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts\n\nHas Amazon become a better healthcare play than Walgreens and CVS?\n\nWalgreens stock is down more than 65% this year as its retail pharmacy operations are struggling to grow and margins remain razor thin. CVS is down only 14%, but its business is broader than Walgreens and doesn't rely entirely on pharmacy operations. But both companies are facing considerable challenges these days, and news of Amazon intensifying its competition isn't going to help.\n\nAmazon has arguably become a better healthcare play these days, as its operations are leaner, and by expanding its pharmacy operations, it can potentially unlock a big growth opportunity for its business. And by offering customers more of an incentive to sign up for Prime, that can lead to greater all-around revenue growth for Amazon, beyond just revenue for its pharmacy operations.\n\nFor investors looking for a good growth stock to own, Amazon is hands down the better option these days than either CVS or Walgreens, even if your focus is on healthcare.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $806,459!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Buying Up This Millionaire-Maker Stock",
        "content": "Wall Street works for everyone, but some of the ultra-wealthy billionaires seem to have a certain aura about them, as if they have some inside track on the market's pulse. These folks tend to manage money for clients or themselves and, because the amount they manage is so large, they are required to maintain some transparency by filing quarterly 13F filings to reveal their recent trades. These filings give individual investors clues about what the market's big money is focused on.\n\nInvestors should always make their investing decisions based on their own needs, but it's at least noteworthy when Wall Street's billionaires start piling into a stock. The most recent 13F filings revealed one hot stock still trading at roughly the same price it did when billionaires were likely buying it. This company has already made millions for investors, which shows that even billionaires keep it simple.\n\nHere is the millionaire-making stock and why it's still a great long-term opportunity today, whether you are a billionaire or not.\n\nBillionaires are scooping up Amazon\n\nTech giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't some bold, new stock idea. It probably won't impress your co-workers when you sling ideas around at the office. Yet, billionaires are keeping it simple and scooping up shares anyway. According to 13F filing data, several billionaire investors bought shares of Amazon during the quarter ending June 30, 2024:\n\nName Fund Managed Net Worth Amazon Shares Added Ken Fisher Fisher Asset Management $11 billion 1.21 million Ray Dalio Bridgewater Associates $14 billion 1.6 million Paul Tudor Jones Tudor Investment $8 billion 72,609 Ken Griffin Citadel Advisors $43 billion 1.11 million John Overdeck Two Sigma Advisers $7 billion 216,400\n\nSource: 13F filings on Hedge Follow and net worth data from Forbes.\n\nIt's important to remember that 13F filings show what happened months ago. The risk is that investors are working on outdated information. A billionaire could have bought and sold the stock long before the next 13F filings come out. Amazon stock did bounce and dip a bit over the past few months, so maybe they sold for profits. Maybe they held the stock. Perhaps they added more. That's not the point. AMZN Chart\n\nThe more important takeaway is that Amazon's valuation hasn't changed much since April. Everyone, even billionaires, has individual opinions and agendas. Instead, focus on what might have attracted them to Amazon in the first place.\n\nContinued growth ahead for Amazon's core businesses\n\nAs alluded to before, Amazon is a well-known company, and it's arguably a less-exciting stock because everyone knows it. Yet, the company's returns over time have been anything but bland. Thanks to sustained growth in e-commerce first, then in cloud computing services, the stock has turned modest sums into generational wealth over the past few decades.\n\nToday, Amazon is the leader in both of its core business segments. The company has an estimated 40% market share of e-commerce in the U.S. and an estimated 31% share of the global cloud services market, where it competes with Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, among others.\n\nThe great thing about Amazon's core businesses is that they ride massive long-term growth trends that still have room to run. E-commerce is still only 16% of total U.S. retail spending. Companies are still migrating their computer systems to the cloud, and the arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) only adds to that. According to Goldman Sachs, the cloud computing market could grow to $2 trillion by 2030. This doesn't even factor in emerging business opportunities, such as Amazon's advertising segment, which is on track to do roughly $50 billion in revenue this year and growing at 20%.\n\nIt's still a strong buy today\n\nYou can value a stock in several ways, but since Amazon invests so much of its profits back into the business, I like to look at the cash flow generated by its day-to-day activities and base its valuation on that.\n\nBelow, you can see the ratio of Amazon's price to its operating cash flow: AMZN Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\nIts current ratio of 18.5 is near Amazon's decade-low point. In other words, it's about as good a time as any in the past 10 years to buy Amazon stock. This assumes that Amazon invests its cash flow wisely, but the company has a strong record here, with an average return on invested capital of 10.9% over the past decade.\n\nSo, to sum up the stock's appeal, you could say that Amazon is a great business that trades at a great price. Sometimes, it's as simple as that, whether you are a billionaire or not.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.\n\nRising Market Volatility\n\nVolatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market.\n\nA report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds and David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy.\n\nWhile expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells.\n\nThe economist maintains we are marching on ice that’s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September.\n\n“It’s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,” he said. “That’s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.”\n\n“But there’s been some cracks in the business cycle,” he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at “super high” levels.\n\nA slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election.\n\nWhile the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Historically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,” Cohen said.\n\nAlthough there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows.\n\nAI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta’s share price surge due to strong sales growth.\n\nAnalysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value.\n\nPixabay/ Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst’s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 308\n\nAnalyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 20.45%\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a market leader in cloud computing and e-commerce retail, affirming its long-term growth prospects. The company generates a significant chunk of its revenues from e-commerce, with a market share of 37.6%.\n\nCloud computing is increasingly becoming an essential piece of the puzzle amid artificial intelligence, as the company has a market share of 31% in the multibillion-dollar industry. The segment posted an 18.8% revenue increase in Q2 and has reported 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters.\n\nLikewise, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is diversifying its operations into the fiercely competitive streaming service ad-supported market. As the US tech giant intensifies its push into ad-funded streaming services, it plans to introduce more ads across its popular TV series and films on Prime Video in the upcoming year.\n\nBy the end of the year, Amazon is expected to have $127.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, which will be three times its 2018 total. It is also expected to have nearly $400 billion in cash by 2027, far exceeding its competitors in the Big Tech sector.\n\nThis is an incredible transformation for a business known for operating on thin margins, reinvesting most of its profits, and having comparatively little cash compared to its peers.\n\nRecord profits from cloud computing, advertising, and increased efficiency, including cost reduction, are the main drivers of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ‘s cash increase. S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that the company’s free cash flow will almost double from $36.8 billion last year to $70.8 billion in 2025.\n\nAfter other tech companies like Alphabet and Meta began giving back more of their cash to shareholders earlier this year, there was a surge in hopes for an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) dividend or at least more share buybacks in recent quarters. Likewise, analysts on Wall Street rate the stock as a Buy with an average price target of $222.95, implying 20.45% upside potential from current levels. According to our Insider Monkey database, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 with total stakes amounting to $65.85 billion.\n\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 8th on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Nvidia is set to dominate another Big Tech earnings season",
        "content": "We’re rolling into what is expected to be another wild tech earnings season, and you can bet AI is going to be front and center. And if there’s one company that everyone is watching, it’s Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nShares of the chip giant are up more than 16% in the last month, and the stock is currently on pace to unseat Apple as the largest publicly traded company by market capitalization.\n\nThe jump comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for the company’s upcoming Blackwell chip is “insane” during an interview with CNBC on Oct. 3. Since then, shares of Nvidia have climbed roughly 18%, topping out at $130. But reports that the Biden administration will establish a cap on the number of AI chips that can be shipped to certain countries put the rally on hold Tuesday before recovering some ground Wednesday.\n\nNvidia’s incredible stock performance and meteoric rise in data center sales over the last year have put the company in a difficult position for its upcoming earnings announcement, which it has yet to officially schedule. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during his keynote address at Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif. on March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn the company’s fiscal Q3 2024, overall revenue soared 206% to $18.1 billion, while data center revenue rose a whopping 279% to $14.5 billion. And while Nvidia isn’t staring down a decline in revenue, its growth will likely slow versus the same period last year, which could spook investors.\n\nDon’t believe me? Just take a look at what happened after the company announced its Q2 earnings back in August. While the company beat on revenue and earnings per share, with data center revenue increasing 154% year over year to $26.3 billion, Nvidia shares still fell more than 6% immediately following the announcement. It took more than a month for the company’s stock price to recover.\n\nThe AI trade hasn’t raised all ships, either. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) jumped 59% year to date, outpacing the broader S&P 500 (GSPC), which rose 21%. Qualcomm (QCOM) climbed 19% and AMD (AMD) added just 6% to its stock price. Intel (INTC), meanwhile, fell a stunning 55%.\n\nBroadcom benefits from its involvement in AI infrastructure, connecting servers and the like, while Qualcomm is seen as a potential beneficiary of on-device AI growth via AI smartphones and AI PCs. AMD is facing off against Nvidia and serves as an alternative on both price and availability.\n\nThen there’s Intel, which is struggling amid its enormous turnaround effort that includes building out its third-party chip fabrication capabilities as well as trying to catch Nvidia and AMD in the AI processor space.\n\nBut Nvidia is still the hands-down star of the show this earnings season. Investors will be looking for signs of continued AI spending from hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN), which make up a huge portion of AI sales, to get a sense of how well Nvidia chips are selling.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey’ll also look at how other chip companies perform this quarter ahead of Nvidia’s announcement, which tends to be far later in the earnings cycle than its contemporaries.\n\nWall Street will similarly be on the lookout for information about Nvidia’s Blackwell rollout and whether the company is facing any supply constraints as it did with its Hopper chips. Either way, it’s going to be a wild few weeks. Buckle up. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. (yahoofinance)\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on the Magnificent Seven Stocks Plus Netflix.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other magnificent stocks in Jim Cramer's list.\n\nOn Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the ongoing success of major technology stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven. He noted that these companies are proving their resilience in the market, no matter the circumstances, likening their performance to having a unique \"Poltergeist 2 magic.\"\n\nCramer pointed out that this latest rally for the Magnificent Seven differs from previous ones, as it is not merely a zero-sum game where gains for one group come at the expense of another. Instead, other sectors are also thriving, likely due to the influx of capital into the market.\n\n“Unlike previous Mag 7 rallies, this one’s definitely not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can roar, too, in this market, perhaps because there’s just a lot of money going around.”\n\nHe noted that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts mean that cash is losing value, creating an environment ripe for growth. He mentioned that the staying power of the Magnificent Seven is truly unbelievable.\n\n“We know these stocks will once again be hit by endless worries, giving you more opportunities to buy and more weakness before they snap right back and start climbing all over again.”\n\nCramer highlighted that this week marks the beginning of a crucial four-week earnings season, emphasizing that these quarterly reports hold significant weight for investors and the broader stock market. He acknowledged the current climate of anxiety, especially following the market's impressive rally. He added:\n\n“Why stress about how quickly the Fed will cut rates, Oh? God, I'm sick of that. What matters is they're giving vast swaths of the economy a big boost and I doubt they'll stop anytime soon.”\n\nCramer also observed that investors often gravitate toward underdogs in the market, suggesting that banks could be the next promising sector. In addition to banks, Cramer also mentioned the potential in pharmaceutical stocks, suggesting that investors might want to consider major players in that sector as well.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of stocks that were discussed by Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nCramer thinks that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has various growth avenues, especially AWS. He said:\n\n“Amazon's easy. It got hammered down from $187 to $161 after that last quarter, but it's back above $187 now. I think the company simply has too many levers, including the incredible growth for the Amazon Web Services, which [can] take it back, I think, to its $200 high.”\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the most famous global technology companies and it specializes in online retail, advertising, and subscription services. A significant aspect of its operations is its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has emerged as a crucial source of operating profit. Over the past year, AWS has seen accelerating sales growth, reflecting a broader trend as businesses increasingly migrate their data systems to the cloud.\n\nThe transition is particularly relevant as companies seek to leverage artificial intelligence tools, presenting substantial opportunities for Amazon's future expansion. In the second quarter, AWS reported sales of $26.3 billion, marking a 19% increase compared to the previous year. Alongside its cloud segment, the company has also identified advertising as a key growth area. In the same quarter, revenue from advertising services rose by 20% year-over-year, slightly outpacing the growth experienced by AWS.\n\nRecently, on October 10, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) revealed that its Prime Big Deal Days event set new records for October shopping events. This year, a greater number of Prime members participated compared to the previous year, taking advantage of early holiday promotions. The two-day event kicked off the holiday shopping season with record sales, surpassing all previous October events in terms of items sold.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on Jim Cramer's list of magnificent stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Amazon is joining Google and Microsoft in going big on nuclear power",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is joining its artificial intelligence competitors in the race for nuclear energy.\n\nThe tech giant has signed three agreements “to support the development of nuclear energy projects,” it said Wednesday. The agreements include building “several” small modular reactors (SMRs). These “advanced” nuclear reactors have “a smaller physical footprint, allowing them to be built closer to the grid,” Amazon said. And compared with traditional reactors, SMRs can be put online faster because construction takes less time.\n\n“Nuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040,” Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, said in a statement.\n\nGarman said the investment in nuclear energy is “an important area of investment for Amazon,” because it is “both carbon-free and able to scale.”\n\nAmazon’s agreement with Washington-based Energy Northwest will produce four advanced SMRs that will be built, owned, and operated by the utilities consortium. The tech giant is also investing in SMR reactors and fuel developer X-energy, it said. X-energy’s design for advanced nuclear reactors will be used for Amazon’s project with Energy Northwest.\n\nUnder Amazon’s agreement with Virginia-based Dominion Energy (D), the companies will develop an SMR near the utility company’s North Anna Nuclear Generating Station.\n\nAI ambitions are hindering sustainability goals\n\nWhile the AI boom has boosted revenues for major tech companies, the technology’s massive demand for energy is hindering climate change efforts.\n\nOne query on ChatGPT needs almost 10 times as much electricity as a Google (GOOGL) search, according to a study by Goldman Sachs (GS). In April, Ami Badani, chief marketing officer of British chip designer Arm (ARM), said data centers powering AI chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT account for 2% of global electricity consumption. That demand, Badani said, could eventually slow down AI progress.\n\nIn July, Google said its carbon emissions have risen by 48% since 2019, mostly due to energy consumption by data centers and supply chain emissions. The company’s carbon emissions were up 13% year over year in 2023, according to its 2024 Environmental Report.\n\nIn the report, Google said it was “no longer maintaining operational carbon neutrality” and would turn to other “carbon solutions and partnerships” to reach its 2021 goal of reaching net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030.\n\nIn 2020, Microsoft (MSFT) set a similar goal to be “carbon negative” by the end of the decade. But in May, the company said its carbon emissions were almost 31% higher than in 2020, according to its 2024 Environmental Sustainability Report. That jump was mostly due to building data centers for AI, Microsoft said, as well as due to AI hardware such as semiconductors and servers.\n\n“Our challenges are in part unique to our position as a leading cloud supplier that is expanding its datacenters,” Microsoft said in a statement. “But, even more, we reflect the challenges the world must overcome to develop and use greener concrete, steel, fuels, and chips.”\n\nData centers, which are in demand as companies continue developing larger, more powerful models, could consume up to 9% of electricity in the U.S. by 2030 — more than double what is being used now, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.\n\nBig Tech is hungry for nuclear energy\n\nTech giants are taking notice of their growing carbon footprints.\n\nIn July, the Wall Street Journal (NWS) reported that a third of the U.S.’s nuclear power plants were discussing deals with tech companies to supply electricity for data centers.\n\nAmong them was Amazon, which was reportedly closing in on a deal to use electricity from Constellation Energy (CEG) — the owner of most of the country’s power plants.\n\nIn Amazon’s announcement Wednesday, it said it had made an agreement with Talen Energy “to co-locate a data center facility next to” the company’s Pennsylvania-based nuclear facility.\n\nEarlier this week, Google announced it had signed “the world’s first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy” from SMRs developed by California-based Kairos Power.\n\nGoogle said it expects to bring Kairos Power’s first SMR online by the end of the decade. Other reactors will be deployed through 2035. Through the deal, 500 megawatts (MW) of 24/7 carbon-free power will be available to U.S. electricity grids.\n\nIn September, Microsoft and Constellation announced a 20-year power purchase agreement that would restart the Unit 1 reactor on Three Mile Island — close to the site of one of the worst nuclear power plant accidents ever in the U.S. Through the deal, which will launch the Crane Clean Energy Center (CCEC), Microsoft will purchase energy from the Unit 1 reactor as part of its sustainability goal.\n\nThe CCEC, which is expected to come online by 2028, will add more than 800 MW of carbon-free electricity to the power grid, a study by the Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council found.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon, Google tap into nuclear power to fuel data centers and AI push",
        "content": "Amazon on Wednesday announced plans to invest in nuclear power production to fuel its data centers with clean energy, a key part of the e-commerce giant's push to expand AI-powered services.\n\n\"Nuclear energy is safe, reliable, and can help meet the energy needs of our customers for decades to come,\" said Kevin Miller, Amazon Web Services' vice president of global data centers in a statement. The company has a goal to achieve net-zero carbon — where the amount of greenhouse gases produced equals the amount removed from the atmosphere — across its operations by 2040.\n\nAmazon is the latest tech giant to turn to nuclear power as a source of clean energy as the demand for more power in data centers grows. Earlier this week, Google announced its partnership with California-based Kairos Power, in which Google plans to buy power produced from small nuclear reactors built by Kairos. The first reactor is scheduled to be running by 2030.\n\nAnd last month Microsoft announced an agreement with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, in which the facility would be brought back online to produce energy for Microsoft.\n\nAmazon is partnering with Dominion Energy Virginia, Energy Northwest and Talen Energy to explore new efforts to advance nuclear energy, including the development of smaller and faster nuclear reactors. The company is also investing in Maryland-based X-Energy Reactor Company, which announced on Wednesday it's raised $500 million in financing.\n\nRobert Blue, chair, president and chief executive of Dominion Energy, called the partnership an \"important step forward\" that would fuel the development of \"carbon-free power generation in Virginia,\" according to a news release from the company.\n\nThe partnerships come as tech companies face more demands for electricity because of the race to build more AI services that can generate text, images and other content. Tech giants, which already invest in solar and wind technologies, are searching for new sources of clean energy amid growing pressure to limit the greenhouse gas emissions they produce as they expand their AI products. These gasses trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to rising temperatures.\n\nA query on OpenAI's ChatGPT, on average, requires nearly 10 times as much electricity to process as a Google search, according to Goldman Sachs. Analysts for the firm estimate that the power needed to run data centers, where large-scale computing operations are done to support a variety of tech services, will grow 160% by 2030.\n\nTotal electricity consumption of data centers could reach more than 1,000 terawatt-hours in 2026, more than doubling the usage in 2022, according to estimates from the International Energy Agency.\n\nAmazon's announcement drew praise from lawmakers and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm as the United States pursues a goal of being completely dependent on clean electricity by 2035.\n\nIn July, Amazon said it hit its goal of powering its global operations, including its data centers, with 100% renewable energy in 2023, seven years ahead of its target of 2030.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Cameco, Denison Mines, and Energy Fuels Stocks All Popped on Wednesday",
        "content": "Uranium mining stocks surged higher on Wednesday, with industry bellwether Cameco(NYSE: CCJ) rising 8.2% through 2:11 p.m. ET, Denison Mines(NYSEMKT: DNN) doing even better with a 14.7% gain, and smaller Energy Fuels(NYSEMKT: UUUU) performing best of all -- up 17%.\n\nInvestors are betting on a resurgence in demand for nuclear energy, and their optimism is not without reason as tech giants like Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) are placing multibillion-dollar bets on the sector.\n\nWhat's going on with nuclear power?\n\nLast month, Microsoft ignited the rally in nuclear stocks when it signed a power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy(NASDAQ: CEG) under which the latter will reopen Unit 1 of its Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. Microsoft needs extra power to run the servers at its Azure business unit, and thinks nuclear might be the best way to produce that power in a carbon-free way.\n\nMomentum in the sector picked up this week with announcements from first Alphabet and then Amazon that they, too, are looking to nuclear energy to power their data centers.\n\nAlphabet's Google business is partnering with privately held Kairos Power to open a series of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Totaling only 500 megawatts (MW) in power production capacity, the Google news is only half as big as Microsoft's. (Full-scale nuclear power plants generally generate power in the gigawatt range). But that's not why the Google news is significant. It's backing an entirely new kind of nuclear power plants -- SMRs, which are expected to be both cheaper and faster to build than traditional plants.\n\nIn theory, that could drive demand for nuclear energy -- and for uranium to fuel it -- faster than simply building more gigawatt-scale power plants would do. It's this prospect that lies behind the strong interest in uranium producer stocks Wednesday.\n\nEnthusiasm only grew greater Wednesday morning when Amazon announced plans to partner with Energy Northwest, Dominion Energy(NYSE: D), and privately held X-energy to build four SMRs in the state of Washington and at least one in Virginia. Combined, these projects promise to bring at least 620 megawatts of nuclear power online -- and potentially more than 1 gigawatt, equivalent to a full-scale nuclear power plant.\n\nShould you buy uranium stocks now?\n\nBut should you be buying uranium stocks in the middle of a uranium stock-buying frenzy? While I'm bullish on the prospects for the nuclear power industry in general and am finding validation for that bullishness in all this recent news, I still think the answer to this question is ... maybe, but tread carefully and watch the valuations.\n\nWith a market cap of less than $2 billion even after this latest share price surge, Denison Mines is arguably the cheapest of these three stocks, trading at \"only\" 47 times trailing earnings. Denison also has no debt on its balance sheet, and $93 million in cash -- which is good news, because it will need it. It's currently burning cash at the rate of $28 million a year, and isn't expected to turn free cash flow positive until 2028, according to the analysts who follow it.\n\nCameco is a horse of a different color. Valued at more than $24 billion currently, it is easily the most valuable stock in this sector. On the other hand, it trades at a staggering 129 times trailing earnings. Cameco is both profitable and free cash flow positive, and analysts expect its profits to roughly triple over the next five years. Still, with a valuation that's 27.5 times its forecast earnings in 2028, it's hard to call the stock cheap.\n\nAnd Energy Fuels? With a $1.3 billion market cap, Energy Fuels is only a little less expensive than Denison. Analysts hope Energy Fuels turns profitable next year, and begins generating free cash flow in 2027. It's unprofitable today, however, and in its 25-year history, it hasn't ever generated positive free cash flow.\n\nWhile Energy Fuels stock looks speculative to me, it possesses cash reserves that should be sufficient to last until its free cash flow turns positive. In a momentum-driven market where none of these stocks looks cheap by the traditional valuation metrics of price to earnings, or price to free cash flow, tiny Energy Fuels might turn out to be the best performer of all.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Amazon said Wednesday it has signed three agreements to develop nuclear power projects, making the e-commerce giant the latest Big Tech firm to announce nuclear deals in recent weeks amid a surge in demand for energy to power artificial intelligence.\n\nThe company inked deals with public utility conglomerate Energy Northwest and developer X-Energy to build several small modular reactors (SMRs) in the region, and made an agreement with Dominion Energy in Virginia to explore the development of another SMR to boost power in that area.\n\n\"Nuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040,\" Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman said in a statement announcing the deals. Amazon is the second major U.S. tech firm to announce investments in nuclear power this week.\n\n\"One of the fastest ways to address climate change is by transitioning our society to carbon-free energy sources, and nuclear energy is both carbon-free and able to scale—which is why it’s an important area of investment for Amazon,\" Garman continued. \"Our agreements will encourage the construction of new nuclear technologies that will generate energy for decades to come.\"\n\nClean Tech, Ai Boom Straining Us Energy Supply\n\nAmazon is the second major U.S. tech firm to announce investments in nuclear power this week, after Google on Monday said it signed a deal with Kairos Power to bring Kairos' first small modular reactor online by 2030, followed by additional deployments through 2035.\n\nRead On The Fox Business App Google on Monday announced its own agreement investing in the development of nuclear power.\n\n\"We feel like nuclear can play an important role in helping to meet our demand... cleanly in a way that's more around the clock,\" Michael Terrell, senior director for energy and climate at Google, told reporters on a call.\n\nTechnology firms have signed several recent agreements with nuclear power companies this year as artificial intelligence boosts power demand for the first time in decades.\n\nNuclear Energy Is The Answer To Powering Ai Data Centers: Kyle Wool\n\nIn March, Amazon purchased a nuclear-powered datacenter from Talen Energy. Last month, Microsoft and Constellation Energy signed a power deal to help resurrect a unit of the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, the site of the worst U.S. nuclear accident in 1979. Microsoft announced last month it signed a deal to reopen the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania.\n\nU.S. data center power use is expected to roughly triple between 2023 and 2030 and will require about 47 gigawatts of new generation capacity, according to Goldman Sachs estimates, which assumed natural gas, wind and solar power would fill the gap.\n\nStory continues\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Amazon signs nuclear power deals, following Google, Microsoft\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon to power electric vans with mini-nuclear reactors",
        "content": "Amazon is exploring sustainable energy sources to power its delivery vans\n\nAmazon has become the latest tech giant to embrace mini-nuclear reactors as the online retailer seeks to power a growing fleet of electric trucks and data centres.\n\nThe American group, founded by Jeff Bezos, said on Wednesday it had led a $500m (£380m) funding round in small modular reactor (SMR) technology being developed by Maryland-based X-energy.\n\nIt is also backing two SMR projects in the states of Virginia and Washington.\n\nIn a promotional video, Amazon said the power generated from SMRs could be used to “meet the power needs for a growing global economy, and new needs like the electrification of the vehicle fleet and the power needs of artificial intelligence”.\n\nThe deal comes after Google agreed to buy the world’s first private mini-nuclear reactors and Microsoft struck an agreement to restart a mothballed reactor in Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania.\n\nAmazon made the investment alongside Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of the US hedge fund Citadel, the University of Michigan and US investment fund Ares Management, which has invested in Chelsea Football Club.\n\nIt has also agreed to support X-energy’s first project to build a 320-megawatt SMR for a consortium of utility providers in Washington, along with more than five gigawatts of further schemes across the US by 2039 should that prove a success.\n\nIn Virginia, Amazon said it had an agreement with Dominion Energy, the utility company, to look at building a 300-megawatt SMR.\n\nDominion has invited technology providers to bid for the scheme.\n\nThe scramble to back new nuclear power projects comes as the power-hungry tech industry searches for carbon-free, stable electricity to feed a growing array of data centres as well as electric vehicles.\n\n‘Safe source of carbon-free energy’\n\nMatt Garman, the chief executive of Amazon Web Services, said: “Nuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040.\n\n“One of the fastest ways to address climate change is by transitioning our society to carbon-free energy sources, and nuclear energy is both carbon-free and able to scale, which is why it’s an important area of investment for Amazon.\n\n“Our agreements will encourage the construction of new nuclear technologies that will generate energy for decades to come.”\n\nThe coming rise in data centre capacity is expected to push US electricity demand 15pc to 20pc higher over the next decade, according to the federal government.\n\nStory continues\n\nData centres, which are used for data storage and artificial intelligence software, are expected to account for 9pc of electricity generation annually by the end of the decade, up from 4pc last year.\n\nAmazon, which spans internet shopping, e-books publishing, data storage, video streaming and bricks and mortar retail, has pledged to cater for all of its electricity needs with clean power by 2030.\n\nSMRs are seen as a potential breakthrough in nuclear technology because they could be built quicker and cheaper than traditional, large reactors.  The “modules” used to construct them would be mass-produced in factories, transported to sites and then clicked together.\n\nClay Sell, the chief executive of X-energy, said on Wednesday: “To fully realise the opportunities available through artificial intelligence, we must bring clean, safe, and reliable electrons onto the grid with proven technologies that can scale and grow with demand.\n\n“We deeply appreciate our earliest funders and collaborators, notably the US Department of Energy and Dow Inc.\n\n“With Amazon, Ken Griffin, and our other strategic investors, we are now uniquely suited to deliver on this transformative vision for the future of energy and tech.”",

        "title": "Intel and AMD Join Forces to Combat ARM's Dominance",
        "content": "Oct. 16, 2024 - Today Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) decided to team up in response to the rising challenge from ARM Holdings in the semiconductor industry. This collaboration will improve software compatibility across their x86-based chips in response to escalating performance of ARM holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) that erode the market share of both companies.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with INTC.\n\nThe x86 architecture is the dominant computing architecture used in laptops, PCs, and data center servers. Intel invented it, and AMD licensed it. Then suddenly ARM came with its computing architecture and presented a competition to both companies by successfully partnering with important clients like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nARM has gained market share due to its energy efficiency and software compatibility. Intel and AMD can't just sit back and watch, they need to do something.\n\nIntel and AMD decided to team up and improve their quality by addressing the same issue they face: compatibility. Intel and AMD use the same x86 architecture but their chips may require software tweaks to work seamlessly together. So, to address this issue, Intel and AMD made an advisory group that consists of leading industry players such as Broadcom, Dell Technologies, Lenovo Group, and Oracle to ensure consistency and compatibility across their chips. So the plan is: Intel and AMD will improve their compatibility and the advisory group will give them feedback.\n\nRecently, Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger stressed that x86 remains very active in the modern world of computing and has great potential for its development in the context of AI. He further stated that scalability has been a unique selling proposition of the architecture stating that x86 still has serious prospects of further advancement.\n\nARM Holdings has significantly impacted the semiconductor industry, particularly in the mobile and embedded markets by its architecture that has eroded the market share of traditional x86 giants like Intel and AMD. Here's why:\n\nEnergy Efficiency: Energy efficiency is the power that ARM possesses that Intel and AMD have struggled with. The architecture is ideal for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets and has high compatibility for embedded systems like IoT devices like smartwatches, and automotive electronics. Licensing Model: AMR's licensing model provides broader flexibility for the clients compared to the traditional way of purchasing chips from Intel or AMD. Ecosystem and Software: ARM's architecture gains support from the open-source communities as they build a robust ecosystem that attracts developers and encourages the creation of applications and solutions specifically for ARM-based platforms. So the support not only comes from the employees but also from the technology community they built. Market Penetration: After successfully penetrating the mobile device market, ARM expanded to other markets like data centers and servers too.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Ken Griffin, Amazon Invest in Next-Generation Nuclear Energy",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. and billionaire financier Ken Griffin are among the backers anchoring a $500 million investment in small nuclear reactors, a burgeoning technology that has been heralded as the next era for atomic energy.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nInside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City How Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure Mexico Seeks to Halve Permitting Time to Attract More Factories What It Takes to Make City Solutions Go Viral\n\nThe Seattle-based company has signed agreements to develop the new breed of reactors — dubbed small modular reactors, or SMRs — in both Washington and Virginia, investing in in X-Energy, a privately-held advanced nuclear reactor developer.\n\nThe financing will help pay for the development of more than 5 gigawatts of new power projects coming online across the US by 2039, X-Energy said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nAmazon’s announcement comes as technology companies are searching for new energy supplies to power massive data centers needed to run artificial intelligence systems. Alphabet Inc.’s Google announced Monday it was backing the nuclear power, and signed an agreement with Kairos Power to construct a series of SMRs that use molten-salt cooling technology.\n\n“Nuclear energy is both carbon-free and able to scale, which is why it’s an important area of investment for Amazon,” Matt Garman, chief executive officer of Amazon Web Services, said in a statement. “Our agreements will encourage the construction of new nuclear technologies that will generate energy for decades to come.”\n\nData center expansion and other factors, are expected to drive electricity demand up by 15% to 20% over the next decade, according to the Energy Department. Data centers could consume as much as 9% of US electricity generation annually by 2030, up from 4% of total load in 2023, according to a report in May by the nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute.\n\nAmazon, which is poised to discuss the investment Wednesday morning at its offices in Crystal City, Virginia, has also signed agreements with Washington-based utility Energy Northwest and Virginia’s Dominion Energy, Inc. to develop SMR projects. Amazon said the reactors, which will be constructed, owned and operated by Energy Northwest, were expected to generate roughly 320 megawatts, with the option to expand to 960 megawatts total. In Virginia, Amazon said it had signed an agreement with Dominion to explore the development of an SMR project at the utility’s existing North Anna nuclear power station that could bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the region.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnlike traditional nuclear reactors, which average roughly 1,000 megawatts in size, SMRs can be built at factories, delivered by truck or train, and then assembled on-site, saving time and money. Utilities can install just one or bundle several together, expanding the potential market by including countries that don’t need a big conventional nuclear plant.\n\nStill, the technology hasn’t yet been deployed at scale, commercially.\n\nAnd SMR’s have their critics, including those who say the economics of nuclear power is flawed no matter what the size of the reactors. NuScale Power Corp. announced in November it was canceling plans to build a series of SMRs in Utah amid surging costs.\n\nMeanwhile, surging demand for power is prompting utilities to build more natural gas-fired plants, undermining lofty environmental goals for both the industry and tech firms.\n\n“Artificial intelligence may be new, but claims that the next revolutionary nuclear technology will solve our energy problems have been around since we first split the atom,” Johanna Neumann, an official with Environment America, said in a statement. “It’s time for Big Tech to recommit to solutions that work and pose less risk to our environment and health, including making data centers as energy efficient as possible and committing them to be powered by new renewable energy sources.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man How Starbucks’ Colorful, Sugary Drinks Turned Kids Into Customers for Life The World’s Central Banks Aren’t Following the Fed’s Lead Anymore A Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work When a Miracle Cure Is Left on the Shelf\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

It will allow users to see the color of book titles and to add different colored highlights to text.\n\nThe retail giant has been criticized for not having a color e-reader, especially as many of its competitors have color models on the market. An article from Inverse in May claimed new color e-readers from Kobo (RKUNY) and Clara were proof that “Amazon’s Kindle is falling behind.”\n\nAmazon has been generally conservative with Kindle products, changing them slightly but not doing major overhauls. So the Colorsoft is something customers have long been hoping for, especially those who like to read graphic novels and comics on the devices.\n\nAmazon also released AI features for the Kindle Scribe. “The all-new, built-in AI-powered notebook enables you to quickly summarize pages and pages of notes into concise bullets in a script font that can be easily shared directly from the notebook tab,” Amazon said.\n\nThe Kindle Paperwhite, the company’s most popular product in the line, also got an upgrade — it’s thinner than ever and maintains its impressive three months of battery life. And all Kindle device pages will now turn 25% faster.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Tenacious Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "There are many ways to make a million dollars in the stock market, but one method is more reliable than the rest.\n\nHistory shows that patient investors can build a million-dollar portfolio with the help of modest annual returns over a long time. This is a good description of master investor Warren Buffett's strategy, and an even better fit for index fund legend John Bogle. So if you're looking for a million-dollar investment idea, you should really search for companies and stocks that can stay relevant and financially healthy for decades to come.\n\nOn that note, I'd like to introduce you to three tenacious stocks that can carry that heavy weight. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN),  International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM), and Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) should at least match the stock market's average returns for the foreseeable future. Making steady investments in these robust stocks could make you a millionaire over time.\n\nThe secret sauce of durable winners\n\nThe most important quality in long-term business empires is flexibility. My three picks are very different examples of this trait:\n\nIBM has been around for more than a hundred years. What started as a maker of punch-card calculators evolved into a mainframe computing powerhouse and a PC systems pioneer. Now, IBM is leaning into the big-ticket opportunities of cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) services. Berkshire was once a large manufacturer of fabrics. Buffett liquidated its textile mills to finance takeovers in various fields. Today, it's a giant of the insurance, manufacturing, transportation, and consumer goods industries with deep interests in other areas. iPhone maker Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been Berkshire's largest holding since 2018. Amazon started as a pure online bookseller, managed in founder Jeff Bezos' garage. The company added more products to its catalog until it became synonymous with the concept of e-commerce in North America. Amazon is expanding its operations around the world, adding a world-class shipping network and a massive cloud computing system along the way, and always hunting for the next big idea.\n\nThese companies are always ready to change with the times. You will often find them in the vanguard of the next marketwide sea change. That's exactly what I want to see in my long-term investments.\n\nSmart ways to invest like a future millionaire\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results, but these three companies have proven their ability to stay ahead of the times.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire has built a cross-sector conglomerate for the ages, managed by some of the world's best business minds. Big Blue is turning decades of AI research into a terrific near-term growth driver, surely to be followed by another unexpected strategy shift that will be helpful in the 2040s and beyond. Amazon has been around for 30 years but is still acting like a hungry little upstart with tons of unexplored markets and business ideas.\n\nYou can pick any combination of these stocks to power a diversified investment portfolio in the long run. Getting started with a robust investment today is a good start, but you'll do even better if you commit to building on that investment for years to come. With a dollar-cost averaging strategy, you can buy more shares when they're cheap and fewer when they're not, averaging out market volatility along the way. Automating the process with weekly, monthly, or annual stock buys can help you stay on track.\n\nAnd don't forget to enable a dividend reinvestment program (DRIP) for IBM, where the generous dividend payments make a big difference to your long-term returns: IBM Total Return Price Chart\n\nThere you have it: IBM, Berkshire Hathaway, and Amazon can help you make a millionaire over the next few decades. They may not get the job done quickly, but truly wealth-building investments always take time. You'll follow in the footsteps of Bogle, Buffett, and many other investing geniuses. They should always be a part of a diversified portfolio, but these ultra-flexible companies are almost single-ticker index funds on their own.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be Wall Street's First $5 Trillion Stock",
        "content": "There are six publicly traded companies with trillion-dollar valuations. With a market cap of roughly $1.9 trillion, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the fifth-most-valuable company in the world, trailing peers including Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Alphabet.\n\nFor now, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia are steadily in the lead as each boasts a market cap in excess of $3 trillion. However, I think Amazon has the best chance of becoming Wall Street's first $5 trillion stock.\n\nBelow, I'll break down how artificial intelligence (AI) represents a lucrative growth opportunity for all of big tech and why I think Amazon will emerge as the king of the tech realm in the long run.\n\nAmazon's next big catalyst\n\nFor the last couple of years, investors have been bombarded with information, most of it vague, about AI and how large corporations plan to integrate the technology into their businesses.\n\nPromises of increased workplace productivity or enhanced data analytics don't mean much unless you can prove that these technology upgrades are worth the money. The most obvious way to do that is through numbers.\n\nSince the AI revolution took off, Amazon has invested billions of dollars in new products and services. Specifically, the company invested $4 billion in a competitor to OpenAI, Anthropic. Additionally, the company has poured billions of dollars of capital expenditures (capex) into data center infrastructure.\n\nLet's take a look at how these investments are paying off and what that could spell for Amazon's future. AMZN Capital Expenditures (Quarterly) Chart\n\nRevenue growth is great, but rising profits are even better\n\nDespite the exciting prospects of AI, Amazon is facing other financial challenges. Macroeconomic forces, including stubborn inflation and rising interest rates, have stalled Amazon's growth in core segments such as e-commerce and subscription services over the last couple of years. Thankfully, changes to monetary policy, such as reduced interest rates, should help ignite some renewed growth in these operating segments.\n\nWhere I think investors are completely overlooking Amazon is in its cloud computing segment -- Amazon Web Services (AWS). Since the company forged a relationship with Anthropic, revenue and profits from AWS have materially accelerated.\n\nThis is important because the majority of Amazon's operating income stems from AWS. As the overall profile surrounding AWS improves, so does Amazon's entire business.\n\nTo put this into perspective, Amazon's trailing-12-month free cash flow grew 572% year over year to $53 billion as of June 30. At the end of the second quarter, Amazon held $89 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy I think Amazon could be the long-run winner\n\nIt's obvious that Amazon is performing well, but why do I think its growth prospects are far more robust than those of its peers?\n\nFor now, Nvidia is the leader of the graphics processing unit (GPU) and data center industries. However, rising competition from AMD, Intel, and many of Nvidia's own customers leads me to question how much more fuel Nvidia's rocket really has.\n\nApple is perhaps the biggest enigma in the AI landscape among the big tech companies. The company has been slow to dive into the AI arena, and it's too early to tell if its strategy around Apple Intelligence (the marketing moniker for Apple's AI tools) will pay off.\n\nLike Nvidia, Microsoft has been hailed as an early winner in AI adoption. This is largely thanks to the company's multibillion-dollar investments in OpenAI -- the developer of ChatGPT -- and the swift integration of AI across the Windows operating system. While I think Microsoft will continue to grow at an impressive pace, its valuation has arguably already priced in a lot of upside -- especially considering Microsoft competes with Amazon and Alphabet in the cloud computing world.\n\nAnd although Alphabet has made an incredible footprint on the internet space thanks to its Google and YouTube platforms, rising competition in the advertising space has taken a toll on Alphabet's core source of revenue. While Meta Platforms and TikTok are obvious threats, I think Amazon's advertising business is monumentally discounted and could further hinder Alphabet's growth.\n\nGiven the above explanations, I think each of Amazon's major cohorts could face some serious growth deceleration in the coming years. Alternatively, Amazon's diversified ecosystem of e-commerce, subscriptions, grocery delivery, streaming, cloud computing, and more provide a level of immunity to competition that is hard to match.\n\nI think Amazon's revenue and profits will continue to grow for years. As profitability and earnings rise, I think Wall Street will eventually begin valuing Amazon over its peers.\n\nFor these reasons, I think the company's valuation multiples will begin to expand dramatically -- leading to rising share prices and ultimately a market cap value well in excess of other big tech companies'.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is up 24% this year, just edging out the S&P 500. It may not provide the same earth-shattering gains it did for early investors, but it's likely to be a market-beating stock for the foreseeable future. At this later investment stage, that comes with added security. Here are three reasons to believe it's still a no-brainer buy.\n\n1. E-commerce is still growing\n\nMost investors know Amazon as the largest e-commerce company in the world, and that's still its core business and a massive growth driver. Amazon accounts for more than one in three e-commerce sales dollars, a lead so vast that it would be impossible for any competitor to challenge it in the near future.\n\nIt lost some ground during the pandemic's height, when there was an unexpected surge of new businesses going online. But it's expected to grab more market share going forward, racing past 40% of all e-commerce sales this year and increasing its share next year, according to eMarketer.\n\nE-commerce itself is expected to grow as a percentage of retail sales, from 20.3% this year to 23% in 2027. That's an organic growth driver for Amazon's business. But organic or not, Amazon is setting itself up to win, keep challenges at bay, and drive higher revenue and margins.\n\nThe stores segment increased 9% year over year in the U.S. and 10% internationally. Considering the huge base on which the percentages are increasing, those are impressive metrics equal to billions of dollars. CEO Andy Jassy said shoppers are still switching down to lower-priced brands and products due to inflation, so those numbers could accelerate as inflation moderates.\n\nManagement sees plenty of opportunities to lower costs through robotics, great regionalization, and building out its same-day shipping facilities.\n\n2. It's a huge contender in AI\n\nE-commerce may still be Amazon's largest business, accounting for about 62% of sales in the second quarter, but Amazon Web Services is by far the more profitable segment, accounting for 63% of operating income. Don't be fooled by its accounting for less of Amazon's total sales -- it's still the largest cloud company in the world, accounting for 31% of the entire market and edging out top-tier players like Microsoft and Alphabet.\n\nAnd Amazon is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in carving out its niche in generative artificial intelligence (AI). Like everything else Amazon does, it's doing generative AI in a big way. It wants to be everything to everyone, and that means an unparalleled lineup of services to meet every kind of need, from the smaller business that needs turnkey solutions to enterprise customers that need the most precise customization. Since it's larger than anyone else, and its AI business has already reached a billion-dollar run rate, it can afford to invest and to offer its services at more competitive rates. So while it partners with leader Nvidia for the best chips, it's also developing its own chips to compete on price.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement still sees this as only the early innings in this business, and Amazon is poised to benefit from a continuing shift to the cloud and AI.\n\n3. Advertising (and everything else) is just getting started\n\nAdvertising has become Amazon's fastest-growing segment, up 20% year over year in the second quarter (ended June 30). Amazon has the obvious reach advertisers are looking for, especially third-party sellers who are looking to bring eyes to their product pages. It also uses its AI capabilities to present pinpoint accuracy for advertisers to reach target customers.\n\nIt's just getting started in video advertising after creating an ad-supported tier for Prime streaming, where it sees long-term opportunities. Since it's Amazon, it's also looking to offer something better for the customer by showing the fewest ads of any basic TV or ad-supported streaming service.\n\nAs always, Amazon is dipping its toes into new businesses that could explode into its next big growth driver, like healthcare and autonomous vehicles.\n\nAs large as Amazon is, expect a lot more from this perennial winner, and don't miss the chance to buy as early as you can.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,122!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $43,756!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $384,515!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 14, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "Overview of the Recent Transaction\n\nOn September 30, 2024, Norges Bank executed a significant transaction involving the sale of 84,217 shares in Mobileye Global Inc (NASDAQ:MBLY), an industry leader in autonomous driving technologies. This move reduced the firm's holdings in Mobileye to 4,850,094 shares, reflecting a minor position change of -1.71% in their portfolio. The shares were traded at a price of $13.70 each.\n\nProfile of Norges Bank\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MBLY.\n\nNorges Bank, headquartered at Bankplassen 2, Oslo, is a prominent investment entity known for its strategic equity holdings across various sectors, with a strong emphasis on technology and financial services. The firm manages an impressive equity portfolio valued at approximately $669.35 billion, featuring top holdings in major corporations such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Norges Bank Reduces Stake in Mobileye Global Inc\n\nIntroduction to Mobileye Global Inc\n\nFounded in Israel, Mobileye Global Inc specializes in the development and deployment of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving solutions. Since its IPO on October 26, 2022, Mobileye has been at the forefront of innovating autonomous vehicle technologies, contributing significantly to the Vehicles & Parts industry.\n\nFinancial and Market Analysis of Mobileye Global Inc\n\nAs of the latest data, Mobileye Global Inc holds a market capitalization of $9.87 billion, with a current stock price of $12.175. The company's financial health shows a PE Ratio of 0.00, indicating it is currently not generating profits. The GF Score of 24/100 suggests a challenging outlook in terms of future stock performance. Norges Bank Reduces Stake in Mobileye Global Inc\n\nImpact of the Trade on Norges Bank's Portfolio\n\nThe recent reduction in Mobileye shares by Norges Bank has had a minimal impact on its overall portfolio, with the position now accounting for just 0.01% of its total investments. This adjustment reflects a strategic shift possibly due to the stock's underperformance and the firm's portfolio rebalancing.\n\nPerformance Metrics of Mobileye Global Inc Post-Transaction\n\nSince the transaction date, Mobileye's stock price has declined by 11.13%, with a year-to-date drop of 70.55% and a decrease of 54.42% since its IPO. These figures highlight the stock's volatile journey and the challenges it faces in a competitive market.\n\nMarket Sentiment and Future Outlook\n\nThe market's reaction to Mobileye's financial performance and Norges Bank's recent stock reduction has been tepid, reflecting concerns over the company's profitability and growth trajectory. However, Mobileye's ongoing innovations in autonomous driving technology could pivot its market position if successfully commercialized.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nNorges Bank's decision to reduce its stake in Mobileye Global Inc aligns with the stock's recent performance and market challenges. While the future holds potential for recovery and growth, particularly in the autonomous driving sector, investors should closely monitor Mobileye's strategic initiatives and market adaptation. This transaction by Norges Bank could signify a cautious approach towards an industry fraught with both opportunities and significant risks.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "Tesla Fails To Justify The Robotaxi Hype With Concrete Figures",
        "content": "Tesla Fails To Justify The Robotaxi Hype With Concrete Figures\n\nLast week, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi, the star of its next chapter. The Cybercab was revealed at the massive Warner Bros Studios in Burbank, California, known as Hollywood. Like the Cybertruck, Tesla’s robotaxi has a futuristic design, but the “We, Robot” event failed to impress. After the event, Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s net worth went down by $15 billion as he holds about 13% of the company’s shares, but he remains the world’s richest person.\n\nMore Information About The Cybercab\n\nWith production scheduled for some time before 2027, Musk also revealed that the Cybercab, which would compete with rivals including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Waymo, would cost less than $30,000, which is about the same price as its cheaper Model 3 and Model Y.  Moreover, the Cybercab has no plug as it would use inductive charging, one for which Tesla does not currently have infrastructure for, raising many concerns about the cost of making this driverless dream actually happen.\n\nHowever, Musk remains optimistic despite skepticism.\n\nAfter a decade of failing to meet his own deadlines, Musk’s prediction that production of the Cybercab would begin some time \"before 2027” is seen as questionable. Paul Miller from Research Forrester believes it will be extremely difficult for Tesla to offer a new vehicle at that price within that timeframe, which means Tesla would be making a loss on every vehicle.\n\nThe glitzy showcase failed to shake off the feeling that Tesla is losing the race.\n\nThursday was supposed to be the unveiling of Tesla’s new chapter, providing a glimpse of its future built on Musk’s latest driverless dreams. But with Musk’s, history of falling short on promises and Tesla’s past of safety issues, there are many concerns around the Cybercab. Adding to the fact that Alphabet is already operating with Waymo, along with other Chinese firms, Tesla is still far from disrupting the landscape. Many have faltered with automated driving technology when it came to figuring out a profitable business model. For example, it took Google quite some time to scale Waymo. On Thursday, humanoid Optimus robots served drinks and the world got a glimpse of Tesla’s robotaxi fleet, “Cybercab” and “Robovan”, with disappointment in the air. While reasons varied, from not-so-thrilling joyrides in the new vehicles to not-so-self-functioning self-functioning robots and so-on, Tesla failed to impress as it goes up against not only Google and its Waymo, but General Motors (NYSE: GM) and its Cruise autonomous ride-hailing service, as well as Zoox, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN)’s self-driving subsidiary. All in all, the market was probably mostly disappointed because they the dazzling event failed not provide any concrete numbers.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says It’s ‘Just a Matter of Time’ Before Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Rebounds",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks to Watch. Since Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about the latest rebound in the market.\n\n“Never get tired of all-time highs. We are experiencing a time for the market which is what I said would happen when the Fed starts cutting rates when the economy is still solid.”\n\nCramer said that the key reason the market roared to highs was strong earnings from top banks. He said since the Fed’s interest rate cuts have just started, investors believe maybe the “best is yet to come.”\n\nJim Cramer wondered whether this strong performance trend would be a “pattern” in this earnings season.\n\n“We will find out soon enough. We will see if the positive action will be sustained.”\n\nCramer recommended investors to “listen to the calls” this earning season and “ponder a moment, and only then should you pull the trigger.”\n\n“We are at the beginning of one of the year’s four reporting periods. Probably the most exciting. I can’t believe I still get fired up, but man, am I ever.”\n\nFor this article, we watched the latest episodes of Jim Cramer’s ‘Lightning Round’ segment on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he was talking about. With each company, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Jim Cramer Says It’s ‘Just a Matter of Time’ Before Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Rebounds\n\nTtatty / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\n\nTalking about an analyst downgrade on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Cramer questioned the logic of naysayers and said the company always makes a comeback.\n\n“How many times has Amazon been up against headwinds? Do you know how many times they’ve made inexplicable moves? It is nothing new. They always came back; it is in their DNA. It always does. I remember a year and a half ago I was screaming because Amazon Web Services was underperforming, and it came right back.”\n\nCramer thinks it’s just a matter of time before the stock comes back.\n\n“I think it is a matter of time before Amazon bounces back as usual. No hurry. The stock does seem to be headed lower; I have no doubt about that. I get it. But sell to buy it lower? Can you really get back in that? Too hard.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS’s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\n\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\n\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\n\nAlphyn Capital Management stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) continued growth is driven by its strong performance in AWS and advertising, which grew 19% and 20%, respectively. E-commerce growth moderated to 9.3%, likely due to softer consumer demand.\n\nIn previous letters, I mentioned how Amazon’s heavy investments in logistics and fulfillment suppressed margins for some time, but the company is now reaping the rewards of those earlier expenditures. European operations have been profitable for the second consecutive quarter, while North American operating margins have risen from pandemic lows to 5.3%. A key ongoing area of focus for Amazon has been reducing the “cost to serve”; this is beginning to show tangible benefits. In 2023, Amazon undertook a “regionalization” strategy, which divided the U.S. into eight distinct regions for fulfillment and transportation, with corresponding distribution centers in each. As I learned from an expert interview done by InPractise, “regionalization” has resulted in estimated shipping expenses dropping from $4.76 per unit to $4.50, and they are now approximately $4.26, with potential reductions of 2-3% annually. Interestingly, Amazon leaned on its third-party vendors (3P) to finance much of this strategy. It did so by requiring 3P vendors ship inventory to the multiple regional distribution centers, instead of to a single location as they used to do. Moreover, Amazon imposed penalties for failing to meet strict minimum and maximum quantities. In this way, Amazon used 3P inventory to expand its distribution capacity by around 24 million square feet, much of which it could use for its own 1P inventory. Clever strategy, but one wonders if this raises the risk of an eventual vendor backlash due to the added financial and logistical pressures on 3P sellers.\n\nLike Alphabet, Amazon is investing heavily in its AWS infrastructure to support its growing AI business. In the first half of the year, the company spent $30.5 billion on capital expenditures, with plans to exceed that in the year’s second half. When questioned about this during the earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy emphasized that they are seeing significant demand for AI-related services, which he believes will become a “very large” business for Amazon.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com, Inc.

        "content": "SEATTLE The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that eCommerce behemoth Amazon (AMZN, Financials) has struck a five-year agreement with Databricks, a key Snowflake (SNOW, Financials) rival, to effectively set up a data warehouse startup to utilize Amazon's Trainium AI processors. Though the specifics weren't revealed, the deal will likely assist businesses in developing AI in cost-cutting efforts.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with SNOW.\n\nMoreover, Databricks president Naveen Rao highlighted how the partnership will allow companies to build AI models significantly quicker and more inexpensively effectively. This is primarily because of the savings from utilizing Amazon's Trainium processors instead of those from Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), which spearheads the AI chip space.\n\nAlso, it's noteworthy that Databricks will continue using Nvidia processors as part of a pre-existing agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS), notwithstanding the change. Along with its Inferentia series of AI chips used to develop and operate AI models, Amazon debuted the second iteration of its Trainium chips in November last year. All in all the agreement adds to Amazon's position in the cutthroat AI chip space, as it looks to advance its position further.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google redesigned its shopping website to better match consumers with merchant storefronts, seeking to distinguish the platform from e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Inside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City\n\nThe updated shopping experience largely revolves around scrollable feeds akin to a social media app. A new home page will display a personalized feed of products, reviews and auto-playing video shorts from Google’s YouTube. A Deals page will host a similar curated feed of discounted items.\n\nOn Google Search, shopping-related queries will return artificial intelligence-generated blurbs explaining important factors to consider for specific merchandise, like the type of material of a jacket meant for a wet climate. The features will initially be available in the US.\n\nThe redesign is the company’s latest move to keep users on Google’s platform longer when researching anything from recipes to flights, rather than immediately diverting them to external websites. In May, the company introduced AI Overviews, which summarize the contents of search results, a feature some critics argue could reduce clicks through to websites that earn ad revenue from visits.\n\nUnlike the digital marketplaces of fellow technology giants Amazon and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Google Shopping doesn’t sell or ship products; it just shows customers where they can buy items.\n\n“We see ourselves playing a different role” than Amazon, Maria Renz, Google vice president and general manager of commerce, said in an interview prior to the announcement. “Google has always been about promoting a healthy ecosystem.”\n\nShoppers can fully research a potential purchase without ever leaving Google’s variety of websites — from viewing suggested items on Google Shopping to watching product review videos on YouTube to locating brick-and-mortar sellers on Google Maps.\n\nBut the company’s suite of heavily integrated products could be at risk. After a landmark antitrust ruling found Google illegally monopolized the search market, the US Justice Department is considering calling for a breakup that could spin off major parts of the company’s portfolio, including the Chrome internet browser and the Android operating system.\n\nGoogle hasn’t considered directly challenging e-commerce storefronts by handling payment and shipping within Google Shopping, executives said.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Since we don’t have inventory, we don’t take payment, we don’t ship anything — we’re also not trying to maximize profit on a per product basis,” Sean Scott, vice president and general manager of consumer shopping at Google, said in an interview. Scott calls that a “unique advantage.”\n\nRegarding the ability to check out and pay on Google Shopping, “I would never say never,” Scott said. “We’re just trying to help connect consumers with merchants.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man How Airbnb Hosts and Frustrated Neighbors Can Find Common Ground How Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium China Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space Inside the Companies That Set Sports Gambling Odds\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon Ads Launches New AI Tools for Advertisers – AI Creative Studio and Audio Generator",
        "content": "Amazon expands existing family of generative AI tools to include all media types, helping advertisers create engaging content across images, video, and audio\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, October 15, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(NASDAQ: AMZN) — At unBoxed 2024, Amazon Ads introduced AI creative studio and Audio generator, two new generative AI tools designed to lower creative barriers and expand opportunities for advertisers to scale their reach. By building a suite of self-service, AI-powered tools, Amazon Ads is enabling brands of all sizes to create engaging content across media types and eliminating boundaries across ad formats.\n\nWith Audio generator, Amazon Ads expands its suite of AI-powered creative tools – including Image generator and Video generator – empowering brands to connect with customers across the shopping journey. These tools make it simple to build and activate new campaign creatives, helping brands experiment more freely and optimize based on performance – with little more than the information on their Amazon product page. According to Amazon Ads findings, on average, brands who used Image generator between October 2023 and June 2024 saw almost 5% more sales per advertiser.\n\nTo further enhance a seamless ad building experience, Amazon Ads is releasing AI creative studio – which helps advertisers explore and create unique ads all in one place. AI creative studio brings Amazon Ads AI-powered creative generators into a single application, where brands can conceptualize, create, and refresh content regardless of format. Whether it’s turning a simple product shot into videos or, in the near future, converting a TV commercial into online sponsored ads, AI creative studio makes it easy to build and scale campaigns in innovative ways – helping brands reach customers.\n\n\"We’re excited to introduce these new AI-powered creative tools, which have the potential to transform how brands connect with Amazon customers,\" said Jay Richman, Vice President of Creative Experiences for Amazon Ads. \"By reducing the complexities of working across multiple formats and placements, these innovations empower advertisers to more easily reach their target audiences at every stage of the marketing funnel. They can also easily update creatives seasonally, generate fresh, trend-driven content, and tailor ads to different use cases. This leads to a more dynamic and engaging customer experience, ultimately helping to drive overall campaign performance.\"\n\nExplore, get inspired, and create across display, video, and audio formats\n\nAI creative studio brings Amazon Ads AI-powered image and video – and in the future, audio – generation capabilities together within a single experience. Advertisers of all sizes and skill levels can use AI creative studio to research, generate, refine, and publish a variety of high-quality ad creatives produced from a single product shot, product page, or existing ad creative.\n\nWithin AI creative studio, brands can explore the AI gallery – a content hub that houses examples of re-creatable ad formats, concepts, and designs – to spark inspiration. For example, an advertiser might start by browsing themes and choose something \"zen\"-inspired. They could then take a product shot of their handmade ceramic mug on a plain white backdrop, replace that backdrop with a captivating image that features the mug in a serene picnic setting against a picturesque prairie background, and add eye-catching motion like wildflowers swaying in the breeze.\n\nBrands can also upload their own assets to AI creative studio. Advertisers can take existing creative and generate a variety of concepts, adjust them to multiple aspect ratios, and refine them by choosing different styles, lighting, camera angles, colors, and tone presets. For instance, a brand could upload a product photo and convert it into a series of short videos or live images, tailored to engage customers across Amazon – from Prime Video to Twitch, and on Amazon.com.\n\nThe resulting ads can be saved directly to the advertiser’s creative asset library within their existing campaign workflows, for easy campaign activation.\n\n\"Imagine the impact this can have for businesses of all sizes,\" says Richman. \"Traditionally, investing in multiple ad formats and placements demands significant time, budget, and expertise. Now, with AI creative studio, advertisers can easily draw inspiration from custom concepts, select one, and seamlessly create display, video, and eventually audio ads – all within a single workflow.\"\n\nAI creative studio also provides unlimited storage, so that brands can have a breadth of creative assets ready for live campaigns. It is available in beta for select U.S. advertisers starting today.\n\nGenerate audio creatives in minutes\n\nAdvertisers can use Audio generator to easily develop engaging, interactive audio ad creative in just minutes and at no additional cost. This technology makes audio advertising available to more brands, helping them drive incremental reach by engaging relevant audiences while they are listening to their favorite content on Alexa-enabled devices.\n\nJust like with Image and Video generator, advertisers simply input their Amazon-listed product and Audio generator will automatically create a voiceover script based on the product information. Advertisers can then select the voice and tone, as well as background music, and Audio generator will deliver a high-quality, 30-second interactive audio ad that can complement a brand’s display, video, and sponsored ads campaigns.\n\nThe resulting ad can also be refined at any point. Advertisers can tweak the script, make the tone more promotional, conversational, or narrative-based, and test different variations to keep the message fresh and optimize performance. Ads also include an interactive element, such as \"Alexa, add to cart,\" with more options to come.\n\nAvailable now in beta, U.S. advertisers can access Audio generator via the Amazon DSP.\n\n\"We’re really excited to add Audio generator to our growing suite of AI-powered creative tools,\" says Richman. \"From images to video and now audio, we are removing creative barriers for advertisers and unlocking new audiences and opportunities that weren’t possible just a year ago. And the invention won’t stop here—this is just the beginning.\"\n\nTo learn more about all of the announcements at unBoxed 2024, visit ads.amazon.com.

        "title": "Amazon DSP Announces Next-Generation Ad Tech for Precise Full-funnel Reach and Performance",
        "content": "Amazon unveils an all-new Amazon DSP experience, enhanced interoperability, and simplified full-funnel optimization\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, October 15, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(NASDAQ: AMZN) — At unBoxed 2024, Amazon Ads announced a series of innovations across the Amazon Demand-side Platform (Amazon DSP) that drive precise full-funnel audience reach with streamlined campaign planning and optimization. Amazon Ads has a unique, deep understanding of the path customers take from awareness to conversion and is delivering capabilities that all brands can easily use to create and strengthen relationships with their customers, regardless of the size of their business, their products, or which services they sell.\n\n\"The digital advertising landscape is rapidly evolving, with streaming TV becoming mainstream and full-funnel, cross-channel reach and measurement taking center stage. We’re inventing ad tech that makes it easier for all advertisers to navigate this evolution with precise reach, deeper insights, and direct measurement,\" said Kelly MacLean, Vice President of Amazon DSP. \"Amazon DSP can uniquely drive top-to-bottom outcomes on Amazon’s properties, such as the store and Prime Video, as well as across leading streaming apps and premium publishers. We look forward to seeing advertisers leverage the capabilities announced today to fuel their business growth and engage more customers.\"\n\nImproved usability and ease of use\n\nTo increase advertiser efficiency, Amazon DSP is launching a new user experience with simplified workflows to enable campaign creation in just a few clicks. In early tests, the new consolidated display line-item feature reduced campaign setup time by 75%. This feature brings together desktop, mobile, and app display inventory into a single line item, making it easier to launch and monitor reporting.\n\nWhen advertisers visit their campaign health overview page, they will now see new insight cards and machine learning recommendations that help them quickly audit their campaign performance and make adjustments. For example, an advertiser may see an insight card that shows their campaign is currently underdelivering; they can review the accompanying recommendation and click to automatically apply that optimization. Amazon DSP will centralize and expand these cards within a new campaign management hub in 2025.\n\nAmazon DSP enhancements also include new frequency cap controls and reporting to simplify frequency management. Advertisers can now use the frequency groups feature to holistically manage their frequency caps across multiple campaigns, channels and devices—such as capping ad frequency at a household level. Advertisers using these frequency cap controls have saved up to 26% of their campaign budgets from spending on duplicate impressions and drove up to 21% incremental reach.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Amazon DSP's frequency management and target frequency capabilities exceed those of other DSPs. In particular, the frequency cap insights report is the most thought-through report we have seen among all DSPs,\" said Megan Pagliuca, Chief Activation Officer, Omnicom Media Group.\n\nEnhanced interoperability across Amazon ad tech\n\nAmazon Ads is also launching an ads data manager. This easy-to-use interface enables advertisers to securely upload their signals once, and then use them across Amazon DSP and Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC) to engage relevant audiences, measure conversions, and optimize campaigns. It’s integrated with providers like Treasure Data, Salesforce, and Tealium, so advertisers can import their first-party data from wherever they store it. Today advertisers can use ads data manager to connect their first-party data with Amazon DSP audiences, and it will be fully integrated with the Amazon DSP and AMC in 2025.\n\nThrough the powerful combination of AMC, Amazon DSP, and Amazon Publisher Cloud, advertisers are now able to create custom audiences tailored to their business goals, then overlay them with signals from Amazon Ads and third-party publishers to increase their efficacy. This direct collaboration creates a new way for advertisers to launch enhanced deals with premium third-party publishers using their custom audiences—enriched with precise signals from the publisher and Amazon Ads to increase relevancy and campaign performance.\n\nXmars recently activated a campaign for Bedsure with AMC audiences and Amazon Publisher Cloud, which were enhanced with publisher-signals from a leading publisher, resulting in a 2.2X uplift in reach among the brand’s desired audiences. It also had an approximately 50% more efficient cost to reach their desired customers. \"Ensuring that media dollars are driving maximum results is a top priority for our clients,\" said Tony Wang, Xmars Co-founder. \"We’re able to unlock even more value on Amazon DSP using our brand partners' proprietary data in secure collaboration with Amazon Ads signals plus insights from top broadcasters to create enriched deals. This increases the effectiveness of our campaigns across the funnel and delivers even greater value for advertisers.\"\n\nSimplified campaign optimization with AI-driven performance\n\nAmazon Ads also announced enhancements to Performance+, the always-on, automated optimization capability within Amazon DSP. Performance+ uses advertiser-provided signals and predictive AI to automate audience relevancy and campaign optimization for lower-funnel goals, like conversion and customer acquisition. It sets up campaigns, builds custom audiences, and continuously optimizes toward the advertiser’s stated KPIs. Results to date show that Performance+ drive a 51% improvement in customer acquisition costs, on average.\n\nNew Performance+ tactics, now in open beta, expand advertiser campaign strategies to include remarketing and retention, in addition to the prospecting tactic that was already available. The entire workflow has been streamlined to as few as four clicks, while still providing flexible optimization controls and transparency. Advertisers simply choose their campaign goal, such as conversion, awareness, or consideration; choose their KPI, such as cost-per-acquisition (CPA) or return on ad spend (ROAS); and choose their Performance+ tactic: prospecting, remarketing, or retention. Performance+ campaigns continually optimize performance against these specifications to deliver the right results.\n\nFiverr, a company connecting businesses with freelancers, used the Performance+ prospecting tactic to drive automated performance. Within a month, Fiverr saw a 66% reduction in CPA vs. goal target and a 72% increase in click through rate vs. campaign average benchmarks.\n\nTo learn more about all of the announcements at unBoxed 2024, go to ads.amazon.com.\n\nAbout Amazon Ads\n\nAmazon Ads offers full-funnel advertising solutions to help businesses of all sizes achieve their marketing goals at scale.

The announcements showcased how Amazon Ads is making its powerful insights easier to access and activate by every advertiser, across every ad product.\n\n\"Our mission is to be the most customer-obsessed advertising service by giving all brands the measurement and data-driven, machine learning optimization capabilities they need to drive business growth through simple, easy-to-use tools,\" said Paula Despins, Vice President of Ads Measurement at Amazon Ads. \"Today’s launches put our most sophisticated full-funnel measurement and optimization capabilities into the hands of all marketers from small businesses to major brands.\"\n\nAccelerate new product launches and reach high-value customers\n\nAs a leading destination for product discovery, Amazon has a unique ability to help brands successfully launch new products. New product campaigns are a fully-managed service that help brands quickly introduce new products to customers within the first 90 days of their launch, through advertising placements across Amazon’s properties and leading broadcasters and publishers.\n\nNew product campaigns help customers discover and learn about new products through clear and consistent messaging in the places they’re choosing to spend time – so that they can move from awareness, to consideration, to purchasing great products they want or need. For example, a customer could see an ad for an easy-to-use espresso machine while watching Prime Video. A week or so later, the customer may hear an ad for that espresso machine on Amazon Music and learn it’s designed to save counter space. The next time they’re shopping in the Amazon store, they may see a display ad for the same espresso machine that highlights it’s Prime-eligible. At this point the customer is more familiar with the product, putting them that much closer to a purchase. Advertisers using these media plans saw a 9% increase in their weekly sales growth on average compared to those that did not.\n\nOnce a product is launched advertisers need solutions that enable them to both continue acquiring new customers and engaging prospective customers as they move through the funnel, on an ongoing basis. According to a study by Boston Consulting Group, on average, advertisers need to reach customers at least 20 times before they make a purchase. To help advertisers do this more efficiently, Amazon Ads has audience bid boosting to re-engage shoppers reached on streaming TV through Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products ads. Advertisers using Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC), Amazon Ads secure clean room technology, can now adjust their Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products bids specifically for audiences who have seen their streaming TV ads and also visited their website, for example, focusing their investments on these high-value customers.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"For over a century, Newell Brands’ products have been a trusted presence in households around the world. When we launched our latest products, we knew we needed a strategy that could effectively reach audiences across multiple platforms, and partnering with Amazon Ads made that possible. Amazon’s full-funnel approach for new product launches has helped us reach customers wherever they are—whether they’re watching Prime Video or browsing Amazon,\" said Michal Geller, President of eCommerce & Digital at Newell Brands.\n\nSimplify insights with AMC solutions\n\nAMC enables advertisers to join their first-party data with Amazon Ads signals to understand the customer journey and build and activate audiences. New AMC solutions introduce no-code capabilities in an intuitive interface – extending AMC’s sophisticated analytics capabilities to brands of all sizes. Now any Amazon advertiser can use AMC to quickly uncover advanced audience and measurement insights, and optimize their campaigns.\n\nThe first two AMC solutions launching are high value audience and optimal frequency analyses. Brands can use the high value solution to instantly visualize how their customer base is distributed by total spend levels over a period of time. With just a few clicks they can create related audience segments and activate them in future campaigns. With the optimal frequency solution, advertisers can monitor how KPIs like conversion rate and return on ad spend evolve as ad interactions increase, and from there, determine the most efficient frequency caps for their campaign.\n\nHonest Kitchen, a CPG brand, used the optimal frequency AMC solution to improve their Amazon DSP campaign performance. After better understanding their cross-campaign ad frequency, Honest Kitchen was able to adjust their daily frequency caps to increase their impressions by 23% and Amazon.com product detail page views by 44% – all while maintaining nearly the same budget.\n\nMeasure attribution, report on conversion paths, and project long-term sales\n\nAmazon Ads announced a new multi-touch attribution model that helps advertisers understand how their marketing works to drive conversions, going beyond last touch attribution to consider the relative contribution of each marketing touchpoint leading to a conversion. Using advanced machine learning models to analyze trillions of shopping, streaming, and browsing signals, multi-touch attribution determines the relative impact of ad interactions along the path to purchase. It uses advanced techniques like hundreds of thousands of randomized control trial experiments – A/B tests – to establish impact. For example, if an advertiser uses streaming TV, display, Sponsored Products, and other ad types in their campaigns, multi-touch attribution will show the relative contribution of each tactic to their sales. Amazon Ads will start to test multi-touch attribution later this year, with a full rollout planned for 2025.\n\nTo help advertisers understand the insights from multi-touch attribution, Amazon Ads is launching conversion path reporting to show brands their top-converting paths to purchase from the previous 30-days. For example, advertisers might see their TV ad is showing in their top-converting paths and learn how it helped drive conversions through lower funnel channels. Conversion path reporting is AMC’s most popular insight report and it will soon be available self-service in ad console and Amazon DSP reports. It is currently in closed beta and will be available to U.S. advertisers in open beta later this year.\n\nAdvertisers also want to measure beyond immediate sales and understand the long-term impact of their upper-funnel tactics on outcomes. Long term sales insights estimate the sales that a brand can expect to generate over the next year based on how effectively their campaign moves new-to-brand shoppers down the purchase funnel. For example, a customer may click on an ad and engage with a brand for the first time by visiting their product page, and go on to purchase from that brand months later. With long-term sales insights, that campaign now receives credit for the new product page visit based on the historical outcome from customers who have also visited a product page. Together, immediate sales and long-term sales metrics help advertisers quantify immediate sales and potential return from driving key customer engagements throughout the funnel. Long-term sales insights are currently in closed beta and will be available to U.S. advertisers in open beta later this year.\n\nTo learn more about all of the announcements at unBoxed 2024, go to ads.amazon.com.\n\nAbout Amazon Ads\n\nAmazon Ads offers full-funnel advertising solutions to help businesses of all sizes achieve their marketing goals at scale.

        "title": "Google Shopping is getting an AI upgrade as Alphabet looks to monetize investments",
        "content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is giving its Google Shopping page an AI upgrade. The shopping site will now include AI-powered summaries powered by the company's Gemini AI model that offer tips on how to shop for the best option for the product you’re shopping for. It will also get new personalized results and personalized deals pages.\n\nGoogle says the AI summaries will appear in a new module near the top of the screen just below the sponsored products list and provide information like what kind of features to look for when shopping for products and why.\n\nIf shopping for a kettle for making matcha tea, for example, the AI summaries box will tell you that you should look for kettles with a gooseneck spout for controlled pouring and precise temperature controls. Below that, you’ll see a number of recommendations for products that include bits of information from those AI summaries.\n\nIn the tea kettle example, Google Shopping highlighted things like \"gooseneck\" and \"temperature control\" found in the recommended products' descriptions, making it easier to understand why Google suggested those options. Google Shopping is getting an AI upgrade. (Google) (Google)\n\nIn another example, of a person searching for the best men’s winter jacket for the Pacific Northwest, the AI recommendation feature explained that coats that offer both warmth and water resistance are best for the region’s famously rainy weather.\n\nGoogle says users shop more than 1 billion times per day using Google, making this a massive opportunity for Google to prove that its AI upgrades are worthwhile for everyday users.\n\nIn addition to the AI recommendations, Google says it’s adding a personalized shopping feed to the Google Shopping homepage based on products that users have previously shown an interest in. Google says personalized recommendations can also be turned off via Google Shopping's settings menu.\n\nThe Deals page, meanwhile, will include personalized deals for products and goods.\n\nIn addition to Google Shopping, Google has added its Gemini models to its main Google Search product via its AI Overviews feature, as well as a number of its Android apps for smartphones. But it hasn’t been easy going for the company. In May, Google faced considerable backlash, and plenty of mockery, when users found that AI Overviews told them they could eat rocks and put glue on their pizzas. Google Shopping is also getting a personalized page for products you might be interested in. (Google) (Google)\n\nGoogle responded by scaling back its rollout to address the issues and ensure the feature doesn’t surface unreliable information.\n\nGoogle’s updates come as the company seeks to monetize its vast investments in generative AI technologies. In the second quarter, Google’s parent company Alphabet reported spending $2.2 billion building AI models across its DeepMind and Google Research organizations. That's up from $1.1 billion in Q2 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle isn’t the only company pouring money into generative AI. Microsoft (MSFT) has famously spent billions to team up with OpenAI, while Amazon (AMZN) is investing heavily in Anthropic. Meta is also dumping money into its AI programs, building out its own Llama family of AI models.\n\nThe Big Tech firms are racing to be the first to reach general artificial intelligence, or artificial intelligence that can rival or outperform your average person. But it will take years and billions of dollars more before they get there, if they ever do. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Will One Amazon Employee Tank the Tech Giant?",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is in the spotlight, as supporters of Israel are dismayed by a recent video promoting an upcoming AWS event in Las Vegas. In the video, the AWS vice president of Global Specialists and Partner Organizations, Ruba Borno, is shown wearing an inflammatory piece of jewelry – a necklace pendant in the shape of Israel, with a Palestinian flag across it. Initially, instead of addressing this erasure of the State of Israel, an Amazon spokesperson declined to comment about Borno’s choice of jewelry, according to the Jewish Insider.\n\nHowever, an Amazon spokesperson did respond to a request from TipRanks for comment. The spokesperson said, “The violence and loss of life happening every day in the Middle East is tragic, and at Amazon, our hearts and thoughts are with any person or community that’s affected. Our leadership remains in regular contact with our teams based in the region to offer our support. The video shot was not meant to be a political statement, but we’ve taken down the video and will repost a new one in the coming days.”\n\nRegardless, this incident is causing consternation among founders and employees of Israel’s tech sector. The pendant worn by the AWS vice president is reminiscent of the genocidal “River to the Sea…” chant that’s common among anti-Israel protesters, referring to a wish to have all Jews leave Israel.\n\nHow Is AMZN Stock?\n\nFor now, Amazon is holding steady, with only a 2% fall in the past three months and a 2.8% rise over the past six months. Ten days before earnings, analysts are optimistic on AMZN stock, with the average Amazon consensus price target implying an upside of 18.8%.\n\nSupporters of Israel, aka the “Start-Up Nation,” are upset about about this Amazon’s employee’s apparent genocidal wish to wipe Israel off the map. Some executives have started commenting that they will now leave Amazon AWS for other solutions, so competitors like Microsoft (MSFT) could benefit from this public relations disaster.\n\nEmployees and ex-employees of Amazon have been commenting as well, as seen in the example below:\n\nIt remains to be seen if Amazon’s stock will fall in the wake of this incident.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 No-Brainer Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is among the greatest investors of all time. His advice has helped plenty of other investors do great too, including those who invested in his holding company. An investor who bought $100 worth of Class A shares in Berkshire Hathaway back when Buffett took over in 1965 would have turned that $100 investment into nearly $5.6 million today if they didn't sell.\n\nBuffett has picked plenty of winners for Berkshire over the years (and the occasional loser to keep him humble). Here are two great stocks from Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio you might want to consider for your own portfolio. These two no-brainer investments could help you start building wealth of your own.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nBerkshire Hathaway held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in the second quarter. It first disclosed the position in 2019. Whether Amazon was chosen by Buffett or one of his investing deputies, it fits the type of wide-moat business with a long runway of growth that Buffett typically favors.\n\nThe stock surged to new highs in 2024, but it's still a great buy. While Amazon's widely used online store is not growing all that fast anymore, the most profitable parts of the business are growing at double-digit rates and can drive the shares higher.\n\nAmazon's cloud computing business -- Amazon Web Services -- generates most of its operating profit and reported accelerating sales growth over the last year. The good news for new investors is that organizations are still in the early stages of migrating their data systems to the cloud, especially to use their data with artificial intelligence tools, which can fuel Amazon's growth for many years.\n\nAmazon is a no-brainer investment on many levels. It is No. 1 in cloud services and e-commerce, and it may also conquer the burgeoning retail media market. Advertising is currently its fastest-growing revenue source, now generating $51 billion in trailing-12-month revenue.\n\nThe growth in high-margin businesses like cloud and advertising is why Wall Street analysts expect the company's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 20%. This is enough growth to potentially double the value of Amazon stock within the next five years.\n\n2. Visa\n\nBerkshire held over 8.2 million shares of Visa(NYSE: V) in Q2. Visa is the largest card network with more than double the market share of its next largest competitor -- Mastercard. The major card brands are some of the strongest businesses in the world. They are in everyone's wallet, which means if you invest in these businesses, you are in a position to profit from all the card-related payments made around the world every day.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to Visa, Berkshire also holds shares of American Express and Mastercard. However, Visa is the better stock to buy right now. Unlike American Express, Visa doesn't issue cards and carries no credit risk. It focuses purely on payment processing, which is very difficult to duplicate by a competitor and allows the company to generate extremely high margins. Visa is also offering investors better value than Mastercard with a lower price-to-earnings multiple.\n\nVisa has reported consistent growth. With the exception of the pandemic in 2020, Visa has reported double-digit revenue growth every year since 2017. Its high operating margin of 67% has also improved over that time to drive even stronger earnings growth.\n\nDespite controlling over half of all card transactions, Visa continues to focus on driving higher usage of its branded and co-branded cards through partnerships with banks and fintech providers. Visa reported payments volume of $3.3 trillion in the most recent quarter, up from $2.2 trillion in the same quarter five years ago. Remarkably, management still sees a $20 trillion opportunity in consumer payments that are still made with cash, checks, and Automated Clearing House (ACH).\n\nAnalysts expect the company's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 12%. The stock trades at a reasonable forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22 on next year's consensus earnings estimate, which should allow the stock to grow in line with future earnings. Investors can expect Visa shares to hit new highs for years to come.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,266!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $43,047!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $389,794!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 14, 2024\n\nAmerican Express is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Stocks to Buy With the Dow at an All-Time High",
        "content": "Happy belated anniversary, bull market. On Oct. 12, 2022, a new bull market began. Tech stocks led the charge then and are doing so now, fueled by surging demand for anything related to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nHowever, the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) is holding its own. The Dow is up close to 47% since the bull market began. Are there still some Dow stocks worth buying? Absolutely. Here are three unstoppable stocks to buy with the Dow at an all-time high.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a relatively new member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The e-commerce and cloud-services giant replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance in February 2024. Amazon has been a great addition to the Dow so far, outperforming many other stocks in the index this year.\n\nPerhaps the best indicator of Amazon's strength is its rapidly improving free cash flow. The company generated free cash flow of $53 billion in the trailing 12 months ending June 30, 2024, compared with $7.9 billion for the trailing 12 months ending June 30, 2023.\n\nAmazon's cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), continues to be the company's most important growth driver. Organizations across the world are migrating to the cloud. AI, especially generative AI, is accelerating this trend. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in August that AWS remains \"customers' top choice\" thanks largely to its broad functionality.\n\nBut Amazon is always looking for new ways to grow. The company has found one with advertising. In the second quarter of 2024, advertising-services revenue jumped 20% year over year excluding foreign exchange, slightly higher than AWS revenue growth. Jassy said in the Q2 earning call that Amazon is \"at the very beginning of what's possible in our video advertising.\"\n\n2. The Home Depot\n\nThe Home Depot(NYSE: HD) isn't a newbie in the Dow like Amazon. The leading home improvement retailer joined the index on Nov. 1, 1999. Home Depot has more than quadrupled the Dow's total return since then and has continued to outperform the index in 2024.\n\nYou might not think Home Depot looks unstoppable based on its Q2 results. The company's revenue rose only 0.6% year over year and would have decreased by 3.3% if not for the acquisition of SRS Distribution. However, this temporary snapshot doesn't tell the full story about Home Depot's prospects.\n\nKeep one number in mind with Home Depot: 42. That's the median age of owner-occupied U.S. homes, according to Statista. With a large number of older houses, the demand for home improvement supplies should remain strong for years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nHome Depot also has another long-term tailwind. The U.S. continues to face a major housing shortage. Zillow estimates the country needs another 4.5 million homes. Home Depot should have a significant opportunity providing materials to professionals building new homes over the next decade and beyond.\n\n3. Visa\n\nVisa(NYSE: V) joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Sept. 23, 2013. The payments-technology company has nearly doubled the Dow's total return since then.\n\nGranted, Visa has lagged behind the Dow in 2024. This underperformance is due primarily to regulatory issues. In June, a federal judge rejected a settlement between Visa, Mastercard, and retailers over swipe fees. In September, the U.S. Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging that Visa is monopolizing debit-network markets.\n\nI'm not sure how these regulatory challenges will play out. However, Visa should remain a dominant force in the payments market regardless of the outcomes.\n\nAnd that market should continue to grow. Cash is going the way of the dinosaurs as people increasingly use digital-payment methods. Visa could have an especially big growth opportunity as the middle classes expand in developing nations.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late.

        "title": "If I Could Only Buy 2 Stocks in the Last Half of 2024, I'd Pick These",
        "content": "There are many intriguing stocks out there, and that often makes it very difficult to choose just one or two. After all, most people can't afford to buy every stock that looks attractive -- just like you can't afford to pick up every item you like on a trip to your favorite store. But that's OK. It's perfectly fine to select one or two fantastic stocks when you can. This small move should put you on the road to building a rock-solid portfolio. And eventually, this strategy will help you reach the goal of owning dozens of truly great companies that could help you grow wealth over the long term.\n\nSo, now, considering this, I'll help you along this path by telling you about two of my favorite stocks to buy today. In fact, if I could only buy two stocks in the last half of this year, I'd pick these. That's because they both trade for reasonable prices considering their future prospects, and they should benefit from an improving economic situation. Let's check them out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has already established itself as a leader in two high-growth markets: e-commerce and cloud computing. As an e-commerce giant, the company sells essentials as well as mass merchandise and has built its Prime subscription program to more than 200 million members. This is key because members, paying for advantages like free same-day and one-day delivery, are likely to use the service as often as they can to get their money's worth.\n\nAnd Amazon is making sure they'll want to stay by keeping prices low and making delivery faster than ever. High member-retention rates suggest these efforts are working. In the first three months of last year, 97% of Prime members renewed for a year, according to Statista. Moving forward, in an environment of lower interest rates, customers' buying power should improve, and that's great news for this e-commerce powerhouse.\n\nOn top of this, Amazon Web Services (AWS) continues to be the company's profit driver, and its investment in artificial intelligence (AI) has helped AWS recently reach a more-than $105 billion annual-revenue run rate. And it's important to remember Amazon as a whole brings in billions of dollars in revenue and profit annually.\n\nAll of this makes the stock look reasonably priced at 39 times forward-earnings estimates.\n\n2. Carnival\n\nCarnival(NYSE: CCL)(NYSE: CUK) struggled in the early days of the pandemic, as a temporary halt to cruising operations led to losses -- and a widening of debt. But in recent years, the company has made tremendous progress in turning things around and has proven that cruising is still a vacation favorite.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the most recent quarter, the world's biggest cruise operator announced record after record. Third-quarter revenue reached a high of $7.9 billion, while operating income hit a record $2.2 billion. To illustrate just how much travelers love cruising, the cumulative advanced-booked position for 2025 is ahead of the 2024 record -- and this is at higher pricing levels.\n\nCarnival has achieved these results by making many key moves, such as replacing older ships with new, fuel-efficient ones, reducing the number of new ship orders, and designing fuel-efficient routes. The company also has put a focus on paying down debt, and since the start of 2023 has prepaid more than $7 billion. All of this is helping Carnival sail toward its goal of investment-grade status by the end of 2026.\n\nDemand for Carnival's cruises already has taken off, but a lower interest rate environment -- on the horizon thanks to a recent rate cut by the Federal Reserve -- should support demand. And lower rates should also lower the cost of Carnival's variable-rate borrowings.\n\nToday, Carnival trades for about 15 times forward-earnings estimates, a fair price to pay for this market giant that's showing it has what it takes not only to recover but to deliver significant growth.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "content": "In the latest market close, Amazon (AMZN) reached $187.54, with a -0.68% movement compared to the previous day. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.77%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.47%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.87%.\n\nShares of the online retailer have appreciated by 1.25% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 5.56% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.87%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Amazon in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.14, up 34.12% from the prior-year quarter. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $157.06 billion, reflecting a 9.77% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $4.74 per share and a revenue of $634.43 billion, signifying shifts of +63.45% and +10.38%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Amazon. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988.

At present, Amazon boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Amazon is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 39.81. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 22.87.\n\nInvestors should also note that AMZN has a PEG ratio of 1.44 right now. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Internet - Commerce stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 0.82 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 55, placing it within the top 22% of over 250 industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nDon't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +1.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has gained 7.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +34.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +63.5%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 indicates a change of +23.1% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $157.06 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9.8%. The $634.43 billion and $702.71 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.4% and +10.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $147.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.1%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $148.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.44%. The EPS surprise was +17.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): The E-Commerce and Cloud Powerhouse for the Next Decade",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For The Next Decade. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other best stocks to buy and hold for the next decade.\n\nIs Nuclear Energy Making a Comeback?\n\nNuclear plants continue to re-open, but the question stands, will the global supply be able to meet the ever-growing demand for clean energy? On October 1, Aniket Shah, Jefferies’ global head of sustainability and transition strategy, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his stance on nuclear energy making a comeback amid the AI boom.\n\nShah shares that the nuclear energy boom is not surprising. Looking back, the United States signed significant partnerships to boost the supply of nuclear energy years ago, indicating that the value this sector holds is not unknown or recent.\n\nHe adds that the big tech companies are going to be primary catalysts and will influence the entire market. These companies will invest millions and billions in nuclear energy, making the transition easier for other companies to follow. According to Shah, some key investment areas would be small modular reactors and nuclear fusion.\n\nShah also acknowledged that the United States held a bipartisan view of the nuclear boom, explaining why regulations and acts in favor of nuclear energy are being passed at notoriously high speeds. While the building blocks of nuclear energy are coming together, Shah remains concerned over the execution. He highlights that the United States does not have enough skilled labor and resources to make the nuclear energy boom a reality and must work extremely hard to make it happen.\n\nNuclear Energy is Poised for Growth Amid AI Boom\n\nOne of the most opportunistic investment themes in 2024 is AI, the other is electrification, and both require a lot of power. The surge in power demand is in turn driving utility stocks. On October 4, Durgesh Chopra, Evercore ISI managing director, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss how utilities could benefit from AI-driven power demand.\n\nChopra highlights the biggest catalyst for companies like Vistra and Constellation Energy is data centers’ needs for a 24/7 source of clean energy. Therefore, nuclear companies must grab the opportunity and enter into long-term contracts to lock in future growth as soon as possible.\n\nThere are multiple projects in the pipeline in the United States, that add up to roughly 1.5 gigawatts of energy, positioning nuclear plants as the next big thing in energy. On the flip side, balancing supply and demand will be a key challenge for companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the challenges, he believes that the market is well-positioned for growth in utilities. Utilities have not seen demand growth in the past decade, but things are finally changing for the sector. Overall, with inflation going down, the sector may experience significant tailwinds. Chopra also emphasized that growth in this sector will yield results in five to seven years.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for the next decade, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks first on our list of the 10 stocks to buy and hold for the next decade. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services. Its e-commerce platform is functional in 20 countries and ships to over 100 countries.\n\nThe company was first launched in 1994 and is on track to capture over 40% of the e-commerce market in the United States. Its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), increased its revenue by 18.8% in Q2 and has reported 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters.\n\nOver the past few months, the company has not only forged partnerships with AI startups and the government but it has also been actively involved in the development of AI hardware. Recent chips produced by the company include Trainium and Inferentia. On Prime Day, Amazon deployed a quarter million Graviton Chips and 80,000 custom AI chips to manage the surging activity on its platforms.\n\nSpeaking of AI, AWS is now housing the next generation of Llama models from Meta, giving customers more choices to build, deploy, and scale generative AI applications. On September 19, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched Project Amelia, a selling assistant backed by generative AI, allowing sellers to offer better customer assistance and reach.\n\nOverall, AWS has close to 31% market share in cloud computing, indicative of its dominance in the market. Now that AWS is increasingly adopting AI-backed systems, the company is poised to become a fully AI-run company in the next few years.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to a 20% upside from current levels. According to our Insider Monkey database, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 with total stakes amounting to $65.85 billion.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall, AMZN ranks 1st among the 10 stocks to buy and hold for the next decade. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Why companies are ordering workers to return to the office",
        "content": "Directives from major employers, including Amazon (AMZN) and Barclays (BARC.L), that workers will have to return to the office five days a week all have a similar ring. In a memo to employees, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy emphasised the benefits of in-person work, such as increased collaboration and cultural connection — despite the growing body of research showing the advantages of hybrid work models.\n\nMultiple studies suggest that giving people flexibility regarding where they work boosts job satisfaction, work-life balance, health, morale, productivity and ultimately, the bottom line. Yet according to the recent KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook report, which surveyed 1,300 CEOs around the world, 83% of UK CEOs expect to see a full return to the office within three years.\n\nSo why are employers disregarding data and bringing workers back into offices full-time, potentially to the detriment of their businesses?\n\nRead more: Why trauma-informed employers are key to good worker mental health\n\nSometimes, bad decisions are the result of a poor decision-making process, like not having enough information. But often, the fault lies in the minds of the decision makers — because psychological factors like bias can sabotage our decisions.\n\nUncertainty aversion and the status quo bias\n\nCovid-19 lockdowns may seem like an age ago, but the changes they brought to the way we work are still fairly new. As Jassy said in his memo, it was “not a given” that people could work remotely two days a week before the pandemic.\n\nAnd while remote work has since become more normalised, it still carries a sense of uncertainty for many bosses.\n\n“As humans we have an ingrained psychological preference for what feels familiar, even when evidence suggests that better options may exist. This preference stems from our inherent desire for safety and certainty in our choices,” says Charlotte Bailey, an integrative trauma-informed psychotherapist and host of Let’s Talk People-Pleasing podcast.\n\n“Uncertainty fuels anxiety, and anxiety in business is something most leaders want to avoid. It can lead employers to favour the traditional office set-up, where there is more certainty about how work is done.”\n\nBeing averse to perceived uncertainty is linked to a phenomenon called the status quo bias, in which we cling to what’s familiar. Essentially, it is cognitively easier to stick with what you know, rather than process something that may carry an element of risk, says registered psychologist Dr Carolyne Keenan.\n\nRead more: Do four-day weeks improve workers' mental health?\n\n“In-office work has been the norm for so long that some managers may automatically assume it's the best way to maintain structure, communication, and control even if the adaptations required during the recent pandemic have shown something quite different,” she explains.\n\nStory continues\n\nProximity bias\n\nSome employers may unconsciously associate physical presence with productivity. “This is known as proximity bias, where people who are seen more often are perceived as working harder or being more committed,” Keenan explains.\n\n“Employers might feel more reassured by seeing employees at their desks, even though productivity doesn't necessarily depend on physical presence.” Multiple studies suggest that giving people flexibility regarding where they work boosts job satisfaction, work-life balance, health, morale, productivity and ultimately, the bottom line. (Westend61 via Getty Images)\n\nControl\n\nMark Ma, a professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh, and his graduate student, Yuye Ding, recently analysed 500 US firms’ return-to-office mandates. They found most directives stem from control dynamics — rather than concrete evidence about the benefits of in-person work.\n\n“Employers often equate physical presence with productivity and control,” says Bailey. “There’s an unconscious belief that seeing employees at their desks means work is being done, and without that visibility, there’s an increased sense of losing control.\n\n“This control dynamic is deeply ingrained and reflects the belief that overworking — or being seen to work — equals dedication and increased productivity.”\n\nConfirmation bias\n\nAlthough we like to think our decisions are made deliberately and fairly, we often take mental shortcuts called heuristics. This is because we rarely have the capacity to collate and analyse all the information needed for a fully-informed decision, so we pick and choose what seems relevant.\n\n“We all naturally filter information based on what we already believe, which is a bias known as confirmation bias,” says Bailey.\n\n“For example, when you start thinking about buying a particular model of car, you may begin to notice that model everywhere you go. It might feel like everyone is suddenly driving it, but in reality, it’s just that you’re more attuned to it because you’re interested in that specific car. Your mind is filtering out the other models, which reinforces your belief that it’s a popular choice.”\n\nRead more: The rise of the 'hushed hybrid' workplace\n\nIf an employer is already sceptical about remote work, they may be more likely to take note of the negative stories that reinforce their doubts.\n\n“Businesses might highlight the potential risks of remote work — like reduced collaboration — while ignoring the data or experiences that demonstrate its benefits,” adds Bailey.\n\nSocial identity\n\nMuch of the rhetoric around in-person work focuses on ease of communication and collaboration, but even this can be driven by bias.\n\n“Employers may believe that in-office work fosters a stronger company culture and sense of team cohesion. This is related to social identity theory, where people feel more connected to a group when they are physically present,” Keenan says. “Managers might worry that remote work will erode this sense of belonging or reduce opportunities for spontaneous collaboration.”\n\nGroupthink\n\nThe phrase safety in numbers is the backbone to the concept of groupthink. First coined by social psychologist Irving Janis in 1971, the term groupthink describes how people strive for consensus within a group, casting aside their own beliefs or adopting those of the rest of the group.\n\nSo if some employers start to crackdown on remote work, others may follow suit.\n\n“Leadership teams may reinforce each other’s beliefs about the necessity of in-office work and want to follow tradition,” says Bailey. “Challenging these long-standing norms can feel uncomfortable. It feels easier to stick with group preferences.”\n\nHow employers can adapt to new ways of working Some employers may unconsciously associate physical presence with productivity. (Hinterhaus Productions via Getty Images)\n\nAwareness of bias\n\nDecision-makers may not be aware of their own biases, so taking time to think about their true motivations is important. “For instance, are they making choices based on a few individuals who have broken trust, and consequently punishing the entire team?” says Bailey.\n\n“It's essential to build a culture of trust where expectations are clear and the focus shifts from micromanagement to autonomy,” she adds. “Allow employees to manage their own time, showing them that they are respected and trusted to get on with the task at hand. It can lead to greater job satisfaction and increased productivity.”\n\nManagers should challenge their beliefs. Physically being in an office often means working at a desk, headphones in for focus, and ignoring the person typing next to you. An alternative is to embrace remote or hybrid work by upgrading virtual communication methods and investing in training.\n\nFocus on outcomes\n\nFocusing on actual positive results, instead of clocking up a worker’s hours at their desk, is also key.\n\nRead more: Why quiet quitting is about bad bosses, not laziness\n\n“In-office work can create a false sense of control where visibility is equated with effectiveness,” says Keenan. “Employers should adopt outcome-based performance metrics, where success is measured by the quality and timeliness of work, not where or how long an employee is working.”\n\nPrioritise wellbeing\n\nDespite the increased focus on mental health at work, there’s still a disconnect between the wellbeing strategies employers put in place — like in-office perks — and what actually works.\n\nOverwhelming evidence suggests that focusing on work-life balance, listening to what workers need, and trusting people to work autonomously are key to them feeling valued, which increases good mental health. In turn, this leads to higher engagement and retention.\n\nCreating an environment where remote or hybrid work isn’t just tolerated but is embraced can build a more adaptable, resilient workforce.\n\n“In doing so, employers will find that many of the initial concerns about remote work – such as productivity or culture — are manageable and even improve when approached thoughtfully,” says Keenan.\n\n“Culture isn’t dependent on a physical space — it’s built through shared values, open communication, and support.”\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Invest In.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other profitable blue chip stocks.\n\nThe September inflation report came in hotter than expected and showed that it remains sticky. Headline inflation rose by 2.4%, slightly above the anticipated 2.3%, and down from 2.5% in August. Month-over-month, CPI increased by 0.2%, exceeding the forecast of 0.1%.\n\nCore inflation, excluding food and energy, also came in higher than expected at 3.3%, compared to the anticipated 3.2%, marking a slight increase from August. On a monthly basis, core CPI rose by 0.3%, which matched August’s figures but was above expectations of 0.2%.\n\nFollowing the report, the market is expecting a 25 basis points rate cut to no rate cuts in the upcoming Fed meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, 79.9% of interest rate traders expect the rate cuts to be at 450-475 bps at the coming Fed meeting while 20.1% expect the rate cut to stay the same. At the beginning of the month, 32.1% expected a 50 bps rate cut, while 67.9% anticipated a 25 bps cut.\n\nUnderstanding Inflation Trends and Federal Reserve Strategy\n\nDespite the sticky inflation, IBM's vice chair, Gary Cohn believes that the Fed will cut rates by 100 bps this year. In an interview at CNBC's ‘Money Movers',he suggested that the U.S. is experiencing what a soft landing looks like, with inflation decreasing but not steadily. He indicated that reaching the Fed's 2% target will be challenging, as inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around this level.\n\nCohn noted that for the first time in nearly two decades, the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate, employment, and price stability, after focusing primarily on one at a time. He believes the Fed is making the right decisions and is currently in a delicate position as it missed meeting opportunities this year.\n\nCohn expects that the Fed will implement a total of 100 basis points in rate cuts this year, likely consisting of 25 basis point reductions over the next couple of months. When asked about inflation targets, he expressed a preference for slightly exceeding the target inflation rate, suggesting that a rate of around 2.2% would be more acceptable in a growing economy than undershooting the target.\n\nCohn also highlighted concerns about geopolitical risks and said that global tensions could lead to inflationary pressures by disrupting supply chains and increasing shipping costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we use stock screeners to identify nearly 30 stocks above $100 billion market cap and $10 billion TTM net income. Next, we narrowed our list to 8 stocks that had a 5-year net income compound annual growth rate of above 10% and were most widely held by institutional investors. The most profitable blue chip stocks are listed in ascending order of the hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of 912 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nMarket Cap: $1.937 Trillion\n\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 29.71%\n\nTTM Net Income: $44.42 billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the biggest technology and e-commerce companies in the world. Its operations span e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence industries. The company tops our list of most profitable blue chip stocks.\n\nIts operations are divided into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). For consumers, the company offers a wide selection of products through online and physical stores and emphasizes low prices, fast delivery, and customer service.\n\nOne of Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) significant projects is Kuiper Systems LLC, also known as Project Kuiper. It is a subsidiary of the company founded in 2019 and provides global broadband internet through a satellite constellation in low Earth orbit. The company has invested a substantial amount of money in the project to make it an important player in satellite-based internet services.\n\nOn October 10, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak reiterated a Buy rating for the company stock due to the firm’s confidence in Project Kuiper. Although Kuiper's costs, including launch expenses, hardware, and R&D, are complex, the analyst views the financial impact as manageable.\n\nHe acknowledged the project's delays but believes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) can absorb the estimated $1.5 billion EBIT hit in 2025, which is minimal compared to its projected $75-$80 billion EBIT. Nowak remains optimistic about the company’s financial strength and ability to handle the timing of cost recognition.\n\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the most profitable blue chip stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Walgreens: A New Risk Just Emerged for the Stock",
        "content": "It's been a very difficult year for Walgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA), which has seen its stock lose two-thirds of its value this year. The company has fallen victim to consistent drops in drug reimbursement payments from insurance providers over the years, a poor acquisition, and a cost-conscious consumer.\n\nNow a new threat to the company has emerged: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nThe Amazon threat\n\nThe pharmacy business has long been considered e-commerce-proof. While there have been mail-order and e-commerce pharmacies for quite some time, catering to people with predictable prescription refills, many patients need their medicine immediately, not in a few days.\n\nHowever, Amazon is now looking to turn the industry on its head by rapidly expanding its same-day pharmacy services. Amazon began its e-commerce pharmacy service in 2020 and started testing same-day delivery in a few select cities last October. It expanded to the greater Los Angeles area and New York City in March and now has ambitious plans for 2025.\n\nThe e-commerce giant now plans to offer same-day pharmacy services in 20 more cities next year, including Boston, Dallas, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and San Diego, among others. The move is expected to help the company provide same-day pharmacy delivery to nearly half the U.S. by the end of next year.\n\nAmazon said that for orders placed by 4 p.m., customers will be able to get their medications delivered to them by 10 p.m. the same day. In addition, delivery is free for Prime members. Amazon has even been testing delivering medicine by drones in College Station, Texas, which is home to Texas A&M University.\n\nAmazon's aggressive push into same-day pharmacy delivery comes at a bad time for Walgreens, which recently announced that it could close a quarter of its stores. The move should ultimately be addition by subtraction for Walgreens. As it closes unprofitable stores, the ones that remain open should see a boost as many customers move their scripts to new Walgreens locations. However, with nearby pharmacies closing, the lure of free same-day pharmacy delivery from Amazon could see customers instead opting for the convenience of not having to go to a pharmacy when they are sick.\n\nFor its part, Amazon said it was looking to capitalize on the growing number of \"pharmacy deserts\" that were being created by store closures. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat to do with Walgreens stock?\n\nWhile Amazon's same-day pharmacy delivery service is a new emerging threat, the biggest issue Walgreens continues to face is drug reimbursement pressures. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) have created an untenable situation for pharmacies to the point where, in some instances, they lose money by filling certain prescriptions, including popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor its part, Walgreens is trying to convince PBMs to switch to a new cost-plus model, where pharmacies would be paid for the part they play in helping reduce inflationary pressures on drug prices and the services they provide. However, the company will need to convince the big three PBMs that this model will also benefit them as well.\n\nFor its part, the U.S. government has taken notice of what is going on in the PBM market. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently sued the three big PBMs over their practices, which it says have inflated the cost of insulin prices. A verdict in the government's favor could help the pharmacy industry by leading to improved transparency with PBMs and eliminating the practice of excluding certain drugs from PBM formularies.\n\nAt this point, Walgreens stock is trading at a very inexpensive valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of just over 4.5 times earnings based on this fiscal year's analyst estimates and a similar enterprise value-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) multiple. The latter metric takes into consideration its debt and removes non-cash items. WBA PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nWhile the company continues to deal with reimbursement pressure and now has to deal with a new threat from Amazon offering same-day pharmacy services, I think the stock has the potential to rebound. The closing of unprofitable stores should still be a positive, as would disposing of its VillageMD investment, which has also been a drag on the company's results.\n\nMeanwhile, a favorable ruling by the government against PBMs has the potential to be a catalyst for the stock if they are forced to change their ways. As such, I'd view Walgreens stock as a potential speculative buy, despite the new Amazon threat adding to its list of risks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Is A Goldman Sachs Phase 2 AI Stock For The Next AI Wave",
        "content": "We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks. In this piece, we will look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the list of Goldman Sachs' Phase 2 AI stocks.\n\nWhile consumer technology stocks had soared in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, back then, their share price gains were due to. the growing demand for technology products and services due to lock downs. Now, big technology stocks have persisted in their strong performance despite high interest rates since they have been judged by the market as the top innovators and performers in the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nSince AI is somewhat of a ubiquitous technology, its impact is on several industries. So far, we’ve seen most of the stock market returns related to AI directly tied to just one stock. This stock continued to be the fifth most trending AI stocks as recently as in mid October and its share price returns are nothing short of unbelievable. From its bottom in October 2022 when the split adjusted share price was a mere $11.23, the shares have gained a stunning 1,100%. In other words, if you had invested just $100 back then in the shares and then held onto them for dear life, your investment would be worth $1,200 today.\n\nThis is the magic of AI, a technology that has caught Wall Street and retail investors alike by storm. However, AI’s impact, and its enablement, aren’t limited to the GPU designer we’ve mentioned above. While GPUs are the ‘oil’ for this technology, a wide variety of other components from data center infrastructure, networking equipment, connectivity, and energy all will have to play their part if OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s plans of initially building as many as 7 AI data centers across the US, with each data center guzzling an unbelievable 5 Gigawatts of electricity, are to come to fruition.\n\nThis then makes us ask, what are such stocks that might enable 35 Gigawatts of AI data centers across the US? After all, in order to meet the world’s demand for AI chips, Altman believes that an unfathomable $7 trillion will need to be spent for building 36 chip manufacturing fabs and additional AI data centers. This money has to be spent somewhere, and therein lies the answer to our question. Things get clearer when we look at a detailed research report from investment bank Goldman Sachs. This report segregated the AI sector into four categories.\n\nThe first category only included Wall Street’s AI darling, the second was made of AI capacity providers like server companies, other semiconductor firms, and utilities, the third included firms that sell AI products and software, and the fourth category firms were those that will benefit from AI adoption. In its report, the investment bank shared that year to date in July, the first category had returned 139%. As of mid October, this category has gained 179% on the stock market, so safe to say returns have accelerated despite some turbulence in between. By July, the second group of firms was also doing well. Its returns ranged between ~-8% to ~50%, with the average stock having delivered 22%.\n\nZooming into these firms, the utility sector is one which had particularly impressed the bank. It shared that utilities were the best performing sector in the flagship S&P index between March and May courtesy of their 16% returns. Their three month returns ranked in the 98th percentile since 2022 and were the third highest after 2003 and 2020 rallies. This outperformance is unsurprising given the strong investments in data centers that have taken the US by storm this year.\n\nThese investments have led to estimates suggesting that America’s data center hub, Northern Virginia, will require 11,000 megawatts of electricity by 2035 – demand which has already spurred $5.2 billion in investments for transmission lines and coal fired power plants. Estimates from Boston Consulting Group believe that by 2030, AI will account for 16% of America’s energy consumption and touch 130 gigawatts. For a detailed look at the link between electricity use and data centers, you should read 15 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Jefferies, Citi and Wall Street Analysts.\n\nThe bustling optimism surrounding AI is also reflected in revenue estimates. Goldman’s September 2024 research shows that 2025 revenue estimates of semiconductor firms, software enablers, and hardware firms except semiconductors are roughly 2.3x, 2.05x, and 1.8x over 2019 levels, respectively. Similarly, non semiconductor hardware companies have seen their revenue forecasts for Q4 2025 jump to $450 billion for a $380 billion gain over Q1 2024’s $70 billion. Makes us wonder whether it’s this group of companies that might see a stock mirror the 1,100% returns of Wall Street’s AI darling.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs’ best phase 2 AI stocks, we ranked the 20 stocks with the highest year to date returns and some other big tech and data center names that have announced multi billion dollars in capital expenditure by their year to date performance.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA close up of a confident investor making a decisive transaction in the stock market.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nYear To Date Share Price Gain: 25.94%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest eCommerce company and a dominant player in the cloud computing industry. This offers it an unmatched business diversification, with the eCommerce business providing high volume top line contributions and the cloud business offering a high margin business with stable revenues. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s partnership with Anthropic, a firm set up by former OpenAI employees, has provided it with access to a foundational AI model. When coupled with its in house processors and data center infrastructure, it makes Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) one of the few firms in the world to provide an end to end AI stack to businesses and other users. The firm’s AI software also allows it to improve merchant advertising on its eCommerce site and become an AI beneficiary. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s tools such as Amazon Bedrock provide generative AI for application development and enable broader AI access in the industry.\n\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 22nd on our list of Goldman Sachs' top phase 2 AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations.

This came even as the company invested aggressively in artificial intelligence, AWS, logistics and Project Kuiper, the advisory told investors in a research note. Truist said Amazon remained its favorite mega cap as the company continued to gain share of global e-commerce and improved its value proposition to both merchants and consumers.

        "content": "Only once in U.S. history has a former president who lost reelection after his first term managed to become president again. The last time it happened was in 1892 when Grover Cleveland became the first -- and, so far, only -- president elected for two non-consecutive terms.\n\nBut Cleveland might soon have company. Former President Donald Trump is running neck-and-neck with Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race. If elected, his policies could impact the businesses of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" companies: Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). What's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump wins in November? Former President Donald Trump. Image source: Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead.\n\nTrump's proposals that could impact the Magnificent Seven\n\nThree major Trump proposals could impact the Magnificent Seven the most. The GOP presidential nominee's proposed corporate tax cuts arguably belong at the top of the list.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump signed legislation that overhauled the federal corporate tax rate structure. Previously, large corporations paid federal taxes of 15% to 35%. After the Trump tax cuts, these businesses paid a flat tax of 21%. The former president wants to slash this rate to 15% if he's elected again.\n\nAnother key part of Trump's economic policy for a potential second term is the implementation of across-the-board tariffs. He promises to impose tariffs of up to 20% on all imported products. Trump, who has referred to himself as \"Tariff Man,\" wants to impose tariffs of 60% on goods imported from China. He has also threatened to enact tariffs of 100% on products made in Mexico.\n\nWhen Trump was president before, he was a fan of deregulation. Reducing federal regulations is likely to be a major focus again if he returns to the White House. Trump wants to eliminate 10 existing regulations for every new regulation. One promise that's especially relevant to the Magnificent Seven is his pledge to repeal an executive order signed by President Biden that regulates artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nHow the Magnificent Seven could be affected\n\nPaying less in federal taxes should be good for all the Magnificent Seven. However, the impact of Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts perhaps won't be as great as it might seem. As the following table shows, none of these giant companies pay the 21% federal tax rate in place now.\n\nCompany Effective Tax Rate in the Last Fiscal Year Alphabet 13.9% Amazon 9.7% Apple 14.7% Meta Platforms 17.6% Microsoft 18.0% Nvidia 12.0% Tesla (50% Tax Benefit)\n\nData sources: Company 10-K filings. *Tesla received more tax benefits than it paid in taxes in 2023.\n\nSteeper tariffs could especially impact the Magnificent Seven companies that rely on imported products and components. Although the companies would probably pass the increased costs along to consumers, the higher prices could negatively impact sales.\n\nApple would likely be the hardest hit by tariffs because of its global supply chain. All the others could also feel some effects of higher tariffs. The Magnificent Seven members that generate more revenue from services, particularly Alphabet and Meta, would probably be the least impacted by Trump's proposed tariffs.\n\nWhat about Trump's deregulation focus? I think the major cloud service providers -- Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- could be helped by reduced AI regulations. So would Nvidia and, perhaps to a lesser extent, Meta and Tesla.\n\nHowever, Trump has specifically criticized Alphabet, telling Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo in a recent interview, \"Google has been very bad. They've been very irresponsible. And I have a feeling that Google's going to be close to shut down, because I don't think Congress is going to take it.\" The former president has also called Meta's Facebook \"a true enemy of the people\" in a social media post.\n\nAnd while Tesla CEO Elon Musk supports Trump for president, Trump's proposed policies could hurt Tesla. The GOP presidential nominee has railed against federal incentives for electric vehicles in the past. On the other hand, he told an audience at one of his rallies, \"I'm for electric cars. I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\"\n\nThe best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump wins\n\nSo, what's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump wins in November? I think it's a close contest between Microsoft and Nvidia.\n\nMicrosoft might be helped more by Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts because it pays the highest effective tax rate of the Magnificent Seven companies. Both Microsoft and Nvidia could be hurt to some extent by the former president's tariffs but helped by his regulatory stance. Neither has been singled out for attacks by Trump as Alphabet and Meta have nor have the industries in which they operate been the target of his ire like Tesla.\n\nI believe Nvidia has stronger growth prospects than Microsoft, though. If I had to pick just one Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump returns to the White House, I would buy Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nMicrosoft downgraded at Oppenheimer\n\nOppenheimer analysts downgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock from Outperform to Perform on Tuesday, citing concerns about elevated consensus expectations for both revenue and earnings.\n\nA key issue raised by the firm’s analysts is potential losses stemming from Microsoft's AI partner, OpenAI, which is expected to post a loss of around $5 billion this year. With Microsoft holding a 49% stake, the company could face significant financial impact as a result.\n\nThe downgrade also highlighted slower-than-expected enterprise adoption of AI technologies, which could lead to lower-than-anticipated revenue from AI-related services.\n\nIn addition, Oppenheimer pointed to rising capital expenditures (CapEx), particularly in high-performance computing, such as GPUs and data centers. The firm estimates that Microsoft's CapEx will hit $63 billion by 2025, a 14% year-over-year increase and double what it spent in 2023. Depreciation is also expected to rise by 28%, reaching $29 billion.\n\nThe analysts mentioned that the Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point interest rate cut in September, will likely have a modest effect on Microsoft’s net interest income from its $76 billion cash reserve.\n\nOppenheimer also expressed concerns over Microsoft’s gross and EBITDA margins, which are expected to decline due to rising depreciation and operational costs linked to AI investments.\n\n“This will translate into 3% EPS growth in 1Q25 and we expect weakish guidance for 2025. We also think the Street estimates for EPS growth are ~200bps too high in FY26 and FY27,” analysts said in a note.\n\nFurther risks include potential bottlenecks in data center capacity to meet anticipated GPU shipments and growing competition in the AI space, with other companies narrowing the gap on Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft’s stock currently trades in the middle of its five-year price-to-earnings range of 25x-35x, though Oppenheimer suggests it could drift toward the lower end of that spectrum.\n\nGoldman hikes Nvidia price target after meeting with leadership\n\nGoldman Sachs raised its price target for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $150 from $135 on Friday, reflecting an 11% potential upside.\n\nFollowing a recent investor meeting with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress, and IR representative Stewart Stecker, Goldman Sachs analysts expressed stronger confidence in Nvidia's competitive positioning, particularly as inference workloads become more complex.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We came away from the NDR with a better appreciation of the company's competitive moat and, importantly, the projected increase in Inference workload complexity as well as its implications for future compute demand,\" the bank noted.\n\nGoldman Sachs highlighted several factors underpinning Nvidia’s competitive advantage, including its large installed base, innovation at both the chip and data center levels, and its expanding software offerings.\n\nThe report specifically mentioned domain-specific libraries like Nvidia Parabricks, used for genomics analysis, and Nvidia AI Aerial, which supports cloud-native 5G networks.\n\nThe firm also raised its revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates for FY2026/27 by 7% and 8%, respectively. This adjustment reflects higher cloud capex, strong AI server orders, and an improved outlook for chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) at TSMC.\n\nWells Fargo cuts Amazon rating, price target\n\nWells Fargo cut Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rating to Equal Weight from Overweight earlier in the week, pointing out several challenges that could halt the company’s positive earnings revision momentum.\n\nThe bank also reduced its price target for Amazon to $183 from $225.\n\nAlthough Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains a strong performer, Wells Fargo stated it is \"not enough\" to drive upward estimate revisions in the near term.\n\nKey concerns include Amazon's investments in Project Kuiper, pressure from Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fees, and slowing growth from its advertising business.\n\nThe firm also warned that \"margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well\" and suggested that positive revisions may not return until Amazon issues guidance in July 2025.\n\n“While the market is more prepared for pressure on 4Q OI, we caution that margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well. As such, we move to Equal Weight until visibility into margin expansion resumes,” Wells Fargo’s team wrote.\n\nMoreover, Wells Fargo cut its operating income (OI) estimates for Amazon by $5.4 billion, $4.5 billion, and $5.5 billion for 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively, attributing the reductions to slower monetization of its merchant services and advertising businesses.\n\n\"Amazon remains a margin expansion story,\" according to the bank, but it noted that the rate of this expansion will likely be slower than what the market currently anticipates.\n\nThe note also highlighted rising competition from Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which has priced its fulfillment services 15% lower than Amazon's FBA, adding pressure to Amazon’s market share.\n\nMorgan Stanley disappointed with Robotaxi event\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts voiced disappointment following Tesla's much-anticipated \"We, Robot\" event this week, citing a lack of key information about Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, ride-sharing economics, and a clear go-to-market strategy for autonomous vehicles.\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares dropped nearly 9% Friday, as several analysts pointed to the absence of detailed updates during the event.\n\nTesla did reveal its upcoming \"Cybercab,\" but Morgan Stanley remarked that the presentation lacked meaningful new insights. \"We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation,\" analysts said in a note.\n\nAhead of the event, Morgan Stanley had anticipated significant updates on Tesla’s FSD technology, such as measurable improvements in miles driven without disengagements, but these specifics were not provided.\n\nThe Wall Street firm also expected details on the strategy behind the company's supervised and unsupervised ride-sharing services, including economic analysis and estimates for the total addressable market (TAM).\n\n\"We had expected at least some incremental information around the 'rate of change' of the FSD system,\" it explained.\n\nFurthermore, the event did not provide any meaningful discussion on Tesla’s collaboration with xAI or updates on Tesla’s \"Master Plan 4,\" leaving Morgan Stanley analysts to conclude that the event failed to significantly move forward Tesla’s narrative as an AI-focused company.\n\nGeopolitical tensions could ‘prick the AI bubble’\n\nCapital Economics warned in a Friday note that escalating trade disputes between the US and China, or a sharp rise in tensions between China and Taiwan, represent significant geopolitical risks that could “prick the AI bubble.”\n\nWhile tech stocks have seen strong performance this year, the firm cautioned that the rally could stall as geopolitical risks intensify, especially with the US presidential election approaching.\n\nA central concern is Taiwan’s critical role in the AI supply chain. Taiwanese companies control around 90% of the market for advanced chips and AI servers, key drivers of the AI capital expenditure boom among major tech firms.\n\nAccording to Capital Economics, any disruption in this supply chain due to geopolitical conflict could have severe consequences.\n\n\"China could restrict the flow of highly advanced semiconductor chips and AI servers from Taiwan to the US, thereby breaking the 'AI supply chain,'\" the firm emphasized in a note.\n\nOn the US-China trade front, the report points to potential risks of heightened tensions after the 2024 US presidential election.\n\nIf Donald Trump returns to office, strategists anticipate \"a significant increase in tariffs on Chinese goods\" and a broader shift away from free trade, which would raise costs for tech companies. Even under a Harris administration, which is expected to maintain current export controls, there is still considerable risk to the tech sector.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Microsoft, Amazon rating cuts; Robotaxi day disappoints\n\nMoon race, private competition in focus as space powers gather in Milan\n\nBASF downgraded to 'neutral' by UBS amid earnings growth concerns for 2025\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nAmazon.com\n\nWhat happened? On Monday, Wells Fargo downgraded Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Equalweight with a $183 price target.\n\n*TLDR: WFC sees NT pressures on AMZN from Project Kuiper and FBA fee issues. AMZN’s margin expansion faces competition from Walmart (NYSE:WMT), reducing FBA fees by $2 billion.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Wells Fargo analysts note that while Amazon has been a consistent positive revision story, several factors are likely to pressure revisions in the near term. These include investments in Project Kuiper, anticipated FBA fee pressures, and moderating advertising operating income contributions. The bank’s downgrade comes on the heels of potential caps on margin expansion in the first half of 2025. Consequently, Wells Fargo has reduced its operating income estimates for 2025, 2026, and 2027 by $5.4 billion, $4.5 billion, and $5.5 billion, respectively.\n\nDespite these headwinds, Wells Fargo maintains that Amazon remains a margin expansion story, albeit at a more moderate pace than the market expects. The analysts also highlight the growing competition from Walmart, whose expanding fulfillment capabilities and competitive pricing are likely to impact Amazon’s merchant services more than consumer wallet share. This competition is expected to result in an estimated $2 billion annual reduction in FBA fees.\n\nEqualweight at Wells Fargo means “Total return on stock expected to be -10% to +10% over the next 12 months. “\n\nWells Fargo\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Wolfe Research upgraded Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) to Outperform with a $65 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Wolfe upgraded WFC amid a challenging ~9% EPS reset for 2026. Asset cap removal expected to boost EPS, supporting the upgrade decision.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Wolfe upgraded Wells Fargo amid the challenging ~9% EPS reset for 2026 and the complexities of AML and regulatory risks. The decision comes after noting that WFC shares have significantly lagged behind peers by approximately 2000 basis points since April. The analysts believe that the risks to consensus EPS and Net Interest Income (NII) are now better understood, and the current valuation remains overly discounted, even with deeper cuts.\n\nFurthermore, Wolfe highlights that the removal of the asset cap is expected to provide a high-single-digit EPS boost, which is not yet reflected in the stock’s multiple. This potential tailwind, combined with the improved understanding of risks, supports the analysts’ decision to upgrade WFC.\n\nStory continues\n\nOutperform at Wolfe means “The security is projected to outperform analyst's industry coverage universe over the next 12 months.”\n\nNorwegian Cruise Lines\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, Citi upgraded Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE:NCLH) to Buy with a $30 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Citi sees NCLH’s new strategy balancing yield and cost, mitigating runaway expenses. Potential 30% EPS CAGR if NCLH maintains a 2.5% yield/cost spread.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Citi analysts express confidence in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings’ new strategy, which aims to balance yield and cost, mitigating the risk of runaway expenses. They estimate a 23% three-year EPS CAGR, potentially reaching 30% if NCLH maintains its targeted 2.5% yield/cost spread. This shift from a “quality at all costs” approach to a more balanced strategy is expected to unlock significant pricing opportunities without escalating costs.\n\nThe firm’s conservative long-term estimates suggest substantial earnings upside, even if NCLH falls short of its yield/cost target. Citi’s projections indicate that maintaining the 2.5% spread could lead to a three-year EPS CAGR closer to 30%, highlighting the potential for meaningful earnings growth and multiple expansion compared to current market expectations.\n\nBuy at Citi means “Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks.”\n\nNike\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Truist upgraded Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) to Buy with a $97 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Truist remains cautious on Nike but sees growing optimism as expectations align with reality. Near-term wins include marketing investments, better wholesale relationships, and promoting Caitlin Clark.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Truist has maintained a cautious stance on Nike since the Fall of 2023. While the brokerage still views the turnaround process as long and uncertain, there is growing optimism about Nike’s shares as investor expectations now seem to accurately reflect the company’s current reality. With a team of seasoned company veterans back at the helm, Truist believes Nike is moving in the right direction.\n\nAlthough a fundamental recovery remains a long-term prospect, Truist sees potential for some near-term wins. These include increased investment in marketing, improved wholesale relationships, and the promotion of ambassador Caitlin Clark. The brokerage believes these efforts by the new team should be enough to demonstrate to investors that better times are ahead for Nike.\n\nBuy at Truist means “the stock’s total return is expected to outperform the S&P 500 or relevant benchmark over the next 12-18 months (unless otherwise indicated).”\n\nFerrari\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, JPMorgan upgraded Ferrari NV (NYSE:RACE) to Overweight with a $525 price target.\n\n*TLDR: RACE upgraded on high visibility earnings growth and resilience to China’s slowdown. RACE’s disciplined growth strategy under CEO Vigna results in record pricing, backlog, and future earnings visibility\n\nWhat’s the full story? JPMorgan has upgraded Ferrari shares following a series of investor meetings with CEO Benedetto Vigna and Manager of Investor Relations Aldo Benetti across several major cities in Asia and Australia. The analysts highlighted key investment positives, including unique drivers of high visibility earnings growth, which are expected to be increasingly valued by investors amidst growing macroeconomic, industry, and geopolitical uncertainties. The analysts gained greater confidence in Ferrari’s ability to navigate key debate areas such as electrification and emerged assured that Ferrari will remain resilient against the current slowdown in China, which is affecting other high-end automakers and European luxury goods brands.\n\nJPMorgan emphasized Ferrari’s disciplined growth strategy, rooted in the philosophy of delivering one car less than the market demands, as famously stated by founder Enzo Ferrari. Under CEO Vigna’s leadership, this strategy has resulted in record pricing and backlog, providing excellent visibility into future earnings growth. Ferrari’s ability to reallocate shipments from markets with softer demand, like China, to regions with stronger demand ensures no negative impact on total company profits and even higher margins. Additionally, Ferrari’s upcoming battery electric vehicle promises an exceptional driving experience, and the potential debut of its latest Supercar could provide a significant earnings boost.\n\nOverweight at JPMorgan means “over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe.”\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet calls of the week\n\nMoon race, private competition in focus as space powers gather in Milan\n\nBASF downgraded to 'neutral' by UBS amid earnings growth concerns for 2025\n\nView comments",

        "title": "How Amazon changes local economies when it moves in",
        "content": "When Amazon (AMZN) announced its expansion into Nashville, including a new headquarters there, the move marked the single largest jobs commitment made by a company in Tennessee’s history.\n\nThe data shows the tech giant's arrival has made a difference in the economy too.\n\n“Like any economist, I was skeptical before I saw the results,” said Vikram Pathania, one of Amazon’s principal economists. “You see employment go up, you see income go up, and you see these indicators move positively.”\n\nIn 2023, Amazon’s investments contributed $4 billion to Tennessee’s gross domestic product and supported 15,000 indirect jobs, according to data provided by the company. Additional findings show that when the company moves into a county, that county can expect its employment-to-population ratio to increase by 1.7% on average.\n\nThe company touted that for every 10 jobs that it created directly, nine additional jobs were indirectly created as well.\n\n“The very act of building a new warehouse means hiring local construction companies, and so sometimes you start to notice the effects by year one, definitely by year two. And by year three, the numbers are coming through,” Pathania said. \"But there’s also an indirect channel because we are employing people and putting wages in their pockets. Those people are then going and spending that money at local businesses.\"\n\nAmazon's growing network\n\nAt the company’s Delivering the Future event held this week in Nashville, Amazon showcased its innovations — from artificial intelligence to robotics — and highlighted its presence within the community.\n\n“We’re not just creating jobs — we’re creating different opportunities and pathways that make us a part of the community and not just a corporate citizen within the community,” Amazon’s vice president of worldwide economic development, Holly Sullivan, told Yahoo Finance over the phone.\n\nWhen Amazon first announced plans to open its second North American headquarters (HQ2) in 2017, cities across the US set out to entice it to invest in their communities. An image of the reception area at Amazon's Nashville headquarters, completed in 2021. (Amazon)\n\nThe e-commerce giant initially announced its HQ2 would be split between New York City and Arlington, Va., which offered Amazon $750 million in state taxpayer subsidies. However, the company canceled the New York location after backlash from local grassroots organizers, residents, and politicians, who opposed the billions in government incentives offered to the company.\n\nA year later, Amazon announced plans to invest in Nashville instead, with the goal of creating nearly 5,000 jobs in the music capital. Nashville’s then-mayor, David Briley, hailed it as fantastic news for the city, while the governor called it a “game changer” for Tennessee.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We want to go into locations that support us and support that job growth,” Amazon's Sullivan said. “Nashville is a great example of this. We started with our fulfillment operations, and now we have a major corporate office with over 3,000 employees.”\n\nAmazon completed construction of its office last year, providing 1 million square feet of space for its employees, whose roles range from technical jobs, such as software development engineers, to providing financial and business services.\n\nAmazon has rapidly expanded its global footprint in recent years. In 2020 alone, the e-commerce giant added 300 new warehouses, according to data gathered by Consumer Reports. MWPVL International, a supply chain and logistics consulting firm, found that Amazon operates over 1,300 active locations in the US, occupying 435 million square feet.\n\nAmazon's booming warehouse construction hasn't been well-received by everyone, and some municipalities have placed restrictions on building Amazon's logistics network, citing concerns over pollution, construction, and congestion.\n\nBut when it comes to where Amazon will expand next, the company is focused on technological innovation. Priorities for the business — think artificial intelligence — will drive the thought process about the locations it invests in. As of now, the company has plans to spend more than $100 billion over the next decade on data centers, according to the Wall Street Journal.

        "title": "Amazon.com Inc (AMZN): Most Promising Growth Stock According to Hedge Funds",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other Most Promising Growth Stock According to Hedge Funds.\n\nBull Market and Investor Sentiment\n\nInvestors had been anxiously anticipating the start of a bull market, which the S&P 500 confirmed earlier this year. The bull run has seen the market continue to rise to new record highs, supporting revenue and earnings growth across the board.\n\nFast forward, the upward momentum appears to have peaked, with market indices at record highs. While it was highly expected that stocks would explode on the Federal Reserve offering support to a struggling economy with interest rate cuts, that has not been the case.\n\nREAD ALSO: David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy and 7 Best Nanotech Penny Stocks to Buy.\n\nIt’s become increasingly clear that investors have become more sensitive to growth scares as the global economy faces many issues. Top on the list is the rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that threaten to disrupt supply chain networks. Energy prices rising owing to the escalation of a full-blown war could trigger higher inflation, something that is unsettling the markets.\n\nAnalysts at UBS are already warning investors that they should get overweight on defensive names as global growth slows at the back of deteriorating fundamentals. While UBS doesn’t anticipate a severe downturn, the bank is cautious, advising its clients to focus on important sectors like utilities and pharmaceuticals, which always outperform in a downturn.\n\nWhile investors are increasingly rotating into defensive plays amid concerns about geopolitical tensions and the slowing global economy, Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s Andrew Slimmon recommends against this strategy.\n\n“Now is the time to just be cautious. Don’t chase the defensives that are working because I think when we get to the fourth quarter, that won’t work,” the portfolio manager told CNBC’s “The Exchange.\n\n“While our expectation is for October to remain choppy, we don’t view the overall market action to be bearish and encourage investors to maintain perspective on the longer-term trends,” Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, wrote to clients.\n\nThe sentiments echo the need to focus on high-growth companies. Investors who diversify their portfolio into high-growth companies eventually earn great returns regardless of how much a stock rises or falls in the short term.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts project that S&P 500 stocks will grow at a median annual EPS rate of 8.5% over the next five years. On the other hand, the best growth stocks are well poised to outperform this benchmark by a factor of two to three or more.\n\nFor starters, companies exposed to artificial intelligence spectacles or those leveraging technology continue to deliver record earnings and revenue growth, thus dominating most hedge fund portfolios. Additionally, the most promising growth stocks, according to hedge funds, are those whose core business would be positively impacted by improving consumer purchasing power. As the Fed steers the economy into a soft landing, consumer purchasing is expected to improve, benefiting consumer cyclical stocks. Moreover, the rate cuts will likely benefit growth and tech stocks as well.\n\nMarket fluctuations are inevitable, but the secret to a growth stock’s success lies in the robustness of its core operations. Regardless of whether a stock is rising or falling in the short term, if you consistently invest in a competitively solid business, you’ll eventually reap substantial rewards.\n\nPixabay/ Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the most promising growth stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to find 30 popular growth stocks. Then we selected the 10 that were the most widely held by hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has often been perceived as a technology investment play, given its investment in various tech solutions to strengthen its edge in multiple sectors. Nevertheless, it stands out as one of the most promising growth stocks according to hedge funds for diversifying an investment portfolio in the consumer cyclical sector.\n\nWith the recent interest rate cuts expected to bolster consumer purchasing power, Amazon should be one of the biggest beneficiaries as customers flocking its e-commerce platform.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s long-term prospects lie in the digital marketplace as the Prime program gains widespread recognition. The more benefits Amazon offers through Prime, the more loyal its customers become, allowing it to increase its pricing and thus generate more revenue.\n\nLikewise, the company emerged successful in the online shopping sector by integrating the retail business framework and leveraging its vast scale to provide outstanding service and competitive pricing. This strategy is being replicated in the cloud industry, where it commands a 31% market share.\n\nWhile the company generates most of its revenue from the online marketplace, it reaps most profits from its cloud unit, which is billed as the world’s largest cloud infrastructure. AWS operates at much higher margins, thus subsidizing the growth of Amazon’s lower-margin e-commerce business.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has also sought to diversify its revenue stream by advertising live sports and acquiring the rights to air National Basketball Association and Women’s National Basketball Association games beginning in 2025.\n\nAnalysts expect Amazon’s earnings to grow by nearly 28% yearly over the next three to five years, justifying the stock trading at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 30. Additionally, analysts rate the stock as a buy with an average price target of $223.43, implying a 21.77% upside potential. Based on our Insider Monkey database, by the end of Q2 2024, 308 hedge funds had invested in AMZN, with their total stakes reaching $65.85 billion.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nTwo years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAmid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Scotiabank analyst Nat Schindler recently initiated coverage of the stock with an Outperform rating and $245 price target. The advisory has a high level of confidence that consumers will use Amazon's services more in the future. It is also positive on the company's ability to monetize its artificial intelligence investments. The investment firm expects corporate uses, streamlining customer interactions, speeding code development, storing and contextualizing unstructured data, and other business efficiencies to be the most substantial near- to medium-term opportunities.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) with a Sector Outperform rating and price target of $245 per share.\n\nThe analyst writes that Amazon benefits from a leadership position across all verticals, especially AWS, where they expect revenue growth to exceed consensus estimates beyond 2025.\n\nThe analyst says that AWS's AI business, though early, shows strong demand and is poised for significant growth. Its focus on providing flexible, cost-effective AI solutions positions AWS as a key partner for companies leveraging AI.\n\nConsequently, the analyst expects AWS to maintain ~15% revenue growth with low-30% operating margins beyond 2025.\n\nIn the long term, Schindler expects Amazon's Retail business to grow steadily at 5%-10%, though with lower margins. Growth catalysts like healthcare and grocery services could further boost retail numbers, potentially reaching high single digits.\n\nSchindler anticipates an upside in operating income over the next 2-4 years, fueled by macro tailwinds and cost optimizations.\n\nJP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth says that Amazon remained their top pick.\n\nThe analyst says that they are encouraged by strong AWS growth and continued operational discipline across the business.\n\nAnmuth projects operating income of $16 billion in Q4 and $70 billion in 2025, with AWS growth of 20%+ expected to be driven by easing optimizations, workload migrations, and AI monetization.\n\nNorth America's margins should improve with better shipping, inventory, and automation.\n\nThe analyst expects free cash flow at $58 billion in 2024 and $72 billion in 2025, with potential capital returns next year.\n\nThe analyst adds that investors expect Q3 net sales of $157 billion—$158.5 billion, AWS growth of 20%- 21%, and operating income of $14 billion—$15 billion+.\n\nPrice Action: AMZN shares are up 1.42% at $189.30 at the last check Friday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nAmazon Prime Big Deal Days 2024 Scores Record-Breaking Sales\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for AMZN\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Deutsche Bank Initiates Coverage On Buy Feb 2022 Tigress Financial Maintains Buy Feb 2022 Credit Suisse Maintains Outperform\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for AMZN\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Scotiabank initiated coverage on three major tech giants—Alphabet (Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms—assigning Sector Outperform (Buy) ratings to Google and Amazon, while rating Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as Sector Perform (Neutral).\n\nThe analysts, in a note Friday, highlighted key differences in their growth trajectories and long-term competitive positions, helping to explain their ratings.\n\nThey explained that one of the primary distinctions between these companies is the predictability of future consumer usage.\n\n\"In the cases of Amazon and Google, we have a high level of confidence that consumers will use their services more in the future,\" said Scotiabank, while Meta’s future usage is less predictable.\n\nAccording to the bank, hours in a day are the \"ultimate limited resource,\" and while Amazon and Google help consumers save time, Meta’s business model relies on keeping users engaged for longer periods.\n\n\"Amazon and Google give you time, Meta sells your time,\" they stated. Amazon and Google make money by quickly directing users off their platforms—through paid search ads for Google and completed transactions for Amazon—while Meta earns by increasing user engagement, similar to traditional media models.\n\nScotiabank is also optimistic about the company’s potential in artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon and Google are expected to capitalize the most on AI investments, with their cloud services playing a pivotal role in monetizing corporate AI applications.\n\nIn contrast, Scotiabank sees Meta’s AI efforts as more focused on improving ad targeting and consumer engagement, which they describe as \"incremental rather than revolutionary.\"\n\nOverall, while Scotiabank sees strong potential for Amazon and Google in AI-driven growth, they are less certain about Meta’s long-term competitive edge in the evolving tech landscape\n\nRelated Articles\n\nScotiabank Starts big tech coverage: Amazon and Google Outperform, Meta Neutral\n\nNippon Steel to sell Calvert JV to ArcelorMittal if U.S. Steel deal completed\n\nStrong bank earnings push S&P 500, Dow to record highs\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nVenu Krishna, Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that he is not revising his S&P 500 year-end projection of 5,600 because he believes stock valuations are “full.”\n\n“If you see what’s happening, numbers (earnings)  have been cut sharply going into the end. What is still anchoring the market is big tech, even though their earnings themselves are kind of decelerating. Then seasonality comes into play. October is the weakest month, and you don’t want to get ahead of that.”\n\nAsked whether he does not believe the market really broadened out, Krishna said while there were some signs of market broadening, the “anchor” of the rally remains big tech, which according to him, are just six stocks.\n\nMoving beyond the earnings and valuations debate, another factor still impacting investor sentiment is the Federal Reserve’s next moves.\n\nTalking about the latest Fed minutes released October 9,  Wolfe Research’s Stephanie Roth said on CNBC that a “substantial” majority of Fed officials wanted a 50-basis-point rate cut. However, she said in the next meeting, a 50bps rate cut is “off the table.”\n\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news. With each stock we mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN): Retail Growth and AWS Challenges Amid AI Investments\n\nPixabay/ Public Domain\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\n\nTalking to CNBC, Brad Gerstner explained why he is invested in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\n“Because we think their retail business their margins are gonna go up. Jassy has absolutely found religion. He’s in animal mode when it comes to making sure they are running as efficiency as possible.”\n\nHowever, the investor said there is “a lot of worry” when it comes to AWS amid concerns that the company might be at risk of losing market share to Azure. Brad Gerstner said Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) “has to invest” in Anthropic because MSFT currently has an edge because of its OpenAI investments.\n\nAWS’s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\n\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\n\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October. While we acknowledge the potential Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "AI 'Godfather' Yoshua Bengio: We're 'creating monsters more powerful than us'",
        "content": "Whether you think artificial intelligence will save the world or end it — there’s no question we’re in a moment of great enthusiasm. AI, as we know, may not have existed without Yoshua Bengio.\n\nCalled the “Godfather of Artificial Intelligence,\" Bengio, 60, is a Canadian computer scientist who has devoted his research to neural networks and deep learning algorithms. His pioneering work has led the way for the AI models we use today — such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude.\n\n\"Intelligence gives power and whoever controls that power — if it's human level or above — is going to be very, very powerful,\" Bengio said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. \"Technology in general, is used by people who want more power: economic dominance, military dominance, political dominance. So before we create technology that could concentrate power in dangerous ways — we need to be very careful.\"\n\nIn 2018, Bengio and two colleagues — former Google (GOOG) VP Geoffrey Hinton (winner of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics), and Meta (META)’s chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun — won the Turing Award (known as the Noble Prize of computing). In 2022, Bengio was the most cited computer scientist in the world. And Time magazine has named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nDespite helping to invent the technology, Bengio has now become a voice of caution in the AI world. That caution comes as investors continue to show a great deal of enthusiasm on the space — bidding up shares of AI plays to fresh records this year.\n\nAI chip darling Nvidia's (NVDA) stock is up 162% year to date, for example, compared to the S&P 500's 21% gain.\n\nThe company is now valued at a staggering $3.25 trillion according to Yahoo Finance data, trailing Apple (AAPL) slightly for the title of most valuable company in the world.\n\nI interviewed Bengio on the possible threats of AI and which tech companies are getting it right.\n\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhy should we be concerned about human-level intelligence?\n\n\"If this falls in the wrong hands, whatever that means, that could be very dangerous. These tools could help terrorists pretty soon, and they could help state actors that wish to destroy our democracies. And then there is the issue that many scientists have been pointing out, which is the way that we're training them now — we don't see clearly how we could avoid these systems becoming autonomous and have their own preservation goals, and we could lose control of these systems. So we're on a path to maybe creating monsters that could be more powerful than us.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOpenAI, Meta, Google, Amazon — Which big AI player is getting it right?\n\n\"Morally, I would say the company that's behaving the best is Anthropic [major investors include Amazon and Google]. But I think they all have biases because of the economic structure in which their survival depends on being among the leading companies, and ideally being the first to arrive at AGI. And that means a race — an arms race between corporations, where the public safety is likely to be the losing objective.\n\nAnthropic is giving a lot of signs that they care a lot about avoiding catastrophic outcomes. They were the first to propose a safety policy where there's a commitment that if the AI ends up having capabilities that could be dangerous, then they would stop that effort. They are also the only ones along with Elon Musk who've been supporting SB 1047. In other words, saying 'yes, with some improvements we agree that having more transparency of the safety procedures and results and liability if we cause major harm'.\n\nThought on the huge run up on AI stocks, like Nvidia?\n\n\"What I think is very certain is the long term trajectory. So if you're in it for the long term, it's a fairly safe bet, except if we don't manage to protect the public... [Then] the reaction could be such that everything could crash right? Either because there's a backlash from societies against AI in general or because really catastrophic things happen and our economic structure crumbles.\n\nEither way, it would be bad for investors. So I think investors, if they were smart, would understand that we need to move cautiously and avoid the kind of mistakes and catastrophes that could harm our future collectively.\"\n\nThought on the AI chips race?\n\n\"I think the chips clearly are becoming an important piece of the puzzle, and of course, it's a bottleneck. It's very likely that the need for humongous amounts of computation is not going to disappear with the kinds of events, the scientific advances I can envision in the coming years, and so it's going to be a strategic value to have high end AI chips capabilities — and all the steps in the supply chain will matter. There are very few companies able to do it right now, so I expect to see a lot more investments going on and hopefully a bit of a diversification.\"\n\nWhat do you think about Salesforce introducing 1 billion autonomous agents by 2026?\n\n\"Autonomy is one of the goals for these companies, and it's a good reason for it economically, commercially, this is going to be a huge breakthrough in terms of the number of applications that this opens up. Think about all the personal assistant applications. It requires a lot more autonomy than what current state of the art systems can provide. So it's understandable they would aim for something like this. The fact that Salesforce (CRM) is thinking they can reach it in two years, for me, is concerning. We need to have guardrails, both in terms of governments and technologically, before that happens.\"\n\nGovernor Newsom vetoed California's SB 1047 — Was that a mistake?\n\n\"He didn't give reasons that made sense to me, like wanting to regulate not only the big systems but all the small ones... There's a possibility that things can move quickly — we talked about a few years. And maybe even if it's a small possibility, like 10% [chance of disaster] we need to be ready. We need to have regulation. We need to have companies already going through the moves of documenting what they're doing in a way that's going to be consistent across the industry.\n\nThe other thing is the companies were worried about lawsuits. I talked to a lot of these companies, but there's already tort law, so there could be lawsuits anytime, if they create harm. And what the bill was doing about liability is reducing the scope of lawsuits... There were 10 conditions, you need to have all of these conditions for the law to support the lawsuit. So I think it was actually helping. But there's an ideological resistance against any involvement — anything that's not the status quo, any more involvement of the state into the affairs of these AI labs.\"\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Why Amazon’s Zoox is taking a different approach to autonomous taxis",
        "content": "While Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk teased details about its robotaxi, called the Cybercab, Amazon’s (AMZN) self-driving subsidiary Zoox has embarked on its own dramatic departure from transportation as we know it.\n\nThe difference is clear from aesthetics alone. Zoox's robot taxi has no steering wheel, no driver’s seat, and no pedals. The four seats face inward, as the toaster-like cabin operates bidirectionally, meaning it can drive both ways.\n\n“It’s a vehicle specifically made for people and not for drivers,” said co-founder and chief technical officer Jesse Levinson. “We realized if there isn't a human driver, you can completely change [the riding experience].”\n\nZoox touts its vehicles as purpose-built, designed specifically for autonomy. Levinson hopes that approach helps propel Zoox to the front of the pack as the company prepares to launch commercial driverless taxi rides in Las Vegas next year. Zoox, a self-driving vehicle owned by Amazon, is seen at the company's factory in Fremont, California, U.S. July 19, 2022. REUTERS/Carlos Barria (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nZoox's entry into the nascent market would pit it against Google’s (GOOG) Waymo, the market leader in robotaxis so far, and Tesla (TSLA), which offered more hints this week about the evolution of its full self-driving technology.\n\nOn Thursday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled the Cybercab prototype at the company's \"We, Robot\" event, saying that the EV maker plans to sell the robotaxi for $30,000 and start production before 2027, though Musk's timelines have been delayed before. It also revealed a Robovan concept capable of transporting 20 people.\n\nBefore the event, Levinson was quick to point out that the technology Zoox uses is entirely different from that of Tesla. Unlike the Amazon-owned firm, which uses a network of sensors, cameras, and mics, Tesla relies on a camera-based vision system, which is seen as more affordable. Musk has also pushed for the cars to be able to operate in any environment, unlike Google's Waymo, which digitally maps the routes it operates in with a human behind the wheel first before the autonomous cars are deployed. Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk rides in Tesla's robotaxi at an unveiling event in Los Angeles, California, on Oct. 10, 2024. Tesla/Handout via REUTERS (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nMore consequentially, according to Levinson, Tesla’s autopilot currently uses a driver assistance system, which requires drivers to retake control of the car at any time. That’s fundamentally different from the autonomy-first approach that Zoox is taking, he said.\n\n“It might sound like that's a small difference, but it's actually a giant difference because it means that no matter what's happening in your environment, and it means no matter what's going wrong with your sensors or if they're covered up or if they're occluded, or even if they fail, you still have to be able to keep driving safely,” he said. “Teslas and passenger cars today, they're just not designed that way. And so it's a really, a very different hardware and software product entirely.”\n\nStory continues\n\nZoox's robotaxi model\n\nAutonomous cars remain an intriguing ambition for tech companies, despite delays in the wider rollout of driverless taxi services. Consulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimates the global robotaxi market could generate as much as $1.3 trillion in revenue by 2030.\n\nBut implementation has been fragmented, with commercial operations limited to a handful of cities. Companies that have successfully made it to market have opted to retrofit cars intended for drivers to achieve full autonomy.\n\nZoox’s approach pivots away from that model. The company has specifically relied on a sensor suite that includes lidar, radar, and cameras to navigate a limited stretch of roads. The vehicles, built in-house, include a sound bar surrounding the cabin, with mics built into the interior and exterior of the vehicle, in part to enhance the detection of emergency vehicle sirens.\n\nWhile Zoox assembles vehicles at its own manufacturing facility in California, the company purchases large modules from suppliers to control overall costs tied to automotive manufacturing, according to the firm. Zoox, a self-driving vehicle owned by Amazon, is displayed during a media tour at the company's factory in Fremont, Calif., on July 19, 2022. REUTERS/Carlos Barria (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nLevinson said vehicles are equipped with redundancies for critical components to ensure safety. There are two braking systems, two steering racks, two batteries, two motors, and four sensor pods in each corner.\n\n\"If any one of those components has a hardware or software failure, not only is it still safe, but we can actually keep driving and take the customer to their destination,\" Levinson said. \"Just like if there's a component failure on an airplane, you still land the plane, you don't drop out of the sky.\"\n\nThose redundancies are coupled with human technicians, who monitor the vehicles for safety. While the cars operate fully autonomously, technicians step in on rare occasions to guide the vehicle when it encounters unfamiliar situations, like construction zones, according to Levinson.\n\n\"The vehicles are only getting help from humans only 1% of the time,\" Levinson said. \"As it gets more sophisticated, the amount of time they’re asking for help goes down and down and down and down. We don’t think it ever truly gets to zero, but it doesn’t have to get to zero. It just has to go down to something that’s very small.\"\n\nFor now, Levinson said he’s confident that Zoox is on the right track for the future. It is on target to expand beyond its 5-mile test loop in Las Vegas, with commercial service set to launch in 2025.\n\n“In the long term, more and more companies will converge on something like this,” he said, pointing to his vehicle, “where you've really imagined the experience without needing all the legacy of a car.”\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Pivotal Research Group has initiated coverage of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a \"buy\" rating, citing the company’s strong organic growth potential and its robust position across several sectors.\n\nIn a note dated Friday, analysts at Pivotal flagged Amazon’s broad expansion opportunities, particularly driven by its cloud services division, Amazon Web Services, which they predict will grow from 17% of total revenue in 2024 to over 35% within the next five years.\n\nThis substantial growth is expected to be fueled by the increasing adoption of cloud technologies, particularly as artificial intelligence capabilities continue to expand across industries.\n\nBeyond cloud services, Pivotal pointed out that Amazon has vast potential to grow its e-commerce and retail businesses by leveraging its infrastructure to expand into new markets, especially in sectors like grocery and pharmacy.\n\nThe company’s international footprint is also expected to expand, along with improvements in delivery speeds and fulfillment operations.\n\nAmazon's advertising business, which is already the third-largest globally, is projected to capture more market share, further diversifying its revenue streams.\n\nPivotal also noted Amazon’s ability to develop new revenue channels through technological advancements like robotics, AI, and autonomous vehicles.\n\nAnalysts at Pivotal argue that these emerging technologies will not only support operational efficiency but could also lead to margin expansion over the next five years, driving operating margins up from the current 10% to approximately 20% by 2029.\n\nKey to Amazon’s value proposition, as per Pivotal, is its ability to capitalize on scale, efficiency, and higher-margin businesses like AWS and advertising.\n\nThese factors, combined with potential cost reductions through AI and automation, place Amazon in a strong position to continue its dominance in the technology sector.\n\nDespite the bullish outlook, Pivotal also warned of several risks that could affect Amazon’s trajectory. These include regulatory pressures, as the company faces potential antitrust actions, and concerns that Amazon may lag behind competitors in AI development.\n\nAdditionally, the Kuiper satellite project, aimed at providing global internet coverage, poses a financial risk, although it is seen as a long-term bet that could enhance Amazon’s logistics and retail capabilities.\n\nPivotal values Amazon using a discounted cash flow model, forecasting a 30% annual growth in free cash flow per share, supported by strong growth in AWS and advertising.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe brokerage has set a year-end 2025 price target of $260 for Amazon’s stock, reflecting confidence in the company’s ability to sustain its market leadership while expanding into new high-growth areas​.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPivotal Research begins Amazon coverage, sees strong growth with $260 PT\n\nRussian court orders seizure of $155.8 million in JPMorgan Chase funds in VTB lawsuit\n\nFastenal shares gain over 2% as Q3 earnings top estimates\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI News You Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\n\nThe AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification.\n\nAnother notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "title": "Meet the Unstoppable Growth Stock That Could Join Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft in the $3 Trillion Club by 2029",
        "content": "It's amazing how much things can change in just 20 years. Two decades ago, industrial and energy stalwarts General Electric and ExxonMobil were the most valuable companies when measured by market cap, worth $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively. Jump ahead to 2024, and technology concerns are leading the way.\n\nTopping the list are three of the world's most recognizable tech companies. Apple leads the pack at $3.4 trillion (as of this writing). Nvidia and Microsoft are trailing close behind, with market caps of $3.1 trillion and $3 trillion, respectively.\n\nWith a market cap of just $1.9 trillion, it might seem premature to suggest that Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has all the attributes necessary for membership in the $3 trillion club. However, the stock has gained 42% over the past year and 109% over the past five years, and its rebound appears poised to continue.\n\nRecent improvements in the economy, the company's strong market position, and its measured adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) could be the drivers needed to fuel Amazon's membership in this elite fraternity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nImproving performance\n\nThe past several years have been rife with challenges, not the least of which was an economic downturn fueled by decades-high inflation. There's been a vast improvement in recent months, however, as consumer sentiment in September reached its highest point in five months and the Federal Reserve Bank began its long-awaited campaign of interest rate cuts.\n\nThe improving economic conditions are favorably impacting Amazon's results. In the second quarter, net sales of $148 billion climbed 10% year over year, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.26 nearly doubled.\n\nHelping fuel the robust results were improvements from each of the company's major operating segments. Online sales in the U.S. increased 9%, while international sales climbed 7%. Perhaps most important was a reacceleration from Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- the company's cloud computing business -- which jumped 19%, its highest rate of growth since late 2022.\n\nEqually important is advertising -- the company's fastest-growing business -- which increased 20%, as Amazon is working to become a major player in the ad world.\n\nAn industry leader -- in more ways than one\n\nAmazon is the undisputed leader in the realm of e-commerce, which is an area it pioneered. The company accounted for 38% of U.S. digital retail sales last year, more than its next 15 largest rivals combined, according to data compiled by eMarketer. That dominance is expected to continue in 2024, with the company expected to nab 40% of online sales in the U.S. this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has long employed AI to maintain a competitive advantage over its rivals. Amazon uses AI to make product recommendations to customers and predict and maintain adequate inventory levels at its distribution centers and warehouses. The company also uses AI-powered robots to stock shelves and gather merchandise for shipping, and deploys these advanced algorithms to determine the most efficient delivery routes.\n\nAmazon is also the leader in cloud computing, another business it pioneered. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the top provider of cloud infrastructure services, with 33% of the market in the second quarter, with Microsoft Azure at No. 2 and Alphabet's Google Cloud at No. 3, with 20% and 10% of the market respectively, according to research firm Canalys. Amazon offers one of the largest repositories of AI models for its cloud customers, which has helped reaccelerate its cloud growth.\n\nLast but certainly not least is Amazon's digital advertising business. The company displays ads on its e-commerce website, Prime Video, Freevee, Amazon Music streaming services, its Twitch video game streaming platform, and more. The company uses AI to help ensure the advertising reaches its target market. The results are undeniable, as advertising has been Amazon's fastest-growing business for several years running.\n\nThe path to $3 trillion\n\nAmazon currently boasts a market cap of roughly $1.9 trillion, which means it will take stock price gains of roughly 57% to drive its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Amazon is expected to generate revenue of $635 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Amazon would have to grow its revenue to roughly $998 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.\n\nWall Street is currently forecasting revenue growth for Amazon of 11% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2029. It's worth noting that Amazon has grown its annual revenue by nearly 400% over the past decade, so those expectations could well be conservative.\n\nFurthermore, Amazon is currently selling for roughly 3.2 times sales, a slight discount compared to its average multiple of more than 3.3 over the past five years. That's a pretty attractive price to pay for a company with so many ways to win.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Jeff Bezos-Led Amazon Almost Ran Out Of Cash 24 Years Ago. At $400B, It Is Now Projected To Have As Much Cash As Apple And Microsoft Combined By 2027: Here's More\n\nJeff Bezos’ Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) once nearly ran out of cash 24 years ago, during the dot-com bubble crisis of 2000. It was once reportedly left with just 10 months of cash, with its stock price plunging to $7 from $107.\n\nFast forward to 2024, Amazon is expected to have nearly as much cash on its balance sheet as rivals Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) combined by 2027.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\n\nWhat Happened: Amazon is projected to amass $127.4 billion in cash and short-term investments by the end of the year, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, reported Business Insider.\n\nThis figure surpasses the cash reserves of tech giants Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft, which stand at $112.8 billion and $108.1 billion, respectively.\n\nBy 2027, Amazon’s cash reserves are expected to approach $400 billion, a significant shift for a company traditionally focused on reinvestment rather than cash accumulation.\n\nTrending: ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\nWall Street is now speculating whether Amazon will follow in the footsteps of other tech companies by returning some of this cash to shareholders through buybacks or dividends.\n\nApple is projected to have a cash pile of $106.51 billion, while Microsoft is expected to amass $300.88 billion, putting the combined total at $407.39 billion for two of the world's most valuable companies by market capitalization.\n\nSee Also: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nFor context, during the dot-com bubble crash in 2000, Amazon's stock plummeted and the company's cash reserves were falling, too.

This move followed a Wells Fargo downgrade, citing slowing growth and increased competition.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon is preparing for the holiday season by boosting its workforce by 250,000 to meet the demands of the retail surge.

        "title": "Cramer Says Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Always Comes Back",
        "content": "We recently published an article titled, Jim Cramer on Netflix and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other stocks discussed by Jim Cramer.\n\nRecently, Mad Money’s host, Jim Cramer addressed what he called a “ridiculous plethora of sell-side downgrades,” noting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.94%, the S&P 500 decreased by 0.96%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped by 1.18% on Monday. While he acknowledged the session’s poor performance, he cautioned that paying too much attention to downgrades can be detrimental for long-term investors.\n\nCramer urged investors not to get overly influenced by the negative sentiment on Wall Street and emphasized the importance of staying committed to strong companies, even when their stock prices experience volatility. He recounted the history of the bull market, stating:\n\n“When I look at the history of this incredible bull market, and it has been an incredible bull market, it’s littered with buy-to-hold, hold-to-sell, buy-to-hold, hold-to-sell. These downgrades scare you out of amazing stocks at levels that may temporarily be too high, but will recover later. If you listen to the downgrades, though, you’ll never recover with it.”\n\nIn discussing the challenges investors face, Cramer pointed out that many get rattled by analyst downgrades and might sell their shares in solid companies, which can make it difficult to buy back in later.\n\n“In the last decade, the toughest thing to do is to hold on to good stocks. But analysts and commentators love to take aim at big long-term winners. Their jeremiads have scared so many people out of some amazing gains.”\n\nHe observed that complacency can be prevalent on Wall Street, with bullish investors often overlooking risks while bearish ones miss out on potential opportunities. For those considering action based on a downgrade, Cramer advised waiting for a bounce to sell, but he noted that timing such moves is “incredibly hard,” even for seasoned traders.\n\nCramer emphasized that when analysts downgrade stocks that have already taken a hit and overlook positive aspects, it can create a challenging environment. However, he believes it is still possible to profit. Here’s what he said:\n\n“I need you to understand that when analysts downgrade after stocks have already been hammered, when really good investors ignore the positives, then, it may be a grim time. But not so grim that we can’t make money by focusing on the fundamentals of the companies. And not just the economy, the Fed, interest rates and oil.”\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were mentioned by Jim Cramer during his episodes of Mad Money on October 7 and October 8. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Cramer Says Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Always Comes Back\n\nCramer Says Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Always Comes Back\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global powerhouse in the retail industry, offering a wide array of consumer products through both online and physical platforms. Recently, Jim Cramer discussed Wells Fargo’s downgrade of Amazon. He noted the stock’s drop from $184 to $161 but its recent rise to $186. He said:\n\n“First downgrade, Amazon by Wells Fargo titled “Positive Revision Story on Pause Reducing to Equal Weight”. Totally get it, lots of headwinds, stock’s abused from the so-called bad quarter when Amazon fell from $184 to $161. Since then, it’s traded as high as $195, but it’s $186 as of last week. It’s time to sell? I’m not so sure.\n\nWhat do these analysts fear? Amazon spending a lot on a ton of initiatives, worries about Walmart impact. So there’s a slight estimate cut, too. Wait a second. I say. How many times, how many times has Amazon been up against headwinds? Do you know how many times the company’s made some inexplicable moves? This is nothing new. Yet Amazon has always come back. It’s in their culture. It’s in their DNA. It always does.”\n\nCramer emphasized that the company has historically faced challenges and always rebounded. He suggested that while the stock may dip, he believes it will recover again. He added:\n\n“I remember a year and a half ago when I was screaming at them because Amazon Web Services was underperforming. Came right back. Last time they reported, I was in disbelief at the Olympics and the attempted assassination of Donald Trump led to a light third-quarter sales guide. I was apoplectic at the Alexa losses and what happens? Comes right back.\n\nSo I say knock yourself out and sell it if you have to. Let me ask you, did you sell Amazon at $161 after that last supposedly bad quarter? How did it feel when the stock didn’t bounce to $195? Once again, I think it’s just a matter of time before Amazon bounces back. As usual. No hurry. Stock does seem to be headed lower, I’ve no doubt about that. I get it. But sell to buy it lower? Can you really get back in that? Too hard.”\n\nWhile Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) generates a significant portion of its revenue from its retail operations, it finds a substantial share of its profits through Amazon Web Services (AWS), which stands as one of the largest cloud infrastructure providers worldwide. This segment operates with considerably higher margins compared to retail.\n\nThe ability to provide discounts, free shipping, and affordable hardware options for Prime members has been pivotal in Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) growth strategy. With over 200 million Prime subscribers globally, the company has cultivated a loyal customer base. As of the second quarter of 2024, AWS commanded a significant 33% share of the cloud infrastructure market.\n\nIt reported mixed outcomes in its second-quarter earnings report. The company saw revenue rise by 10% to reach $148 billion, which fell slightly short of analysts’ expectations. However, it reported a notable increase in GAAP net income, which surged 94% to $1.26 per share, exceeding forecasts.\n\nOverall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of stocks discussed by Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "In a significant leap forward for online retail, Amazon’s (AMZN) second Prime Day event has emerged as the company’s largest October shopping event to date, it said in statement on Thursday.\n\nFollowing closely on the heels of July’s Prime Day, which already set high expectations, this year’s October event saw increased participation among Prime members. More shoppers took advantage of early holiday deals, pushing sales and the number of items sold beyond previous records for October, Amazon said.\n\nDuring the two-day event, which Amazon branded as “Prime Big Deal Day” and which took place in 19 countries, Prime members worldwide saved over $1 billion across millions of deals, with significant discounts across categories such as electronics, home goods, beauty, and apparel.\n\nIndependent sellers, which account for over 60% of sales, also reported record sales during the event, offering discounts on items like blow dryers, electrolyte mix, and mascara.\n\nAmazon, which boasts 180 million Prime members, said that millions of users leaned on Rufus, its generative AI shopping assistant, for personalized deal recommendations and answers to product questions.\n\nDoug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, stated that the event “marked a strong start to the holiday shopping season.” He added that the company is “excited to deliver for customers this holiday, with compelling selection, value, and convenience.”\n\nAmazon said shoppers can expect more deals leading up to the holidays, including a Holiday Beauty Haul, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday. To meet demand, the company plans to hire 250,000 seasonal employees. With two Prime Day-events under its belt, Amazon continues to further solidify its position as a leader in the e-commerce landscape.\n\nEarlier this week, the company said it was doubling down on pharmacies with plans to open new pharmacies in 20 cities across the U.S. in 2025. The move aims to give more customers access to same-day delivery for their prescriptions.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tesla’s (TSLA) Robotaxi Launch Comes with Opportunities and Risks",
        "content": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), the leading EV maker in the United States, is scheduled to debut its highly anticipated robotaxi on October 10 at a special event named We, Robot at Warner Bros. (WBD) Studios in California. The launch of Cybercab, the robotaxi, will present Tesla with new opportunities and risks as the company gears up to navigate stiff competition from the likes of Waymo and increased regulatory scrutiny for its full self-driving technology. Despite short-term risks, I am bullish on Tesla as I believe the company’s technological investments will pave the way for robust long-term earnings growth.\n\nWe, Robot Is More than Just Robotaxis\n\nTesla’s robotaxi, Cybercab, is likely to be a two-seater compact vehicle with a stainless steel finish. The company is expected to introduce a prototype for the Cybercab tomorrow. Tesla is also expected to announce the timing of production and the planned number of vehicles for the next couple of years, giving investors an idea about the investments required to mass produce Cybercabs to pursue a future as a robotaxi company.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, Tesla is likely to announce a dual approach to monetize autonomous ridesharing by unveiling a supervised autonomous ridesharing service alongside the highly anticipated fully autonomous ridesharing platform. In addition, according to Deepwater Asset Management, the event would not be all about robotaxis. The investment management company co-founded by Gene Munster believes Tesla will preview its low-cost EV during this event. Deepwater predicts this low-cost model to be named Model 2 and start at a price of $25,000.\n\nThis would be a major development for Tesla as the company has been under pressure in global markets due to its inability to compete with low-cost EVs launched by Chinese automakers. In fact, BYD Company Limited (BYDDF) surpassed Tesla last year to become the best-selling EV brand in the world. Deepwater also expects Tesla to introduce a Cybervan, a fully autonomous passenger van capable of transporting 8-10 people.\n\nTesla Will Benefit from Autonomous Ridesharing Growth\n\nOne of the key factors behind my bullish stance on Tesla is the company’s potential to emerge as a leader in the global autonomous ridesharing market, which is expected to grow exponentially in the next decade. According to Global Market Insights, this industry was valued at just $910 million in 2023 but is projected to grow at a stellar annual rate of 64% through 2032, lifting the market value to almost $66 billion.\n\nThe growing regulatory support around the world and technological advancements will play key roles in this expected growth. The rapid urbanization in populous regions calls for efficient transportation solutions, and autonomous ridesharing has been identified as one possible solution to address this demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne major advantage Tesla has over its peers is its access to real-world self-driving data. According to Ark Invest’s estimates, Tesla customers drive approximately 5 million miles per day in FSD mode compared to just 70,000 miles for Waymo. This access to real-world data should enable Tesla to scale faster by investing in technological upgrades, potentially helping the company capture a meaningful share of the autonomous ridesharing market.\n\nCommercialization of Robotaxis Will Face Challenges\n\nAlthough I am bullish on Tesla’s robotaxi prospects, the company is likely to face a few challenges as it attempts to commercialize the Cybercab. One major challenge is the stiff competition in the industry. Google-owned Waymo has already made its presence felt in a few U.S. cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Austin. Last month, Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana announced on LinkedIn that Waymo had surpassed 100,000 paid trips per week, which highlights the traction that the autonomous ridehailing platform has gained in the recent past.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL), Waymo’s parent, recently announced a $5 billion investment in the self-driving car business, which is an indication that big tech giants are gearing up to aggressively invest in autonomous driving, threatening Tesla’s path to commercialization. In addition to Waymo, Tesla faces competition from several other self-driving startups, such as Cruise, owned by General Motors (GM), and Zoox, acquired by Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN). In global markets, the biggest competition stems from Chinese Internet giant Baidu (BIDU), which has made stellar progress with its self-driving unit, Apollo Go.\n\nAnother challenge that Tesla would face is continued pressure on operating margins as the company will be forced to invest aggressively to upgrade manufacturing plants to support mass production of robotaxis. Potential factory downtime required to upgrade facilities may exacerbate this challenge. Still, I believe Tesla’s vertically integrated business model, which allows the company to manage costs efficiently while investing in self-driving technology, will help the company offer autonomous rides at a more affordable cost than many of its competitors in the long run, paving the way for competitive advantages.\n\nIs Tesla a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?\n\nTesla seems well-positioned to benefit from the launch of robotaxis in the long term despite facing several challenges on the path toward commercialization. However, RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan believes it’s too early to be excited about the robotaxi launch, given that this is a very long-term play. However, he believes the robotaxi business unit will account for half of Tesla’s valuation in the long term, which reveals his positive long-term stance on this business unit.\n\nCFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson also believes the short-term optimism on robotaxis may be displaced since a true driverless taxi is many years away. In a note yesterday, the analyst claimed that Tesla still has a long way to go to achieve Level 4 autonomy.\n\nOverall, based on the ratings of 35 Wall Street analysts, the average Tesla price target is $207.83, which implies downside of 15% from the current market price.\n\nWhile I acknowledge some of the short-term challenges limiting Tesla’s growth, I believe the company will continue to grow at a stellar pace in the next decade, aided by its strong market position in the North American EV sector, the expected success of its energy storage business, and the diversification into robotaxis.\n\nTakeaway\n\nTesla is expected to introduce its robotaxi prototype on October 10, marking the most important product unveil since the Model 3 launch, according to CEO Elon Musk. The company may face several commercialization challenges for the robotaxi, but the long-term outlook is promising. Tesla seems well-positioned to enjoy durable competitive advantages in the EV space and the autonomous ridesharing market, which should pave the way for robust earnings growth.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) the Best Quality Stock to Buy According to Analysts?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Quality Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we will look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the best-quality stocks to buy.\n\nIncome-Focused Investing\n\nThe stock market has seen a notable 20% increase year-to-date, but as it approaches the seasonally volatile months leading up to Election Day, potential volatility is expected. The S&P 500 has historically pulled back 5% to 10% around election time but tends to recover afterward.\n\nInstead of cashing out, investors are encouraged to take advantage of any market pullbacks. Historically, when the Fed cuts rates without an impending recession, it creates a favorable environment for broader market performance. Mona Mahajan, Edward Jones senior investment strategist, recently appeared on CNBC to discuss her similar sentiment on these latest market trends, and where investors can find opportunities right now. We talked about this in our article about the 10 Best WallStreetBets Stocks To Buy Right Now, here’s an excerpt from it:\n\n“When asked if investors should consider cashing out and taking a holiday for the remainder of the year, Mahajan advised against such a move. Instead, she suggested that if there are pullbacks or corrections in the market, it would be prudent to lean into those opportunities… Additionally, rate cuts typically lead to expanded valuations, particularly for sectors that have lagged behind in this regard. She emphasized that lower borrowing costs from Fed rate cuts would benefit both consumers and corporations. In terms of investment strategies during potential downturns, she recommended focusing on cyclical sectors such as utilities and industrials while also maintaining exposure to technology and the artificial intelligence sectors. Mahajan underscored that diversification would be key over the next 12 to 18 months.”\n\nGlobal Investment Strategist at ProShares Advisors, Simeon Hyman, appeared on CNBC on October 2 to emphasize ‘income’ as a key focus, highlighting the opportunity in fixed-income markets, which could provide 10-15% returns if geopolitical tensions worsen. He thinks that the US economy is stronger than the rest of the world despite tensions.\n\nSimeon Hyman emphasized the importance of the term ‘income’ in the context of current market conditions, noting that the market was just 1% off its all-time highs. This situation presents a salary cut for income-oriented investors, highlighting the challenges they face. However, the fixed-income market offers a silver lining; it currently provides enough yield to cushion against worsening geopolitical tensions. For instance, the yield on the 10-year bond is nearly 4%, and there is potential for it to drop to 3% or lower if significant negative events occur. This scenario presents an opportunity for investors to realize gains of 10% or 15% on bonds in a tumultuous environment, a situation not seen in over a decade.\n\nDespite the current market being down by 3.7%, which is slightly less than 4%, Hyman insisted that rounding was at play. He expressed surprise at this performance given ongoing geopolitical tensions but pointed out that positive economic news in the US persists. Specifically, there has been a 50-basis point cut and indications of a soft landing for the economy. A month-over-month increase of just 0.1% suggests that if one can overlook geopolitical issues, the US economy is faring better than many others globally and remains on solid economic footing.\n\nAdditionally, Hyman proposed a covered call strategy focused on the Russell 2000 index, which has been underperforming compared to the S&P 500. He described this strategy as beneficial because it allows investors to generate income that could offset recent losses while maintaining a bullish position in small caps. Historically, rate cuts have positively impacted small-cap stocks, and this strategy enables investors to capitalize on that trend while also generating income through covered calls.\n\nFor risk-averse investors, the current emphasis on fixed-income markets as a viable investment option aligns well with the insights shared by Simeon Hyman, who highlighted the potential for 10-15% returns in bonds amid geopolitical tensions. Additionally, they may also explore quality stocks with reliable growth histories, which can provide stability in uncertain market conditions, similar to the defensive strategies Hyman suggested.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list, we first sifted through Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF holdings to find the ones with an upside potential of over 15% as of October 4, 2024. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their analysts’ upside potential.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 20.91%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is engaged in e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. It’s the world’s largest online marketplace, offering a vast selection of products across various categories. It also provides cloud computing services through AWS, streaming services like Prime Video and Music, and hardware products like Kindle and Echo.\n\nAWS, its most profitable part, has over 30% profit margins and is expected to grow by 15% to 21% each year until 2028, so its success is important for the company’s future profits. AWS grew by 18.8% in Q2 2024. Amazon Prime has become very successful, with 200 million members worldwide. It helps customers spend more and is almost $100 billion per year.\n\nThe company is making money from ads on its content. The ad business is now worth $50 billion, after AWS. Evercore ISI thinks Amazon Prime Video could make between $1.8 and $3.3 billion in profit by 2025, which could increase its total profit by 3% to 5% this year.\n\nPhysical stores, like Whole Foods, are the smallest part of Amazon’s business and aren’t growing very fast. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has invested $30.5 billion in capital expenditures this year and expects more spending in the second half. This is driven by growing AI demand. Investors are confident in its future, especially AWS, which has a $156.6 billion backlog and improved profitability to over 30%. These factors add up to make it a great investment opportunity.\n\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 7th on our list of the best-quality stocks. While we acknowledge the growth potential of AMZN, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Analysts at Truist Securities have upgraded Nike (NYSE:NKE) stock to Buy, a move driven by optimism around recent leadership changes.\n\nThe price target has also been raised to $97 from $83, reflecting more than 17% upside from Nike’s current trading price.\n\nWhile acknowledging that Nike's turnaround may be a long and uncertain process, Truist analysts believe the new management, including the return of long-time veterans like Tom Peddie and incoming CEO Elliot Hill, can reignite excitement around the brand.\n\nA key factor in this upgrade is the management's focus on restoring Nike’s wholesale relationships, which had been neglected during its direct-to-consumer (DTC) expansion.\n\nTruist believes that re-engaging with retail partners like Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) and Designer Brands Inc (NYSE:DBI), and potentially establishing a store on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), could drive significant growth.\n\n“With Elliot Hill and Tom Peddie at the helm, we believe Nike’s first strategic priorities will revolve around re-engaging with retail partners,” Truist analysts wrote.\n\nThe re-entry into Amazon’s platform, especially after recent improvements in Amazon’s counterfeit prevention, is seen as a potential “game-changer.”\n\nWhile the financial recovery may take time, Truist remains positive about near-term catalysts, such as Nike’s investment in marketing and endorsement deals. The signing of WNBA star Caitlin Clark to a multi-million dollar contract is highlighted as an underutilized asset.\n\n“Although a fundamental recovery remains a long-term prospect, we think some near-term wins from the fresh team should be enough to show investors there are better times ahead,” analysts noted.\n\nIn terms of valuation, Truist says that while Nike shares aren’t “cheap,” the stock’s underperformance over the past year has created an attractive entry point for investors betting on a long-term recovery.\n\nFollowing three consecutive earnings and guidance disappointments, Nike shares fell more than 30% since December 2023, compared to a 22% gain for the S&P 500 over that period.\n\n“While shares are currently trading at ~28.5x Street’s next-twelve-months EPS forecasts on a relative basis, NKE’s current ~32% premium to the S&P 500 is well below the 3-year average of ~60%,” analysts said.\n\n“At these levels we think qualitative improvements that highlight that the new management team is aggressively pursuing a turnaround would be enough for shares to outperform.”\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTruist upgrades Nike stock to Buy, says new management can reignite interest\n\nDomino's Pizza misses sales growth estimates as consumers go deal-hunting\n\nStarboard seeks probe after former Pfizer execs pull support for its campaign\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AMD's AI product event likely to be 'a fade-the-news event' says analyst",
        "content": "Investing.com -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is set to host its \"Advancing AI\" event this week, where analysts expect to hear about new product announcements that could lift sales and drive the chipmaker’s stock price.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts at Lynx Equity Strategies believe this will be “a fade-the-news event.”\n\n“AMD stock has had a modest run-up over the past week on investor expectations for clarity on MI325X and its follow-ons. We think investors are likely to be disappointed,” they emphasized.\n\nLynx’s team is skeptical about AMD's ability to close the gap with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), noting that the latter continues to dominate the market. Despite AMD’s ambitious claims at the MI300X launch nearly a year ago, it has made minimal progress in challenging NVIDIA’s stronghold.\n\n\"We do not expect MI325X to change the narrative meaningfully,\" the analysts state, suggesting that AMD is likely to “remain a distant second” to its rival.\n\nWhile AMD is expected to highlight developments in data center CPUs and AI PCs, Lynx believes investor attention will remain firmly on the MI-series. The analysts warn that unless AMD can demonstrate a clear driver for market share gains, the stock could potentially retest its yearly lows.\n\nAfter AMD’s Computex presentation a few months ago, there was some optimism around the company’s next-gen data center GPUs, especially given the higher HBM density on AMD's MI325X—288GB compared to NVIDIA's 141GB on the H200.\n\nHowever, Lynx notes that customer traction has been weak in the months since. Although AMD management may boast superior benchmark results compared to NVIDIA’s Hopper series, the firm’s analysts remain unconvinced, noting that \"while running real workloads in the field, we think MI300X continues to trail NVDA’s H100.\"\n\n“We do not expect MI325X to change the narrative meaningfully. Superior HBM density is merely one of the factors at work; the software stack, backplane networking and power consumption matter just as much,” analysts continued.\n\nThey believe AMD has high hopes for the MI325X and is expanding its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity in anticipation of future demand. Notably, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s strong guidance for its ethernet connectivity business at GPU-based AI data centers next year could indicate growing demand from AMD AI servers. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also appears to be a key customer, though Lynx remains uncertain about “who the needle-movers are.”\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which endorsed AMD’s launch of MI300X last year, may have seen its commitment to AMD diminish recently.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We believe META may have firmed up its plans for internally developed silicon as a future alternative to NVDA. And Amazon/AWS too, we doubt if AMD is seen as a viable alternative to NVDA,” Lynx explains.\n\nThe firm also mentions Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) as a potential customer, along with interest from enterprises, but it cautions that the MI-series, along with its software stack, may not be the plug-and-play solution AMD has marketed it as.\n\n“Outside of MSFT we do not believe end customers are likely to spend resources to help bridge the gap as it is unclear what would be the payoff,” said the analysts.\n\n“We expect the stock to trade down after the event today and likely to revisit the lows of the year.”\n\nAs for potential surprises at the event, Lynx suggests that while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) might be announced as new customers, this would likely be limited to externally facing cloud instances.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAMD's AI product event likely to be 'a fade-the-news event' says analyst\n\nUS futures extend losses after higher-than-expected inflation data\n\nUBS downgrades Nutrien to 'neutral' on weak Ag outlook, lowers PT to $51\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphyn Capital Management: Amazon.com (AMZN) is Heavily Investing in its AWS Infrastructure",
        "content": "Alphyn Capital Management, an investment management firm, released its third-quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The Master Account of the fund returned 8.9% net in the third quarter compared to 5.9% for the S&P500 Index. As of September 30, 2024, the top ten holdings accounted for approximately 71% of the portfolio, and approximately 9% of the portfolio was held in cash. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nAlphyn Capital Management highlighted stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides consumer products, advertising, and subscription services through online and physical stores that operate through North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) segments. The one-month return of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was -0.98%, and its shares gained 39.93% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On October 9, 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock closed at $185.17 per share with a market capitalization of $1.943 trillion.\n\nAlphyn Capital Management stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) continued growth is driven by its strong performance in AWS and advertising, which grew 19% and 20%, respectively. E-commerce growth moderated to 9.3%, likely due to softer consumer demand.\n\nIn previous letters, I mentioned how Amazon’s heavy investments in logistics and fulfillment suppressed margins for some time, but the company is now reaping the rewards of those earlier expenditures. European operations have been profitable for the second consecutive quarter, while North American operating margins have risen from pandemic lows to 5.3%. A key ongoing area of focus for Amazon has been reducing the “cost to serve”; this is beginning to show tangible benefits. In 2023, Amazon undertook a “regionalization” strategy, which divided the U.S. into eight distinct regions for fulfillment and transportation, with corresponding distribution centers in each. As I learned from an expert interview done by InPractise, “regionalization” has resulted in estimated shipping expenses dropping from $4.76 per unit to $4.50, and they are now approximately $4.26, with potential reductions of 2-3% annually. Interestingly, Amazon leaned on its third-party vendors (3P) to finance much of this strategy. It did so by requiring 3P vendors ship inventory to the multiple regional distribution centers, instead of to a single location as they used to do. Moreover, Amazon imposed penalties for failing to meet strict minimum and maximum quantities. In this way, Amazon used 3P inventory to expand its distribution capacity by around 24 million square feet, much of which it could use for its own 1P inventory. Clever strategy, but one wonders if this raises the risk of an eventual vendor backlash due to the added financial and logistical pressures on 3P sellers.\n\nLike Alphabet, Amazon is investing heavily in its AWS infrastructure to support its growing AI business. In the first half of the year, the company spent $30.5 billion on capital expenditures, with plans to exceed that in the year’s second half. When questioned about this during the earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy emphasized that they are seeing significant demand for AI-related services, which he believes will become a “very large” business for Amazon.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.

        "content": "Amazon Pharmacy to Double Service Areas, Offer Same-Day Medication Delivery\n\nAmazon Pharmacy is expanding its pharmacy services to 20 more U.S. cities by 2025, offering fast, free delivery of prescription medications. Amazon’s new pharmacies will be embedded within its Same-Day Delivery sites, enabling swift medication delivery.\n\nThe service offers a digital-first experience, 24/7 access to pharmacists, and various ways to save on prescriptions. By 2025, nearly 45% of U.S. customers are expected to be eligible for same-day delivery, allowing medications to arrive within hours of being ordered.\n\nLeveraging its vast logistics network, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) aims to provide a rapid, efficient pharmacy service that directly delivers medications to customers’ doors.\n\nDr. Vin Gupta, Chief Medical Officer of Amazon Pharmacy, emphasized the importance of rapid access to prescriptions. “There’s often a crucial window after diagnosis when starting medication is most critical,” he said.\n\nAmazon’s pharmacy expansion also aims to address the growing issue of “pharmacy deserts,” where many communities are over 10 miles away from the nearest pharmacy. Traditional mail-order prescriptions often take up to 10 days to arrive, leaving many underserved. Amazon’s rapid delivery and pharmacist availability close the care gap, especially in areas with limited access to healthcare services.\n\nJohn Love, VP of Amazon Pharmacy, highlighted Amazon’s efforts to streamline medication delivery and offer clear pricing, automatic coupons, and discounts for Prime members.\n\nInnovations such as RxPass, a $5-a-month subscription for 60 common medications, and savings of up to 80% on generics demonstrate Amazon’s commitment to making healthcare more accessible and affordable.\n\nSince its launch in 2020, Amazon Pharmacy has integrated technology to modernize pharmacy operations while maintaining clinical oversight.\n\nHannah McClellan, VP of Operations, Product, and Technology at Amazon Pharmacy, added that feedback from customers and physicians has been overwhelmingly positive, reinforcing the importance of fast medication delivery.\n\nPrice Action: At last check Thursday, AMZN stock was up 0.99% at $187 during the premarket session.\n\nRead Next:\n\nAsia Gains, Europe Dips While Crude Oil Surges On Supply Risk – Global Markets Today While US Slept.\n\nPhoto by Koshiro K via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) TV+ will soon be available on Amazon’s (AMZN) Prime Video, as streaming platforms continue to consolidate to resemble the cable offerings they’ve largely outcompeted.\n\nLater this month, Prime Video subscribers will be able to add Apple’s streaming service for $9.99 a month, adding to Amazon’s more than 100 existing add-on subscription options, the company said Wednesday.\n\n“As we continue to expand our offering and make it easy for customers to personalize their streaming experience directly in one app, we are proud to welcome Apple TV+ and its popular and critically-acclaimed shows, films and events to Prime Video,” said Mike Hopkins, senior vice president and head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios.\n\nApple TV+ is home to popular series including Ted Lasso and The Morning Show, as well as movies and live sports.\n\nAmazon and Apple join other platforms in bundling their services to boost subscriptions and viewership. In July, Disney (DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) announced that they would offer a new bundle that combines all of their streaming platforms — Disney+, Hulu and Max — under one monthly subscription plan.\n\nDespite the influx of entrants into the streaming business, for many, it hasn’t yet been a profitable endeavor. They face steep competition, particularly from established streaming behemoth Netflix (NFLX).\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said in February that he believes Prime Video could become a “large and profitable business,” The Wrap reported. In the second quarter, advertising revenue grew 20% year over year to $12.77 billion. The company also added ad tiers earlier this year, and has said it’s planning to ramp up its ad load in 2025.\n\nOther media giants have also been struggling to keep pace with the growing demands of the streaming market. Disney CEO Bob Iger acknowledgedin March thatnearly five years after its debut, the company’s streaming platform is still lagging behind the industry’s “gold standard” Netflix.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional cable companies are adding streaming offerings in an attempt to bolster their customer base. Charter Communications (CHTR), the parent company of Spectrum, announced earlier its month that it will offer its cable TV subscribers free access to Peacock (CMCSA), Disney+, Max, and others.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – October 10, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Target Corp. TGT, Macy's, Inc. M and Bath & Body Works, Inc. BBWI.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nHow These Retailers Are Gearing Up for Earnings Season\n\nAs the holiday season nears, retailers are mobilizing resources to meet the demand of shoppers seeking attractive deals. With the anticipation of an uptick in consumer activity, industry leaders are focusing on bolstering their workforce through extensive seasonal hiring initiatives.\n\nAccording to a recent report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, U.S. retailers are poised to deploy about 520,000 seasonal employees in the final quarter of 2024. This recruitment is aimed at enhancing in-store customer service and optimizing online order fulfillment capabilities.\n\nSeveral major retailers have announced their hiring plans for the holiday season. Amazon.com, Inc., Target Corp., Macy's, Inc. and Bath & Body Works, Inc. are among the companies gearing up to add seasonal staff to meet the anticipated demand. These retailers aim to enhance customer service and streamline operations as shoppers flock to stores and online platforms during this busy time.\n\nRetailers Hire for Holiday Rush: AMZN, TGT, M & BBWI\n\nAmazon is making significant strides in its hiring efforts, planning to onboard 250,000 seasonal associates across the nation. This recruitment drive includes both part-time and full-time positions in fulfillment centers and transportation roles. To attract talent, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is investing $2.2 billion to boost pay for its seasonal workforce, offering a competitive wage of at least $18 per hour, along with health care benefits. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIn contrast to Amazon, Target, a Zacks Rank #3 company, is aiming to recruit around 100,000 seasonal workers to support its stores and supply-chain facilities during the holiday season. These seasonal roles will help with Order Pickup, Drive-up and fulfilling holiday orders, ensuring fast and efficient service for customers.\n\nShoppers can take advantage of Target’s flexible fulfillment options, including Drive Up, Order Pickup and same-day delivery through Shipt. Free two-day shipping is also available for orders above $35. Target Circle members enjoy additional perks, such as an extra 5% off purchases when using a Target Circle card.\n\nStory continues\n\nKeeping in mind the festive rush, Macy’s has announced plans to hire more than 31,500 full and part-time seasonal employees for the upcoming holiday season. These positions will support operations at Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury stores, as well as its distribution centers.\n\nBath & Body Works, a Zacks Rank #3 company, is preparing to cater to the heightened shopping frenzy by adding 30,000 dedicated seasonal sales associates across its more than 1,800 stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. The holiday spirit extends to BBWI's distribution centers as well, with plans to hire approximately 2,700 employees across four central Ohio distribution centers.\n\nA Promising Outlook for the Holiday Season\n\nThe holiday season is a critical revenue driver for retailers, and many are taking proactive measures to address logistical and inventory challenges. Retailers are not only replenishing shelves with in-demand products but are also ramping up investments in digital capabilities to create a seamless shopping experience. Seasonal associates will play vital roles in managing curbside pickups, in-store services and doorstep deliveries, ensuring that customer needs are met promptly.\n\nAccording to the Mastercard Economics Institute, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are anticipated to increase by 3.2% between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24. This forecast reflects a slight improvement over the 3.1% increase witnessed last season. Per the report, online spending is expected to rise 7.1% year over year. With a proactive approach and customer-centric offerings, retailers will try to seize every opportunity the season presents.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is adding Apple Inc.’s TV+ streaming service to its channels store in the US, offering hits such as Ted Lasso and Slow Horses in its video supermarket for the first time.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSan Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums\n\nApple will begin selling TV+ subscriptions through Prime later this month, Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Amazon Prime Video, said Wednesday at the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles.\n\n“What we offer channel partners is hundreds of millions of subscribers around the world,” Hopkins said. “Having this engagement around the world with Prime Members accessing Prime Video is a real great platform for other partners to be able to reach them.”\n\nAmazon markets more than 100 streaming services via its channels store, enabling customers to watch shows from Max, Paramount+ and Hallmark within Prime Video. Those services rely on Amazon to expand their audience.\n\nApple TV+ was one of the only major streaming services not available in the store, along with Netflix and Walt Disney Co.’s main properties. Those two are among the few with streaming services that have more viewers than Prime Video.\n\nApple has invested billions of dollars in original programming over the last few years, earning industry awards and critical praise. But its streaming service has yet to attract as many subscribers as Netflix and Amazon.\n\nThe agreement expands an existing relationship between the companies. In 2017, Amazon started offering a Prime Video app on the Apple TV set-top box, while Prime Video is integrated into the Apple TV app across the iPhone maker’s device lineup. The two companies are also retail partners, with Apple offering an official store via Amazon.com.\n\nHopkins also said he expects more consolidation in the media industry and that Amazon’s streaming service will be profitable “very soon.”\n\nEarlier in the evening Cristobal Valenzuela, co-founder of AI startup Runway, gave a demonstration of his company’s technology, which lets movie and TV show producers render lifelike images for partners like Lions Gate Entertainment. Valenzuela said actors, writers and other artists shouldn’t fear the new technology.\n\n“You never watch a movie because how it was made, you watch a movie because it’s a good story,” he said. “We want to make sure we can help tell those stories.”\n\nStory continues\n\n--With assistance from Mark Gurman.\n\n(Updates with Hopkins comments starting in third paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes) Musk Reveals Why He’s Jumping Into Trump’s Arms China Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space How Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession Rate Cuts Need Time to Work Their Way Through the Economy\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

BIO-key is focusing on high-margin, annual recurring revenues, which have solid potential to build on its base moving forward.\n\nNegative Points\n\nQ2 2024 revenue of $1.1 million fell below the year-ago revenue of approximately $1.9 million, primarily due to delays in software license contracts. The company experienced lower services revenue related to customizations and upgrades for a large customer project that did not occur in Q2 2024. A large recurring maintenance contract did not renew in Q1 2024, negatively impacting the current year's top-line revenue. BIO-key's financial performance remains variable due to the size and timing of customer contracts and commitments. The company has faced significant delays in large projects in Africa, impacting its financial results and leading to a write-down of over $3 million in inventory.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Can you explain why reported revenue hasn't picked up substantially despite efforts to grow the recurring revenue base and channel partner programs? A: Michael DePasquale, CEO, explained that the key issue is closing more opportunities in their pipeline. The company is pursuing larger sales with higher-profile customers, which have longer sales cycles. They are focusing on increasing the number of opportunities, shortening sales cycles, and improving close ratios. Additionally, they are enhancing direct selling efforts and leveraging new resources to target enterprise-focused opportunities.\n\nQ: Is the recent Amazon marketplace announcement a continuation of your previous acceptance into Amazon's AWS independent software vendor program? A: Yes, Michael DePasquale confirmed that it is a continuation. Initially, they were accepted as a vendor, and now they have developed their storefront to be live on the marketplace. This allows Amazon customers to easily acquire BIO-Key solutions.\n\nQ: Do you expect revenue from the Amazon channel to start this year? A: Michael DePasquale affirmed that they expect revenue from the Amazon channel to start this year. The company is live on the marketplace, and marketing and promotion efforts will begin at the end of the current quarter and into October.\n\nQ: What does your outlook commentary mean regarding sequential growth on a full-year basis? A: Michael DePasquale clarified that they expect to grow their business year-over-year and anticipate higher revenues in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Despite a challenging quarter, they are confident in achieving year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nQ: Are the two large Africa contracts still viable, or have they been canceled? A: Michael DePasquale stated that the projects are still alive, but there have been significant delays due to political and economic issues in Nigeria. They remain optimistic about selling equipment in the market and are exploring other opportunities in the payment space and financial services in Africa.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) the Best AI Data Center Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI data center stocks.\n\nThe AI data center industry is experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the massive computational power they require. AI data centers are specialized facilities designed to handle high-intensity AI workloads, including machine learning, natural language processing, and neural network training. These facilities integrate advanced hardware and software to process large-scale data efficiently, creating a crucial infrastructure for the global digital economy. Leading technology companies are making substantial investments in AI data centers. For instance, Meta announced plans to invest $33 billion in data center expansion to support AI research and development. Google is also investing billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, committing $3.3 billion in just one region of the United States​. These investments highlight the significance of AI data centers in the broader tech ecosystem.\n\nAI workloads demand hardware that can process vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This need has led to the development of AI-specific chips, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These chips are essential components in AI data centers.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhile AI data centers are essential for technological progress, they consume enormous amounts of energy. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers worldwide account for about 1% of global electricity demand, a figure that could increase significantly with the rise of AI. Cooling systems, necessary to maintain optimal hardware performance, further contribute to this energy demand. To address this, companies are increasingly focused on building energy-efficient data centers. For example, Google has implemented machine learning algorithms to reduce energy use in its data centers by 30%.\n\nThe AI data center industry will continue to evolve as the demand for AI-driven applications grows. Experts predict a significant shift toward edge computing, where data centers are decentralized and located closer to the source of data generation. This reduces latency and improves performance for real-time AI applications such as autonomous driving and smart cities. Moreover, the integration of quantum computing into AI data centers could revolutionize the field. Quantum computers are capable of processing complex calculations at speeds unattainable by classical computers, making them ideal for AI and big data applications. Companies like IBM and Google are already exploring quantum technology in their AI research.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. A report by news publication Bloomberg earlier this year claimed that the company plans to spend nearly $150 billion in the next decade to develop data centers in a bid to spur AI growth. The report was based on AI infrastructure announcements made by the tech giant in the past few years. Some of the areas in which Amazon has pledged to spend billions to develop data centers include northern Virginia, Oregon, and Mississippi in the US, as well as Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Spain, and the United Kingdom abroad. Amazon is ramping up investments in data centers to keep pace with rival Microsoft.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best AI data center stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Last month, she bought 22,143 shares through the ARKQ ETF. In August, she purchased 187,843 shares across five ARK ETFs.\n\nThe Bull Case For Amazon\n\nEarlier it was reported that Wood is attempting to recover from recent market downturns by purchasing shares in tech companies that have seen significant declines\n\nHer investment strategy appears to be pivoting toward companies with long-term reliability and diversified growth potential.\n\nAmazon fits this bill, particularly due to its cloud services division, Amazon Web Services, or AWS.\n\nIn its latest earnings report released in August, Amazon announced that AWS posted a 19% growth.\n\nChallenges On The Horizon\n\nAmazon is currently facing an FTC investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices. On Monday, a judge’s ruling allowed antitrust lawsuits against Amazon to proceed.\n\nThe e-commerce landscape is also becoming increasingly crowded, with both established players and emerging platforms vying for market share.\n\nWood is also an investor in Amazon's rival Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP).\n\nAmazon currently has a market capitalization of $1.917 trillion, making it the fifth most valuable listed company in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom the end of August till date, Amazon’s stock has gained 2.36%, slightly underperforming the broader Nasdaq index, which gained 2.65%.\n\nTrending: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement.

Remember when Jim Cramer, who has often been the target of numerous jokes, called Wood the \"kiss of death\" in 2022?\n\n\"She could be right, she could be wrong,\" George Kailas, CEO of Prospero.ai, a fintech investment platform told Fortune in August. \"She's definitely been both in the last couple of years.\"\n\nEarlier this year in July, Wood defended the ARK Innovation ETF, which has experienced significant volatility.\n\nAt the time, in a letter to investors, Wood acknowledged challenges due to the macro environment and stock selections but reaffirmed her commitment to investing in disruptive innovation.\n\n\"Exiting our strategies now would crystallize losses that lower interest rates and reversions to the mean should transform into meaningful profits during the next few years,\" she wrote, adding, \"We are resolute.\"\n\nPrice Action: Since the year began, ARKK has fallen almost 11% while Amazon’s stock has shot up 20.26% in the same period.

        "content": "As the holiday season nears, retailers are mobilizing resources to meet the demand of shoppers seeking attractive deals. With the anticipation of an uptick in consumer activity, industry leaders are focusing on bolstering their workforce through extensive seasonal hiring initiatives. According to a recent report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, U.S. retailers are poised to deploy about 520,000 seasonal employees in the final quarter of 2024. This recruitment is aimed at enhancing in-store customer service and optimizing online order fulfillment capabilities.\r\n\r\nSeveral major retailers have announced their hiring plans for the holiday season. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Target Corporation TGT, Macy's, Inc. M and Bath & Body Works, Inc. BBWI are among the companies gearing up to add seasonal staff to meet the anticipated demand. These retailers aim to enhance customer service and streamline operations as shoppers flock to stores and online platforms during this busy time.\n\nRetailers Hire for Holiday Rush: AMZN, TGT, M & BBWI\n\nAmazon is making significant strides in its hiring efforts, planning to onboard 250,000 seasonal associates across the nation. This recruitment drive includes both part-time and full-time positions in fulfillment centers and transportation roles. To attract talent, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is investing $2.2 billion to boost pay for its seasonal workforce, offering a competitive wage of at least $18 per hour, along with health care benefits. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to Amazon, Target, a Zacks Rank #3 company, is aiming to recruit around 100,000 seasonal workers to support its stores and supply-chain facilities during the holiday season. These seasonal roles will help with Order Pickup, Drive-up and fulfilling holiday orders, ensuring fast and efficient service for customers.\r\n\r\nShoppers can take advantage of Target’s flexible fulfillment options, including Drive Up, Order Pickup and same-day delivery through Shipt. Free two-day shipping is also available for orders above $35. Target Circle members enjoy additional perks, such as an extra 5% off purchases when using a Target Circle card.\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind the festive rush, Macy’s has announced plans to hire more than 31,500 full and part-time seasonal employees for the upcoming holiday season. These positions will support operations at Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury stores, as well as its distribution centers.\r\n\r\nBath & Body Works, a Zacks Rank #3 company, is preparing to cater to the heightened shopping frenzy by adding 30,000 dedicated seasonal sales associates across its more than 1,800 stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. The holiday spirit extends to BBWI's distribution centers as well, with plans to hire approximately 2,700 employees across four central Ohio distribution centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Promising Outlook for the Holiday Season\n\nThe holiday season is a critical revenue driver for retailers, and many are taking proactive measures to address logistical and inventory challenges. Retailers are not only replenishing shelves with in-demand products but are also ramping up investments in digital capabilities to create a seamless shopping experience. Seasonal associates will play vital roles in managing curbside pickups, in-store services and doorstep deliveries, ensuring that customer needs are met promptly.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Mastercard Economics Institute, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are anticipated to increase by 3.2% between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24.

        "title": "Amazon is doubling down on pharmacies",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) wants to give more customers access to same-day delivery for their prescriptions.\n\nThe company announced on Wednesday that it plans to open pharmacies in 20 new cities across the U.S. in 2025. This expansion will more than double the number of cities where customers can access same-day delivery for their medications.\n\nThe new pharmacies will be located within Amazon’s Same-Day Delivery sites, warehouses that are part fulfillment centers and part delivery stations, and aim to address a significant challenge in healthcare: providing convenient and affordable access to medications. Amazon’s clinical teams will manage the prescription review and packaging process.\n\nCustomers in major cities like Boston, Dallas, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and San Diego will soon have access to faster delivery of their medications. Additional cities will be announced later.\n\nDr. Vin Gupta, Amazon Pharmacy’s chief medical officer, emphasized the importance of speed and accessibility in healthcare. “There’s often an important window of time after getting diagnosed when it’s most vital to start your medication,” he said. Amazon plans to use its advanced logistics to deliver prescriptions within hours, which could increase patient engagement and adherence to treatments.\n\nCurrently, Amazon Pharmacy customers typically receive their medications within two days. By the end of 2025, nearly 45% of U.S. customers will be eligible for same-day delivery, allowing them to order medications by 4 p.m. and receive them by 10 p.m., the company said.\n\nAs “pharmacy deserts” – areas with limited access to pharmacies – become more common, residents in many areas face increasing difficulty accessing medications. A study published earlier this year found that among 3,143 U.S. counties, almost half had communities that were 10 miles or further from the nearest pharmacy. Amazon’s digital-first approach, with its same-day delivery expansion, is one way the retailer hopes to address this growing gap.\n\nSince its launch in 2020, Amazon Pharmacy said it has focused on making it easier to get medications. John Love, Amazon Pharmacy’s vice president, stated that through the expansion, the retail giant wants to “re-envision” and “re-imagine” healthcare delivery to meet customers where they are.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "How Meta has become an AI behemoth",
        "content": "When you think of Meta (META), you might think of Facebook, Instagram, or, shudder, the metaverse. But the social media company has quickly become an artificial intelligence darling up there with the likes of OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nMeta’s AI success comes via its Llama family of models, which the company is infusing across its various social platforms — including its Meta AI assistant for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Businesses are also putting Llama to work. In August, Meta reported organizations ranging from Accenture (ACN) and DoorDash (DASH) to Goldman Sachs (GS) are using Llama to develop their own AI software.\n\nIt’s not just that Meta is implementing its AI into its own products, though. The company is also offering up its Llama models as open-source software. Open-source software is, generally, software that companies create and then allow developers to download and augment for free. That contrasts with, say, OpenAI, which uses a closed-source software approach for its GPT family of models.\n\nAll of that has helped to make Meta a formidable force in the AI space and a potential threat to its AI rivals.\n\n“If Llama did not exist, OpenAI and [Google’s] Gemini would be in a better position,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance. “There are undoubtedly some developers who, if not for Llama existing, would have been probably forced to go to Gemini or GPT.”\n\nBut the AI industry is still in its infancy, and there’s no telling which company will be the big winner in the long run.\n\nMeta is playing the long game\n\nMeta’s AI strategy should provide a number of benefits for the company in the near and long term. Out of the gate, the company is able to apply its Llama models to its products, helping to improve its own offerings while simultaneously proving the software’s worth in real-world scenarios.\n\nAfter all, if Meta is using its models in its own products, why shouldn’t third-party developers? And because the Llama family is open source, developers can take a look under the software’s hood, allowing them to address any flaws or risks over time.\n\n“Meta has been democratizing AI, open sourcing it, utilizing what they're building in their own platforms,” said Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman. “They've been doing it really at all the layers.” AI domination? Mark Zuckerberg speaks about Meta AI during the Meta Connect conference in September. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nOf course, Llama won’t just help Meta improve its existing software and build goodwill among developers, it could also prove to be a steady revenue stream in the long run.\n\n“We want this to be open, but if you're someone like Microsoft or Amazon or Google and you're going to basically be reselling these services, that's something that we think we should get some portion of the revenue for,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during Meta’s third quarter 2023 earnings call. “So those are the deals that we intend to be making, and we've started doing that a little bit.”\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Zuckerberg said he doesn’t think those deals will contribute much to Meta’s revenue now, the CEO said he hopes it can in the long term.\n\nShares of Meta are up 85% over the last 12 months, compared to Microsoft and Google, which are up 25% and 18%, respectively. Analysts say the company’s shares are priced well relative to earnings, but the promise of how AI will boost the social media company’s own products could prove to be a tailwind.\n\nMeta’s competitors aren’t sitting idly by\n\nMeta’s open-source family of models may give it a competitive edge, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to knock OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, or any of the host of other companies fighting for position in the AI wars out of the game.\n\n“It's competitive in the sense that it's a great, cheap alternative for developers,” Munster said. “It's the most advanced, cheapest alternative.”\n\nAnd just as Meta’s models continue to evolve, so do its competitors'. Rivals OpenAI and Anthropic have funding deals with Microsoft and Amazon (AMZN), respectively, that give them the cash they’ll need to grow over the years.\n\nGoogle also has the benefit of being able to offer its Gemini platform on hundreds of millions of Android smartphones around the world, while OpenAI is expected to land on iPhones via Siri in the coming months.\n\nAnd although consumers will be able to use Meta’s AI services via its family of apps, users will find it easier to call on an AI assistant that’s built into their devices rather than having to open up a third-party app.\n\nStill, with more than 3.27 billion daily active users across its family of apps, Meta has plenty of opportunities of its own.

        "title": "Jeff Bezos Says 'All Overnight Success Takes 10 Years' – Amazon Didn't Turn A Profit For Almost A Decade",
        "content": "Jeff Bezos famously said in a 2018 CNBC interview, \"All overnight success takes about 10 years,\" perfectly summing up Amazon's long journey from an online bookstore to one of the most valuable companies in the world.\n\nHis statement reflects that real success isn't instant, and Amazon's story is a prime example. Despite its current dominance, Amazon's path to profitability was slow, filled with financial losses, skepticism and hard work.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\nAmazon was founded in 1994 with a focus on selling books online. At the time, the internet was still relatively new, and the concept of e-commerce was far from mainstream. From the outset, Bezos had a vision for Amazon's future that extended well beyond books. However, that vision wasn't immediately profitable.\n\nFor years, Amazon posted losses, and it wasn't until 2003 – almost a full decade later – that Amazon finally turned a full-year profit. That year, the company reported a net income of $35 million, a significant turnaround from the $149 million loss it had posted just the year before. This slow climb to profitability aligns perfectly with Bezos' statement about the 10-year overnight success.\n\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\n\nThe road to that first profit wasn't easy. In the early 2000s, many were skeptical of Amazon's future. The company was expanding rapidly, moving beyond books and into new product categories and investing heavily in infrastructure. While these moves were essential to its growth, they were costly, leading to years of financial losses. Still, Bezos remained focused on the long term. He wasn't interested in short-term gains or quick profits. Instead, he prioritized growth and customer satisfaction, even if that meant operating at a loss for years.\n\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nIn a talk at the Internet Association’s gala in 2017, as reported by CNBC, Bezos explained his forward-thinking approach: \"When someone congratulates Amazon on its financial quarter, I am thinking to myself those quarterly results were pretty much fully baked about three years ago.\" This long-term mindset was crucial to Amazon's eventual success.\n\nStory continues\n\nBezos understood that today’s work might not pay off immediately, but it would bear fruit. His willingness to think years ahead rather than focus on short-term profits set Amazon apart from many of its competitors.\n\nTrending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\n\nA key part of Amazon's strategy during those unprofitable years was its commitment to innovation. The company continually explored new ideas, took risks and learned from failures. Bezos believed in the importance of \"high-quality failures\" – mistakes that stem from bold, calculated risks rather than operational errors.\n\nThis philosophy encouraged innovation and allowed Amazon to adapt to the ever-changing market. This willingness to experiment and take risks led to the development of services like Amazon Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS), both of which are now integral to the company's success.\n\nTrending: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\n\nToday, Amazon's dominance in multiple industries – retail, cloud computing and entertainment – seems almost inevitable. But looking back, it's clear that the company's journey was anything but guaranteed. Bezos' 10-year overnight success statement reminds us that the road to success is often long and challenging. The early years of financial losses and uncertainty were necessary for Amazon's growth, allowing the company to lay the groundwork for its future success.\n\nTrending: Beating the market through ethical real estate investing' — this platform aims to give tenants equity in the homes they live in while scoring 17.17% average annual returns for investors – here’s how to join with just $100\n\nBezos' perspective is particularly relevant in today's world, where there's a strong emphasis on quick wins and instant results. Many entrepreneurs and business leaders consider Amazon's story a reminder that building something great takes time. It's not just about making money fast; it's about creating a strong foundation, taking risks and staying committed to a long-term vision.\n\nAmazon's success story offers valuable lessons for anyone looking to build something meaningful. While it's easy to focus on the company’s current position, its early years tell a much more complex story – one of persistence, innovation and a relentless focus on the future.\n\nBezos' \"10-year overnight success\" is a reminder that real success doesn't happen overnight. It's built over time through hard work, strategic planning and a willingness to take risks. Today, Bezos' net worth is $204.4 billion, making him the fourth-richest man globally.\n\nRead Next:\n\nTeens may never need wisdom teeth removed thanks to this MedTech Company – Be an early investor for just $300 for 100 shares!

        "title": "Amazon Unveils AI Tool to Help Drivers Find Packages Faster",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. unveiled a new artificial intelligence tool designed to solve a major pain point in its quick delivery apparatus: drivers rummaging through cluttered vans at each stop searching for packages.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums Singapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes\n\nThe technology projects a green circle on packages to be delivered at each stop and red Xs on those to be delivered later, Amazon said Wednesday at a Nashville media event focused on its logistics and online shopping initiatives.\n\nCalled Vision Assisted Package Retrieval and in development since 2020, the tool will be deployed in 1,000 Amazon vans next year and will shorten the typical delivery route by about 30 minutes, the company said.\n\nThe tool uses computer-vision technology initially developed in Amazon warehouses to identify products without using barcode scanners. The technology was adapted for vans’ cramped cargo areas and integrated with delivery-route navigation software.\n\n“Delivery drivers will no longer have to spend time organizing packages by stops, reading labels or manually checking key identifiers like a customer’s name or address to ensure they have the right packages,” Amazon said in a release. “They simply have to look for VAPR’s green light, grab and go.”\n\nThe announcement underscores Amazon’s shifting priorities under Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who assumed the role from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Bezos wowed the media with grandiose announcements that looked far into the future, such as fleets of autonomous delivery drones — a project still in the testing phase more than a decade after he announced it.\n\nUnder Jassy, who steered the company through layoffs and shuttered dozens of moonshot projects, the focus is on near-term efforts to shave costs and make Amazon’s low-margin e-commerce business more appealing to Wall Street investors prone to fret about slim profits.\n\nThe Seattle-based company relies on a network of small businesses that use 100,000 vans and employ 390,000 drivers to deliver packages. By reducing delivery times, Amazon can limit what it has to pay these delivery service partners, which typically hire drivers paid by the hour.\n\nAmazon announced several other initiatives:\n\nAI Shopping Guides designed to help customers research more than 100 product types, ranging from televisions and dog food to headphones and face moisturizers. A next-generation fulfillment center in Shreveport, Louisiana, that uses artificial intelligence and robotics to help workers pick and pack orders. An expansion of same-day prescription drug delivery that next year will bring the offering to almost half of the US.\n\nStory continues\n\n(Updated with other initiatives at end of story.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMusk Reveals Why He’s Jumping Into Trump’s Arms How Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession Rate Cuts Need Time to Work Their Way Through the Economy Hamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "content": "Amazon Pharmacy (AMZN) announced same-day delivery for prescriptions in 20 new states Wednesday, expanding its service to include nearly half of the US in 2025.\n\nThe service, Amazon said in a statement, provides delivery \"within hours\" for customer prescriptions, as long as the order is received by 4 p.m. for delivery up to 10 p.m.\n\nThe announcement, part of Amazon's Delivering the Future event in Nashville, will ramp up competition among big pharmacy retailers, which already have similar services for additional fees.\n\nWalgreens (WBA), for example, offers same-day delivery from 8,000 stores — with caveats that orders must be placed by 4 p.m. on weekdays and 1 p.m. on weekends, and it only applies to refills for eligible prescriptions. CVS (CVS), meanwhile, offers a similar service at \"almost all\" of its stores, with much the same caveats. It specifies on its website that deliveries for same-day will arrive within four hours.\n\nWalmart (WMT) does not have a same-day option but offers overnight delivery for a $15 fee.\n\nAmazon has been investing in its healthcare suite amid an industrywide recoil on brick-and-mortar services.\n\nWalgreens, for example, has pulled out of its clinic offerings, and Walmart recently shuttered its clinic locations. CVS, meanwhile, is focused on a primary care approach, as is Amazon with its One Medical unit.\n\nThe same-day strategy, according to Amazon, will help with the problem of patients who do not refill their prescriptions in time. (As many as a third of patients, according to the National Community Pharmacists Association.)\n\n\"This rapid access increases the likelihood patients engage immediately in their care and adhere to treatment routines, which is shown to improve health outcomes,\" said Amazon Pharmacy chief medical officer Dr. Vin Gupta. John Love, vice president of Amazon Pharmacy, talks about healthcare delivery by drone during Amazon's \"Delivering the Future\" event in Sumner, Washington, on Oct. 18, 2023. (JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) (JASON REDMOND via Getty Images)\n\nFootprint expansion\n\nTo date, Amazon has declined to reveal health unit-specific data but continues to invest heavily in expansion on all fronts. The company is building out more One Medical sites, and the announcement Wednesday showcases an investment in building out logistics for medicines.\n\nThe expansion complements a contraction of physical pharmacy locations around the country. Major retailers like CVS and Walgreens have closed several hundred stores in the past year, and vertically integrated companies like CVS and UnitedHealth (UNH) have begun to rely on mail order as a way to fill the gap.\n\nWhile the deliveries will become part of the Same Day delivery sites Amazon already has, there is some buildout needed, such as mini pharmacy locations to help decrease delivery time. These mini-sites include robotic arms and other automation to help speedily fill prescriptions — but are overseen by licensed pharmacists and pharmacy technicians.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe same-day delivery of medicines began in New York City and Los Angeles earlier this year. Some of the new cities include Boston, Dallas, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and San Diego.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "content": "Investing.com -- BMO Capital analysts believe Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are the top ad stocks heading into the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2025, citing their scale and advanced AI tools as key drivers.\n\nAccording to BMO’s recent checks with advertising industry experts, discussing key trends and observations across the US, UK, and Canadian advertising ecosystems, both companies are well-positioned to capture additional ad spend as their AI tools help advertisers optimize campaigns more effectively.\n\n“Specifically, our experts agree that META is best positioned to benefit from a TikTok ban, with YouTube and SNAP also benefiting to a lesser extent,” wrote BMO.\n\nThe experts are also said to have highlighted that Google’s Performance Max (PMax) is driving incremental ad dollars toward search ads, thanks to AI-driven improvements in return on ad spend (ROAS).\n\nHowever, YouTube has seen some headwinds due to competition from sports engagement for July in events like Copa America and UEFA European Cup. Despite these challenges, Google is still seen as a strong player in the digital ad space.\n\nBMO said Meta is expected to see revenue growth in the 10%-12% range for Q4 2024, with some experts predicting the lower end of this guidance due to a slowdown compared to the first half of the year.\n\nHowever, they explained that Meta is poised to benefit from increasing retail and social commerce, with in-app shopping ads generating higher CPMs.\n\nBMO’s experts foresee social commerce becoming a significant growth driver for Meta, with transaction-related ads expected to grow from 8.2% to over 40% of total spend over time.\n\nConnected TV (CTV) is also anticipated to play an important role in advertising growth, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) identified as the best-positioned platforms.\n\nThey note that Amazon’s Prime Video has shifted from experimental ad spending to committed budgets, while Netflix’s CPMs have fallen from $40 to $23, making it more attractive to advertisers.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThese 2 ad stocks are best positioned into Q4 says BMO\n\nAmazon targets faster deliveries and buying with new tech\n\nOpenAI sees increasing use of its AI models for influencing elections\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon has revealed new technology that it says will help delivery drivers avoid organizing packages at stops or manually check to see if they have the right parcel for each delivery.\n\nThe technology – called Vision-Assisted Package Retrieval, or VAPR – is intended to cut down on the time and effort it takes drivers to retrieve packages, Amazon’s retail chief Doug Harrington said at a company event in Nashville on Wednesday.\n\nAmazon expects to put 1,000 delivery vans that contain the technology on the road by early next year.\n\nThe company says VAPR essentially works like this: Once an Amazon delivery van arrives at a customer’s location, it will project a green “0” on packages that need to be dropped off, and a red “X” on those that should remain in the van.\n\nThe technology will also use audio and visual cues to let drivers know they have found the right package, Amazon said.\n\nThe Seattle company has been testing the new feature with its Delivery Service Partners, the businesses that deliver packages across the country for Amazon.\n\nIt said early tests have showed the technology helped reduce “perceived physical and mental effort” for drivers and saved them more than 30 minutes per route.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Analyst on Amazon (AMZN): AWS an ‘Ideal Choice’ For LLM and GenAI Applications",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Trending AI Stocks in October. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nTom Lee, Fundstrat co-founder, while talking to CNBC in a latest program, explained his bullish case for the market and why he believes the S&P 500 is headed to close the year “well beyond” 5,700.\n\n“Bull markets are supported by a strong fundamentals and this is a case where not only has the economy survivie extremely high interest rates but the Fed is beginning to cut rates, and an economy that has been sort of languishing has been China. Now we have stimulus and what looks like some bazooka policies that are supporting that region, and we have a lot of cash on the sidelines. I think this is a formula for stocks to do pretty well the next three to 12 months, and that’s why we think that we would be well beyond 5700 before year-end.”\n\nLee said that he’s inclined to buy “risks outright” as he believes more upward momentum would come for stocks after the election.\n\n“Small caps still have good fundamentals, earnings growth is accelerating, the media P/E is eleven times which is almost seven turns lower than the S&P so I think there is still case to be made that small-cap are starting a multi-year gain.”\n\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks that are making big moves on the back of latest news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\n\nWilliam Blair analysts see Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a major beneficiary of generative AI, primarily through its AWS cloud division and e-commerce platform. “AWS’s extensive infrastructure and leading position in the cloud market make it an ideal choice for developing large language models and deploying GenAI applications,” said analysts Arjun Bhatia and Dylan Carden. They believe growing demand for compute resources driven by GenAI workloads will fuel AWS’s growth, given the resource-heavy nature of LLMs and GenAI applications. The investment bank also expects GenAI to improve user experiences on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) e-commerce platform.\n\nAWS’s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\n\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\n\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\n\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Trending AI Stocks in October. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "The US Justice Department said in a new court filing that it may recommend a break up of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) as an antidote to unhealthy competition in the search engine market, showing just how far Washington is willing to go to rein in Big Tech.\n\nDOJ lawyers used a 32-page document to outline a framework of options for DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta to consider, including \"behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search.\"\n\nGoogle in a blog post said that \"DOJ’s radical and sweeping proposals risk hurting consumers, businesses, and developers.\"\n\nIts stock fell slightly in pre-market trading Wednesday.\n\nThe proposal is the first step from the Justice Department to break up a tech empire since it tried to do so more than two decades ago with Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nThat case — which the DOJ referenced in its Tuesday court filing — resulted in a 2002 settlement that opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market.\n\nThe move by DOJ also sends a signal to other tech giants currently facing antitrust cases from DOJ and other Washington regulators as part of a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries.\n\nThe administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly.\n\nThe case against Google targeting its dominance in search resulted in a landmark decision in August, where DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta sided with DOJ and concluded Google illegally monopolized the online search engine market and the market for search text advertising. DOJ said in a new court document that it is considering a breakup of Google, among other options, as potential remedies in a landmark antitrust trial. A judge has to make the final decision. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nMehta concluded that Google’s agreements with browser providers and devices powered by Google’s Android operating system stifled rivals from entering and growing within the markets.\n\nIt will now be up to Mehta to decide what should happen now in a separate \"remedies\" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025.\n\nDOJ is expected to provide a more detailed document by Nov. 20 outlining these remedies. But the 32-page document filed late Tuesday offers several points of focus beyond forcing Google to sell parts of its business.\n\nOne has to do with contracts that secure Google’s search engine as a default on internet browsers and internet-connected devices that use Google’s Android operating system.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle pays as much as $26 billion per year to maintain its position on mobile devices like Apple (AAPL) and Samsung smartphones.\n\nJustice Department lawyers said to prevent further harm they may seek to limit or terminate Google’s use of those contracts that use Chrome, Play and Android to advantage Google search, as well as \"other revenue-sharing arrangements related to search and search-related products, potentially with or without the use of a choice screen.\" Judge Amit Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) (Mark Wilson via Getty Images)\n\nThe DOJ could also ask the judge to force Google to share with rival browsers and search providers the data that it uses to refine its search algorithms, and limit the company's dominance over search text ads.\n\nDOJ suggested the judge should also consider blocking Google from illegally monopolizing related markets, in addition to the search and search text advertising markets.\n\nIt may ask the judge to force Google to give websites more ability to \"opt out\" of \"any Google-owned artificial-intelligence product.\"\n\nGoogle pushed back on the DOJ's suggestions.\n\n“We believe that today’s blueprint goes well beyond the legal scope of the Court’s decision about Search distribution contracts,” Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post.\n\nGoogle has promised to appeal. And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google's behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.’s Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal.\n\nAnd even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored.\n\nGoogle faces antitrust challenges on other fronts. It is currently defending itself in a separate lawsuit from DOJ alleging a monopoly in the technology used to but and sell online ads.\n\nAnd earlier this week another federal judge ordered Google to open up its app store as part of the resolution of a suit brought by Epic Games Inc.\n\nDOJ cited that ruling in its Tuesday court filing that outlined a Google breakup as one possible remedy, noting that the judge in the Epic Games case said remedies should \"bridge to moat\" to combat network effects.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising AI Stocks According to Analysts.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other promising AI stocks.\n\nThe General Outlook for Tech and AI is Positive\n\nWhile 2024 has been a solid year for defensive stocks and utilities, the technology sector, on the other hand, experienced significant headwinds. However, the general outlook for technology and AI is starting to improve as we near the end of 2024. On October 9, Dominic Rizzo, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his thesis for the AI industry.\n\nMost investors were disappointed after they failed to generate higher returns for their investments in AI during the second quarter of 2024. While Rizzo expects the theme to prevail for the next few quarters, he suggests that the technology and AI sector is on track to earn better returns, especially companies using artificial intelligence to improve their businesses.\n\nAs for the Magnificent Seven, while all companies have distinct business models and offerings, these companies have grown at a 50% to 100% faster rate than the rest of the market, making it reasonable to group them. Overall, Rizzo reiterates that while the group has been under immense pressure, it is well-positioned to leverage AI to its benefit.\n\nRizzo believes that AI is an innovation that is here to stay rather than a mere disruptive technology, meaning that companies using it to their benefit will most likely perform better than the ones that are not. Therefore, most if not companies have no other option but to direct investments in AI chips and GPUs. He expects the AI chip market to reach $400 billion by 2027.\n\nJamie Dimon is Not Worried about AI Taking Over Jobs\n\nTechnology has been altering the world since humans came into being. On October 8, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan CEO appeared in an interview on Bloomberg Television where he discussed the role of artificial intelligence, initial public offerings, and the easing cycle by the Fed.\n\nAccording to Dimon, technology was previously limited to certain regions and countries, but now we have tech centers in almost every part of the world including Berlin, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. According to Dimon, the acceleration in technology is great and he is glad that innovation is taking precedence, especially in Europe.\n\nSpeaking of AI, Dimon suggests that artificial intelligence is going to change a lot of things that are common elements of our world. As far as job losses go, technology has always been changing the job market and is mostly responsible for taking away jobs. However, he emphasizes the need to look at the bigger picture.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, Dimon suggests that jobs will likely be more enhanced and researched-oriented. As for sectors like finance, people have been using it to detect fraud and minimize risk already. Similarly, AI has limited a lot of marketing jobs but at the same time, it has left a positive impact on productivity. Dimon shares he is not worried about AI changing the job landscape and that we should focus on re-training and re-educating workers losing their jobs as new technologies keep springing.\n\nNow that we have studied the outlook of the AI industry, let's take a look at the most promising AI stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the most promising AI stocks according to analysts, we sifted through multiple ETFs, our own rankings, and similar rankings on the internet. We then ranked the most promising AI stocks based on the Analyst upside as of October 9, 2024. We also included the hedge fund sentiment for each stock. It is to be noted, that we only considered stocks with a market capitalization of over $1 billion, as of October 9, 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAnalyst Upside as of October 9, 2024: 22%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks ninth on our list of the most promising AI stocks according to analysts. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services.\n\nIts proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), increased its revenue by 18.8% in Q2 and has reported 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters. Coming to its dominance in AI, Over the past few months, the company has not only forged partnerships with AI startups and the government but it has also been actively involved in the development of AI hardware. Recent chips produced by the company include Trainium and Inferentia.\n\nIn addition to that, AWS is now housing the next generation of Llama models from Meta, giving customers more choices to build, deploy, and scale generative AI applications. On September 19, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched Project Amelia, a selling assistant backed by generative AI, allowing sellers to offer better customer assistance and reach.\n\nOverall, AWS has close to 31% market share in cloud computing, indicative of its dominance in the market. Now that AWS is increasingly adopting AI-backed systems, the company is poised to become a fully AI-run company in the next few years.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to a 22% upside from current levels. According to our Insider Monkey database, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 with total stakes amounting to $65.85 billion.\n\nDiamond Hill SelectStrategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\"\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 9th on our list of the most promising AI stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley andJim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Amazon airline sells excess cargo capacity to third-party shippers",
        "content": "Amazon Air aircraft on the apron at Ontario International Airport in Ontario, California, on May 9, 2022. Amazon manages more than 100 aircraft of varying sizes that are operated by partner airlines. (Photo: Shutterstock/Tada Images)\n\nAmazon has officially entered the for-hire air cargo market, making capacity on its large fleet of cargo jets broadly available for the first time to freight forwarders and other businesses after previously providing airlift to a limited set of companies. The creation of a direct sales channel for heavy shipments beyond Amazon’s parcel ecosystem puts the e-commerce platform in position to challenge FedEx and UPS for a greater share of domestic airfreight.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) established its air logistics arm in 2016 to meet delivery commitments of one to two days for Prime members and drive customer satisfaction. Amazon Air, which relies on contract airlines to fly its leased parcel freighters, now has more than 100 aircraft in its fleet, several air sortation hubs, more than 250 daily flights and a route network that connects 54 U.S. airports.\n\nThe mega-retailer three weeks ago unveiled the Amazon Air Cargo website as a vehicle for advertising the airfreight product and booking shipments online. Shippers can tender freight as needed, reserve regular blocks of space or charter entire aircraft. Amazon is also offering air cargo service in Europe and India, where it operates more limited networks.\n\n“Ready for takeoff! Amazon Air Cargo is now open for business serving domestic networks across North America, EMEA, and Asia. Built on the backbone of Amazon’s world-class logistics network, we’re ready to handle, transport, and deliver your goods safely, securely, and efficiently — on time, every day,” Amazon’s logistics unit announced on LinkedIn.\n\nAmazon for years quietly sold space on its cargo jets to a handful of clients. Now it is fully externalizing the service to capitalize on excess capacity after working out the kinks for moving high volumes of third-party freight.\n\nHandling containers with products of varying types and sizes alongside express small parcels that are routed to destinations through a highly automated conveyor sortation system increases operational complexity. There is no publicly available information about whether Amazon freighter aircraft fly full, but logistics practitioners familiar with the company said the air network has imbalances where select lanes have weak load factors. Revenue gained from wholesale air cargo can help offset overhead costs, they said.\n\nAmazon’s 3-year-old superhub at Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport is a key part of the company’s ability to provide air shipping for customers outside the Amazon supply chain.\n\nThe new website allows Amazon Air to attract customers besides those using Amazon Prime, the electronic retailer’s paid subscription service, as it opens the door to full-scale airfreight service. The target audience includes logistics companies, online retailers and postal services.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We’re always working to develop new, innovative logistics solutions that support Amazon customers. Amazon Air Cargo has been offering third-party shippers access to Amazon’s logistics network to deliver air shipments with speed and reliability since 2019, and we are excited to now expand the service to more cargo customers,” spokesperson Alexa Clark said in a statement to FreightWaves.\n\nAmazon marketing states the carrier will haul all types of products, ranging from perishables, pharmaceuticals and oversized, to parcels and dangerous goods. Customers can access real-time supply and make cargo bookings by integrating their transportation management systems with Amazon’s reservation system.\n\nThe Loadstar was first to notice Amazon’s new effort to market air cargo shipping.\n\nAmazon mostly operates Boeing 737-800 narrowbody and Boeing 767 medium widebody freighters but has added six Airbus A330-300 large cargo jets to the fleet in the past year. Small fleets in Europe and India are entirely Boeing 737-800s.\n\nDuring the past two years, the retail giant has been more cautious about growing the air network as e-commerce sales normalized and it shifted to a regional fulfillment model that decreases reliance on air transport. Amazon Air has also mostly transitioned to a hub-and-spoke model that mirrors FedEx and UPS, with less point-to-point flying, according to researchers at DePaul University who monitor Amazon Air’s progress. The European network serves about 10 airports, down from a high of 13 three years ago.\n\nAmazon Air follows integrator playbook\n\nA source outside the company, who spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to hurt existing business relationships, said Amazon had to iron out security procedures for freight forwarders tendering pallets mixed with parcels and general cargo, like auto parts, before expanding air cargo service so shipments could be properly screened by a ground handling agent in accordance with Transportation Security Administration requirements.\n\nAmazon’s move toward offering wholesale capacity is a logical evolution for an integrated express carrier. FedEx, UPS and DHL Express for decades have offered wholesale capacity to outside shippers seeking a deferred delivery mode.\n\nSatish Jindel, CEO of parcel shipping analytics firm ShipMatrix, said Amazon will now compete with FedEx and UPS for traditional domestic airfreight.\n\n“UPS and FedEx, in addition to parcel, they move airfreight domestically for customers and freight forwarders. So they’re going to be an alternative to UPS and FedEx,” he said. “More importantly, they have the resources to deploy more aircraft if they are successful.” An Amazon Air Boeing 767 freighter takes off from George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nThe move to sell air cargo service is consistent with Amazon’s rollout a year ago of a stand-alone shipping service under which the retail-tech giant uses its independent drivers to provide pickups at warehouses and handle the shipments to final delivery. It also fits with a year-old global supply chain service, which involves picking up inventory from manufacturing facilities worldwide, booking the shipment with an ocean carrier, handling customs clearance and ground transportation, managing inventory replenishment, and making the final delivery. Supply Chain by Amazon leverages the company’s position as a bulk buyer of ocean freight capacity.\n\nAmazon has been slow to expand the ground shipping beyond the initial 15 markets but will make a bigger push next year to do so, Jindel predicted.\n\nAmazon’s success with third-party cargo will depend on the terms, conditions and pricing offered, because express carriers give their core business priority over forwarder cargo when space is tight, Brian Clancy, managing director of Logistics Capital & Strategy, told FreightWaves.\n\n“The Achilles heel in that strategy is that whenever you have a volume surge the first thing that gets kicked off the aircraft is wholesaler cargo. If you say we can’t guarantee it [the shipment schedule], we have to roll it to the next day if we have an overload situation on certain lanes, the forwarders will throw up their hands and say I can beat that with point-to-point truck or I’ll give it to Forward Air and they’ll run it through their expedited less-than-truckload network,” the veteran consultant said.\n\nMost forwarders tend to use express capacity for less urgent freight “because when the planes aren’t full, it’s the best value equation. You will get the best service with the highest on-time performance, assuming you can use the capacity consistently,” Clancy added.\n\nHe downplayed the potential effectiveness of commercializing Amazon Air in Europe, because it increasingly has become a trucking market, Amazon utilizes small 737-800 aircraft, and policymakers there are discouraging short-haul flights to meet strict carbon-reduction targets.\n\nMeanwhile, FedEx is beginning to downsize its domestic, daytime freighter network after the expiration of a major contract with the U.S. Postal Service, part of a broader reorganization of the air network designed to reduce costs. The logistics integrator will continue to provide daytime service for other customers, but flight activity will be tailored to better maximize aircraft utilization, officials have publicly stated. The reorganization also involves segmenting express parcels to overnight flights and international deferred freight to daytime departures so that warehouse workers can focus on processing high-yield priority packages without the distraction of handling large pallets at the same time.\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper articles by Eric Kulisch.\n\nWrite to Eric Kulisch at ekulisch@freightwaves.com.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING:\n\nAmazon flying to generate 20% of Sun Country Airlines’ revenue\n\nAmazon concentrates parcel freighters at US air hubs, report says\n\nAmazon’s largest cargo jet makes debut\n\nThe post Amazon airline sells excess cargo capacity to third-party shippers appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "38.3% of Warren Buffett's $315 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Under Warren Buffett's leadership as CEO, the Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) investment company has delivered a compound annual return of 19.8% since 1965. That would have been enough to turn an investment of $1,000 back then into a whopping $44.7 million today. By comparison, the same investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to just $338,311 over the same period. That's why investors closely monitor Berkshire's every move.\n\nThe conglomerate's success stems from Buffett's simple investment strategy: He likes companies with steady growth, robust profitability, strong management teams, and shareholder-friendly initiatives like stock buyback programs and dividend schemes. One thing Buffett and his team never do is chase the latest stock market trend, so you won't find Berkshire piling into red-hot artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\n\nWith that said, three existing stocks in Berkshire's $315 billion portfolio of publicly listed securities are deploying AI into their legacy businesses in unique ways. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Amazon: 0.6% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nE-commerce is Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) core business, but the company is also home to the world's largest cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon is using AWS to build a dominant presence across the three core layers of AI:\n\nInfrastructure: AWS designed its own data center chips for AI development. One of them is called Trainium, which offers cost savings of up to 50% during the AI training process, compared to infrastructure powered by competing chips like those supplied by Nvidia. Large language models (LLMs): AWS developed a family of LLMs called Titan. Businesses can use them to accelerate the build-out of their own AI software applications. Titan LLMs are available on the Bedrock platform through AWS, along with a selection of other models from third-party AI start-ups like Anthropic. AI software: AWS offers a powerful AI virtual assistant called Q. It's capable of generating computer code to help developers accelerate their software projects, and businesses can also use it to extract valuable insights from their internal data.\n\nBut Amazon is also integrating AI into its e-commerce segment. It developed a virtual assistant called Rufus, which can answer shoppers' questions and even help them with product comparisons. Plus, Amazon launched Project Private Investigator in its fulfillment centers during the recent second quarter of 2024, which uses AI and computer vision to identify defective products before they are shipped to customers. That could be a huge cost saver over the long term, because it will reduce the number of orders that are returned for a refund.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon stock in 2019, but Buffett has often expressed regret for failing to identify the opportunity sooner. Still, as long as Berkshire continues to hold the stock, it will likely benefit from Amazon's fast-growing presence in the AI space.\n\n2. Coca-Cola: 8.9% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is the world's largest soda company, and it likes to experiment with technology to help improve efficiency, connect with customers, and create new opportunities to generate revenue. The company is now deploying AI in a variety of ways, and it even appointed a \"head of generative AI\" last year to oversee its efforts.\n\nSo far, Coca-Cola has used AI to craft marketing campaigns, and even to design a promotional version of its flagship soda. Coca-Cola Y3000 captures what the drink might taste like in the year 3000 by using AI to analyze mountains of customer data.\n\nBut back in April, Coca-Cola made its largest AI commitment to date. It agreed to spend $1.1 billion on Microsoft's Azure AI cloud services platform over five years, to help improve workplace productivity, supply chains, marketing, and more.\n\nBerkshire spent $1.3 billion building its stake in Coca-Cola stock between 1987 and 1994, and it has never sold a single share. That position is now worth a whopping $28 billion. Plus, Berkshire is on track to earn $776 million in dividend payments from the beverage giant this year alone.\n\nAlthough there was no way Buffett could have foreseen the AI revolution back then, his investment conglomerate will reap substantial rewards if this technology drives more revenue and earnings for Coca-Cola.\n\n3. Apple: 28.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the largest company in the world, with a market capitalization of $3.4 trillion. The company is rolling out its Apple Intelligence software, which it developed in partnership with OpenAI to bring AI to the latest generation of iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers.\n\nApple Intelligence can interpret messages and emails, and draft responses on command. It can also summarize content with a single tap, and prioritize notifications based on what is important to each individual user. Plus, Apple Intelligence will empower the Siri voice assistant with the knowledge and capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT application, which will make it more useful than ever.\n\nApple Intelligence will utilize Apple's latest chips, including the A18 Pro (for the iPhone), and the new M4 (for the iPad and Mac computers), which were specifically designed in-house for processing AI workloads. They allow AI features to function on-device, which creates a faster user experience because they don't have to send requests to external data centers for processing.\n\nBerkshire spent approximately $38 billion buying Apple stock between 2016 and 2023. Earlier this year, that position was worth over $170 billion, which accounted for almost half of the conglomerate's entire stock portfolio (by value). However, Berkshire sold 13% of its stake during the first quarter, which Buffett said was for tax reasons, and then it sold 49% of its remaining position in the second quarter.\n\nIt's possible the gigantic sales reflect Buffett's cautious view on the stock market overall, because the S&P 500 index is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.2, which is 55% more expensive than its long-term average of 18.1. Berkshire is now sitting on a record $277 billion in cash, so Buffett and his team might be waiting to pounce in the event of a market correction.\n\nNevertheless, Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, so the conglomerate will still benefit nicely if Apple Intelligence pushes consumers to upgrade to the latest devices to access its features.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Winners And Losers Of Q2: Revolve (NYSE:RVLV) Vs The Rest Of The Online Retail Stocks\n\nAs the craze of earnings season draws to a close, here’s a look back at some of the most exciting (and some less so) results from Q2. Today, we are looking at online retail stocks, starting with Revolve (NYSE:RVLV).\n\nConsumers ever rising demand for convenience, selection, and speed are secular engines underpinning ecommerce adoption. For years prior to Covid, ecommerce penetration as a percentage of overall retail would grow 1-2% annually, but in 2020 adoption accelerated by 5%, reaching 25%, as increased emphasis on convenience drove consumers to structurally buy more online. The surge in buying caused many online retailers to rapidly grow their logistics infrastructures, preparing them for further growth in the years ahead as consumer shopping habits continue to shift online.\n\nThe 6 online retail stocks we track reported a slower Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.6% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 1.3% below.\n\nAfter much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank’s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\n\nLuckily, online retail stocks have performed well with share prices up 20.7% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nRevolve (NYSE:RVLV)\n\nLaunched in 2003 by software engineers Michael Mente and Mike Karanikolas, Revolve Group (NASDAQ: RVLV) is a next generation fashion retailer that leverages social media and a community of fashion influencers to drive its merchandising strategy.\n\nRevolve reported revenues of $282.5 million, up 3.2% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 1.9%. Despite the top-line beat, it was still a mixed quarter for the company with a decent beat of analysts’ buyer estimates but slow revenue growth.\n\n\"I'm thrilled with our team's performance that fueled a strong second quarter, highlighted by a return to top-line growth and a more than doubling of our net income year-over-year,\" said co-founder and co-CEO Mike Karanikolas.\n\nStory continues Revolve Total Revenue\n\nInterestingly, the stock is up 38.9% since reporting and currently trades at $24.41.\n\nRead our full report on Revolve here, it’s free.\n\nBest Q2: Carvana (NYSE:CVNA)\n\nKnown for its glass tower car vending machines, Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) provides a convenient automotive shopping experience by offering an online platform for buying and selling used cars.\n\nCarvana reported revenues of $3.41 billion, up 14.9% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 4.6%. The business had a strong quarter, with adjusted operating income and EPS exceeding expectations. Carvana Total Revenue\n\nCarvana pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 43.2% since reporting. It currently trades at $190.90.\n\nIs now the time to buy Carvana?

It was a disappointing quarter as it posted a miss of analysts’ buyer estimates and slow revenue growth.\n\nWayfair delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group. The company reported 22 million active buyers, up 0.9% year on year. Interestingly, the stock is up 4.5% since the results and currently trades at $56.89.\n\nRead our full analysis of Wayfair’s results here.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nFounded by Jeff Bezos after quitting his stock-picking job at D.E. Shaw, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest online retailer and provider of cloud computing services.\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $148 billion, up 10.1% year on year. This number was in line with analysts’ expectations. Taking a step back, it was a mixed quarter as it also recorded an impressive beat of analysts’ earnings estimates but operating income guidance for next quarter missing analysts’ expectations.\n\nThe stock is flat since reporting and currently trades at $182.63.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Amazon here, it’s free.\n\nChewy (NYSE:CHWY)\n\nFounded by Ryan Cohen who later became known for his involvement in GameStop, Chewy (NYSE: CHWY) is an online retailer specializing in pet food, supplies, and healthcare services.\n\nChewy reported revenues of $2.86 billion, up 2.6% year on year.

(6:15) - Breaking Down Recent Performances: What Stocks To Keep On Your Radar? (28:30) - Episode Roundup: META, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, TSLA Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nIt’s time to check in on the Mag 7 stocks, formerly known as FAANG stocks or FANGMAN stocks. The Mag 7 stocks are the large cap innovators with high growth. The Mag 7 includes Tesla, NVIDIA, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Meta Platforms.\n\nTracey has often discussed how value investors can own both growth and value stocks. Value investors are not limited only to value stocks.\n\nWhy not look at the largest big cap growth stocks out there? Why not own some Mag 7 stocks?\n\nWhat’s the Definition of a “Cheap” Stock?\n\nBut just because a value investor might buy a growth stock, doesn’t mean that investor doesn’t want attractive valuations. A “cheap” stock, for value investors, doesn’t mean the share price. Cheapness is not talking about a stock under $1.00. Cheapness means the company’s valuations are attractive.\n\nFor value investors, valuations are often determined by looking at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. P/E ratios are usually the first default though, so Tracey looked at them for this podcast.\n\nThe P/E ratio is price divided by earnings.\n\nBut there’s a good case for the P/S ratio, especially when looking at technology stocks.\n\nTracey considers both on the podcast.\n\nAre There Any Deals in the Mag 7 Stocks?\n\n1. Tesla, Inc. TSLA\n\nTesla has underperformed so far in 2024. Shares of Tesla are down 3.1% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is up 19.4%.\n\nBut the sell-off doesn’t mean Tesla is cheap. It’s trading with a forward P/E of 113, which is at the nosebleed levels. And it has a P/S ratio of 8.7. That’s not cheap but at least it’s under 10.\n\nIs Tesla a deal on the weakness or is it a value trap?\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN\n\nHas Amazon EVER been cheap? Investors have always paid a premium for the stock, at least on a P/E basis. But Amazon is currently trading with a forward P/E of 39, which is among its lowest P/E ratios over the last decade.\n\nShares of Amazon have gained 19% year-to-date yet it’s still sporting an attractive P/E. Earnings are expected to rise 63.5% this year and 23% next year, which explains it.\n\nBut it is Amazon’s P/S ratio which is the real surprise. It has P/S ratio of just 3.2, the lowest of the Mag 7.\n\nShould Amazon be on a value investor’s short list?\n\n3. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\n\nNVIDIA can’t be a deal, can it? It has been one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street this year. Shares of NVIDIA are up 157.9% year-to-date. But earnings are also expected to be up 116% this year and another 33% in fiscal 2026.\n\nNVIDIA is trading with a forward P/E of “just” 41.5. But that is well under Tesla at 113x, and other growth stocks like Costco, which is trading at 49x.\n\nIs NVIDIA still a buy here?\n\n4. Apple Inc. AAPL\n\nWarren Buffett might have sold a bunch of his Apple position in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio this year, but he still owns a big chunk of shares. And if the greatest value investor ever owns your stock, there must be some value there, right?\n\nBut Apple isn’t that cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 30. Earnings are expected to be up this year, but just 9.3%. Shares of Apple have gained 15.1% year-to-date.\n\nIs Apple losing its shine with value investors in 2024?\n\n5. Meta Platforms, Inc. META\n\nMeta Platforms has been a quiet winner in 2024. Shares of Meta Platforms are up 65.2% year-to-date.\n\nIt’s a growth stock. Earnings are expected to rise 43.6% this year and another 12.8% next year. But Meta Platforms also has an attractive forward P/E of just 27. And it’s now paying a dividend, yielding 0.4%.\n\nIs Meta Platforms the cheapest Mag 7 stock?\n\nWhat Is the Cheapest of the Mag 7 stocks?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL, MSFT and AMZN in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Amazon.com Inc (AMZN): Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other the Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years.\n\nEconomic Resilience and Surprising Rate Cut Amid Geopolitical Tensions\n\nThe US economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, and the stock market hit all-time highs in the third quarter, averting fears of a recession at hand. While the economy has remained resilient for the better part of the year, the US Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut surprised many analysts.\n\nJamie Dimon believes the steep cut might be justified as geopolitical uncertainties can potentially disrupt the gains achieved by affecting supply chains and triggering uncertainties and fears in the market.\n\nREAD ALSO: Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks and 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows.\n\nPowell and other Fed officials are open to further lowering interest rates after last month’s half-point cut, but there’s market debate on the pace.\n\nSoaring tensions in the Middle East with Israel invading Lebanon and threatening to attack Iran have triggered a layer of uncertainty, which Dimon believes could have a significant impact on the economy. Consequently, the banker believes that the 50 basis point cut could offer the much-needed economic support as inflation continues to drop.\n\nNevertheless, James Demerit, Main Street Research CIO, believes the upward momentum in the equity markets will persist as the macro environment improves. While valuations appear to have gotten out of hand, there are still opportunities for stocks trading below their fair value as the investment environment improves.\n\nApart from the magnificent seven stocks whose valuations have gotten out of hand, other stocks are trading at 16 times earnings, which, according to Demmert, is cheap considering the strong fundamentals that support a further rally. Companies that have consistently grown sales and profits should continue delivering regardless of the uncertainties around the US election and soaring geopolitical tensions.\n\nAccording to Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, it is time to be upbeat about the market heading into year-end. “The bull market has survived the year’s historically weakest quarter,” said Hill in an interview with CNBC. “It is likely to remain intact through at least the end of the year, as earnings remain strong, interest rates are moving lower and consumers are still spending.”\n\nStory continues\n\nWhich Stocks Could Make You Rich in 5 to 10 Years?\n\nWhen considering which stocks to buy, it’s beneficial to ask, “Which industries are experiencing the most rapid growth?” Despite some sectors facing challenges post-pandemic, many are flourishing, offering abundant opportunities. The global economy is rapidly evolving, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, travel, online retail, cybersecurity, and green energy experiencing significant growth. The AI market alone is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027 (according to estimates from Markets and Markets). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, total employment in the United States will expand by 11.9 million, or 7.7%, to 165.4 million from 153.5 million.\n\nSome of the top stocks that will make you rich in 5 to 10 years are companies that can rally as the global economy grows on the back of favorable monetary policies. Additionally, they include stocks of companies that are leaders in their respective fields and well-poised to benefit from technological changes such as artificial intelligence.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head, reiterated utilities and large-cap real estate stocks are well positioned to perform heading into year end. Likewise, industrials and financials should receive a significant boost if the overall economy improves.\n\nAccording to Subramanian, the idea of the Fed cutting is not only liquidity inducing that should benefit the equity market but a move that ends up cutting money market yields. With liquidity slowly moving out of short-term bonds, most of it is ending up in equity markets as investors take note of high-risk reward opportunities at highly discounted valuations. Subramanian believes dividend stocks and growth stocks are well-positioned to generate significant value going forward.\n\nWith this economic perspective in mind, let’s start our list of stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years.\n\nPixabay/ Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, we sifted through multiple reports and rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 possible stocks that experts and analysts believe have multi-year growth opportunities. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them, as of the end of Q2 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 308\n\nThere is no doubt that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, given its market-leading position in e-commerce, cloud computing and electronics. Additionally, it is making a name for itself amid the artificial intelligence race as it leverages technology to strengthen its competitive edge.\n\nOver the past two years, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s venture into generative AI has generated the most excitement for the stock. Consumers are utilizing and benefiting from Amazon’s AI tools, which should allow the company to maintain its leading position in cloud computing and increase its market share as it invests in improvements and new features. In the second quarter, Amazon Web Services (AWS) sales growth accelerated to 18.8% year over year, attributed to the integration of AI.\n\nAI might offer Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) new opportunities and the biggest growth prospects. However, it is making investments in its other ventures and yielding outcomes. For some time now, Amazon’s fastest-growing business has been advertising. In the second quarter of this year, revenue climbed by $2 billion, or 20% yearly.\n\nThrough sponsored ads on its e-commerce platform, it already provides unrivaled exposure to advertisers targeting Amazon customers; now, with the launch of its new ad-supported Prime streaming tier, Amazon and advertisers will have even more opportunities.\n\nRevenues were up by 10% in the second quarter to $148 billion, attributed to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s e-commerce and cloud computing dominance. Due to each of these divisions’ advantages, investors should anticipate sustained growth from both of them. In the US, e-commerce only accounts for about 16% of retail sales.\n\nAs its cloud computing and e-commerce businesses grow, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is witnessing excellent margin expansion and revenue growth, affirming how it is well-positioned to generate long-term shareholder value. The operating margin reached an all-time high of 9% over the past 12 months. The robust growth justified the stock trading at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 31.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) closed the most recent trading day at $182.72, moving +1.06% from the previous trading session. The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.97% for the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.3%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 1.45%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the online retailer had gained 3.08% over the past month, lagging the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 7.36% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.41% in that time.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Amazon will be of great interest to investors. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.14, up 34.12% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $157.05 billion, up 9.76% from the year-ago period.\n\nAMZN's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.74 per share and revenue of $634.38 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +63.45% and +10.37%, respectively.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Amazon. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.21% lower. At present, Amazon boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nDigging into valuation, Amazon currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 38.12. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 23.92, so one might conclude that Amazon is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AMZN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.38. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Internet - Commerce industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 56, this industry ranks in the top 23% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Mag 7 stocks are the large cap innovators with high growth. The Mag 7 includes Tesla, NVIDIA, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Meta Platforms.\n\nTracey has often discussed how value investors can own both growth and value stocks. Value investors are not limited only to value stocks.\n\nWhy not look at the largest big cap growth stocks out there? Why not own some Mag 7 stocks?\n\nWhat’s the Definition of a “Cheap” Stock?\n\nBut just because a value investor might buy a growth stock, doesn’t mean that investor doesn’t want attractive valuations.

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla has underperformed so far in 2024. Shares of Tesla are down 3.1% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is up 19.4%.\n\nBut the sell-off doesn’t mean Tesla is cheap. It’s trading with a forward P/E of 113, which is at the nosebleed levels. And it has a P/S ratio of 8.7. That’s not cheap but at least it’s under 10.\n\nIs Tesla a deal on the weakness or is it a value trap?\n\n2. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)\n\nHas Amazon EVER been cheap? Investors have always paid a premium for the stock, at least on a P/E basis. But Amazon is currently trading with a forward P/E of 39, which is among its lowest P/E ratios over the last decade.\n\nShares of Amazon have gained 19% year-to-date yet it’s still sporting an attractive P/E. Earnings are expected to rise 63.5% this year and 23% next year, which explains it.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it is Amazon’s P/S ratio which is the real surprise. It has P/S ratio of just 3.2, the lowest of the Mag 7.\n\nShould Amazon be on a value investor’s short list?\n\n3. NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA can’t be a deal, can it? It has been one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street this year. Shares of NVIDIA are up 157.9% year-to-date. But earnings are also expected to be up 116% this year and another 33% in fiscal 2026.\n\nNVIDIA is trading with a forward P/E of “just” 41.5. But that is well under Tesla at 113x, and other growth stocks like Costco, which is trading at 49x.\n\nIs NVIDIA still a buy here?\n\n4. Apple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett might have sold a bunch of his Apple position in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio this year, but he still owns a big chunk of shares. And if the greatest value investor ever owns your stock, there must be some value there, right?\n\nBut Apple isn’t that cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 30. Earnings are expected to be up this year, but just 9.3%. Shares of Apple have gained 15.1% year-to-date.\n\nIs Apple losing its shine with value investors in 2024?\n\n5. Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)\n\nMeta Platforms has been a quiet winner in 2024. Shares of Meta Platforms are up 65.2% year-to-date.\n\nIt’s a growth stock. Earnings are expected to rise 43.6% this year and another 12.8% next year. But Meta Platforms also has an attractive forward P/E of just 27. And it’s now paying a dividend, yielding 0.4%.\n\nIs Meta Platforms the cheapest Mag 7 stock?\n\nWhat Is the Cheapest of the Mag 7 stocks?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL, MSFT and AMZN in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Meet the former Amazon VP driving Hershey’s tech transformation",
        "content": "With a dozen years at Amazon under his belt, Deepak Bhatia made a big career change last year when he joined Hershey as the candymaker’s first-ever chief technology officer.\n\n“The goal is not to simply take things that were at Amazon and bring them over,” says Bhatia, whose last role at the e-commerce giant was vice president of supply-chain optimization technologies.\n\nHe asserts that not all of the technology applications that worked at Amazon, which has expertise in cloud computing, robotics, and generative artificial intelligence, can also be applied to Hershey—a consumer packaged goods company that produces, manufactures, and sells the namesake candy bar, Twizzlers, Kit Kat, and other snacks.\n\nBut there are lessons learned at Amazon that he does plan to infuse at Hershey, particularly around automating tasks within the foodmaker’s manufacturing supply chain and inventory management. Some other areas of focus for Bhatia as CTO include investing in data science, forecasting, cybersecurity, and more precise spending on marketing and in-store promotions.\n\nAs Hershey looks to rely more on data for those decisions, which at times may be automated, humans will remain firmly in the loop. “We have to balance it with a measured level of skepticism in the machine output and not just blindly trust it,” says Bhatia.\n\nHe’s particularly excited about how gen AI can help generate marketing assets and develop new snacking innovations, while also bolstering productivity with AI-enabled agents, copilots, and assistants to take on more mundane tasks.\n\nTo get the workforce up to speed, Bhatia says Hershey offers tech courses online, but a bigger transformation is underway within the technology group, where there is less focus on a project-by-project approach and more emphasis on empowering tech leaders to collaborate and create solutions for the business.\n\nWhile Bhatia is truly excited about gen AI, his approach is not to throw the technology at everything. He wants to start with simple solutions and add complexity when it is justified: “That’s how I’ve seen a lot of these new technologies generate a lot of value over time.”\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nYou are the first-ever CTO at Hershey. What led them to create the role, and what were the priorities you laid out?\n\nWe’ve had CIOs before, but the first CTO is a strong message and gives the status to the role that it deserves in terms of what we want technology to do. First and foremost, with our people and talent, and what should be in house [versus] what should be external. Our preference is going to be investing in talent and capabilities that will future-proof us. Second, which I think is underestimated, is the value of data. The focus on data—making good quality data accessible and modernizing the tech—this is where our investments are going to be.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow are you remaking the company and the tech teams to help make a difference across the business?\n\nCore to this is obviously having the right talent. But how we organize is equally important. We are working very actively to reorganize, and that’s obviously going to be a journey. That can be anything from how we do end-to-end planning, including sales and operations, to supply chain. Other examples can be, how do we better spend and optimize our trade promotions and media spending and get the most bang for our buck? And the third is a never-ending desire to better understand the customer and better understand the categories and competition.\n\nWhat is the status of Hershey’s generative AI journey?\n\nIn the near term, there is huge potential that gen AI has in terms of agents, assistants, and pilots that really augment what people can do, automate it, and make it faster. We are investing a lot in gen AI in the application of how we do promotions, marketing, and content generation. It is the beginning of the journey, and the effects of this will manifest in the years to come. We are making huge investments not only in terms of technology, but also how we organize ourselves and how we invest in talent.\n\nDo you have generative AI in production today or are you still in test and pilot mode?\n\nWe are starting to test and pilot a lot of gen AI applications at the same time. If you have gen AI being used as a pilot in getting ideation and marketing content generation, then I would consider this to be more than a pilot. But it’s hard to say how much of a role that particular work stream you can attribute to gen AI versus what the actual experts are working on. Keep in mind, the sweet spot for a lot of these applications and technologies right now, especially on the generative side, is how they can augment or scale the ideation process.\n\nWhat do you think about the cost of generative AI and balancing those costs with the outcomes you want to achieve?\n\nThere have been huge investments that have been made by a lot of big companies in gen AI. The monetization hasn’t yet been completely figured out. What you will see is that there will be a few iterations of a pricing model and different solution providers will experiment and figure out a really effective way to monetize. It has to happen with the amount of investments that have been made on this entire ecosystem. But I think it’s very early to know how that will happen, and likely a one-size-fits-all strategy won’t end up manifesting.\n\nWhat is your favorite Hershey snack?\n\nI love our dark chocolate Kit Kat. But there’s a Hershey golden almond bar that’s only available in Hershey’s stores. If you get a chance to go to one of our physical stores, get one of those dark chocolate almond bars. I buy boatloads of them and bring them back home.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Temu Targets Amazon Fire TV Streaming Gadgets With $4 Remote",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Temu, locked in a fierce rivalry with Amazon.com Inc., is targeting one of the e-commerce giant’s most popular product lines: the Fire TV streaming device.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums Singapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes What Do US Vehicle Regulators Have Against Tiny Cars? For a Master of Brutalist Provocations, a Modest Museum Appraisal\n\nTemu is selling Alexa-activated remote controls that are compatible with Amazon’s Fire TV Stick for as little as $4. Similar generic versions cost about $10 on Amazon.com, while the official Fire TV replacement is about $25.\n\nSince emerging in 2022, Temu has challenged Amazon’s speedy delivery guarantees by offering steep discounts to shoppers willing to wait about a week to receive their orders.\n\nThe knock-off Fire TV remotes are selling briskly, according to Temu’s site, which gave the “best seller” badge to one product described as a “replacement Alexa Voice Remote Control” that’s compatible with Fire TV streaming devices.\n\nTemu shoppers purchased more than 75,000 units of the product, which had a 4.6-star rating from thousands of reviews. Many of the reviewers said the replacement looked exactly like the remotes that came with their Amazon streaming devices. The devices are provided by a China-based company called “Cilcone,” according to the website.\n\n“I was skeptical that this would work, but for the cost was willing to try,” one review dated Aug. 16 states. “All I had to do was put batteries in, follow the instructions and within 30 seconds it was controlling my Fire Cube and TV.”\n\nIt’s unclear whether Temu plans to carry other Fire TV-related gadgetry.\n\n“The products are sold by our third-party independent sellers,” a Temu spokesperson said in a statement. “Similar products are widely available across various online marketplaces.”\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said the company is investigating the situation.\n\nTemu parent PDD Holdings Inc. in August spooked investors after warning that revenue growth will slow as it battles rivals chasing China’s budget-conscious consumers. Challenges at home are making PDD more dependent on overseas markets like the US, where Temu is setting up its own delivery operation and actively wooing Amazon sellers.\n\nAbout 35% of all streaming media devices used in the US are made by Amazon, putting it No. 2 behind Roku, according to Parks Associates, a market research firm based in Addison, Texas. Amazon launched the Fire TV line of media players a decade ago and they’ve become the company’s best-selling products. Their remotes feature a button that directs viewers to Amazon’s video streaming service, which helped it develop that business as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has long been criticized for hurting its brand partners by creating generic versions of their products and undercutting them on price. The Seattle-based company has launched its own batteries, clothing, luggage, home goods and more. Amazon has favored its own products in search results over those sold by competitors, which violates antitrust rules, the Federal Trade Commission alleged in a lawsuit against the company last year.\n\nFour-dollar remotes could similarly undermine Amazon’s Fire TV business, especially if Chinese factories start churning out other generic accessories. Some shoppers will take a gamble on the Temu remote to save money even if it’s just a few dollars, said Rob Volpe, a consumer behavior expert in San Francisco.\n\n“Historically, the distribution channel for a brand is one of the key indicators to consumers of the premium nature or value of something,” he said. “To see Amazon products show up on Temu looks a little weird and out of place, but I would say it isn’t hurting the brand.”\n\n(Updates with Temu comment in seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "title": "Dave Clark made Amazon a logistics powerhouse. Now he’s raised $100 million to help Fortune 500s perfect their supply chains too",
        "content": "In over two decades at Amazon, Dave Clark oversaw the transformation of the online retailer into a shipping and delivery giant, before rising to the No. 2 executive role alongside founder Jeff Bezos and eventually Bezos’s successor, Andy Jassy.\n\nNow Clark is channeling that lifetime of experience, plus learnings from a brief, turbulent stint atop supply-chain startup Flexport, to bet on himself.\n\nClark founded a new AI-powered supply-chain startup called Auger this summer, and has raised $100 million in Series A funding entirely from the investment firm Oak HC/FT, he told Fortune in an interview on Monday. Clark’s aim is to help midsize enterprises with global supply chains—think the Fortune 500 outside of the top 50—integrate various supply-chain systems, and their data, from different providers into a single operating system that looks more like a consumer app than a clunky enterprise solution.\n\n“The software doesn’t really talk to each other; a friend of mine calls it Franken software,” Clark says of traditional supply-chain systems. “The pieces all come together but don’t [work] together, and so people end up setting up teams of analysts with Excel. A shocking amount of the world’s supply chain actually runs on Excel.”\n\nWith Auger, Clark aims to let business users get real-time answers to pressing questions around shipments, forecasting, and other critical areas through simple text queries. Such visibility should help increase a supply chain’s efficiency while lowering costs, Clark believes.\n\n“How do we allow companies to run their supply chains with the same level of simplicity and elegance as the consumer applications that they use every day?” Clark asked rhetorically. “The technology totally exists to do that, and I think it just hasn’t been put together.”\n\nClark says the sweet spot for an Auger customer will be companies that have global supply chains but aren’t so large as to employ massive in-house technology divisions. The startup will likely focus its efforts on U.S.-based companies initially, but hopes to eventually expand beyond that including into the government and defense spaces.\n\nClark moved back to Washington State from Texas to launch Auger, which is headquartered in Bellevue. The startup plans to grow to 30 to 40 employees in the next six months, according to a spokesperson. Auger hasn’t yet released a product nor has Clark decided which AI model or models the startup would use.\n\nClark spent 23 years at Amazon, retiring from the company in 2022 as CEO of its global consumer business, where he reported to Amazon CEO Bezos and later to his successor, Jassy. Clark spent almost a decade of his time at Amazon in roles more or less equivalent to a chief supply-chain officer, launching and scaling Amazon’s last-mile delivery network and laying the foundation for a new regional warehouse structure that the company says has helped increase shipping speeds.\n\nStory continues\n\nClark left Amazon for the CEO job at freight software startup Flexport, in part owing to friction with Jassy, his new boss. But Clark spent just a year at the startup before Flexport founder Ryan Petersen pushed him and his deputies out in a dramatic, befuddling move.\n\nClark, who says he hasn’t spoken to Petersen or Jassy anytime recently, had reportedly been considering a run for Texas governor in 2026. But he tells Fortune that he had decided not to throw his hat in the ring after Gov. Greg Abbott announced earlier this year that he intended to run for reelection. “He’s a great governor,” Clark says of Abbott, though he notes that he hopes to eventually get into politics, in part because of his disillusionment with career politicians.\n\n“Much of the problems we talk about today, whether immigration or anything else, are highly solvable problems that rational people on both sides share probably 80% or 90% of the same objectives and cannot get the ball across the line because it’s just too good politically for their careers to fight,” he says. “I think if you have a world where politicians … that’s not their career … you have a higher probability of solving some of these intractable issues that linger and create lots of dysfunction in the world.”\n\nAs for the impetus behind Auger, Clark says he had visions of tackling a similar problem at Flexport.\n\n“I went to Flexport with this idea that we could build the same kind of things we built at Amazon but for other businesses,” Clark notes. “And that was kind of the intent when I went there, but we ended up not aligned on the mission in the same way.”\n\nNow he gets a second chance. With a $100 million war chest behind him.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- After downgrading Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) this week, Wells Fargo said it is increasing its Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) position, recommending investors focus on the tech giant as part of its \"Signature Picks\" portfolio.\n\nThe shift follows limited visibility for Amazon's future estimate revisions, while Microsoft shows strong momentum in its cloud and AI services, according to Wells Fargo analysts.\n\nThe bank removed Amazon from its Signature Picks portfolio after the downgrade, which cited challenges in the company's outlook.\n\nWhile Amazon had delivered a solid performance, rising 40% since reintroduction into the portfolio in July 2023, Wells Fargo's Ken Gawrelski highlighted the \"limited visibility into further positive estimate revisions\" as a reason for the downgrade.\n\nIn contrast, Wells Fargo has increased its position in Microsoft, raising the allocation from 3.9% to 8.9%.\n\nThe bank's analysts are optimistic about Microsoft's Azure platform and its AI capabilities. The report highlighted positive Azure checks with partners finishing above plan for Azure in the recent quarter, driven by strong demand in cloud migration, modernization projects, and AI workloads.\n\n\"Stronger-than-usual checks suggest underlying Azure momentum continuing; expect shares benefit as more model clarity surfaces through FY25,\" said the bank.\n\nAzure growth is expected to accelerate with 33% year-over-year growth in Q1, including 12 points from AI, Wells Fargo stated.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft's rollout of Copilot, its AI-powered productivity tool, is expected to gradually drive adoption and long-term revenue, even though it's still in the early stages.\n\nWells Fargo has a price target of $515 for Microsoft, reflecting a premium based on its significant scale and favorable long-term growth prospects.\n\nThe report pointed out that the current capex investments in AI would continue to impact free cash flow multiples, but long-term earnings growth remains robust.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAfter downgrading Amazon, Wells Fargo says buy Microsoft stock\n\nGreencore stock rallies 10% as analysts say 'upgrade momentum continues'\n\nChina's stocks rally fizzles as stimulus offer disappoints\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We are in the fourth quarter of an eventful 2024 and market researchers' attention has shifted toward the holiday sales season of 2024-25. Several research firms have already projected the upcoming holiday seasons retail sales.\n\nAlthough physical or in-house store sales are expected to be muted and may even decline year over year, online or e-commerce sales are likely to be bright spot this year. Under this scenario, investors should focus on internet-commerce stocks for the near to mid term. Three such stocks are: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Wayfair Inc. W and Travelzoo TZOO.\n\nStrong Online Holiday Sales Projections\n\nAdobe has estimated 2024 holiday sales from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31 to reach a record-high $240.8 billion, up 8.4% year over year. More significantly, mobile transactions will account for 53.2% of total online sales, rising 12.8% year over year.\n\nMastercard SpendingPulse forecast total retail sales from Nov 1 to Dec 24, 2024 to increase 3.2% year over year. Within this, online retail sales are likely to advance 7.1% annually.\n\nDeloitte’s retail and consumer products practice projects holiday sales will total $1.58 trillion to $1.59 trillion between November 2024 to January 2025. This indicates a year-over-year rise of 2.3-3.3%. E-commerce sales are expected to grow 9% year over year to reach between $289 billion and $294 billion.\n\nEMARKETER projected that holiday sales during the November-December period will grow 4.8% annually to hit $1.353 trillion. However, online sales are expected climb 9.5% year over year. Salesforce predicts a 2% year-over-year increase in 2024 holiday sales to $272 billion.\n\n3 E-Commerce Stocks to Watch for Holiday Season\n\nThese three e-commerce stocks have strong growth potential for the rest of 2024. Moreover, these stocks have solid price upside left in the short-term. Each of these stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon.com Inc.\n\nAmazon is pushing ahead with its devices strategy. Alexa powered Echo devices are going great guns and helping the company sell products and services. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven Alexa has already been integrated into a host of everyday devices for a digital home, which has converted the nascent smart home market into a potential area of growth in a very short time.\n\nMoreover, AMZN is benefiting from an increasing number of Alexa-compatible smart devices. AMZN is racing to build an ecosystem around Alexa and it’s safe to say that it has taken an early lead over Google's smart assistant.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure as a service to enterprise customers. The expanding customer base of Amazon Web Services (AWS) driven by its strengthening cloud offerings, will continue to aid AMZN’s dominance in the global cloud space.\n\nExcellent Price Upside Potential for AMZN Shares\n\nAmazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.4% and 63.5%, respectively, for the current year. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 21.3% from the last closing price of $180.80. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $200-$265.\n\nWayfair Inc.\n\nWayfair is benefiting from growing momentum across active customers, owing to lower costs and increasing customer and supplier loyalties. W’s strengthening market share, driven by broad availability and fast delivery of products, is a plus. W’s strong momentum across repeat customers is a tailwind. A solid momentum in mobile app orders is contributing well. Strength in W’s fulfillment solutions and supplier advertising is a major positive.\n\nImpressive Price Upside Potential for W Stock\n\nWayfair has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 5% and more than 100%, respectively, for next year. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 15.7% from the last closing price of $56.32. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $42-$100.\n\nTravelzoo\n\nTravelzoo is an Internet media company. TZOO is engaged in the provision of information to subscribers and website users about travel, entertainment and local deals available from companies. TZOO’s operating segment consists of Asia Pacific, Europe and North America.\n\nEnormous Price Upside Potential for TZOO Stock\n\nTravelzoo has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 2.3% and 21.3%, respectively, for the current year.

        "title": "What's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy If Kamala Harris Wins in November?",
        "content": "The stock market has performed pretty well as the Biden-Harris administration draws to a close. Despite the steep decline in 2022, the S&P 500 has soared nearly 50%. Much of this performance was driven by huge gains for the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nCould this momentum continue in a Kamala Harris administration? And, if so, what's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Harris wins in November? Kamala Harris. Official White House photo by Lawrence Jackson.\n\nHarris' proposals that could affect the Magnificent Seven\n\nHarris has unveiled a wide range of economic proposals. Her campaign released an 82-page document outlining what she'd like to do to create what she calls \"an opportunity economy.\" Not all of the proposals in this document affect the Magnificent Seven, but several could.\n\nThe vice president's plan to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% has received significant media attention. Although this is a large increase, it's still lower than the maximum corporate tax rate of 39% that was in place before former President Donald Trump's tax cuts went into effect in 2018.\n\nAnother Harris proposal is to quadruple the tax rate on corporate stock buybacks. The rationale behind this plan is \"to encourage businesses to invest in growth and productivity.\"\n\nHarris also wants the federal government to invest in industries that are important to the country's economic and national security. Her plan specifically identifies the following types of businesses that would be eligible for tax credits:\n\nAerospace companies Artificial intelligence (AI) data centers Automobile manufacturers Biotechnology companies Clean energy manufacturers Semiconductor manufacturers Steel and iron producers\n\nEvaluating the impact of these proposals\n\nIn theory, the members of the Magnificent Seven -- Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) -- would be affected equally by Harris' proposed corporate tax rate increase. However, in practice, this change could impact the big companies differently.\n\nThe following table shows the effective tax rates paid by the Magnificent Seven in their most recent fiscal years:\n\nCompany Effective Tax Rate Alphabet 13.9% Amazon 9.73% Apple 14.7% Meta Platforms 17.6% Microsoft 18% Nvidia 12% Tesla (50% Tax Benefit)\n\nData sources: Company 10-K filings. *Tesla received more tax benefits than it paid in taxes in 2023.\n\nAs you can see, none of the Magnificent Seven companies paid the full 21% corporate tax rate. Microsoft and Meta had the highest effective tax rates of the group. However, all of the companies have been adept at using the tax code to their advantage.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat about stock buybacks? Most of the Magnificent Seven members have repurchased shares in significant amounts. Apple has by far spent the most money on stock buybacks -- $70.6 billion in the nine months ended July 1, 2023. Increased taxes on stock buybacks could cause Apple and others to change their capital deployment strategies. However, I don't expect this would significantly impact their stock performance or underlying businesses.\n\nEach of these companies could benefit from the tax credits for AI data centers proposed by Harris. As the three largest cloud services providers, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet might be the biggest winners on this front. However, Nvidia could also be helped quite a bit because its GPUs are used heavily in AI data centers. In addition, Nvidia and Tesla could potentially receive tax credits offered to semiconductor makers and automakers, respectively.\n\nThe best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Harris wins\n\nSo what's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Harris wins the presidential race? The honest answer is that there's insufficient information to know which stock might benefit the most from the aforementioned policies proposed by the vice president. Furthermore, it's uncertain if she would be able to implement all of her plans should she be elected. The U.S. Congress advances legislation; the president only signs the bills into law.\n\nThat said, many economists believe that Harris' economic policies would help control inflation, while Trump's plans (especially his proposed tariffs) could cause inflation to rise. If these economists are right, interest rates would more likely be lower during a Harris administration than they would otherwise be.\n\nWhile all the Magnificent Seven stocks should benefit from a lower-rate environment, I think the best pick of the group is Amazon. The company has a substantial debt load, which makes it a potentially bigger beneficiary of lower rates than the other Magnificent Seven members. Lower interest rates could also boost consumer and corporate spending, helping Amazon's e-commerce, advertising, and cloud services businesses.\n\nRegardless of which person occupies the White House over the next four years, Amazon should benefit from the shift of IT spending to the cloud from on-premises. This migration will likely be accelerated by AI advances.\n\nSurprisingly, Amazon stock has only climbed around 12% during Harris' time as VP. I suspect it could deliver much greater gains if she becomes president and interest rates decline further.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,006!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $42,905!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $388,128!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 7, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a red-hot investment theme for nearly two years, and Nvidia has been one of the most popular ways to play that theme. But the billionaire hedge fund managers below sold shares of Nvidia during the second quarter, and shifted capital toward two other AI stocks, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM).\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors sold 9.2 million shares of Nvidia, slashing his stake by 79%. He also added 1.1 million Amazon shares and 633,897 Taiwan Semiconductor shares. Amazon now ranks as his largest holding excluding options and index funds. Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 96,963 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 1%. He also purchased 702,235 Amazon shares and 1.1 million Taiwan Semiconductor shares, which now rank as his second and third largest positions, respectively.\n\nOf course, the second quarter ended on June 30, so the trades detailed above occured months ago. However, Amazon and Taiwan Semiconductor still come highly recommended by Wall Street:\n\nAmong the 65 analysts that follow Amazon, 95% rate the stock a buy and the remaining 5% rate the stock a hold. The median price target of $220 per share implies 18% upside from its current share price of $187. Among the 44 analysts that follow Taiwan Semiconductor, 98% rate the stock a buy and the remaining 2% rate the stock a hold. The median price target of $209 per ADR implies 15% upside from its current price of $181.\n\nHere's what investors should know about Amazon and Taiwan Semiconductor.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon operates the world's most popular online marketplace in terms of monthly visitors, and the company has fortified its leadership with a robust logistics network. Dominance in retail has helped Amazon become the third-largest ad tech company in the United States, and it could surpass second-place Meta Platforms by the end of the decade, according to eMarketer.\n\nBeyond retail and advertising, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the market leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services, which puts the company in a unique position where artificial intelligence (AI) is concerned. With the largest community of customers and partners among public clouds, AWS has more monetization and upsell opportunities than its rivals. And consultancy Gartner recently recognized AWS as a leader in cloud AI developer services.\n\nAmazon reported mixed financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 10% to $148 billion, narrowly missing estimates. But GAAP net income increased 94% to $1.26 per share, beating expectations. The stock declined following the report, partly because sales increased more slowly than anticipated, and partly because management gave somewhat conservative guidance for the third quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Amazon has a strong presence in three larger markets, and Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 22% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 44 times earnings look relatively reasonable. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 2, which is a discount to the three-year average of 2.9. Patient investors should consider buying a few shares today.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the world's largest dedicated chipmaker or foundry. It shoulders the cost burden associated with fabricating chips for other companies. TSMC accounted for 62% of foundry revenue in the June quarter, up 4 percentage points from the previous year, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nThat scale affords the company a significant advantage. It supports the aggressive capital expenditures required to keep TSMC on the cutting edge of semiconductor manufacturing, also called process technology. Heavy R&D spending, coupled with engineering expertise, enables the company to consistently build chips that are smaller, faster, and more power efficient.\n\nTSMC holds more than 90% market share in its most advanced process technologies, the 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer nodes, according to analysts. And management says its 2-nanometer node will reach volume production in 2025. Industry leadership affords TSMC pricing power, and it has made the company the AI chipmaker of choice for customers like Apple, Broadcom, and Nvidia.\n\nTSMC reported strong financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $20.8 billion and earnings jumped 30% to $1.48 per ADR. \"Our business in the second quarter was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by continued smartphone seasonality,\" said CFO Wendell Huang. He anticipates strong demand for smartphone and AI products in the third quarter.\n\nWall Street expects TSMC's earnings to increase at 26% annually over the next three years as the AI boom drives demand for faster semiconductors. That makes the current valuation of 32.4 times earnings look fair. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.2, which is a discount to the three-year average of 1.6. Investors should feel comfortable buying a few shares today. TSCM stock doubled the gains in the S&P 500 during the last three years, and I think it will continue to outperform over the next three.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) stock closed 3% lower Monday as Wells Fargo (WFC) analysts downgraded shares, noting that the company's strength in the cloud services market won’t be enough to stave off other hurdles to its profit margins.\n\nWells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski downgraded the stock from Overweight to Equal Weight and lowered his price target for the stock from $225 to $183.\n\n\"AMZN has been a consistent positive revision story, but we believe factors pressure revisions in the near term,\" he wrote in a note Monday.\n\nChallenges facing Amazon include rising competition from Walmart (WMT), moderating contribution from its ad business to operating income, and high costs linked to its satellite broadband project.\n\n\"Keeping these headwinds in context, Amazon remains a margin expansion story, just likely a more moderate margin expansion pace than the market expects,\" Gawrelski wrote.\n\nGawrelski is one of only five Wall Street analysts who don’t recommend buying the popular stock, Bloomberg data show. He sees shares priced at $187 over the next year. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts see Amazon stock rising over 20% to about $220, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nAmazon’s most recent earnings report in early August fell short of Wall Street’s forecasts. But strength in its cloud services division, Amazon Web Services, has helped make up for weaker-than-expected growth in retail sales. AWS houses Amazon's AI services, and it generated $26.3 billion in revenue during the company’s second fiscal quarter, ahead of analysts’ forecasts and 19% higher than the year before. Its advertising segment also saw revenue surge 20%, but its $12.8 billion in sales reported for the three months ended June 30 fell just short of expectations.\n\nAmazon is part of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks that have posted massive gains over the past year thanks to investor hype over generative artificial intelligence. Amazon stock is up 42% from last year.\n\nThe rapid expansion of Amazon Web Services has mirrored the AI trend. Amazon’s AWS segment has launched a host of AI tools for developers and consumers over the past year. AWS is making more money renting space in its far-off data centers to customers looking to power hungry AI software. Amazon expects AI to generate billions of dollars of revenue in the coming years. But Wells Fargo thinks advancements in the AI space won’t be enough to offset downsides from Amazon’s other businesses, which could hinder its profit growth.

(Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nWells Fargo’s Gawrelski said rising competition from Walmart’s burgeoning fulfillment services business will put pressure on the fees Amazon can charge merchants for storing, packing, and shipping their products. Gawrelski noted that Walmart’s fulfillment offerings for sellers are about 15% cheaper. If Amazon is forced to lower its fees, that would cut into its income from its retail segment.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon’s Project Kuiper, its initiative to become a satellite broadband internet service provider and rival to SpaceX’s Starlink, will shave $3 billion off its operating income in 2025 and 2026, Gawrelski estimated. He added that Amazon’s advertising sales will grow at a “much more modest pace” between 2025 and 2027.\n\nAlso on Monday, a judge ruled that the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust case against Amazon will move forward.\n\nWells Fargo sees Amazon beating expectations in the third quarter. The company raised its third quarter outlook for Amazon’s earnings per share from $1.18 to $1.26, well above the consensus estimate of $1.15, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Judge rules the FTC can proceed with antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, tosses out few state claims",
        "content": "A federal judge said the Federal Trade Commission can proceed with its landmark antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. But, he also gave the company a small victory by tossing out a few claims made by states involved in the legal fight.\n\nThe order, issued last week by Judge John H. Chun and unsealed on Monday, is a major defeat for Amazon, which has tried for months to get the case tossed out in court. A trial in the case is slated to be held in October 2026.\n\n“We are pleased with the court’s decision and look forward to moving this case forward,” FTC spokesperson Doug Farrar said in a prepared statement. “The ways Amazon illegally maintains its monopolies and the harm they cause—including suppressed competition and higher prices for shoppers and sellers—will be on full display at trial.”\n\nThe FTC and the attorneys general of 18 states, plus Puerto Rico, have alleged in court the e-commerce behemoth is abusing its position in the marketplace to inflate prices on and off its platform, overcharge sellers and stifle competition that pops up on the market.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed in September 2023, is the result of a yearslong investigation into the company’s business and is one of the most significant legal challenges brought against Amazon in its nearly 30-year history.\n\nU.S. regulators and state attorneys general are accusing the online retailer of violating federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws.\n\nIn the order, Judge Chun, of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, allowed the federal challenges and many of the state claims to proceed. But he dismissed some claims made by New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma and Maryland under state antitrust or consumer protection laws.\n\nAmazon, for its part, expressed confidence that it could prove its argument in court as the case proceeds\n\n“The ruling at this early stage requires the court to assume all facts alleged in the complaint are true. They are not,” Tim Doyle said in a statement, adding that the agency’s case “falsely” claims consumers only consider popular sites Walmart.com, Target.com, Amazon, and eBay when shopping for household products.\n\n“Moving forward the FTC will have to prove its claims in court, and we’re confident those claims will not hold up when the FTC has to prove them with evidence,” Doyle said. He also asserted the FTC’s approach “would make shopping more difficult and costly.”\n\nThe FTC is also suing Meta Platforms over alleged monopolistic practices, while the Department of Justice has brought similar lawsuits against Apple and Google, with some success.\n\nIn August, a federal judge ruled that Google’s ubiquitous search engine is illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission's case accusing Amazon of stifling competition in online retail will move forward, though some of the states that sued alongside the agency had their claims dismissed, court documents showed.\n\nU.S. District Judge John Chun in Seattle unsealed his ruling from Sept. 30, which dismissed some of the claims brought by attorneys general in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Oklahoma.\n\nLast year, the FTC alleged Amazon.com, which has 1 billion items in its online superstore, was using an algorithm that pushed up prices U.S. households paid by more than $1 billion. Amazon has said in court papers it stopped using the program in 2019.\n\nThe FTC has accused the online retailer of using anti-competitive tactics to maintain dominance among online superstores and marketplaces.\n\nAmazon asked Chun to dismiss the case in December, saying the FTC had raised no evidence of harm to consumers.\n\nThe judge said in his ruling that he cannot consider Amazon's claims that its actions benefited competition at this early stage in the case.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Andrea Ricci)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s dominance in the $300 billion search advertising market is under pressure as emerging rivals like TikTok and AI startups mount challenges, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal on Monday.\n\nThe publication said that while Google has long been the unchallenged leader, new developments in artificial intelligence and social media search capabilities are beginning to erode its lead.\n\nTikTok, the fast-growing short-form video platform, recently introduced a feature allowing brands to target ads based on users' search queries, directly competing with Google's core search business.\n\nMeanwhile, Perplexity, an AI-powered search startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is set to introduce advertisements alongside its AI-generated answers. Perplexity, which already generates revenue from a $20-a-month subscription, could further shift the balance in the search advertising landscape, noted the WSJ.\n\nAccording to the WSJ, citing research firm eMarketer, Google's U.S. search ad market share is forecast to fall below 50% for the first time in more than a decade by 2024.\n\nThey note that competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has steadily increased its share, are also chipping away at Google's dominance. Amazon is expected to capture 22.3% of the market this year, up from 17.6% in 2022.\n\nDespite the challenges, Google continues to evolve its search platform, incorporating AI-generated summaries and ads into its mobile searches.\n\n\"We're confident in this approach to monetizing our AI-powered experiences,\" Brendon Kraham, Google's vice president overseeing search ads, told the WSJ.\n\nNevertheless, they note that advertisers are increasingly looking for alternatives.\n\nThe WSJ also quoted digital advertising executive Nii Ahene, who told them that \"for the first time in probably 15 years, we will have viable alternatives to Google.\"\r\n\r\nThe increasing competition, coupled with Google's ongoing legal battles, paints a complex picture for the future of the search giant's grip on the market.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoogle search share slipping on AI, TiKTok challenges - WSJ\n\nChevron to sell assets for $6.5 billion to Canadian Natural Resources\n\nUS Supreme Court denies Uber, Lyft bid to avoid California driver suits\n\nView comments",

The main event with this card is the high rewards rate on those categories of purchases. If you’re already forking over for the annual Prime membership fee, you might as well earn top-notch rewards on your spending with the brand.\n\nThe Prime card is basically a store card, but Amazon isn’t just any old store. The uber-retailer is known for being able to deliver almost anything from alarm clocks to zucchini, and get it to you within a day or two in most urban and suburban areas. Prime membership grants you the speediest of deliveries without any additional costs, along with some other valuable benefits and services. Whether or not Prime membership is right for you is for you to decide. But you need it to apply for the Prime Visa, and the card is the only one that earns an unlimited 5% back at Amazon, Whole Foods and Chase Travel.\n\nThe Prime Visa’s earnings in other categories are fine, but if you’re doing most of your spending on groceries that aren’t at Whole Foods or shelling out a bundle for gas, dining and transit you’d be better off getting a card that earns high reward on spending in those areas. There’s a plain-Jane Amazon Visa too that doesn’t require a Prime membership. But the rewards are watered-down to 3% back on Amazon spending, Whole Foods and Chase Travel purchases. If you spend a decent amount of money choosing to “Amazon it”, the Prime Card (and Prime membership) will likely both streamline your shopping and save you money in the form of rewards.\n\nWho is the Prime Visa good for?\n\nIf your doorstep is greeted with cardboard boxes on the daily, or if you fill most of your shopping needs with a few clicks, the Prime Visa is a worthwhile option to score high rewards on shopping with Amazon that can translate into cash back in your pocket.\n\nWho shouldn’t get the Prime Visa?\n\nIf you rarely shop with Amazon, you’re better off with a card that earns high rewards in the areas where you spend the most. Even if you spend a lot on Whole Foods shopping without any Amazon orders, you’re still likely to find greater value in a card that earns high rewards on grocery shopping in general, freeing you up to shop at other food stores.\n\nPro Tip\n\nThe card that wins my 2024 No Brainer Award is the Prime Visa. It’s free, you’ll get a $100 Amazon Gift Card instantly upon approval and it offers 5% cash back on Amazon purchases (6% if you choose slower shipping at checkout). Given the glut of stuff I buy off Amazon (ranging from the silly to the essential), I’ve already earned $250+ cash back this year. Chris Butsch, Fortune contributor\n\nPrime Visa: How to earn rewards\n\nThe Prime Visa earns rewards at the following rates:\n\n5% back on Amazon.com, Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, and Chase Travel purchases with an eligible Prime membership. 2% back at gas stations, restaurants, and local transit and commuting, including rideshare. 1% back on all other purchases\n\nNew cardholders are eligible to receive a $150 Amazon Gift Card instantly upon approval exclusively for Prime members, which will be loaded into their Amazon.com account. An welcome bonus you can use that day is an unusual feature.\n\nHow to redeem Prime Visa rewards\n\nThe points earned on the Prime Visa are worth a penny per point for a variety of options, so redeeming 10,000 points would be worth $100. Here’s what you can do with your earnings.\n\nShop with points\n\nYou can redeem your points earned from previous purchases on the card toward future purchases on Amazon.com. A point is worth a penny this way and there’s no minimum redemption amount. Although this is likely the way many people will choose to use their points due to the ease of use, it’s worth pointing out that a more valuable use is to apply your rewards as a statement credit to your card balance so you earn points on every purchase. When you use your points to pay for an Amazon purchase, you won’t earn any points on that purchase.\n\nYou can also buy gift cards through Amazon for a wide variety of merchants using your points.\n\nRedeem points for a statement credit\n\nAs mentioned above, this is likely the best use of your rewards earned on the card. A point is worth a penny when redeemed this way and you can pay yourself back for your Amazon purchase while still earning points for the buy. You aren’t limited to just redeeming rewards for an Amazon purchase, you can choose to redeem your rewards from the card at any time and in any amount as a statement credit.\n\nRedeem to a bank account\n\nIf you’d prefer to have the money in hand, you can have your rewards deposited into an eligible U.S. checking or savings account. You either make this redemption online through your account or by calling the number on the back of your card.\n\nRedeem points for travel through Chase\n\nYou can redeem your rewards to book travel through Chase Travel. This includes flights, hotels, cruises, and rental cars . A point is also worth a penny when redeemed this way. Although these rewards can be redeemed for travel through Chase, they are not the same as Chase Ultimate Rewards and cannot be combined with the earnings from other Chase cards. Additionally, you cannot transfer Amazon points to any of Chase’s travel loyalty partners.\n\nAdditional benefits\n\nAuto rental col­li­sion damage waiver: Receive secondary rental coverage on most cars when you decline the rental company’s collision insurance and charge the entire rental cost to your card. Baggage delay insurance: If your baggage is delayed by more than six hours, you can get reimbursed for essential purchases up to $100 a day for up to three days. Extended warranty protection: Extends the time period of the U.S. manufacturer’s warranty by an additional year, on eligible warranties of three years or less. Lost luggage reimbursement: You’re covered up to $3,000 per passenger If you or an immediate family member check or carry on luggage that is damaged or lost by the carrier. Pur­chase pro­tec­tion: New purchases are covered for 120 days against damage or theft up to $500 per claim. Travel accident insurance: You are eligible for accidental death or dismemberment coverage of up to $500,000 when you pay for your air, bus, train, or cruise transportation with your card.\n\nCredit cards similar to the Prime Visa\n\nMaybe you don’t shop with Amazon enough to justify the annual Prime membership fee or you simply don’t want to be forced to pay a fee to unlock the benefits of the Prime Card. There are other options to consider that can still earn strong rewards with the online retailer.\n\nPrime Visa Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card U.S. Bank Shopper Cash Rewards™ Visa Signature® Card Annual fee Annual fee Annual fee $0 annual fee, requires Prime membership to apply $0 $0 intro annual fee for the first year ($95 year thereafter) Welcome bonus Welcome bonus Welcome bonus $150 Amazon Gift Card instantly upon approval exclusively for Prime members $50 Amazon.com gift card $250 bonus after you spend $2,000 in eligible purchases within the first 120 days of account opening. Rewards Rewards Rewards 5% back on Amazon.com, Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, and Chase Travel purchases with an eligible Prime membership\r\n2% back at gas stations, restaurants, and local transit and commuting, including rideshare\r\n1% back on all other purchases 3% cash back on Amazon.com and Whole Foods purchases\r\n2% cash back on gas station, restaurant, and drugstore purchases\r\n1% cash back on general purchases 6% cash back on your first $1,500 in combined eligible purchases each quarter with two retailers you choose\r\n3% cash back on your first $1,500 in eligible purchases on your choice of one everyday category (like wholesale clubs, gas and EV charging stations, bills and utilities)1.5% cash back on all other eligible purchases Our Take Our Take Our Take The Prime Visa is an ideal cash-back card for those who know their delivery driver on a first-name basis. With an industry-leading 5% cash back on Amazon and Whole Foods purchases it’s a no-brainer as long as you’re already paying for a Prime Membership. The Amazon Visa only makes sense if you spend heavily at Amazon and Whole Foods but are firmly against buying Prime membership. Learn more\r\nat Cardratings.com\n\nAmazon Rewards Visa Signature Card vs. Prime Visa\n\nThe Amazon Visa could satisfy those who shop occasionally at Amazon.com but can’t stomach the idea of paying the Prime membership fee. The card has no annual fee, no membership requirement and earns 3% back on Amazon and Chase Travel purchases compared to the Prime Card’s 5% in those areas. The Amazon Visa earns the same rate as the Prime Visa of 2% back at gas stations, restaurants, and local transit and commuting and 1% on all other spending. All of the other card perks, benefits and redemption options are identical.\n\nYou’d have to spend $2,780 a year in one or more of the Prime Card’s 5% categories to break even with the cost of the $139 annual Prime membership. That should help you determine if the Amazon Visa or the Prime Visa is a better fit for your spending habits.\n\nU.S. Bank Shopper Cash Rewards™ Visa Signature® Card vs. Prime Visa\n\nIf you’re willing to put in a little work, the U.S. Bank Shopper Cash Rewards Card could work out to be even more lucrative on your Amazon spending than an Amazon cobranded credit card. For an annual fee of $0 in the first year, $95 after that, the card earns up to 6% on your first $1,500 spent quarterly with two participating retailers of your choice, 5.5% on prepaid hotel reservations and car rentals made through the U.S. Bank Travel Rewards Center, 3% cash back on the first $1,500 you spend each quarter in an eligible category you choose, and 1.5% back on everything else.\n\nThere’s a long list of categories eligible to choose from for the 6% rewards but let’s assume you want it to always be Amazon. That means over the course of a year, you can earn 6% back up on a total of $6,000 in spending at Amazon or $360 in Amazon spending compared to earning $300 on $6,000 in spending at 5% from the Prime Card. But most people’s spending habits are not split into neat quarterly chunks and tracking the multiple rates and spending caps on the U.S. Shopper Cash Rewards card is best left for those who enjoy tracking the minutiae of how to maximize every dollar spent.\n\nChoosing between these two cards will depend on which one more closely aligns with your spending habits, including how you spend in areas that aren’t Amazon along with your willingness to pay attention to category caps.\n\nIs the Prime Visa right for you?\n\nEvery day can feel like Prime Day with the Prime Visa. If Amazon spending is a prominent part of your budget and you already have a Prime membership, adding this card into the mix is a smart move to earn high rewards.\n\nIf a Prime membership is unappealing to you, or you only shop a few times a year with Amazon, look to a card that offers benefits and rewards that you’ll get more value from.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nIs Amazon Prime free with the Prime card?\n\nNo, the Prime Visa card does not include a free Amazon Prime membership. Amazon Prime membership is currently $14.99 a month or $139 annually\n\nIs the Prime card a credit card?\n\nYes, Amazon’s Prime card is a Visa Signature card which means you can use it anywhere Visa is accepted.\n\nHow can I redeem rewards with the Prime card?\n\nYou can redeem rewards at checkout for Amazon purchases, for a statement credit for your Prime card, for gift cards, or to book travel through Chase.\n\nWhat credit score do I need to get approved for the Prime Card?\n\nLike most rewards cards, you’ll need good or better credit to be a likely candidate for approval for the Prime card. However, most issuers take a number of factors into consideration in addition to your credit score, including your income and other debt obligations.\n\nFortune Recommends™ has partnered with CardRatings for our coverage of credit card products.

And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google's behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.’s Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal.\n\nAnd even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored.\n\nA breakup\n\nCertainly, a breakup of Google’s empire — the most rare of antitrust remedies — has the most potential to reorder the tech universe.\n\nThat could include divestitures of its Android operating system, Chrome browser, or AdWords platform — all of which steer users into Google search.\n\nAny one of the three solutions would rip away a multibillion-dollar revenue stream from the tech giant, plus cut off data that fuels its broader search and advertising ecosystem.\n\nLegal experts disagree about whether this will actually happen. Hittinger said it’s unlikely because Judge Mehta must select a remedy that best serves the public interest.\n\n\"You can't just yank the rug out from under the American public that's been using Google's service, now ingrained in our culture, without a substitute,\" Hittinger said. \"Unless other competitors have a platform which is the same or better than Google, what's the public supposed to use in the meantime?\"\n\nA divestment of Android away from Google could have consequences for devices aside from those installed on devices used for internet search.

Airplane manufacturers use it to power video screens, and supermarkets use it to run their consumer kiosks.\n\nStory continues\n\nDevelopers also rely on Google to maintain Android’s ability to work across platforms.\n\nHittinger expects Judge Mehta to fashion a remedy similar to the one imposed against Xerox (XRX) in 1975 to end its dominance of the office copier market.\n\nThe company was no longer allowed to configure its copiers so that ink cartridge suppliers and other third-party components could not run on its machines.\n\nBut Bill Baer, former attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division, said he could foresee Judge Mehta requiring Google to divest Android or Chrome.\n\n\"The judge, in order to make this remedy meaningful, is going to have to do something that allows competition to flourish,\" Baer said.\n\n\"Because they're a monopolist, they charge the advertisers, who in turn charge us, a whole lot more than if the market were competitive.\"\n\nExclusive contracts\n\nOne likely scenario, antitrust lawyers said, is for the judge to put an end to agreements that secure Google’s search engine as a default on internet browsers and internet-connected devices that use Google’s Android operating system.\n\nGoogle pays as much as $26 billion per year to maintain its position on mobile devices like Apple (AAPL) and Samsung smartphones.\n\nProskauer antitrust lawyer Colin Kass said he suspects Judge Mehta to be particularly receptive to remedies that undo those contracts because their anti-competitive effects were at the heart of the ruling.\n\n\"This was a relatively narrow complaint and an even narrower ruling,\" Kass said.\n\nRepresentatives from Apple and other companies that benefit from the contracts testified that they chose Google for the quality of its search engine. Competing evidence from the DOJ showed Microsoft's Bing search engine attracted more users on its Edge browser when Google was not the default option.\n\nAn end to these revenue-sharing contracts would have considerable consequences for Google and Apple.\n\nThe contracts — which require Apple to install Google Search as the default across its Safari browser, Spotlight Search, and Siri — bring in an estimated $20 plus billion for Apple each year.\n\nTargeted search platforms like Yelp (YELP) and Amazon (AMZN) could also benefit from fewer search users being automatically directed to Google. CEO of Apple Tim Cook. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nTim McGinn, an antitrust litigation attorney with Gunster, said device manufacturers and browser services could choose Google as a default even if a court blocks Google from default placement agreements.\n\nPlus, he said, it's possible that the court could still allow Google to secure default placements for search but under new non-exclusive contracts that don’t raise antitrust concerns.\n\nIf Google can't get default placement any longer, it could also be required to give consumers a choice of search provider.\n\nMcGinn predicted the DOJ would ask that mobile devices, browsers, and wireless carriers give consumers a choice between search providers.\n\n\"It’s possible we’ll eventually see more phones and browsers pre-programmed to use another search engine,\" McGinn said.\n\nLast year, the European Union’s antitrust regulator, the European Commission, required Google to give a choice screen based on its determination that the lack of choice violated its antitrust law.\n\nSharing data with rivals\n\nThe DOJ could also ask the judge to force Google to share with rival browsers and search providers its “click and query” data that it uses to refine its search algorithms.\n\nSpecifically, the data includes Google’s intellectual property that tracks and learns from information that its search engine users type into its search field and links they choose by clicking on query results.\n\nRival US search providers include Microsoft (MSFT) Bing, Yahoo Search, and DuckDuckGo. International search providers include Russia’s Yandex and China’s Bidau.\n\nA spokesman for DuckDuckGo told Yahoo Finance before the trial that the company hoped the case would result in Google having to share its click and query data.\n\nThe data could help more privacy oriented browsers like DuckDuckGo and search engines compete against Google.\n\nThe spokesman said it can be more difficult for DuckDuckGo to attract advertisers because, unlike Google, it does not assemble user search profiles or search histories and then use that data to target users with advertisements.\n\nAnother remedy that some legal experts expect to be on the DOJ’s list is for Google to temporarily open up its internet index data to rival browser providers, such as Microsoft’s Edge, Apple’s Safari, Mozilla’s Firefox, Brave, and Opera.\n\nAI\n\nEven if Google were forced to divest search-related entities, or unravel contracts for default placement, these moves may not have a dramatic effect on the company, according to Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill.\n\nIts bigger threats, Thill said, are from new AI-assisted search engines and recent gains made by rival Meta in attracting advertisers.\n\n\"I don't think spinning off a browser or an Android operating system is going to have a dramatic impact on the company,\" Thill said.\n\nJudge Mehta, however, may have to consider how remedies to restore competition in the traditional search engine market may impact competition in the emerging market for AI-assisted search.\n\nOne concern, legal experts said, is that Google's search dominance could unfairly entrench its position in the market for next generation search.\n\nAt the same time, these fresh threats may work to Google’s advantage in the remedies trial, allowing it to argue that its overall search dominance is already under threat.\n\n\"If a violation is found, Google will say the market is already solving itself,\" said former US Federal Trade Commission Chairman and George Washington University antitrust law professor William Kovacic.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Why Amazon (AMZN) Shares Are Sliding Today",
        "content": "Why Amazon (AMZN) Shares Are Sliding Today\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nShares of cloud computing and online retail behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell 3.1% in the morning session after Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski downgraded the stock's rating from Overweight (Buy) to Equal Weight (Hold) and lowered the price target from $225 to $183.\n\nThe analyst is concerned that the projected gains from AWS (Amazon Web Services - cloud computing business) would likely not be enough to power the profitability narrative. Gawrelski added, \"While the market is more prepared for pressure on 4Q [operating income], we caution that margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well.\"\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Amazon? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nAmazon’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 30 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 3.1% as equities soared (Nasdaq +0.9%, S&P 500 +0.55%) after The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported nonfarm payrolls for September 2024, which exceeded expectations. Notably, nonfarm payrolls increased by 254,000, significantly surpassing the consensus estimate of 150,000. In addition, the unemployment rate clocked in at 4.1%, slightly below analysts' expectations of 4.2%.\n\nOverall, the report supports the Fed's favored \"soft landing\" narrative, suggesting that inflation can be controlled without significantly harming the economy.\n\nKeeping up with that theme, Reuters reported that Amazon plans to hire 250,000 transportation and warehouse workers in the U.S. ahead of the holiday shopping season. While the numbers were in line with the pace reported in 2023, it nonetheless underscores the resilient demand environment despite some retailers enduring a challenging year as consumers have had their wallets strained due to inflation, which is now cooling off.\n\nLastly, JMP analyst Nicolas Jones argued that Amazon could achieve $20 billion in annual cost savings with autonomous vans. Expanding on the rationale behind the idea, he added, \"By eventually utilizing autonomous driving technology for middle mile, in combination with deploying electric vehicles for last-mile delivery, we see an opportunity for AMZN to reduce shipping costs by ~20% globally ($20B) over time; this reflects approximately $1.15 of savings per mile.\" Jones maintained a Market Outperform (Buy) rating and a price target of $265, representing a 40% premium to the stock's trading price when the research was released.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is up 21% since the beginning of the year, but at $181.47 per share, it is still trading 9.3% below its 52-week high of $200 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Amazon’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,095.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. shares fell in premarket trading on Monday, following a rare analyst downgrade that cited concerns over margin trends into next year, which growth in the cloud computing business is unlikely to compensate for.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSingapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation What Do US Vehicle Regulators Have Against Tiny Cars? For a Master of Brutalist Provocations, a Modest Museum Appraisal\n\nWells Fargo Securities cut the stock to equal weight from overweight, with analyst Ken Gawrelski becoming one of the few analysts tracked by Bloomberg who doesn’t have a buy recommendation on the stock. He also cut his price target from $225 to $183, one of the lowest on Wall Street.\n\nThe e-commerce and cloud-computing giant fell 1.4% to $184 before the bell. The stock is up 23% this year, as of its last close, modestly outperforming the 19% gain of the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nAmazon “has been a consistent positive revision story, but we believe factors pressure revisions in the near term,” Gawrelski wrote. “While the market is more prepared for pressure on 4Q [operating income], we caution that margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well.”\n\nThere is limited visibility into a resumption of positive estimate revisions until the company’s July 2025 outlook, he wrote, and the strength of the Amazon Web Services cloud computing business, or AWS, on its own is not enough.\n\nAmazon is one of the best-liked stocks on Wall Street, with about 94% of analysts holding the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock, while none recommend selling. The average analyst price target of roughly $219 points represents and upside of about 18% over the coming 12 months.\n\nThe broad optimism comes is large part related to the AWS business, which is expected to see long-term demand tailwinds related to artificial intelligence, although there are near-term concerns related to how much the company is spending on AI-related investments\n\nAlso on Monday, Bloomberg Intelligence wrote that sales gains for AWS “appear likely to accelerate 20% in 2025, roughly 200 bps above consensus, our analysis shows, with greater contribution from gen AI, while demand for non-AI discretionary IT spending stabilizes.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "content": "LONDON (Reuters) - Freely, a new streaming service backed by the BBC, ITV and other British public broadcasters, will be available on Amazon Fire televisions following a \"landmark deal\" with the U.S. technology giant, the companies said on Monday.\n\nThe deal is a win for the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, whose joint venture, called Everyone TV, launched Freely earlier this year, allowing viewers to stream both live TV and on-demand content for free when they purchase smart TVs carrying the service.\n\nThe tie-up will help take content from the four public broadcasters - which are required by UK law to offer programming beneficial to the public interest - to more British households, through smart TVs using Amazon's popular Fire operating system.\n\n\"A deal of this kind, between a technology giant and those working in the public interest, is remarkable,\" Everyone TV Chief Executive Jonathan Thompson said.\n\n\"It represents a significant development in widening the availability of Freely and therefore ensuring UK audiences can access free TV well into the future.\"\n\nFreely's launch in April marked the first time all four of Britain's public service broadcasters joined hands to set up a streaming service, as they look to future-proof live TV in the age of streaming.\n\nFreely offers 70,000 hours of on-demand content, more than any other major streaming platform in Britain including Netflix, Disney, Amazon Prime and Apple TV, according to data from London-based Ampere Analysis.\n\nEveryone TV has also signed a deal with TV manufacturer TCL, which will include Freely in their new 2024 smart TVs, it said.\n\n(Reporting by Sachin Ravikumar; editing by Sarah Young)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon downgraded at Wells Fargo as 'positive revision story on pause'",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Wells Fargo downgraded Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Equal Weight from Overweight in a note to clients on Monday, citing multiple headwinds that are likely to pause the company's positive earnings revision story.\n\nThe bank also lowered its price target for the stock to $183 from $225, highlighting challenges that may limit Amazon's operating income (OI) growth through 2027.\n\nAccording to Wells Fargo, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains strong, it is \"not enough\" to drive positive estimate revisions in the near term.\n\nSeveral factors, including investments in Project Kuiper, pressure from Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fees, and moderating advertising contributions, are expected to weigh on Amazon's earnings growth.\n\nThe firm warns that \"margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well\" and that the company is unlikely to see the resumption of positive revisions until its July 2025 guidance.\n\n\"While the market is more prepared for pressure on 4Q OI, we caution that margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well. As such, we move to Equal Weight until visibility into margin expansion resumes,\" writes Wells Fargo.\n\nWells Fargo reduced its OI estimates for Amazon by $5.4 billion, $4.5 billion, and $5.5 billion for 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively, attributing these cuts to slower monetization of merchant services and advertising.\n\n\"Amazon remains a margin expansion story,\" Wells Fargo noted, adding that the pace of this expansion will likely be more moderate than the market currently expects.\n\nThe report also points to increasing competition from Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s expanding fulfillment services, which are now priced 15% cheaper than Amazon's FBA offering.\n\nWells Fargo believes Walmart's growing fulfillment capabilities could exert pressure on Amazon's fees and merchant services.\n\nGiven the challenges, Wells Fargo sees limited visibility into Amazon's earnings recovery in the short term and, hence, lowered its price target and rating on the stock.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAmazon downgraded at Wells Fargo as 'positive revision story on pause'\n\nIndia stocks lower at close of trade; Nifty 50 down 0.87%\n\nHIms & Hers shares rise premarket on upcoming inclusion in S&P SmallCap 600\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Billionaires Are Betting Big on These FAANG Stocks, and This $700 Billion Opportunity Explains Why",
        "content": "The stock market is the greatest wealth-building machine ever created, and it's available to anyone with a little money to invest. Over a quarter of those on the Forbes 400 list of the richest people in America built their wealth on Wall Street.\n\nYou can tag along with the most successful investors by following their disclosures with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Every quarter, investors with over $100 million under management are required to report their holdings on SEC form 13F.\n\nThe filings for the second quarter revealed that prominent billionaires continue to favor holding shares of elite tech companies, including the FAANG stocks, which are the following:\n\nMeta Platforms (formerly Facebook) (NASDAQ: META) Apple Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Netflix Alphabet (formerly Google)\n\nSome of the most respected billionaire investors are favoring two stocks on this list that control a growing slice of the $699 billion digital advertising market.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon is the largest holding for Daniel Loeb's Third Point and Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Investors. Amazon is widely known as a go-to shopping destination for over 200 million Prime members, but the online tech titan also has fast-growing revenue streams in several non-retail businesses, and one of those is retail media advertising.\n\nRetail media is the fastest-growing market within digital advertising. It is projected to grow 22% in 2024 to reach $140 billion. Amazon is growing right along with it. The company's advertising revenue grew 20% year over year in the second quarter.\n\nAmazon's advertising revenue is mostly driven by sponsored ads, which the company displays on product pages. But it's also expanding its ad business on Prime Video, where it's in the early stages of growth. The appeal for brands is to get their products in front of a large customer base across Amazon's consumer-facing properties. Brands can advertise their product on a popular e-commerce platform where customers can easily click and make a purchase, which is why retail media is such a fast-growing market.\n\nAmazon's trailing advertising revenue is $51 billion, and at the rate it's growing, it could have a significant impact on the company's profitability. North American operating income jumped 58% year over year last quarter, while Amazon's international segment turned a year-ago loss into an operating profit of $273 million.\n\nBillionaire investors are generally looking for strong companies with clear catalysts for profitable growth, and that's why Loeb and Halvorsen have large bets on Amazon. Analysts expect Amazon's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 22%, which could send the stock soaring in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nChase Coleman's Tiger Global Management held a $3.7 billion stake in Facebook owner Meta Platforms in Q2 -- the firm's top holding. Meta has enormous advantages in the digital advertising market with over 3.2 billion daily active people across its family of apps, including Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp.\n\nThe recovery in the broader ad market over the last year has benefited Meta's share price. Revenue grew 22% year over year in Q2. The company's share of digital ad spending was 21.3% in June, according to eMarketer, which is far higher than competing platforms. The second closest competitor is Alphabet's YouTube at just 5.6% a share.\n\nMeta must walk a delicate line, monetizing its platform with ads while not disrupting the user experience. Meta's large share and recent growth indicate it has mastered this ability to deliver relevant ads that blend with users' interests. In fact, recent improvements to its apps are driving up user engagement.\n\nMeta's investments in artificial intelligence (AI) are paying off, with Meta AI bringing better content recommendations on Facebook and Instagram. This feature is powered by Meta's Llama large language model and has led to billions of search queries by users, which can grow ad impressions and revenue. In Q2, Meta saw a 10% increase in the number of ad impressions and the average price per ad.\n\nAI could drive 94% of ad revenue by 2029, according to GroupM. Meta has tremendous resources to invest in AI infrastructure to create more sophisticated AI models that can benefit advertisers, improve the user experience, and ultimately generate big returns for shareholders.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta's earnings to grow at annualized rate of 17% in the coming years. The stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio is just 24 using 2025 earnings estimates, which is very attractive relative to growth expectations.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Quality Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other quality stocks.\n\nIncome-Focused Investing\n\nThe stock market has seen a notable 20% increase year-to-date, but as it approaches the seasonally volatile months leading up to Election Day, potential volatility is expected. The S&P 500 has historically pulled back 5% to 10% around election time but tends to recover afterward.\n\nInstead of cashing out, investors are encouraged to take advantage of any market pullbacks. Historically, when the Fed cuts rates without an impending recession, it creates a favorable environment for broader market performance. Mona Mahajan, Edward Jones senior investment strategist, recently appeared on CNBC to discuss her similar sentiment on these latest market trends, and where investors can find opportunities right now. We talked about this in our article about the 10 Best WallStreetBets Stocks To Buy Right Now, here's an excerpt from it:\n\n“When asked if investors should consider cashing out and taking a holiday for the remainder of the year, Mahajan advised against such a move. Instead, she suggested that if there are pullbacks or corrections in the market, it would be prudent to lean into those opportunities... Additionally, rate cuts typically lead to expanded valuations, particularly for sectors that have lagged behind in this regard. She emphasized that lower borrowing costs from Fed rate cuts would benefit both consumers and corporations.\n\nIn terms of investment strategies during potential downturns, she recommended focusing on cyclical sectors such as utilities and industrials while also maintaining exposure to technology and the artificial intelligence sectors. Mahajan underscored that diversification would be key over the next 12 to 18 months.”\n\nGlobal Investment Strategist at ProShares Advisors, Simeon Hyman, appeared on CNBC on October 2 to emphasize 'income' as a key focus, highlighting the opportunity in fixed-income markets, which could provide 10-15% returns if geopolitical tensions worsen. He thinks that the US economy is stronger than the rest of the world despite tensions.\n\nSimeon Hyman emphasized the importance of the term 'income' in the context of current market conditions, noting that the market was just 1% off its all-time highs. This situation presents a salary cut for income-oriented investors, highlighting the challenges they face. However, the fixed-income market offers a silver lining; it currently provides enough yield to cushion against worsening geopolitical tensions. For instance, the yield on the 10-year bond is nearly 4%, and there is potential for it to drop to 3% or lower if significant negative events occur. This scenario presents an opportunity for investors to realize gains of 10% or 15% on bonds in a tumultuous environment, a situation not seen in over a decade.\n\nDespite the current market being down by 3.7%, which is slightly less than 4%, Hyman insisted that rounding was at play. He expressed surprise at this performance given ongoing geopolitical tensions but pointed out that positive economic news in the US persists. Specifically, there has been a 50-basis point cut and indications of a soft landing for the economy. A month-over-month increase of just 0.1% suggests that if one can overlook geopolitical issues, the US economy is faring better than many others globally and remains on solid economic footing.\n\nAdditionally, Hyman proposed a covered call strategy focused on the Russell 2000 index, which has been underperforming compared to the S&P 500. He described this strategy as beneficial because it allows investors to generate income that could offset recent losses while maintaining a bullish position in small caps. Historically, rate cuts have positively impacted small-cap stocks, and this strategy enables investors to capitalize on that trend while also generating income through covered calls.\n\nFor risk-averse investors, the current emphasis on fixed-income markets as a viable investment option aligns well with the insights shared by Simeon Hyman, who highlighted the potential for 10-15% returns in bonds amid geopolitical tensions. Additionally, they may also explore quality stocks with reliable growth histories, which can provide stability in uncertain market conditions, similar to the defensive strategies Hyman suggested. As investors try to track stock performances to find strategies, we're here with a list of the 10 Best Quality Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list, we first sifted through Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF holdings to find the ones with an upside potential of over 15% as of October 4, 2024. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their analysts' upside potential.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 20.91%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is engaged in e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. It's the world's largest online marketplace, offering a vast selection of products across various categories. It also provides cloud computing services through AWS, streaming services like Prime Video and Music, and hardware products like Kindle and Echo.\n\nAWS, its most profitable part, has over 30% profit margins and is expected to grow by 15% to 21% each year until 2028, so its success is important for the company's future profits. AWS grew by 18.8% in Q2 2024. Amazon Prime has become very successful, with 200 million members worldwide. It helps customers spend more and is almost $100 billion per year.\n\nThe company is making money from ads on its content. The ad business is now worth $50 billion, after AWS. Evercore ISI thinks Amazon Prime Video could make between $1.8 and $3.3 billion in profit by 2025, which could increase its total profit by 3% to 5% this year.\n\nPhysical stores, like Whole Foods, are the smallest part of Amazon's business and aren't growing very fast. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has invested $30.5 billion in capital expenditures this year and expects more spending in the second half. This is driven by growing AI demand. Investors are confident in its future, especially AWS, which has a $156.6 billion backlog and improved profitability to over 30%. These factors add up to make it a great investment opportunity.\n\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI Superstars According to Goldman Sachs.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nUS technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk.\n\nWhile tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nThis has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave — particularly in software and cloud services.\n\nStory continues\n\nTheir scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants.\n\nLet's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds and hedge fund sentiment is an important indicator that we pay a lot of attention to at Insider Monkey.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. JMP Securities analyst Nicholas Jones recently penned an investor note on the company, maintaining an Outperform rating with a price target of $265. In the note, the analyst underlined that it was possible for Amazon to save more than $20 billion annually by deploying autonomous technology combined with electric combination trucks for middle-mile transport and replacing internal combustion engine delivery vans with electric Rivian Automotive delivery vans. Per the analyst fuel cost tended to be 25%-30% of the per mile costs in middle-mile and last-mile delivery, while electric vehicles could generate a nearly 50% reduction in per-mile energy costs.\n\nJMP viewed this as a medium- to long-term opportunity for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). More near term, as the company converted its last-mile fleet to electric Rivian fans, there was potential for up to $7 billion of annual savings, globally, contended the analyst. Amazon has deployed 15,000 Rivian vans in the US and thousands across Europe, according to JMP.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.

        "content": "The massive demand for energy as Big Tech races to build its AI infrastructure has been a tailwind for GE Vernova (GEV), the power equipment maker that spun out of iconic GE earlier this year.\n\nShares of the Cambridge, Mass.-based company have been hovering near all-time highs, along with the broader S&P 500 Industrial ETF (XLI), as investors look to play off the electrification and artificial intelligence theme led by AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA).\n\n\"[Vernova] seems to be caught up in the broader trade of AI and power demand,\" Daniel Rich, analyst at CFRA, told Yahoo Finance. The firm has a Buy rating and a price target of $230 on the stock.\n\nMuch of Wall Street's bullishness stems from expectations of power demand growth stemming from Big Tech's commitment to record infrastructure technology investments.\n\nAmazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) are expected to spend a combined $200 billion this year on cloud and AI investments, including building and maintaining data centers. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., May 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nPower demand from infrastructure technologies in the US is expected to more than double by 2030 thanks to use of AI, according to consulting firm McKinsey & Co.\n\n\"Because of how much more power we're going to need —if the projections are accurate to power data centers — to power AI applications, Vernova is definitely a winner,\" he added.\n\nOne Wall Street analyst dubbed the $72 billion company the \"supermarket\" for the electric power industry — from natural gas turbines used to generate electricity to servicing of power plants, modernizing electric grids, and building wind turbines.\n\n\"This company does everything,\" Raymond James managing director Pavel Molchanov told Yahoo Finance in an interview this week.\n\n\"Because the buildout of electric power infrastructure is an all-of-the-above story, that means all of these solutions are going to be needed,\" he added.\n\nVernova's reach is global, with roughly 30% of its revenue stemming from the US. Some of its biggest competitors, like Siemens Energy, Schneider Electric, and ABB, are based abroad.\n\nVernova expects to deliver 70 to 80 heavy-duty gas turbines per year in 2026, up from roughly 55 for the last few years. Servicing those units is also expected to grow substantially.\n\n\"We're seeing increasing demand for power generation, driven by manufacturing growth, industrial electrification, EVs, and emerging data center needs,\" Vernova CEO Scott Strazik said during the company's latest earnings call over the summer.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe recent deal between software giant Microsoft and nuclear power provider Constellation Energy (CEG) to restart a reactor at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island is one recent example of the growing energy demand among Big Tech.\n\nThe partnership has made Morgan Stanley analysts more bullish on the prospects of gas-powered plants adjacent to data centers.\n\n\"We believe a co-located data center and gas-fired power plant utilizing GEV's gas-turbine equipment could be announced in 2025,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Percoco wrote in a note last week.\n\nThe analyst reiterated an Overweight rating and increased his bull case scenario price target on the stock to $397 from $371. A rendering of GE's 7HA gas turbine. (Business Wire) (Business Wire)\n\nVernova stock is up more than 100% since its March spinoff, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 21% year-to-date gain. That's despite negative headlines in the company's most challenged unit — its wind turbines — after incidents of blades breaking off in key offshore projects.\n\nMolchanov from Raymond James cautions the strong run-up means there could be little room to run, though.\n\n\"It’s an S&P 500 stock that has doubled in the last six months. If that sounds a little bit like certain other AI-related companies that people are familiar with, well, that’s not a coincidence,\" said Molchanov.\n\nCalling the AI-fueled rally \"overstretched,\" the analyst and his team downgraded the stock from Outperform to Market Perform based on valuation. Much of the enthusiasm over AI is already baked into Vernova's share price, he said.\n\n\"The bottom line is that we think the stock could use a period of consolidation after its sentiment-driven gains, and we look forward to revisiting our rating if and when the trade becomes less crowded,\" he said.\n\nThe stock has 19 Buy, six Hold, and two Sell analyst recommendations.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "2 FAANG Stocks That Could Crush the S&amp;P 500 Through 2030",
        "content": "Building wealth in the stock market is not complicated. It simply involves holding shares of consistently growing companies over many years. In the last decade, a small group of elite growth stocks became the default choice for investors looking to earn above-average returns. These became known as FAANG stocks, which include the following:\n\nMeta Platforms (formerly Facebook) Apple Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) Alphabet (formerly Google)\n\nYou can make a case for buying all of these stocks. They all have solid competitive advantages and favorable long-term prospects, although some offer more compelling return potential than others.\n\nIf you're looking for the best FAANG stocks to beat the historical 10% return of the S&P 500 index, here are two I'd put my money on.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon is a large business with $604 billion in trailing-12-month revenue, but the company continues to grow at rates that can support market-beating returns.\n\nTrailing-12-month revenue is up 12% year over year through the company's second quarter (ended June 30), with the highest rates of growth coming from non-retail services like advertising and cloud computing. While revenue from online stores grew only 6%, Amazon's efforts to lower costs, improve fulfillment efficiency, and speed up delivery could translate to further share gains in the e-commerce market.\n\nYear to date, Amazon has delivered more than 5 billion units within one day. Faster shipping speed appears to be leading to the desired outcome, which is increasing order frequency, as management reported an acceleration in its everyday essentials business in the second quarter. This shows Amazon strengthening its competitive advantage in retail.\n\nThe efficiency gains in fulfillment are also leading to higher profits. Operating income nearly doubled in Q2 to $14.7 billion over the year-ago quarter. There are still plenty of opportunities to reduce costs, including expanding the use of automation and robotics and consolidating multiple orders to one box. The company could expand margins for several years, considering the growth opportunities in lucrative non-retail businesses like Amazon Web Services and advertising.\n\nAnalysts expect Amazon's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 22% in the coming years. Even allowing for a lower price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio over the next six years, Amazon investors could potentially double their money by 2030 and beat the S&P 500.\n\n2. Netflix\n\nNetflix has grown into a large entertainment business over the last decade with 277 million subscribers. But this doesn't mean its return potential is over. The company is still growing revenue at double-digit rates and opportunities to grow profits by expanding margins make it a great stock to hold for the next six years.\n\nStory continues\n\nNetflix turned in stellar results in Q2 (ended June 30), with revenue and global paid memberships up nearly 17% year over year. The company continues to see a positive impact on subscriber growth from paid sharing, which is putting an end to password sharing among members and boosting revenue.\n\nNetflix already earns industry-leading margins in entertainment, with an operating margin of 27% in Q2. Management is committed to increasing margins every year, but considering it's very early in scaling its advertising business, there is a long runway of opportunity to grow profits.\n\nMoreover, Netflix still has an attractive revenue growth opportunity. There are more than 1 billion broadband users worldwide, and more than 5 billion basic internet users. Netflix still has a small share of connected TV penetration, which could provide years of gradual growth in subscribers globally.\n\nAll told, Netflix can deliver solid growth for many years. Analysts expect Netflix's earnings to grow 27% on an annualized basis, yet the stock trades at a forward P/E of 31 on 2025 earnings estimates -- a reasonable valuation for this much earnings potential. Investors can expect Netflix stock to climb along with earnings, which should easily lead to market-beating returns through 2030.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: These 2 Stocks Will Join Nvidia, Meta, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft in the Trillion-Dollar Club by 2030",
        "content": "Getting to a $1 trillion market cap is such a challenging milestone that only a handful of corporations have done it. The list includes several tech giants, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Though this elite club is highly exclusive, more companies will eventually join it. Stocks that are headed that way might be worth serious consideration. Let's look at two: Visa(NYSE: V) and Novo Nordisk(NYSE: NVO). These companies could be trillion-dollar stocks by 2030.\n\n1. Visa\n\nVisa runs one of the largest payment networks in the world, helping facilitate millions of daily credit card transactions. The company has delivered excellent returns during the past decade as cash transactions continue to be replaced by other payment forms. Visa's market cap is just under $550 billion as of this writing -- so it needs a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 10.5% to become a trillion-dollar company by the end of 2030. That's well within the company's powers. For one, Visa has performed much better than that during the past decade. V Total Return Level Chart\n\nOf course, that doesn't guarantee the company will deliver the same returns in the future, but some of the underlying factors that led to such solid performances in the past for the business are still in place. Visa remains a leader in its industry, with its only true noteworthy competitor being Mastercard(NYSE: MA). Visa still benefits from network effects: The more people carry credit cards that bear its logo, the more attractive its ecosystem becomes to merchants, and vice versa. That helps ensure that it will remain a major player in this industry for a while.\n\nVisa also still has plenty of room to grow. Credit card penetration is relatively high in many developed countries, but not so in others. In developing countries, there is even more potential. Visa sees a $20 trillion opportunity across a range of payments it can capture. The company's revenue of about $35 billion in the trailing 12-month period is a tiny percentage of that total. If Visa can make headway in its addressable market, the company's revenue, earnings, and stock price should move in the same direction they have during the past 10 years.\n\nThe company is well-equipped to deliver a CAGR of more than 10.5% through 2030.\n\n2. Novo Nordisk\n\nAs of this writing, Novo Nordisk's market cap is about $400 billion. To hit $1 trillion, it would need a CAGR of about 16.5%. That would be an impressive average to maintain for six years, but Novo Nordisk has been more than impressive recently. Brand names like Wegovy and Ozempic have become famous. Both are GLP-1 medicines that treat obesity and diabetes, respectively. Novo Nordisk has been one of the pioneers in the GLP-1 weight loss market, which is now attracting pharmaceutical companies left and right.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome analysts estimate that the weight loss drug market will hit $150 billion by the early 2030s -- it was worth just $24 billion last year. And although there will be plenty of challengers, Novo Nordisk's pipeline in this field is second to none. The company's most promising programs include an oral medicine called amycretin, and CagriSema, which some have estimated could generate as much as $20.2 billion in revenue by 2030.\n\nThat barely scratches the surface of Novo Nordisk's pipeline, though. Semaglutide (the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic) is being tested in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, two areas with high unmet needs. The company is developing several other diabetes and obesity medicines, and a range of treatments for various rare diseases. Novo Nordisk's revenue has grown rapidly during the past five years, as have its stock price and market cap. NVO Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nThe drugmaker should earn important approvals during the next few years, which will help it continue generating excellent financial results through the end of the decade. Becoming a trillion-dollar stock by 2030 is well within Novo Nordisk's reach, and it should continue beating the market beyond that.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Alphabet 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Alphabet is one of the world's largest companies. With a market cap of $2 trillion, there are only a handful of stocks that can compete with its size.\n\nHowever, there are companies that could grow even larger than Alphabet within the next five years. Here, I'll cover two that could pull off that feat: MetaPlatforms (NASDAQ: META) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nAs of this writing, Meta Platforms' market cap stands at about $1.5 trillion. That trails Alphabet by a little more than $500 billion.\n\nYet while Meta is only 75% the size of Alphabet, I think it could overtake its rival in the very near future. Here's why.\n\nFirst, Meta is enormous. The company can claim nearly 3.3 billion daily active users (DAUs) across its platforms, which include Facebook and Instagram. That means more than a third of the global population uses Meta's platform regularly.\n\nAccordingly, given the size of its user base, the company reaps an enormous windfall in terms of ad revenue. In its most recently reported quarter, Meta tallied $38.3 billion in ad revenue. That works out to about $425 million per day.\n\nTrue, Alphabet makes even more in ad revenue right now, but it's facing some challenges in its key category of internet search. That's to say nothing of the recent federal antitrust ruling that labeled the company a monopoly.\n\nIn short, Meta's bread and butter is ad revenue, and it's an area that is not only highly lucrative -- Meta's operating margin is a stout 38% -- it's growing like a weed. The company's overall revenue grew by 22% in its most recent quarter, despite its size.\n\nIn other words, Meta has plenty of gas in the tank to catch Alphabet by 2029 -- if not sooner.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nIf Meta still has a sizable gap to overtake Alphabet, Amazon has only a tiny crack. As of this writing, Amazon's market cap of $1.9 trillion trails Alphabet's market cap by about $100 billion, or roughly 5%.\n\nIndeed, during the past 10 years, these two companies have traded places several times, with Alphabet holding a steady lead from 2014-2018. Amazon edged ahead from 2018-2022, only to see Alphabet retake the lead in recent years.\n\nHowever, I think Amazon will not only retake the lead, but move significantly ahead of Alphabet during the next five years. The main reason why is that Amazon is starting to hit its stride under Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who took over from Jeff Bezos in 2021.\n\nThree years into the job, Jassy is putting his own mark on Amazon, starting with the company's increased efficiency. As of its most recently reported quarter, Amazon's operating margin climbed to almost 10%. That's up significantly from its recent low of 1.8%, hit about one year after Jassy took over from Bezos.\n\nStory continues AMZN Operating Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nTwo companies to watch\n\nBoth Amazon and Meta Platforms are gaining ground on Alphabet's giant market cap. While I believe all three stocks remain solid long-term buy-and-hold candidates, investors may want to focus on Amazon and Meta, as those companies appear better positioned than Alphabet over the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Last week closed on a positive note, with two key developments easing concerns about the economy. A strong jobs report helped calm fears of a weakening labor market, while the resolution of the dockworkers’ strike alleviated worries about supply chain disruptions. In addition, oil prices, which had surged early in the week due to Middle East tensions, saw a welcome pullback by the weekend.\n\nThis week promises to be action-packed, with plenty on the horizon. With this wave of optimism, let’s dive into what the coming week has in store.\n\nThree-day Nvidia AI summit\n\nNVIDIA’s AI Summit kicks off Monday, running from Oct. 7-9 in Washington, D.C. The three-day event will bring together industry leaders to explore how AI can tackle some of society’s biggest challenges. With a focus on healthcare, cybersecurity, manufacturing, and more, the summit will highlight AI’s potential to drive innovation across key sectors.\n\nAmazon’s two-day Prime Day sale\n\nAmazon’s (AMZN) highly anticipated two-day Prime Day sale event kicks off Tuesday, offering a valuable glimpse into consumer behavior and e-commerce trends. The sale will provide key insights into what products shoppers are prioritizing, as well as into the broader state of consumer demand. This event is expected to highlight popular categories and pricing strategies and could serve as a bellwether for the coming holiday shopping season.\n\nAmazon’s recruitment strategy is partly driven by expectations that e-commerce spending will surpass overall holiday sales in the fourth quarter. The company’s Prime Day event earlier this year generated over $14.2 billion in online sales, marking one of the biggest e-commerce events of the year.\n\nMusk will finally unveil robotaxi\n\nTesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk will finally unveil the highly anticipated Robotaxi on Thursday at Warner Bros. Studios (WBD) in Los Angeles, California. Dubbed “We, Robot,” the event will show the first look at the prototype and the booking platform for owners and riders. There will be also an update to the company’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, which powers the robotaxis, along with a production timeline and the service launch date.\n\nBeginning of the financial giants’ earnings\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) is set to report its earnings ahead of the closing bell Tuesday. Then, Thursday, Delta Air Lines (DAL), Infosys (INFY), and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) are scheduled to release their earnings before the market opens. The week will close with major banks taking center stage Friday, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), BlackRock (BLK), and the BNY Mellon (BK) lead off the quarterly earnings season for the financial sector.\n\nInflation data due this week\n\nThe Consumer Credit report for September is set to be released Monday. Midweek (on Wednesday), investors will keep an eye on the Wholesale Inventories data for August, along with the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s September FOMC meeting, which could provide insights into the central bank’s next moves.\n\nThursday will bring a trio of key data releases, including initial jobless claims, the consumer price index (CPI), and core CPI, offering a detailed look at inflation and labor market trends. Finally, on Friday, the producer price index (PPI) and core PPI will be released alongside preliminary consumer sentiment data for October, rounding out the week with a comprehensive view of inflationary pressures and consumer outlooks.\n\n– Francisco Velasquez contributed to this article\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) the Best Stock to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio. In this article, we will look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio.\n\nRay Dalio was born in 1949 and graduated from Long Island University in 1971. After a brief stint as a clerk on the New York Stock Exchange, he attended Harvard Business School and earned his MBA in 1973. That same year, he became the Director of Commodities at Dominick & Dominick LLC and later traded futures at Shearson Hayden Stone for a year. Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates in 1973 in his apartment. In July 2011, he stepped down as CEO but continued to work as a co-CIO alongside Robert Prince and Greg Jensen, taking on the title of “Mentor.”\n\nBridgewater Associates is notable for its focus on transparency and accountability. The firm promotes a culture where team members take responsibility for mistakes and learn from them. It encourages questioning and alignment, ensuring everyone regularly evaluates the validity of their ideas. This approach is crucial to the firm’s management style and investment strategies.\n\nRay Dalio Warns of U.S. Decline\n\nRay Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, emphasized that since 1945, the United States has been the dominant global empire, but it is now in a state of relative decline. This decline isn’t just an opinion, it’s supported by concrete measures such as the nation’s share of global GDP, military strength, and the quality of its education system. These factors indicate that the U.S. is losing its position.\n\nIn addition to these, Dalio points out two other key elements that often disrupt world order: natural events like droughts, floods, and pandemics, which have historically caused more damage and upheaval than wars, and human creativity and technological innovation, which bring about substantial changes. Dalio believes all five factors are influencing the U.S. today. However, he stresses that the most critical issue is how people manage these challenges together.\n\nThe ability to address them intelligently and without creating further conflict is essential. If conflict arises, it could lead to a devastating outcome. But if people can come together and handle the situation effectively, the country can navigate these issues successfully. For Dalio, how society deals with one another is the number one factor in determining the future.\n\nChina Faces Economic Challenges and Urgent Need for Restructuring After Four Years of Change\n\nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Ray Dalio also highlighted significant issues in China that have emerged over the past four years. He explained that China is in need of a major restructuring, as a large portion of individual spending, around 70%, was invested in real estate. With the decline in real estate, stocks, and salaries, people have become more cautious, reducing their spending and holding onto cash. In a deflationary environment, cash has become a relatively safe asset. This situation is affecting both households and businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nDalio also pointed out that the government sector is facing serious challenges. Local governments, responsible for 83% of public spending, previously relied on land sales to generate revenue. With land sales drying up, these governments have accumulated significant debt, and now they’re struggling to pay it off. The key question is how to inject money into these local economies to keep them functioning. Dalio compared the situation to Japan’s struggles in 1990, noting that China’s challenges are even more severe and will require deep restructuring to resolve.\n\nIn addition to economic concerns, Dalio raised questions about property ownership and values. He referenced Deng Xiaoping’s famous statement, “It’s glorious to be rich,” and wondered if that sentiment still holds true in China today. The overall environment in the country is becoming more complex and difficult, as these economic and political issues intensify.\n\nDalio also emphasized the importance of being cautious when investing in China. He made it clear that every country goes through economic cycles, experiencing both highs and lows. According to Dalio, it’s crucial not to invest too heavily in any one country, including China, to avoid having it dominate your portfolio. Despite the challenges China faces, Dalio continues to invest there, but he stressed that the key consideration is the size and structure of the investment. Overall, his experience investing in China has been positive, though careful management is essential.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through Bridgewater Associates’ Q2 2024 13F portfolio and picked the top 10 stocks held by the fund. We also added the total number of hedge fund investors per company, as of Q2 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of Bridgewater Associates’ stake in them.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nTotal Number of Shares Owned: 2,645,567\n\nTotal Value of Shares Owned: $511,255,823\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a bright outlook, supported by strong financial results and smart strategies for growth. In Q2 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported revenues of $144.5 billion, a 12% increase from the previous year, with net income reaching $7.9 billion. This growth came from solid performances in both e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), which generated $26.4 billion in revenue, up 15%, showing its strength in the cloud computing market.\n\nA major reason for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s success is its continuous investment in logistics and fulfillment. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is expanding its delivery network, including new centers and advanced technology, which improves customer satisfaction and helps it gain more market share. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s advertising business is thriving, with revenue reaching $12.2 billion in Q2 2024, a 21% increase, as more brands invest in digital marketing on its platform.\n\nMoreover, Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.”\n\nOverall, AMZN ranks 4th on our list of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN, but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "OpenAI is considering transitioning from a nonprofit into a for-profit company, and its deep-pocketed benefactor, Microsoft (MSFT), has a lot to gain if the ChatGPT developer gets the green light to act more like a startup.\n\n\"Anything that frees up OpenAI to focus on profit is likely to benefit Microsoft's investment in the company,\" said Sarah Kreps, director of the Tech Policy Institute in the Brooks School of Public Policy at Cornell University.\n\nA reconfigured business structure would give Microsoft an opportunity to renegotiate its already generous profit cap, as well as discard a provision that denies Microsoft an interest in OpenAI-created general artificial intelligence (GAI), according to another observer.\n\n“[OpenAI] is clearly saying that the nonprofit will no longer be in control, so presumably that means Microsoft and other investors will have more say about what OpenAI does,\" said Rose Chan Loui, founding executive director of the University of California Los Angeles's Lowell Milken Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofits. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, right, speaks as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman looks on during the OpenAI DevDay event last November in San Francisco. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nBut there are potential snags for Microsoft as OpenAI attempts to shed its charitable cloak.\n\nOpenAI's huge valuation, labyrinth of for-profit subsidiaries, and potentially risky technology make a for-profit switch legally and publicly complicated — and could invite pushback from regulators.\n\nStill, OpenAI's investors see plenty of upside. On Wednesday, the company announced it raised some $6.6 billion in its latest funding round, valuing the Sam Altman-helped firm at $157 billion. However, that valuation is largely contingent on OpenAI becoming a for-profit entity.\n\nWhirlwind of change\n\nOpenAI is in the midst of a whirlwind of change.\n\nIt is experiencing an extended executive exodus including, most recently, the departure of chief technology officer Mira Murati. It also faces increased competition from rivals including Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon-backed (AMZN) Anthropic.\n\nThe reclassification to a for-profit structure would be yet another seismic shift for OpenAI, upending the way it was established nearly a decade ago.\n\nIt began in 2015 as a nonprofit under the name OpenAI Inc., a nod to its mission of advancing humanity instead of pursuing profits.\n\n“The corporation is not organized for the private gain of any person,” OpenAI’s certificate of incorporation stated in its organizing documents, along with a promise to keep its technology as open source for public benefit.\n\nThings evolved in 2019 when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and his team created a for-profit subsidiary to raise outside venture capital — including billions from Microsoft.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was structured in such a way that the for-profit subsidiary, technically owned by a holding company owned by OpenAI employees and investors, remained under the control of the nonprofit and its board of directors while giving its biggest backer (Microsoft) no board seats and no voting power.\n\nThe inherent tension between these two parts of the enterprise is what contributed to a dramatic boardroom clash in 2023, when Altman was ousted by the board and then brought back five days later.\n\nIn the aftermath, Microsoft took a non-voting observer position on OpenAI’s board, only to relinquish that seat this year as both OpenAI and Microsoft came under more regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThe idea of upending the current structure has already attracted interest from US and European regulators and exacerbated an ideological divide between scientific and business leaders who warn that machine learning technologies like those developed by OpenAI should remain accessible to the public.\n\nThe technology, they argue, poses an existential threat to humankind and, therefore, should be operated in a way that's subject to public scrutiny. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, at a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law Subcommittee hearing in 2023. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Bill Clark via Getty Images)\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft are also part of an ongoing inquiry by the US Federal Trade Commission over concerns that AI market consolidation is “distorting innovation and undermining fair competition.”\n\nAnd multiple calls have been made for California’s attorney general to probe the legality of OpenAI’s business structure. One came from Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI with Altman. He sued OpenAI, Altman and 21 named OpenAI subsidiaries.\n\nMusk said the defendants fraudulently promised that his $100 million in OpenAI investments would be used for public benefit.\n\nA transition by OpenAI to for-profit status could also attract the attention of the Internal Revenue Service, given that OpenAI was granted tax-exempt status as a charitable organization.\n\n'Did they get fair market value?'\n\nOne unknown question is to what extent Microsoft will be able to directly extract profits from its investments.\n\nBy law, a nonprofit must use its assets only for its stated charitable purposes. And OpenAI's assets, which include all of OpenAI's subsidiaries, may not be sold for anything less than fair market value.\n\nThe question regulators will want to confirm is, \"Did they get fair market value for the asset at the time?\" said Gene Takagi, a principal at NEO Law Group.\n\nChan Loui added that regulators would require OpenAI to realistically value its assets, including residual interest. And she suspects that figure may be in excess of OpenAI's latest valuation.\n\n“I think the greatest sensitivity probably is with how they remove the nonprofit's control,” she said. \"And I think their best shot of avoiding conflict relating to restructuring is to compensate the nonprofit enough,” Chan Loui said.\n\n“I think that's the best way for them to get the public on their side, the states on their side, and the IRS on their side.\" Elon Musk looks on during the Milken Conference in May. REUTERS/David Swanson/File Photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nWhat OpenAI is expected to do as part of its transition is register as a public benefit corporation.\n\nSuch entities are like traditional corporations but with more freedom to spend on civically minded initiatives, according to Rick Alexander, a veteran corporate structuring lawyer and founder of the Shareholder Commons,\n\n\"It's a permission structure,\" Alexander said.\n\nOther public benefit corporations include Elon Musk's xAI, Warby Parker (WRBY), Allbirds (BIRD), Lemonade (LMND), and Etsy (ETSY).\n\nAnd based on the success of Musk's xAI, OpenAI could benefit handsomely from the change. In May, xAI raised $6 billion.\n\n\"This type of transition can generate considerable investor interest quickly,\" Kreps said. \"This is such a capital-intensive industry, so anything OpenAI can do to attract investment will act as a positive feedback loop and accelerate its advantages.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Can robotaxis turn a profit? Experts skeptical as Tesla prepares to unveil plans.",
        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has long touted autonomous vehicles as the future of the company.\n\nAt his shareholder meeting in June, Musk said the technology alone would boost the company’s value by at least tenfold.\n\nBut with Musk set to unveil details on Oct. 10 about an autonomous taxi fleet he has teased for years, skeptics caution that robotaxis may be years away from becoming a profitable venture.\n\n“It might be a little difficult to get crazy excited,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan said about the potential stock reaction for Tesla. “This is far into the future, so we just don't know how big it’s going to impact [the business].”\n\nTesla’s entry into the market would put the company in direct competition with Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo, which has been operating its self-driving taxi fleet in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Phoenix, with an expansion scheduled in Austin.\n\nWhile the timeline for any autonomous taxi from Tesla remains uncertain, analysts point to Waymo’s business model as proof of challenging economics.\n\nUnlike Uber (Uber) and Lyft (LYFT), which utilize vehicles owned and operated by individual drivers, autonomous taxi firms must own their entire fleet. That means overseeing the cost of maintenance, car insurance, charging infrastructure, and cleaning.\n\nIt all amounts to an operational cost of $0.42 per mile per vehicle, according to a report by Lux Research. Chris Robinson, senior director of the energy team and author of the report, said that amounts to two to three times the cost of car ownership.\n\n“You need to drive down the cost of offering those services to be competitive with car ownership,” Robinson said. “That's why I don't think we'll see car ownership fundamentally displaced more so than services like Uber and taxi drivers that would be displaced by robotaxis.” Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego arrives in a Waymo self-driving vehicle on Dec. 16, 2022, at the Sky Harbor International Airport Sky Train facility in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Matt York, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nOperational costs are compounded by the process of automating the vehicles. Waymo’s current fleet is made up of Jaguar I-PACE electric vehicles that are equipped for human drivers but retrofitted with high-tech sensors and computers to achieve full autonomy.\n\nWhile parent company Alphabet doesn’t specifically break out revenue data for its self-driving service, its business unit that includes Waymo posted an operating loss of roughly $2 billion in the first half of the year. Robinson estimates that equipment costs alone surpass $40,000 per vehicle today.\n\nAmazon’s (AMZN) Zoox is attempting to change that calculation with a vehicle built in-house specifically for autonomous use.

Co-founder and chief technical officer Jesse Levinson said Zoox would not have survived and made it to market without backing from Amazon, which acquired the company in 2020.\n\n“Making a car is an expensive endeavor in general, but this is a new type of vehicle,” he said. “[You need to] build the autonomy stack, integrate it with this custom robotaxi, you need to collect many, many millions of miles of data. You need to do tons of simulation, you need to develop all kinds of firmware and AI algorithms and the glue to connect it all together. Then you have to validate it out in the field and prove that it's actually safer than a human. Doing all that takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of capital.”\n\nConsulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimated the global autonomous taxi market could generate as much as $1.3 trillion in revenue by 2030. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk listens to a question at a conference in Washington, on March 9, 2020. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nTesla bulls argue that the company holds clear advantages as a proven carmaker armed with data from millions of drivers. But the company has yet to prove that its self-driving technology can operate on its own, and Musk has yet to provide details on how any autonomous fleet would work.\n\nRegardless of a delayed timeline, Narayan said he expects Tesla’s autonomous fleet to contribute to the company’s revenue in a meaningful way. In his latest note, he said robotaxis and full self-driving subscriptions would account for half of Tesla’s valuation.\n\n“I’m a big believer in the robotaxi concept,” he said.

        "content": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) which saw its share price drive 115% higher over five years.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Amazon.com achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 28% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 17% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Amazon.com's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe're pleased to report that Amazon.com shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 46% over one year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 17% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Growth Stocks to Buy Before 2025",
        "content": "Stock market volatility will come and go, but what makes a growth stock truly unstoppable is the strength of the underlying business. Whether a stock is up or down in the near term, if you patiently hold shares of a competitively strong business, you're going to earn great returns sooner or later.\n\nThree phenomenal growth stocks to buy right now are Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), and Home Depot(NYSE: HD). Here's what three Motley Fool contributors have to say about these all-star companies.\n\nAmazon's profitability is piling up\n\nJohn Ballard (Amazon): Amazon has been a truly wealth-building investment for long-term shareholders. Just over the last five years, the stock has doubled and continues to look strong in 2024.\n\nAmazon is involved in a lot of business opportunities, spanning e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing (e.g., Amazon Web Services, or AWS). E-commerce alone is a multitrillion-dollar market that continues to grow. Trailing-12-month revenue across all these businesses grew 12% year over year to reach $604 billion in the second quarter.\n\nThat is a healthy growth rate for such a large business, which speaks to the substantial opportunities ahead. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) in the shopping experience could allow Amazon to gain share of the online retail market, particularly in areas like apparel. The company is making significant investments in generative AI shopping assistants to make browsing and finding the right items more convenient and easier.\n\nAnother reason to consider Amazon an unstoppable growth stock worth owning is the improvement on the bottom line. Amazon is becoming a financial powerhouse, with operating profit nearly doubling year over year in Q2. Its trailing free cash flow has more than doubled over the last five years to $48 billion.\n\nWith management focusing on lowering costs, improving operating efficiency, and investing in growth opportunities like AI and cloud services, investors will do very well with Amazon stock in 2025 and for years to come.\n\nFast-growing in multiple businesses\n\nJennifer Saibil (MercadoLibre): MercadoLibre is the leading e-commerce retailer in Latin America, and it also has a competitive fintech business. It continues to report high growth and profits despite a volatile Latin American economy and inflation, and if the global economy begins to shape up, it will be well-positioned to benefit even more.\n\nE-commerce is still the company's main business, and it's growing at robust levels. Gross merchandise volume increased 20% year over year in Q2, or 83% on a currency-neutral basis. E-commerce remains underpenetrated in Latin America, which is still moving away from being a largely cash-based society, and that leaves MercadoLibre with a long growth runway in this business alone. It serves a population exceeding 500 million, and it continues to activate new customers who are buying more items and buying more frequently. Even if this was its only business, it would be a standout stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut there's so much more. The fintech business is growing even faster and presents massive opportunities. The fintech platform offers digital payments, credit cards, and more on an all-digital app. It has a large credit business with around 20 million users at a cost to serve of less than $1. It's an asset-light, cash-rich business that creates strong financials for the whole company.\n\nLike Amazon, MercadoLibre is leveraging its extensive e-commerce platform for media and advertising with strong results. It has the No. 3 spot in digital ads market share in its region, and ad revenue increased from $436 million to $705 million in 2023.\n\nTotal revenue increased 42% (113% currency neutral) year over year to $5.1 billion in Q4, and net income was up from $262 million last year to $531 million this year. Those are typical growth rates.\n\nMercadoLibre stock is outpacing the S&P 500 this year, up 32%, and it could climb much higher as it continues to demonstrate solid performance.\n\nCapitalize on the housing recovery\n\nJeremy Bowman (Home Depot): The housing market has been on life support since mortgage rates started rapidly rising in 2022. Home prices remain elevated, and the lock-in effect from low mortgage rates during the pandemic has dissuaded Americans from moving.\n\nHowever, the Federal Reserve recently lowered the fed funds rate (with more cuts likely) which should lead to lower interest rates, and the housing market is starting to show signs of life. Redfin reported that mortgage rate locks jumped 70% from a month ago after the Fed's 50 basis-point rate cut, and mortgage-purchase applications also rose 10%.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans have record levels of home equity that they're eager to tap into for home improvement projects.\n\nThose trends are all good news for Home Depot, the nation's leading home improvement retailer. Home Depot's performance has been sluggish while the housing market has been slow, but it should bounce back in the recovery especially as there's a shortage of millions of homes in the country.\n\nBoth presidential candidates have plans to address the housing shortage with proposals that will make it easier to build new homes and make homeownership more accessible, favoring home-improvement retailers like Home Depot.\n\nAdditionally, Home Depot is well positioned to capitalize on the rebound after its acquisition earlier this year of SRS Distribution, a leading building-supplies distributor that expanded its addressable market by $50 billion and strengthened its relationship with the pro customer.\n\nHome Depot stock might not look like a bargain right now, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27, but there's a lot of leverage in its business model. Once it returns to growth, profits could move significantly higher, making the stock a winner in 2025.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 30 AI News Investors Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) data centers are one of the hottest topics on Wall Street as companies across the industrial spectrum compete in a race to deploy AI technologies in their operations. The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers are the largest in the industry, typically developed by technology giants based in the US, and offer massive networking capacity and often consume as much power as a big city or even a small country.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAs technology stocks stage a comeback on the back of Fed rate cuts and AI optimism, the news coming from the commerce department in the US has buoyed investors further. The US government said earlier this week that it plans to award nearly $100 million to boost the use of artificial intelligence in developing new sustainable semiconductor materials. The funding is part of the more than $52 billion in US chip manufacturing and research grants promised by US President Joe Biden. The latest funding would go towards helping universities, national laboratories, and the private sector develop AI-powered autonomous experimentation for sustainable semiconductor manufacturing. The goal is to reduce time needed to develop new semiconductor materials that are less resource-intensive.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Investment advisory Bernstein recently referenced the company in an investor note detailing that AI infrastructure spending by tech giants is expected to reach a combined total of $160 billion in 2024. The note was released as the advisory sought to clarify that training AI models required higher budget allocations as opposed to inferencing. According to an analysis by Bernstein, inference only accounted for 5% of AI infrastructure spending. Bernstein referenced ChatGPT by OpenAI as an example, noting that GPT-2 was trained on a cluster of chips costing about $3 million, while GPT-3 required about $30 million worth of hardware to train. GPT-4 was then trained on 25,000 A100s, which cost about $300 million.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 in Right Now",
        "content": "Right now is a great time to invest in technology stocks -- for two reasons. First, we're at the beginning of the growth story for a promising new area, and that's artificial intelligence (AI). JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has even said that AI could be as transformational for the world as the steam engine and the internet. And analysts predict that in just the time frame of today through 2030, the AI market could grow from $200 billion to more than $1 trillion.\n\nSecond, some of these players are trading at reasonable valuations right now considering their long-term prospects. That offers investors an opportunity to get in on this exciting growth story at a fair price.\n\nSo, if you have $50,000 to invest and are looking to buy growth stocks, it's a great idea to pick up technology players that operate in the AI space, from designers of AI products to those who use them or sell AI services to others. I would spread this investment across several players and of course, make sure that this is in the context of a diversified portfolio; it's always best to invest across a few sectors in case one falls on hard times.\n\nTo increase the safety of this bet, I favor companies that don't rely uniquely on AI and prior to this boom, already built profitable businesses. Considering all of this, here are the best stocks to invest $50,000 in right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) may be the safest of all AI bets thanks to its diversification across high-growth industries. The company is a leader in e-commerce and in cloud computing through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. These two major areas have helped Amazon generate billions of dollars in revenue and profit in recent years. And today, Amazon's investment in AI is adding to the gains.\n\nThis market giant is benefiting from AI in two ways. First, Amazon uses the technology to increase its own efficiency in e-commerce -- for example, selecting the fastest delivery routes for packages. This should lower Amazon's costs and in turn, boost profit. Second, AWS is going all in on AI, offering a wide range of products and services to fulfill just about every need of a customer launching an AI project. AWS recently reached a $105 billion annual-revenue run rate thanks to this focus on AI.\n\nToday, Amazon shares trade for 39 times forward-earnings estimates. This isn't dirt cheap but remains very reasonable considering the company's solid market position.\n\nOracle\n\nOracle(NYSE: ORCL) is an up-and-coming AI powerhouse. Originally known for its database software, Oracle has shifted to prioritizing cloud infrastructure in recent times -- and it's been a worthwhile bet because the company has seen demand and revenue take off.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the most-recent quarter, for example, cloud-infrastructure revenue soared 45% to $2.2 billion, and total remaining-performance obligations (RPO) -- representing contract backlog -- surged 53% to $99 billion. All of this offers investors a reason to be optimistic about growth ahead.\n\nAnother positive point is Oracle has signed multicloud agreements with market giants AWS, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. These allow customers to use Oracle's database technology through any of these cloud providers. So Oracle has made itself easy to access and on top of this, gives customers additional types of flexibility, such as Oracle Alloy, which allows partners to customize their cloud experience.\n\nOracle shares trade for 26 times forward-earnings estimates right now, higher than in the past but a deal considering Oracle's AI growth.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nYou may use a Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) service daily if you message a friend on WhatsApp or Messenger, or post something to Instagram or Facebook. Meta owns these top social media apps and thanks to advertisers on these platforms, the company has generated billions of dollars in earnings.\n\nI expect this to continue since Meta has a solid moat, or competitive advantage. It's very difficult for users to switch to other platforms, knowing that many of their contacts may not follow. After all, about 3.2 billion people worldwide use at least one of Meta's apps daily.\n\nBut Meta isn't stopping there. The company has made AI its biggest investment area this year and already has launched its first virtual assistant. In fact, the company aims to create AI tools for professional and leisure purposes to suit the needs of every Meta user. And that may be just the beginning, as Meta is exploring a wide array of AI products and services with the aim of being a leader in the space.\n\nAll of this makes the stock look particularly cheap at only 26 times forward-earnings estimates.\n\nNvidia\n\nThis article wouldn't be complete without mentioning the star of the AI market right now, and that's Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Some investors have worried about investing in this chip designer since earnings and share performance have soared so much in recent years. Profit has climbed in the triple digits into the billions of dollars quarter after quarter, and the stock has advanced more than 400% over the past three years.\n\nSo, the worry is Nvidia's strongest wave of growth may have passed, and rivals may slip ahead. I wouldn't expect Nvidia to register such earnings or share performance non-stop. But I think the growth opportunity is far from over, and a new wave of growth may be just ahead. It's important to remember that Nvidia is the market leader, and its focus on innovation should keep it there.\n\nThe company now is planning for the launch of new architecture Blackwell, a platform that should supercharge growth and could lead to more share performance down the road.\n\nAnd that's why Nvidia's valuation at 42 times forward-earnings estimates looks fair, and it's worth picking up this winning stock at these levels.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "You don't have to take high risks to profit from the $184 billion artificial intelligence (AI) market. AI is bringing massive improvements to business productivity and more personalized services for consumers. Leading tech companies that you already know are among the ones that are best capitalizing on these trends. Here are two such stocks to buy today.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has more than doubled over the last five years and is currently up about 23% year to date in 2024. And the e-commerce leader still offers excellent return prospects over the next decade, particularly given its investments in AI.\n\nMost consumers will know Amazon first as a retail operation, but it's also the No. 1 enterprise cloud service provider, where Amazon Web Services (AWS) today controls more than 30% of a $297 billion market, according to Synergy Research. Revenue from AWS is accelerating -- it rose 19% year-over-year in Q2 -- as more enterprises are using AI services.\n\nFor example, Ferrari is using generative AI from AWS to help design cars faster and deliver personalized experiences to customers. Many other leading companies have chosen AWS for AI, especially to take advantage of Amazon Bedrock, which helps them build custom AI applications.\n\nAmazon has been using AI in its e-commerce business for years to deliver personalized recommendations to customers based on their interests. It's also using AI to drive content recommendations to viewers of Amazon Prime Video. However, Amazon is still in the early stages of implementing generative AI in the shopping experience. It recently launched Rufus, a conversational shopping assistant that can answer questions about products. Over the long term, it has the potential to significantly reduce shopping time and convert more sales.\n\nConsidering the attractive growth opportunities ahead for the tech titan, analysts expect Amazon's earnings to grow at a 22% annualized rate over the next several years. Assuming the stock is still trading at the same price-to-earnings multiple a decade from now, that would be enough growth for the stock to reach $1,350 by 2034. At a minimum, Amazon investors should expect the stock to outpace the average return of the stock market indexes.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is one of the most AI-focused companies in the world. It drives everything that is important to the company's growth, including its digital advertising business, search, content recommendations on YouTube, and Google Cloud. Its shares have nearly tripled over the last five years and are up about 17% so far this year.\n\nAlphabet has been heavily investing in AI since 2015, when it launched TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning system that made AI research more accessible for other organizations. But the company made a big splash with the launch of Gemini in December. More than 1.5 million developers are using Gemini, making it one of the most widely used AI models, and it's also powering Google's products.\n\nAdvertising generates about half of Alphabet's total revenue, and one of the biggest opportunities the company has with AI is to use the technology to drive more ad sales. Google is already seeing positive results from its rollout of its AI Overviews, a new feature that helps people get information about complex topics and is driving higher search frequency.\n\nAlphabet is also seeing growing demand for AI services in Google Cloud, where Gemini is helping developers build applications faster. Google Cloud offers a large selection of open-source and third-party AI models. Growing demand is boosting Google Cloud's profitability -- the segment's operating profit improved from $395 million in Q2 2023 to more than $1.1 billion in Q2 2024.\n\nAlphabet stock offers great value to investors right now. The shares are trading 15% off their recent high after the company in early August lost an antitrust case over anticompetitive behavior in the search market. It's uncertain what the consequences of litigation will be, but analysts still expect the company to grow its earnings at an annualized rate of 16% over the next several years. Assuming the stock keeps trading at the same price-to-earnings ratio it is now, with growth at that rate, shareholders could potentially double their investments by 2030.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Neuberger Berman Group LLC Acquires Shares in Arcosa Inc\n\nIntroduction to Arcosa Inc\n\nArcosa Inc, based in the USA, operates within the construction industry and was publicly listed on October 16, 2018. The company is engaged in manufacturing infrastructure-related products and services across three primary segments: Construction Products, Engineered Structures, and Transportation Products. With a market capitalization of $4.54 billion and a stock price of $93.15, Arcosa is currently evaluated as modestly overvalued with a GF Value of $71.64. The stock's PE Ratio stands at 30.95, indicating a premium valuation relative to earnings.\n\nStrategic Importance of the Trade\n\nThe recent acquisition by Neuberger Berman Group LLC aligns with its strategic investment goals, enhancing its exposure to the construction sector. The timing of the purchase, at a stock price close to its current market value, suggests a calculated move to capitalize on the future growth prospects of Arcosa, despite the stock being modestly overvalued according to GF Value metrics.\n\nFinancial Health and Market Performance of Arcosa Inc\n\nArcosa's financial health is robust, with a Financial Strength rank of 7/10 and a Profitability Rank of 7/10. The company has demonstrated a steady EBITDA growth of 13.20% over the past three years. However, its Growth Rank is relatively low at 4/10, indicating potential challenges in sustaining high growth rates. The stock has gained 13.56% year-to-date, significantly outperforming the market since its IPO with a price increase of 210.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nComparative Insight and Market Analysis\n\nOther significant shareholders in Arcosa include GAMCO Investors and First Eagle Investment (Trades, Portfolio). Neuberger Berman Group LLC's recent increase in stake places it among the top investors, potentially influencing other market participants. The construction industry, where Arcosa operates, is currently experiencing a phase of moderate growth, which could impact the company's business strategy and stock value moving forward.\n\nFuture Outlook and Implications\n\nThe strategic acquisition by Neuberger Berman Group LLC may signal a positive outlook on Arcosa's market position and future performance. Investors should monitor the construction sector's trends closely, as they will play a crucial role in shaping the potential returns from ACA's stock. The firm's increased stake could also prompt reevaluations by other investors, potentially leading to more dynamic movements in ACA's stock price.

        "title": "Amazon (AMZN) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nShares of cloud computing and online retail behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) jumped 3.1% in the morning session as equities soared (Nasdaq +0.9%, S&P 500 +0.55%) after The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported nonfarm payrolls for September 2024, which exceeded expectations. Notably, nonfarm payrolls increased by 254,000, significantly surpassing the consensus estimate of 150,000. In addition, the unemployment rate clocked in at 4.1%, slightly below analysts' expectations of 4.2%.\n\nOverall, the report supports the Fed's favored \"soft landing\" narrative, suggesting that inflation can be controlled without significantly harming the economy.\n\nKeeping up with that theme, Reuters reported that Amazon plans to hire 250,000 transportation and warehouse workers in the U.S. ahead of the holiday shopping season. While the numbers were in line with the pace reported in 2023, it nonetheless underscores the resilient demand environment despite some retailers enduring a challenging year as consumers have had their wallets strained due to inflation, which is now cooling off.\n\nLastly, JMP analyst Nicolas Jones argued that Amazon could achieve $20 billion in annual cost savings with autonomous vans. Expanding on the rationale behind the idea, he added, \"By eventually utilizing autonomous driving technology for middle mile, in combination with deploying electric vehicles for last-mile delivery, we see an opportunity for AMZN to reduce shipping costs by ~20% globally ($20B) over time; this reflects approximately $1.15 of savings per mile.\" Jones maintained a Market Outperform (Buy) rating and a price target of $265, representing a 40% premium to the stock's trading price when the research was released. After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $185.52, up 2% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy Amazon? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nAmazon’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 4 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nAmazon is up 23.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $185.52 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $200 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Amazon’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,134.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 20 Trending AI News And Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) startups have taken the finance world by storm in the past few months. This interest was sparked by the blockbuster launch of ChatGPT by California-based OpenAI in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has raised tens of billions of dollars in new funding and reached a valuation of over $150 billion. OpenAI revealed earlier this week that it had secured more than $6.6 billion in new funding through a financing round led by prominent names including Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures, and Tiger Global, among others.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPerhaps one reason the startup is so popular is that it is projecting more than $3.5 billion in revenue this year and over $11 billion in 2025. AI startups in general have been quicker at making revenues than previous technology booms, according to an analysis of payment information by fintech firm Stripe. The report underlines that top AI groups are reaching millions of dollars in sales within a year. This timeline is far faster in the life cycle of a startup than comparable non-AI tech groups. The report relies on annual revenue data for the 100 highest-grossing privately held AI companies using Stripe, compared with a comparable basket of prominent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) start-ups as of July 2018.\n\nThe report has gained a lot of traction since Stripe customers include OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, GitHub and Midjourney, among others. Stripe claims, per Financial Times, that AI start-ups took a median 11 months to hit $1 million in annual revenue after their first sales on Stripe, compared with 15 months for the previous generation of SaaS companies. AI start-ups that have scaled to more than $30 million in annual revenue achieved the milestone in 20 months — five times faster than past SaaS companies. Emily Sands, the head of information at Stripe, highlights that unlike past generations of software companies, AI companies paid compute costs straight out of the gate, and were under pressure to build monetisation faster.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Truist analyst Youssef Squali recently released a research note on the firm, reiterating a Buy rating on the stock and raising the price target to $265 from $230. In the note, the analyst underlined that North America revenue for the tech giant was tracking to consensus estimates, reflecting a resilient consumer, sustained growth in advertising revenue, faster growth at Web Services and higher operating margins year-over-year. Per the analyst, this came even as the company invested aggressively in artificial intelligence, AWS, logistics and Project Kuiper.\n\nThe note further highlighted that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) remained a favorite mega cap at Truist as the company continued to gain share of global e-commerce and improved its value proposition to both merchants and consumers. It was also one of the best ways to play cloud, AI, digital ads and global logistics, contended the advisory, which moved the price target to fiscal 2025 from 2024.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the trending AI stocks now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Is Emerging as an AI Winner",
        "content": "Oracle (ORCL) has been an under-the-radar high-flyer stock in 2024 and has just caught the attention of Wall Street. Shares are up 61% year-to-date, and the stock is still selling at a reasonable price. The company is emerging as an AI winner after it posted a beat and raise in the most recent quarter, driven by strong performance in its AI-related business.\n\nOracle is a well-run legacy business, known for its database software products that are popular among businesses worldwide. Companies use Oracle’s software products to organize and manage their data more efficiently. Think software for Enterprise Resource Planning, Customer Relationship Management, and Human Capital Management, among other types of software. Oracle does it all, and much more.\n\nI am bullish on Oracle because of strength in its AI-related business, its strong cash generation capabilities, and its current valuation even after the surge in its stock price.\n\nOracle’s Latest Quarterly Results Hint at Its AI Potential\n\nOracle’s recent beat and raise for FQ1 2025 is key to my bull case for the stock, as they clearly show how it’s gaining traction in the AI investment theme. The company earned $1.03 per share on revenue of $13.3 billion, up 6.86% year-over-year. While these are decent numbers, the most impressive aspect is the 21% year-over-year increase in its Cloud Services revenue, showing that hyperscalers are buying Oracle’s products.\n\nMoreover, Oracle logged a record-high Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) of $99 billion, up 53% year-over-year. This shows that business is booming for the software giant, and investors can look forward to this unearned revenue. As I mentioned, Oracle is gaining traction in the AI space, with the key highlight being its MultiCloud agreement with Amazon’s (AMZN) cloud business, AWS. This partnership joins others, like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), in leveraging Oracle’s database offerings in the cloud.\n\nTherefore, the growth in RPOs and Oracle securing a MultiCloud deal with another large cloud services provider was well-received by investors. The stock is breaking out on the news, and I see this uptrend lasting longer as the company continues to gain popularity among CSPs for cloud implementations of its database products. For Fiscal 2025, the company is aiming for double-digit revenue growth and accelerated growth in its cloud infrastructure business.\n\nOracle Is Good at Cash Generation\n\nAnother reason I’m bullish on Oracle is its cash generation capabilities. In FQ1 2025, the company’s operating cash flow was $7.42 billion, up from $6.97 billion a year ago. This is why I am not too worried about its balance sheet. As of August 31, 2024, Oracle has about $75.3 billion in long-term debt versus about $23 billion in current assets. While this shouldn’t go unnoticed by investors, it doesn’t bother me because of the cash generation and strength in RPOs.\n\nAdditionally, Oracle turns its profits into free cash flow. In the most recent quarter, its net income was $2.9 billion, and its free cash flow was $5.1 billion. Looking at the trailing twelve months (TTM), Oracle’s net income was $10.9 billion, while its TTM free cash flow was $11.2 billion. This gives it a TTM FCF-to-net income ratio greater than 1. Even as it continues to ramp up CapEx to meet demand for its products from hyperscalers, I see Oracle thriving, not struggling, as long as it continues to generate strong cash flow.\n\nOracle Stock Is Fairly Valued Despite the Run-Up\n\nAnother thing I like about Oracle is its current price, as I believe the stock is fairly valued. It’s not cheap, but it’s not expensive either. It’s trading at 26.5 times this year’s earnings estimates, and while that’s a slight premium to its sector, I see the company at the cusp of a multi-year growth cycle driven by AI. Analysts on Wall Street expect earnings to grow by 24% this year, and I would rather pay 26.5 times earnings for 24% growth than 23.6 times earnings for 15% growth (estimates for the S&P 500).\n\nIn addition, management expects the strength in RPOs to drive growth throughout Fiscal 2025. If this momentum continues (my bet), Oracle’s sales might grow well beyond this year. Who knows, we might even see an upward revision for growth estimates. While I can’t put an exact multiple or earnings growth rate estimate on Oracle for the long term, I believe the new AI opportunity looks promising enough to justify the current P/E multiple.\n\nMoreover, Oracle gave revenue guidance for Fiscal 2026 and Fiscal 2029 of $66 billion and $104 billion, respectively, driven by its improving cloud infrastructure business. At a market cap of $465 billion, Oracle is currently trading at 4.4 times management’s Fiscal 2029 revenue estimate. Again, I wouldn’t call it cheap, but I wouldn’t call it expensive either. What I will say is that this stock has the potential to go higher as its cloud infrastructure story plays out similarly to what management and investors are expecting.\n\nAnalysts’ Take on Oracle Stock\n\nOn the Street, Oracle stock sports a consensus Moderate Buy rating based on 17 Buy and 11 Hold recommendations. The average ORCL price target of $178.50 represents an upside of 6.4% from current levels.\n\nSee more ORCL analyst ratings\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nOracle is a well-run software business with improving fundamentals. The company’s cloud infrastructure business is going to propel it to new highs as more cloud services providers turn to it for cloud implementations of its database products. With its AI story just getting started, the stock’s current valuation does not suggest that it’s overpriced. Instead, it reflects a fair price for a company with improving fundamentals and a multi-year growth opportunity. I remain bullish on Oracle for the long term, but I would wait for a slight pullback before buying it.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Can Amazon save $20B per year by deploying autonomous EVs?",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could potentially save more than $20 billion annually by deploying autonomous electric vehicles (EVs) for middle- and last-mile delivery, according to a recent note from JMP Securities.\n\nThe investment firm believes that Amazon's use of autonomous driving technology, coupled with electric vehicles such as Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) delivery vans, presents a significant opportunity to reduce costs across its global shipping operations.\n\nJMP says fuel expenses typically account for around 25-30% of per-mile costs in both middle- and last-mile deliveries. They believe switching to electric vehicles could cut per-mile energy costs by nearly 50%.\n\nAdditionally, they note that driver wages and benefits represent over 40% of the cost per mile in middle-mile transport.\n\nBy replacing internal combustion engine trucks with autonomous electric vehicles for middle-mile transport, JMP says Amazon could reduce shipping expenses by approximately 20% globally. This would translate to around $1.15 in savings per mile, contributing to the projected $20 billion annual savings.\n\nIn the near term, \"as AMZN converts its last-mile fleet to electric Rivian fans, we see the potential for up to $7B of annual savings, globally,\" writes JMP.\n\nWhile the larger savings from autonomous technology may take longer to materialize, the firm emphasizes that the potential for substantial cost reductions is significant over time.\n\n\"To be clear, we view this as a medium- to long-term opportunity,\" adds JMP, maintaining a Market Outperform rating and $265 per share price target on Amazon.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCan Amazon save $20B per year by deploying autonomous EVs?\n\nExclusive-Thermo Fisher's plant making infant RSV drug breached FDA rules, documents show\n\nCVS Health upgraded at TD Cowen after insurer unveils 2025 Medicare Advantage plan\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Second regional NLRB office rules that Amazon, delivery service partners employ drivers jointly",
        "content": "A lower level NLRB decision sets up a second front where the status of Amazon and its DSPs will be fought out. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nThe relationship between Amazon and drivers for the company’s delivery service partners (DSPs) continues to generate outcomes with potentially major implications.\n\nThe most significant development in recent weeks is the decision by a regional office of the National Labor Relations Board that Amazon and one of its DSPs – the companies that actually bring those packages to your door – are joint employers of the DSP workers. It’s the second such decision just since August.\n\nThe finding is also directly opposite what Amazon has long claimed: that workers at DSPs are employees of the DSPs, not of Amazon, and that the DSPs are independent businesses not under the control of Amazon.\n\nThe director of NLRB Region 10, based in Atlanta, in September made a “merit determination” that workers at MJB LLC, a DSP operating out of an Amazon facility, are joint employees of Amazon and MJB. A group of MJB employees, working with the Teamsters, had sought to unionize at the company.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by the NLRB at the time of the finding, the director in the more recent finding also uncovered evidence of antiunion activities at the facility.\n\n“The Regional Director found merit to the allegations that the joint-employers unlawfully made coercive statements and gave the impression of surveillance,” the NLRB said. “She also determined that the joint-employers made threats of unspecified reprisal, threats of plant closure…if workers at the location formed a union.”\n\nThe NLRB statement makes an important point: that while the question of joint employer status will be crucial, it’s not the only issue between Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and the Teamsters in Atlanta. The question of what a company can do to resist unionization also will be key as the case makes its way through the legal process.\n\nIn a prepared statement, Amazon noted that not all of the Teamsters’ allegations were upheld by the regional director. “This complaint makes clear that the Teamsters have been misrepresenting the facts here for over 15 months, which is why the NLRB has not included most of their larger allegations,” Amazon spokeswoman Eileen Hards said in an email to FreightWaves. “As we’ve said all along, there is no merit to any of their claims. We look forward to showing that as the legal process continues and expect the few remaining allegations will be dismissed as well.”\n\nIn a revised definition of joint employers put into effect in late 2023, the NLRB said that “two or more entities may be considered joint employers of a group of employees if each entity has an employment relationship with the employees, and if the entities share or codetermine one or more of the employees’ essential terms and conditions of employment.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe action is the second recent finding of a joint employer relationship. In combination with one from California just a few weeks earlier, it has the broader potential to disrupt the current legal status of Amazon and its DSPs.\n\nIn August, a regional director of the NLRB in the Los Angeles region made a similar finding in a case involving a DSP called Battle Tested Strategies (BTS). The director concluded the Palmdale, California, company and Amazon were joint employers.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nIn a prepared statement, the NLRB noted that when a regional director makes a merit determination, it is “the first step in the NLRB’s General Counsel litigating the allegations after investigating an unfair labor practice charge.”\n\nThe parties in the dispute then have the option of settling. If not, a formal complaint will be issued and a hearing before an NLRB administrative law judge (ALJ) will be scheduled. The ALJ can “order make-whole remedies.”\n\nWhatever the decision is by the ALJ, it can be appealed to the entire NLRB board. If there is still an unhappy side in the dispute, it can be taken into the federal court system.\n\nBTS case gets its formal complaint\n\nThe formal complaint in the BTS case was filed this week by NLRB Region 31. Among its numerous charges, it lays out the heart of the dispute that could have broader ramifications: “At all material times, Respondent Amazon possessed and exercised control over the labor relations policy of Respondent BTS and administered a common labor policy with Respondent BTS for the employees of Respondent BTS at [Amazon’s] DAX8 facility.”\n\nThe workers in Palmdale at Battle Tested Strategies were described in a Teamsters statement as the first group of DSP workers who unionized.\n\nAnother group of DSP workers who voted in favor of being represented by the Teamsters was in Skokie, Illinois, at a company called Four Star Express Delivery. That ended in a strike and – like what happened at BTS – the termination of the company’s contract to serve as an Amazon DSP.\n\nMJB, at the center of the second NLRB preliminary finding of joint employer status, was the target of a Teamsters unionization drive. But there is no report in the NLRB database of unionization elections of a vote having occurred at MJB.\n\nThe drive for unionization of DSPs took another recent step forward in Queens, New York, where workers at three separate DSPs working out of Amazon’s DBK4 facility in September stated their desire to be represented by the Teamsters via a “card check” action.\n\nIn card check, workers sign cards stating their desire to become union members. It is controversial because while a worker voting “no” in a secret ballot can keep that desire hidden, an employee acting on that opposition by refusing to sign a card in a card check drive cannot. But it can be accepted by the NLRB as an approved way of a union organizing a group of workers.\n\nThe Teamsters, in announcing the action, described the number of workers at the facility as being in the hundreds. (This video reportedly is of a union rally at the Queens facility, though when it took place is not noted.)\n\nHigher minimum pay levels mandated\n\nAmazon recently increased the minimum pay for its DSP drivers to approximately $22 per hour with the help of increasing investments in its “rate cards.” That is up from $20.50.\n\nHards said the minimums at Amazon are part of an effort to maintain a basic level of pay and that individual DSPs can pay higher if they choose.\n\n“We do have a program agreement, but all our DSPs make decisions on how they schedule their employees, who they hire, what exactly they pay them and all those important employment decisions,” Hards said. “So just because we’re partners and we have high expectations for them does not mean we run their small independent businesses.”\n\nThe BTS case is notable because the claim by union bakers is that BTS, having recognized the union after its rank and file had voted to be represented by the Teamsters, had its DSP status yanked by Amazon soon after in retaliation. But the formal NLRB complaint, while noting the termination of BTS’ DSP status, does not say anything to support that claim.\n\nAmazon has yet to sign a collective bargaining agreement with any union. The most significant unionization win was at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse with a successful drive by a grassroots union tied to no national organization. It has since aligned with the Teamsters. But no contract with Amazon has been signed.\n\nAmazon also beat back a highly publicized effort to unionize warehouse workers at Bessemer, Alabama, in 2021. However, that unionization drive was conducted by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Workers Union, not the Teamsters.\n\nWhile there is no clear data, Amazon DSP drivers are believed to be overwhelmingly W-2 employees of their DSPs. Their wages are paid by the DSP as part of a salary or an hourly rate, and their income is reported to them at tax time through an IRS W-2 form from the IRS.\n\nAny drivers working as independent contractors would be considered 1099 workers and receive that IRS form for the purposes of income tax payments.\n\nSome other recent developments with the Teamsters have been mostly positive from the union’s perspective.\n\nIt added 160 workers to its ranks when drivers in Florida at Breakthru Beverages voted to align with Teamsters Local 79, according to the union.\n\nAnd that is just another addition to a Teamsters claim that is difficult to independently confirm: that it has added 50,000 workers as members in the past two and a half years.\n\nBesides traditional outlets for organizing, Teamsters President Sean O’Brien said in a statement that “organizers have also found runaway success bringing more workers into the labor movement at once non-traditional companies, including Amazon, the American Red Cross, Costco, and cannabis dispensaries nationwide.”\n\nThe International Brotherhood of Teamsters announced today the union has grown by an astounding 50,000 new members in the last two-and-a-half years, a direct result of key investments in strategic organizing under Teamsters General President Sean M.

        "title": "What's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy With the Fed Cutting Rates?",
        "content": "Interest rates are at long last coming down as the Federal Reserve announced a significant 0.5% rate cut in September. More reductions in the interest rate are likely on the way.\n\nLower rates are usually viewed as good news for smaller businesses. However, they benefit huge corporations, too, including the market-leading group known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. What's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy with the Fed cutting rates?\n\nHow rate cuts could benefit the Magnificent Seven\n\nLet's first look at how lower interest rates could help the members of the Magnificent Seven. Three ways are the most important, in my view.\n\nFirst (and most obvious), lower interest rates reduce Magnificent Seven companies' borrowing costs. This makes it cheaper to refinance maturing debt. They also enable companies to fund new projects that could lead to future growth.\n\nSecond, lower rates can boost customer spending. This can happen whether the customers are individual consumers or organizations.\n\nThird, lower interest rates can lead to a weakening of the U.S. dollar. This benefits Magnificent Seven companies that export to other countries by making their products more competitive in international markets.\n\nEvaluating the Magnificent Seven\n\nRate cuts should help all of the Magnificent Seven stocks. However, some will benefit more than others.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has the most debt on its books in the group -- $157.8 billion. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) trail behind with debt of $101.3 billion and $97.8 billion, respectively. Lower rates could help these companies the most when it comes to reducing interest expenses when their debt matures (assuming rates are still lower at that point).\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) are in the middle of the pack, with debt totaling nearly $38 billion and $28.7 billion, respectively. Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) debt load is only $12.5 billion, while Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) debt of $10 billion is the lowest of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nI suspect that increases in customer spending fueled by lower interest rates would likely be most pronounced for the companies with the most expensive products. Tesla's electric vehicles can cost in the ballpark of $40,000 at the lowest, with the pricey models costing over $113,000.\n\nCompanies spend significant amounts to buy Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), too. Lower rates could especially help start-ups and smaller businesses afford to expand their artificial intelligence (AI) development efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft operate cloud service platforms that could benefit from increased customer spending, driven by lower rates. All three companies market consumer products that could see sales increase, as well. It's the same story for Apple and, to a lesser extent, Meta.\n\nApple and Tesla would arguably be helped the most by a weaker U.S. dollar. Sales outside the U.S. are greater for both companies than their U.S. sales. However, all of the other Magnificent Seven also have significant international sales.\n\nThe best Magnificent Seven stock to buy with falling rates\n\nI think that Amazon and Tesla will probably be helped the most by the Fed's rate cuts. Which is the better stock to buy? I'd go with Amazon.\n\nTesla is much more expensive than Amazon based on forward earnings multiples and facing increasing competition. Even worse, consumer interest in electric vehicles seems to be waning.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon's AWS cloud platform has a massive AI tailwind at its back. Advertising on Prime Video has become an important new growth driver for the company. Amazon's technology investments should continue to pay off in increased profitability for its e-commerce business. Project Kuiper, a new satellite internet service, is poised to be another new source of growth.\n\nAll of these would be positives for Amazon without lower interest rates.

CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized that maintaining productivity while working remotely is key to continuing the current flexible work arrangement, reported Business Insider.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement.

Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\nAmazon’s recent decision to require employees to return to the office five days a week has sparked concern among its workforce and competitors. Google employees, who currently work in the office three days a week, sought reassurance about their hybrid work model during a “TGIF” all-hands meeting.\n\nJohn Casey, Google’s vice president of global compensation and benefits, informed staff that the existing system remains effective, according to the report. However, he stressed the importance of being in the office at least three days weekly. Pichai reiterated the need for productivity during remote work to maintain policy flexibility.\n\nDespite these reassurances, some Google employees remain apprehensive about potential future changes. Google has implemented measures like hot-desking and “neighborhoods” in some offices to adapt to the hybrid model. Meanwhile, other companies, like Dell Technologies Inc., have followed Amazon’s lead, requiring more in-office presence.\n\nA Google spokesperson confirmed the statements made by Pichai and Casey, according to the report.\n\nTrending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nWhy It Matters: Amazon’s decision to enforce a full-time return to the office has led to significant unrest among its employees. A survey revealed that 73% of Amazon workers are considering leaving their jobs due to the new policy, with 80% aware of colleagues contemplating the same move. This shift has affected morale, especially among parents.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the return-to-office mandates have impacted housing markets, with cities like San Jose experiencing a surge in housing prices. This trend is attributed to the increased demand for housing near office locations.\n\nAdditionally, some companies have used RTO mandates as a strategy to encourage voluntary turnover, as revealed in a survey by Bamboo HR. This tactic has been part of the broader “Great Resignation” phenomenon, where employees have opted to leave rather than return to traditional office settings.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon told Yahoo Finance it has \"been taking action to try and reduce risk.\" But the chain, which gets roughly 60% of its US sales from groceries, can only do so much.\n\n\"You obviously can't pull forward your banana flow...

America's largest retailer is \"going to be badly affected from food to nonfood\" due to its worldwide sourcing, he added.\n\nCostco (COST) and Target (TGT) have a \"very high percent\" of goods being imported through the ports, per Flickinger, alongside specialty retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Best Buy (BBY), and Nike.\n\nCostco CEO Ron Vachris told investors that it has prepared for this moment.\n\n\"It could be disruptive based on how impactful, I can't tell you until we know length and what could happen out there. But it is in our sights. Our buyers are all over it,\" Vachris said.\n\nIf certain goods run into shortages because of the disruption, the scarcity could push up its prices. Yet, retailers may have limited room to pass on the cost to shoppers, as fatigued consumers push back on price hikes.\n\nGrocers like Kroger (KR), Albertson's (ACI), Publix, or IGA that have made a \"great effort\" to buy American will benefit, Flickinger said.\n\nWith the strike now on day three, shipping companies like Maersk (MAERSK-B.CO) have implemented fees. Per a report from TD Cowen analyst Jason Seidl, Maersk placed surcharge fees of up to $3,780 per 45 foot container.\n\nAnd there's no way to avoid the hit. Lowe's (LOW) told Telsey Advisory Group that it has \"temporarily shifted more imports through the West Coast.\" But rerouting usually costs 25% to 30% more, per Flickinger. If retailers opt for air freight, that typically costs \"triple\" of ocean freight, said Feldman.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I expect the strike to last probably about 10 days... [But] if it lasts through Halloween, it's going to be crushing for Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, all the way to New Year's Day,\" Flickinger said.\n\nAccording to Wedbush analysts Seth Basham and Matthew McCartney, a one-day strike creates 5 days worth of backlog cargo. That means a one-week strike could cause delays until mid-November.\n\nBesides big box retailers, some retail brands are more exposed than others.\n\nNike (NKE) has \"all kinds of problems\" as they ship from overseas, Flickinger said, while competitors with local manufacturing like Asics (ASCCY), Under Armour (UA), New Balance, and Brooks could benefit.\n\n\"They're going to have a real economic renaissance because of this dock strike, while Nike, Walmart and others are gonna get crushed,\" he said.\n\nNike CFO Matt Friend said on its earnings call this week that it's \"watching the East Coast port strike really closely,\" but has not \"baked anything in\" when it comes to impact on margins.\n\nThe sports giant estimates gross margins for its next quarter to be down approximately 150 basis points due to \"higher promotions, channel mix headwinds, and supply chain deleverage.\" NEW YORK, NEW YORK - OCTOBER 02: Striking workers at the Red Hook Container Terminal in Brooklyn gather after members of the International Longshoremen’s Association, or ILA, began walking off the job yesterday after 12:01 a.m. ET on October 02, 2024 in Brooklyn, New York. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Spencer Platt via Getty Images)\n\nBrown-Forman(BF-B), maker of Jack Daniel's and other liquors, could see its international whiskey sales take a hit, per a client note from Bank of America. Nearly half of Brown-Forman's shipments are whisky produced in Louisville, Kentucky, yet 55% of total company sales are outside the U.S.\n\nCampbell's (CPB) recent acquisition, sauce brand Rao's, will also feel the impact.\n\n\"Rao's produces finished goods in San Marzano, Italy, and imports through New York and New Jersey and also uses the port of Jacksonville/Savannah to import raw materials for its Georgia production facility,\" Bank of America's Bryan Spillane wrote.\n\nA prolonged strike could be a headwind for Keurig (KDP), Tyson (TSN), and Pilgrim's Pride (PPC). Keurig has a second manufacturing plant in Ireland for beverage concentrate, while Tyson and Pilgrim export their chicken from the US southeast.\n\n—\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "When it comes to growth potential over time, few stocks have matched Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The e-commerce pioneer has evolved from an online bookseller to a conglomerate that leads the way in several niches of retail and technology.\n\nIn hindsight, if one had the patience to wait and the fortitude to ride out massive declines, a $1,000 investment in the company's initial public offering (IPO) would have paid off handsomely for shareholders.\n\nAmazon's growth\n\nA $1,000 investment at the closing price on the day of the IPO and not sold would be worth roughly $1.87 million today. The stock made its debut on May 15, 1997, at a pre-split closing price of $23.50 per share ($0.098 per share split-adjusted). Assuming one could buy fractional shares, the 42.55 shares bought on that day would have grown to 10,212 shares worth $182.69 each as of the time of this writing.\n\nThose who owned the stock for the entire 27-year history haven't been on a predictable or easy path.\n\nInvestors may have anticipated Amazon would venture beyond the sale of just books, it was next to impossible to predict the huge variety of products it would sell or that it would spearhead the cloud computing industry through Amazon Web Services (AWS). This is critical because AWS generates the majority of its operating income.\n\nInvestors also endured a brutal sell-off during the dot-com bust. Between 1999 and 2001, Amazon's stock fell as much as 95% and didn't return to its 1999 high until 2009.\n\nFor a time, that drop made it look more like many of the failed online retailers at the time. Hence, investors would have had to have a strong belief in the vision of founder Jeff Bezos to hold their shares through that period.\n\nUltimately, the history of Amazon stock outlines both the rewards and the difficulties of IPO investing. While the potential returns can be massive, it typically takes vision, analysis skills, discipline, and a high pain tolerance to identify such investments early and allow them to grow to their full potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Analysts led by Brian Nowak, who rates the e-commerce firm’s stock at Overweight with a price target of $210, highlight Amazon focus on lower-priced, lower-margin essentials that are weighing on margins overall and holding back profit growth in its North America retail segment.

        "title": "Amazon is hiring a quarter-million workers this holiday season",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) said Thursday that it plans to hire 250,000 seasonal workers as it prepares to tackle a busy holiday shopping season.\n\nThe e-commerce giant plans to hire employees to fill transportation and warehouse roles; the number will match the company’s seasonal hiring numbers from last year. All seasonal employees will receive a minimum wage of $18 per hour and will have access to benefits, including healthcare, from their first day on the job.\n\nSandy Gordon, Amazon’s vice president of employee experience and relations, said in a statement that despite the company’s expected rise in demand and volume, “We feel like the 250,000 is the right number to continue to grow and advance with our operations.”\n\nThe exact breakdown of the seasonal workers — spanning sort centers, fulfillment centers, and delivery stations — remains vague, particularly regarding how many of those roles will be in fulfillment or transportation. A company spokesperson said transportation employees exclude delivery service partners and their teams.\n\nThe company’s hiring efforts come as retailers face a loose labor market. Overall, seasonal hiring will only add 520,000 new jobs during the final quarter of this year, down from last year’s 564,200, according to analysis by employment agency Challenger, Gray, & Christmas, Inc., which cites Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data.\n\nOther retailers are also ramping up their seasonal hiring. For instance, Target plans to hire 100,000 seasonal employees to support in-store operations and supply chain logistics. Discount grocer Aldi aims to bring on 13,000 workers for in-store and warehouse operations, while Bath & Body Works (BBWI) plans to hire 30,000 seasonal employees, including part-time sales associates and full-time roles such as merchandise handlers and processors.\n\nAmazon’s recruitment strategy is partly driven by expectations that e-commerce spending will surpass overall holiday sales in the fourth quarter. Earlier this year, the company’s Prime Day event generated over $14.2 billion in online sales, marking one of the biggest e-commerce events of the year.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Ken Fisher’s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Ken Fisher regularly shares his investing wisdom on his YouTube channel, sharing market insights and lessons he’s learned over the decades. Commenting about the Fed’s rate cut, Fisher recently advised investors not to focus on what the central bank is doing and instead pay attention to long-term investing.\n\n“The fact is, and I’ve said this for a long time, I won’t live forever, but I hope to live a long time and keep saying it: central bankers are crazy. Throughout my life, central banks have operated on flawed ideas and groupthink, which is an inefficient way to manage markets.”\n\nFisher gave an example of how you could end up losing money following the herd mentality when it comes to central bank moves.\n\n“If you had followed the common belief that when the Fed and other central banks hike rates, you should get out of stocks, that would have worked for a couple of months in 2022. By the middle of the summer of 2022, during the height of rate hikes, you would have been on the wrong side of the market. From June 2022 onward, as the Fed hiked rates by 75 basis points nearly every month, the market was just a few months away from rising, leading to the bull market we’re in now, in 2024.\n\nThe basic belief that central bank hikes are bad for stocks was wrong from the start because it was already priced in. As soon as central bank hikes were visible, the market had already accounted for them. We saw a bull market begin in October 2022, which has continued despite repeated rate hikes.”\n\nFor this article, we scanned Ken Fisher’s hedge fund’s Q2 holdings and picked its top AI investments. We have analyzed the AI-related growth catalysts for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Gains Momentum with AWS and Advertising Growth\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nBillionaire Ken Fisher’s Stake: $8,460,561,806\n\nCantor Fitzgerlad recently initiated coverage of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) with an Overweight rating and said in a broader industry note that despite strong performance, many tech stocks remain attractively valued.\n\n“Despite strong performance over the last 18 months, valuations in internet names are fairly reasonable and should benefit from the expectation for upcoming rate cuts, tempered by decelerating top-line growth and as benefits from widespread cost-cutting fade,” Cantor said.\n\nAWS’s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\n\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\n\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Ken Fisher’s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "2 Magnificent Warren Buffett Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Investors love to get inspiration from Warren Buffett. He has shepherded his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, to incredible, market-beating returns over time, providing sage advice for followers along the way.\n\nBuffett has famously said that his favorite holding period is forever, and the ideal stock could sit in your account and multiply over many decades. Two Motley Fool contributors picked Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Nu Holdings(NYSE: NU) as top Warren Buffett stocks that you could hold forever.\n\nE-commerce plus more\n\nJennifer Saibil: If you missed the chance to buy Amazon until now, don't worry. It still has incredible growth opportunities, and it's not too late to buy Amazon stock and hold it forever.\n\nAmazon spent several years scooping up other e-commerce companies when it was just starting out. It made some moves that may have appeared bold at the time, but the result is a consolidated e-commerce giant that's unchallengeable. Amazon accounts for more than a third of all e-commerce sales in the U.S., and while it seems to be finished buying out the competition, it's acquiring all sorts of other companies that expand its revenue streams and make it even more dominant in more fields.\n\nIt's nowhere near done with e-commerce, if only because e-commerce is still getting started. The pandemic brought it more into the mainstream, but it still represents only about 16% of retail sales, according to the Department of Commerce. And that's expected to grow. The Boston Consulting Group sees e-commerce accounting for 41% of retail sales by 2027, and there's no one who will benefit more from that kind of shift than Amazon.\n\nShoppers want the best of both worlds: physical stores and online shopping. Amazon hasn't been as successful with its physical stores, but it's not giving up. Along with those efforts, it's making e-commerce more appealing for customers instead of physical store shopping by accelerating delivery times and offering more products with one-day shipping. It's also bringing more brand names into its stores to become the department store of the internet, where you can get pretty much everything you need. (Except houses. Maybe one day; who knows?)\n\nThat doesn't even touch on Amazon's opportunity in cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI). It's important to mention this first, though, because when you think about a stock you can hold forever, it must have something more than current trends. AI and generative AI could very well turn into something stable and become mainstream, like e-commerce has, but for now, it represents high-growth trends.\n\nWhatever other new trends happen, Amazon is likely to grab part of the market and make itself a leader. It's done that with several other businesses besides e-commerce and cloud services, like streaming and advertising. That's why it should be a stock that can reward patient investors forever.\n\nThis fast-growing business has what it takes to deliver more wins\n\nKeith Noonan: Nu Holdings is a Brazil-based banking and financial technologies company that provides services in Mexico and Colombia in addition to its home country. The fintech specialist went public in December 2021, and Berkshire Hathaway invested in the company around the time of its initial public offering. Berkshire hasn't sold a share of the company's stock since initiating its initial position, and Nu stock currently accounts for roughly 0.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's total stock portfolio.\n\nTrading at roughly 32 times this year's expected earnings, Nu has one of the most growth-dependent valuations of any stock owned by Berkshire. On the other hand, the business is serving up results that suggest the stock could still be quite cheap.\n\nNu closed out the second quarter with 104.5 million customers, representing a growth of 5.2 million customers compared to the previous quarter and a growth of 20.8 million compared to its customer count at the end of Q2 last year. Total banking deposits increased 64% year over year on a currency-adjusted basis to hit $25.2 billion, and its credit card and lending portfolios continued to post strong expansion and overall results. Average monthly revenue per active customer rose 30% year over year in the quarter and 6% on a sequential quarterly basis.\n\nThanks to strong customer growth and increased engagement, the company's revenue jumped 65% year over year to $2.8 billion in the quarter. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (adjusted) net income soared roughly 117% year over year to hit $487.3 million.\n\nNu is already the financial institution with the largest number of active customers and credit operations in Brazil, and it has opportunities to deliver continued growth in its home territories and score dramatic expansion in other Latin American countries.

        "title": "Amazon, Target and other retailers are ramping up hiring for the holiday shopping season",
        "content": "Retailers are ramping up hiring for the holiday season, but fewer seasonal employees are expected to be taken on this year to help customers in stores and assemble online orders in warehouses.\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon said Thursday it will hire 250,000 full, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, rounding out a series of announcements made in recent weeks by the country’s top retailers.\n\nAmazon is hiring the same number of employees it did last year, similar to Bath & Body Works and Target, which said in September it will bring in roughly 100,000 seasonal employees and offer current employees the option to work extra hours during the holiday shopping period.\n\nMeanwhile, the department store Kohl’s encouraged people to apply for positions but stayed mum on its plans, mirroring Walmart, which said it’s been hiring store associates throughout the year and will tap into its own staff when needed during the busy season.\n\nOthers have indicated they will scale back their hiring. Macy’s said it will add more than 31,500 seasonal positions this year across its Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury stores, as well as its distribution centers. Last year, the company added 38,000.\n\nThe holiday shopping period is the busiest time of year for online and brick-and-mortar retailers, some of which have already announced discount events to entice consumers planning to shop early for gifts.\n\nThe consulting firm Deloitte forecasts U.S. retail sales will increase between 2.3% to 3.3% during the November to January timeframe and reach a total of $1.59 trillion. EY-Parthenon, the consulting arm of Ernst & Young, forecasts a similar 3% jump in sales during the traditional November-December period. However, it says price increases due to inflation are likely to account for a big chunk of that growth, noting real volume sales will only rise 0.5% year-over-year.\n\nOnline sales, a growing segment of retail, is expected to increase 8.4% and reach a record $240.8 billion, according to Adobe, which tracks e-commerce transactions.\n\n“At the moment, retailers appear optimistic for a strong holiday shopping season, which is being reflected in the hiring plans of major retailers and warehouses,” said Andy Challenger, senior vice president at the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\n\nOverall, U.S. retailers are expected to add 520,000 new jobs in the final quarter of this year compared to 564,200 in 2023, according to a report released last month by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The firm, which analyzes non-seasonally adjusted data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, says that’s more than the 509,300 seasonal jobs retailers added in 2022. But it represents the second-lowest total since 2009.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenerally, the labor market has gradually lost momentum since the Federal Reserve hiked its benchmark interest rate numerous times in 2022 and 2023 to combat high inflation. Last month, the Fed cut its key rate for the first time in more than four years. It reflected its new focus on bolstering the job market, which saw positive signs this week when data from the Labor Department showed job openings rose unexpectedly in August.\n\nBut the retail industry may encounter challenges filing openings in the coming weeks and months “due to the demands of the job and pay,” Challenger said.\n\nTo scoop up employees, companies like Macy’s and JCPenney as well as sporting goods stores Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s are recruiting workers through nationwide hiring events. Macy’s had said it would offer on-the-spot interviews during its first event, which took place last week in its stores and warehouses. The company plans to hold three more events this year.\n\n“We are finding strong application flow,” said Macy’s, adding nearly a third of its recent hires are employees who've previously worked at the company.\n\nAmid the growth in online shopping, the delivery giant UPS is planning to hire 125,000 seasonal workers for the holiday rush, up from 100,000 last year.\n\nRadial, an e-commerce company that powers deliveries for brands like Calvin Klein and Express, says it will hire fewer people but also plans to scale its staff based on real-time demand. That approach allows the company to meet customers' needs “without overcommitting,\" said Billy Peterson, a senior vice president at Radial.\n\nOn the buyer side, consumers have been resilient with their spending while also showing signs of stress, with credit-card debt rising and savings rates falling, trends that could weigh on spending in future months.\n\nRetail sales ticked up from July to August, after jumping the most in a year and a half the previous month. At the same time, consumers have been more prudent about their purchases and pushing back against high prices by trading down to store brands or seeking out deals for products.\n\nHowever, holiday shoppers could see even higher prices on products if a port workers’ strike that has shut down all the major dockyards on the Eastern seaboard of the U.S. and the Gulf coast persists for more than a month.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) remains under pressure as several key investor debates continue to swirl around the company's long-term outlook.\n\nAccording to Bank of America analysts, who maintain an Underperform rating with a $21 price target on the stock, Intel faces \"a unique confluence of competitive, financial, and strategic threats\" with no immediate positive catalyst on the horizon.\n\nOne of the biggest questions concerns Intel's manufacturing capability, according to the bank in a note.\n\nThey explain that the company's reliance on external foundries, such as TSMC, has grown as its ambitious \"5 nodes in 4 years\" roadmap struggles.\n\nIntel's success in developing its 18A process is seen as critical to its turnaround, but \"so far, there has been no external proof points of success,\" according to BofA.\n\nThe company's recent deal with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which some saw as a win, was described by BofA as \"a framework with no guarantees of any revenue.\"\n\nAnother debate centers on Intel's talent retention, especially in light of frequent restructuring.\n\nBofA highlights that Intel's revenue per employee, at $454,000 per year, significantly lags behind competitors like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), and TSMC.\n\nThey believe it suggests that the company may face challenges in retaining and attracting top talent, which could further hinder its recovery efforts.\n\nFree cash flow (FCF) generation is also a pressing concern. Intel's high operating and capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated, with BofA warning that the company \"would not work without a credible gross margin path to 50%+.\"\n\nIntel's current debt load of $53 billion adds further pressure on its ability to generate meaningful FCF, said BofA.\n\nLastly, the bank says Intel's position in the x86 CPU market is being challenged by the rising adoption of ARM processors in PCs and servers.\n\nBofA notes that ARM's market share in PCs could triple by 2028, further eroding Intel's dominance.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nIntel stock: These are the key investor debates\n\nAmazon plans to hire 250,000 workers for the holidays, same as last year\n\nUpcoming AI features to fuel stronger iPhone 16 demand: BofA\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Arriana McLymore\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon plans to hire 250,000 transportation and warehouse workers this holiday shopping season, the same number as last year as e-commerce spending is expected to outpace overall holiday sales in the final quarter of 2024, the company said on Thursday.\n\n\"Although there is an anticipated increase in the demand and the volume, we feel like the 250,000 is the right number to continue to grow and advance with our operations,\" said Sandy Gordon, vice president of Global Operations Employee Experience at Amazon.\n\nIt was unclear what percentage of the 250,000 seasonal workers, which include staff in sort centers, fulfillment centers and delivery stations, would be in fulfillment centers or transport employees. The transport employees will not include delivery service partners or their teams, according to a company spokesperson.\n\nOnline holiday shoppers are expected to spend a record $240.8 billion, up 4.9% from last year. Broader holiday spending is expected to rise modestly at 3.2%, according to a Mastercard forecast.\n\nWhile Amazon's hiring plans remain flat compared to last year, the company is still outpacing big box competitor Target, which will tack on 100,000 workers for the season.\n\nU.S. retailers are grappling with a softer labor market and are expected to add 520,000 new jobs during the holiday shopping season, slowing down from last year's 564,200 job openings.\n\nAmazon's announcement comes a day after the National Labor Relations Board claimed that the retail giant was a \"joint employer\" of drivers for contractor Battle Tested Strategies (BTS). The contractor's drivers voted to join the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union last year.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said the Teamsters have \"misrepresented the facts\" as the union accuses Amazon of retaliating against BTS for drivers unionizing.\n\n(Reporting by Arriana McLymore in New York City; Editing by David Gregorio)",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note Thursday that Wall Street's profit expectations for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), particularly for the fourth quarter of 2024, may be overly optimistic.\n\nThe bank highlighted that despite long-term bullish prospects, near-term headwinds could impact Amazon's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) guidance.\n\nThe analysts see \"tactical risk to 4Q EBIT\" as the company continues to invest heavily in its lower-margin essentials business.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, Amazon's push to expand its essential goods offering, a key growth area, could hurt short-term profits.\n\n\"We see AMZN's high and growing focus on lower-priced, lower-margin essentials driving merchandise margin pressure,\" the bank states.\n\nThe pressure, combined with a competitive holiday season and cautious consumer spending, is seen as potentially weighing on Amazon's North America retail profit growth.\n\nThe bank expects fourth-quarter EBIT to come in around $1 billion to $1.5 billion below current Wall Street estimates of $17.5 billion.\n\nWhile this outlook may suggest a near-term pullback, Morgan Stanley remains optimistic about Amazon's long-term growth, particularly as the company looks ahead to 2025.\n\nThe analysts point to several profit drivers, including improved cost efficiencies and a potential $2 to $4 billion in corporate savings. They also note that Amazon's Kuiper satellite project, which some fear could be a financial drain, is \"likely manageable\" with an annual cost of $600-$700 million.\n\nMorgan Stanley maintained its $210 price target for Amazon, expecting a rebound in profitability beyond 2024. \"We view these profit challenges as temporary and not structural,\" the bank says, adding that it remains \"buyers on weakness\" as they look toward multiple profit drivers into 2025.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWall Street profit expectations for Amazon 'still seem high' warns Morgan Stanley\n\nUber, Lyft drivers use Teslas as makeshift robotaxis, raising safety concerns\n\nTesla to recall over 27,000 Cybertruck vehicles over rear-view image delay\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Gig Economy Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other best gig economy stocks.\n\nThe Rise of the Gig Economy\n\nThe pandemic era has been heralded as one of the most profitable periods for gig economy stocks, as more and more people started picking up remote work opportunities through online platforms looking to connect service providers with clients. But even before then, the gig economy has been a vital part of the market since, at any point in time, there will be a massive cohort of people who simply want to be their own boss – the pandemic just made it easier for these types of people to shine brighter.\n\nPost-pandemic, as people began to realize that it was, in fact, possible to work from home, gig economy companies were able to hold on to their profits. Even after the return to offices, many individuals have decided to stick with remote work opportunities provided to them by well known online platforms. According to Michael Morton, Senior Analyst at MoffettNathanson, a major part of the reason why gig economy stocks have been performing well in the market this year is that investor perceptions about these businesses are changing. Previously, investors were less inclined to go for gig economy companies because they used to focus too much on growth and not enough on profitability. However, Morton believes that companies are changing this approach to make it the opposite now – the focus on profitability is now overruling that on growth.\n\nSecular Tailwinds and Risks for Gig Economy Businesses\n\nMorton believes that well-known gig economy businesses in the ride-hailing and food delivery spaces are promising enterprises that are set to benefit from secular tailwinds. The biggest tailwind for such businesses is their expansion into large, untapped, addressable markets. While there will be a degree of risk attached to these new endeavors as the big gig economy players start to pursue these opportunities aggressively with high levels of investment, there is room to argue that these investments will be for the overall benefit of the businesses that do tap into markets that have gone ignored so far – think Southeast Asia, India, Latin America, and Africa.\n\nAnother risk that some people see for gig economy businesses is in the regulatory domain. Morton believes that the services these companies are providing to consumers are important enough to necessitate a cooperative attitude from regulatory bodies across the globe, seeing as they not only offer what are now considered essential services but also provide a means of generating supplemental income for their workers. At the same time, most of your bigger gig economy players with operations in up to 70 countries have also shown the capability of working with a variety of regulatory landscapes.\n\nThese factors have been working wonders in terms of alleviating investor concerns surrounding gig economy stocks, a development that is leading to more investors being convinced to buy into these businesses. As a result, the popularity of these stocks is only going up, which is why we’ve compiled a list of some of the best gig economy stocks to buy now.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through ETFs and online rankings to compile an initial list of 20 gig economy stocks. We then selected the 10 gig economy stocks with the highest number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

        "title": "Prediction: These 5 Phenomenal Stocks Are Set to Soar",
        "content": "We all want to invest in stocks that will soar, right? Of course. It's hard to know which stocks will be tomorrow's big winners, though. Given that challenge, it makes perfect sense to just invest in a low-fee, broad-market index fund, such as one that tracks the S&P 500 index of 500 of America's biggest companies.\n\nIf you want to deploy some of your long-term dollars into some super-promising individual stocks, though, here are five growth stocks to consider -- two of which are among the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nIt's not hard to imagine how Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) might soar in the years and decades to come, in part because it's involved in so many different businesses, from A to Z -- like Amazon Web Services and Zappos the shoe retailer. Amazon Web Services (AWS), a leading cloud computing platform, is often underappreciated. As of last year, it held a commanding market share and was growing customers by 31% year over year.\n\nAs big as Amazon is, it's still growing at a good clip, with revenue recently up 10% year over year in its last quarter and operating cash flow up 75%. Amazon has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), too, which is likely to provide major tailwinds for further growth. With its recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32 well below its five-year average of 54, the stock seems appealingly valued.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) arguably has an even more impressive array of businesses under its roof, including the prevalent Office productivity software, the Azure cloud computing platform, the Xbox gaming platform, and the Windows operating system, among others. The company is also poised to ride the AI growth wave, having invested billions in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and incorporating AI into many of its offerings.\n\nWith its recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33 not far from its five-year average of 30, Microsoft stock seems reasonably valued.\n\n3. PayPal\n\nPayPal(NASDAQ: PYPL) is a major player in the fintech arena -- another realm, along with AI and cloud computing, with high expectations for growth. It recently boasted 426 million active customer and merchant accounts and 25 billion annual transactions. In its second quarter, revenue grew 8% year over year, with payment volume up 11%.\n\nThe company had slowed in recent years, but its prospects are looking better recently, with a new management team, a strong balance sheet, and leaner operations. It's been rolling out new features, too, such as its FastLane and Cash Pass rewards program. With its recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16, well below its five-year average of 21, the stock seems undervalued.\n\nStory continues\n\n4. Veeva Systems\n\nVeeva Systems(NYSE: VEEV) is not a household name, like the companies mentioned, but it's grown into a recent market value of $35 billion by offering vital cloud-based services primarily to the life sciences industry. For example, it helps pharmaceutical companies manage clinical trials -- and its customers include lots of big names, such as Moderna and EliLilly.\n\nVeeva's second quarter featured revenue up 15% year over year and subscription services revenue up 19%. That last tidbit is very promising, because subscriptions offer relatively reliable recurring revenue. If a customer has a subscription, you don't have to keep selling to them -- you just have to keep them satisfied.\n\nWith its recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34 well below its five-year average of 50, the stock seems attractively valued. Better, it has billions in cash and no debt, giving it a lot of flexibility to pounce on opportunities.\n\n5. iShares Semiconductor ETF\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) isn't technically a stock. It's an exchange-traded fund (ETF) -- a lot like a mutual fund, but trading like a stock. I have high hopes for this one because it gives you part ownership in 30 stocks of semiconductor specialists, and our modern world is now very dependent on semiconductors -- for everything from cloud computing, AI, data centers, smartphones, and more.\n\nThe ETF's top holdings recently included Nvidia, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices, Applied Materials, and Qualcomm.\n\nFive stocks to watch\n\nThese are five investments that seem to have terrific growth potential over the coming years and decades. They may or may not soar this year, but I suspect that anyone buying them now will be happy they did so five or 10 years from now.\n\nAfter learning more about any that interest you, if you're not sure, you needn't invest in them. There are other great stocks out there -- and great index funds, too, which can also help you amass wealth -- with less risk.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $716,988!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. TheStock Advisorservice has more than quadrupled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of September 30, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors. Selena Maranjian has positions in Advanced Micro Devices, Amazon, Broadcom, Microsoft, Moderna, Nvidia, PayPal, Qualcomm, Veeva Systems, and iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF.

        "title": "Beyond Nvidia: 2 Spectacular Growth Stocks Billionaires Can't Stop Buying",
        "content": "With Nvidia's incredible stock price performance over the past year, some billionaire investment managers are locking in their gains and using the profits to buy other growth stocks. There are reasons to be cautious about owning Nvidia stock, even just because it has ballooned to become a larger percentage of many total portfolios at its high price. Even if you believe it has further growth in its future, you might want to reallocate at least some of your funds to manage risk.\n\nThat raises the question: What other amazing growth stocks are out there to fill a portfolio?\n\nTwo fool.com contributors were asked to offer suggestions. They think you should consider perennial winner Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and newcomer Nu Holdings(NYSE: NU). Both stocks are being bought by billionaires, and both stocks happen to already be in billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio as well.\n\nAI could power huge profit growth for Amazon\n\nKeith Noonan: In the second quarter, Citadel purchased more than 1 million new shares of Amazon stock, bringing its total holdings in the company to approximately 7.7 million shares. Citadel is the most profitable hedge fund in history and is led by founder and billionaire Ken Griffin. With that kind of pedigree, it's little wonder that some investors pay close attention to the moves that Griffin and Citadel make. Notably, the hedge fund also sold roughly 79% of its Nvidia stake last quarter.\n\nLike Nvidia, Amazon looks poised to be one of the biggest drivers and beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the market's leading cloud infrastructure service, and it's poised to see long-term growth catalysts connected to the development, training, and scaling of AI applications.\n\nWhile Amazon is best known as an e-commerce giant and generates most of its sales from online retail, AWS is actually the source of most of the company's profits. AI-driven demand should help AWS keep expanding and come to account for a greater portion of the tech giant's overall sales. As AWS makes up a greater portion of the company's revenue, Amazon's profit margins should continue to improve.\n\nBut while AI's impact is already serving as a bullish catalyst for AWS, its long-term impact on the company's e-commerce business is even more exciting. Amazon is the largest e-commerce business by revenue, but it has historically generated relatively small profit margins on its online retail operations.\n\nHigh costs for warehouse operations and shipping tend to keep margins low, but AI will likely pave the way for significant margin expansion over the long term. Increased automation in warehouses and for deliveries could dramatically reduce operating costs and unlock the profit potential of Amazon's massive e-commerce imprint. With positive AI-related catalysts still seemingly in the early stages of unfolding, Amazon looks poised to be a winner for Griffin and Citadel -- and other long-term investors who build positions in the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nA no-brainer growth platform\n\nJennifer Saibil: Nu Holdings isn't as well known among investors as Nvidia and Amazon, but if you're interested in growth stocks, it should be on your radar. Nu is an all-digital, Brazil-based bank that's attracting customers at a high rate and changing the way people bank in Latin America.\n\nSome billionaire investors who recently increased their positions in Nu include BlackRock's Larry Fink, who increased the investment firm's position by 33%, and Millennium Management's Israel Englander, who increased his company's position by 371%.\n\nIt's not hard to see the appeal of Nu stock. It's been growing at incredible rates most companies dream of, and it's been doing it consistently quarter after quarter. It's also becoming more and more profitable.\n\nNu's platform is similar to other digital banking apps, but it has a few key features that make it stand out. For one thing, it targets the Latin American consumer, and it has a first-mover edge in that region. Brazil has historically been dominated by five traditional banks, and Nu made a splash when it came onto the scene, offering something truly different. These days there are other options, but Nu has already established itself as a leader in Brazil, to the tune of 95.5 million members in Brazil alone, or 56% of the adult population. Nu has added more customers to its platform over the past year than the other top five banks combined.\n\nIt started with targeting the mass consumer by hooking them in with low banking fees and high savings rates. Now that it's established itself, it's going after the high-income consumer, which could boost revenue further. It already has an excellent reputation among this population, and it's developing key products to fit this customer profile.\n\nNu is just getting started in Mexico, where it has 7.8 million customers, and Colombia, where it recently surpassed 1 million. The Brazil business is highly profitable, and it's investing in these two not-yet-profitable regions that will add tremendous scale as they grow and turn their own profits. So far, the Mexico business is outpacing where the Brazil business was at this stage of growth.\n\nNotably, Nu has a robust credit business with strong risk management that feeds into increasing net interest income. Net interest income rose 77% year over year in the second quarter, and net interest margin expanded to 19.8%.\n\nNu should continue to grow its business and it's well positioned to perform even better under lower interest rate conditions.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News Investors Probably Missed.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have been looking for smart ways to play the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has swept the global financial markets over the past two years. Most of the attention in this regard has been confined to obvious choices in semiconductors, software, and biotechnology. Even within these sectors, prominent companies and their AI initiatives have dominated headlines. However, there are several hidden gems within these sectors that offer the same bang for the buck, given present macro context, but are not in limelight as such. For example, Bernie Ahkong, an analyst at UBS, recently noted that the first phase of AI was interest towards chipmakers. In the second phase, investors moved towards the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centers. The present tilt towards utility and power firms is quite possibly the third phase of this AI focus.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nA recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. The cloud division of the company, Amazon Web Services, recently announced a new collaboration with oilfield services firm SLB to bring key technologies from the Delfi digital platform of the latter to customers on AWS. This is not the first SLB deal with a major tech giant. The firm also disclosed a partnership with NVIDIA earlier this month to develop generative artificial intelligence solutions for the energy industry. Howard Gefen, the general manager of energy and utilities at AWS, has said that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) had been happy to expand the partnership with SLB to help the organization scale AI, data and cloud technologies.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Amazon’s five-day return-to-office order sent shock waves throughout the company and the broader business world last month. On Tuesday, Whole Foods CEO Jason Buechel stepped up to the mic to assuage employee concerns at the Amazon-owned grocery chain.\n\nSaying he wanted Whole Foods employees to feel incentivized rather than bludgeoned into coming to the office every day, Buechel touted initiatives such as an “office experience task force” during a special meeting to address the RTO policy.\n\n“I want us to figure out, how do we find the win-win overall in supporting Whole Foods Market, our team members, our customers, and beyond,” Buechel said in the all-hands meeting on Tuesday, a recording of which was reviewed by Fortune.\n\n“Our goal here is not to make this seem like this is a stick,” he added. “We want to help create and work with our team members [in] having the carrot and getting the excitement about bringing back the culture and ultimately the interactions that we once had in our offices across the company.”\n\nBuechel said that his leadership team fielded 1,200 questions in advance of the meeting, which lasted a little less than an hour. Three employees attending the meeting in person were also given the mic to ask questions.\n\nThe town hall comes two weeks after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that his company, which bought Whole Foods in 2017, would return to a full five days in office on Jan. 2, 2025, after nearly five years of remote and hybrid work at Amazon and its subsidiaries. Whole Foods spokesperson Rachel Malish only confirmed that Whole Foods staff will abide by the new Amazon mandate but did not respond to Fortune’s questions about the staff meeting.\n\nJassy’s announcement came across as a tacit acknowledgement of a fraying corporate culture inside Amazon in recent years, as Fortune recently chronicled. Jassy also noted that Amazon would look to thin out middle management and the bureaucracy that the CEO believes comes from too much of it, by reducing the ratio of middle managers to individual employees by 15%. One Whole Foods employee on Tuesday questioned leadership about how such a cut would be carried out at the organic grocery store chain. But Whole Foods HR exec Brian O’Connell told employees that that number is just a “target” and that the grocer has already “done a lot of good work” in reducing this ratio over the past year.\n\n“I don’t imagine we’re going to make a 15% reduction,” he said.\n\nAmong the other queries employees had for management were questions about why Whole Foods workers should have to follow Amazon’s mandate when their compensation doesn’t always match that of their parent company counterparts, to whether the move was intended to force staff out, to how leadership plans to deal with a potential brain drain.\n\nStory continues\n\nLeadership offered vague answers to many questions—“freedom within a framework of a norm of an office-based culture” was one phrase from a Whole Foods marketing exec that especially rankled employees—and failed to explain how five days in office would fix problems that three days in person couldn’t. But Buechel was adamant that the mandate was not meant as an alternative to layoffs and that there would be flexibility to work from home when requiring quiet time to hit a deadline or if an unexpected personal need requires it.\n\nBuechel and other company executives pointed to efforts such as the creation of a new “office experience task force” made up of employees across company divisions who would be charged with brainstorming ideas to help staff transition from their current three-day hybrid structure to a new “office-based culture.”\n\n“What are things that we can do to make it exciting to come here and experience and work with our team members day in, day out?” the CEO asked rhetorically.\n\nThe responsibility of figuring out how this balancing act will work will fall to individual managers, Buechel said. As for the company tracking how often employees badge into the office, which Jassy said would continue during the transition to full in-office work, the Whole Foods CEO said it would continue for now, but “my goal is to get rid of this” if employees “work responsibly.”\n\n“I don’t want us to be in this space,” he said. “I don’t want this to seem like we are punching a clock from 8 to 5. And I don’t want to be in a spot where we are tracking this.”\n\nAre you a current or former Whole Foods employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "title": "Vanguard Group Inc's Strategic Acquisition of Veracyte Inc Shares",
        "content": "Overview of the Recent Transaction\n\nOn September 30, 2024, Vanguard Group Inc made a significant addition to its investment portfolio by acquiring 251,533 shares of Veracyte Inc (NASDAQ:VCYT), a leader in genomic diagnostics. This transaction increased Vanguard's total holdings in the company to 7,748,514 shares, reflecting a substantial investment in the medical diagnostics sector. The shares were purchased at a price of $34.04 each, marking a strategic move by the firm to bolster its position in the healthcare industry.\n\nProfile of Vanguard Group Inc\n\nFounded in 1975 by John C. Bogle, Vanguard Group Inc has grown into one of the world's leading investment management firms, renowned for its low-cost mutual funds and ETFs. The firm operates under a unique client-owned structure, which allows it to focus on delivering high returns at minimal costs to its investors. Vanguard's investment philosophy emphasizes long-term, cost-effective fund management, making it a preferred choice for millions of investors globally. The firm's top holdings include giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), showcasing its focus on technology and financial services sectors.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with VCYT. Vanguard Group Inc's Strategic Acquisition of Veracyte Inc Shares\n\nDetailed Analysis of the Trade\n\nThe recent acquisition by Vanguard has increased its stake in Veracyte Inc to 10.08% of the total shares outstanding, making it a significant shareholder in the company. This move is part of Vanguard's strategy to invest in high-growth sectors such as medical diagnostics and research, where Veracyte Inc is a key player. The addition of these shares has a minimal immediate impact on Vanguard's vast portfolio, representing just 0.01% of its total investments, but it strategically positions Vanguard in a high-potential market.\n\nInsight into Veracyte Inc\n\nVeracyte Inc specializes in genomic diagnostics with a focus on diseases like thyroid cancer, lung cancer, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The company's innovative products, including Afirma, Percepta, and Envisia, have set it apart in the biopharmaceutical sector. Despite being fairly valued with a GF Value of $31.58 and a price to GF Value ratio of 1.06, Veracyte shows robust growth prospects with a GF Score of 82/100, indicating good potential for outperformance. Vanguard Group Inc's Strategic Acquisition of Veracyte Inc Shares\n\nMarket Impact and Comparative Industry Analysis\n\nVeracyte's market capitalization stands at $2.58 billion, with a year-to-date stock price increase of 22.63%. The company operates within the competitive Medical Diagnostics & Research industry, where it has managed to maintain a strong growth rank of 9/10. However, its profitability rank is relatively low at 3/10, suggesting areas for improvement. Veracyte's strategic focus on expanding its diagnostic product range and enhancing technological capabilities positions it well for future growth within the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Notable Investors and Industry Context\n\nApart from Vanguard, other prominent investors like Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio) and Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio) have also invested in Veracyte, indicating strong investor confidence in the company's business model and growth trajectory. Baron Funds remains the largest shareholder, underscoring the attractiveness of Veracyte in the investment community.\n\nConclusion\n\nVanguard Group Inc's recent acquisition of Veracyte Inc shares is a strategic enhancement to its investment portfolio, particularly in the burgeoning field of medical diagnostics. This transaction not only underscores Vanguard's commitment to investing in high-growth industries but also positions it to benefit from Veracyte's potential market gains and technological advancements in genomic diagnostics. As the industry evolves, this move could significantly influence future valuations and investor interest in Veracyte Inc.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is set to debut even more ads on its streaming service Prime Video next year, the company said just eight months after first introducing commercial breaks to the platform.\n\nKelly Day, vice president of Prime Video International, told the Financial Times on Wednesday that the e-commerce giant will be ramping up its ad slot inventory for 2025. The comments were made ahead Amazon’s first London upfront, a presentation made before the upcoming broadcast year through which media companies try to sell the bulk of their ads.\n\nPrime Video first introduced ads in the beginning of the year — with an option for subscribers to go ad-free for an extra fee.\n\nDay told the outlet that Amazon intentionally launched the new feature with a “very light ad load” as a “gentle entry into advertising.”\n\nSo far, ads have been a success for the company with little customer backlash.\n\nDay said that Amazon hasn’t “really seen a groundswell of people churning out or cancelling” their subscriptions following the introduction of advertisements.\n\nAds have been a growing source of revenue for Amazon in recent years. Sales from the company’s digital advertising business rose about 20% to $12.8 billion in the second quarter of 2024, compared with the previous year.\n\nEarlier this year, Amazon said that it will add three new ad formats to Prime Video later this fall.\n\nMany other streaming services have added ad-supported tiers to their platforms and are now vying for advertisers’ money.\n\nIn August, Netflix (NFLX) stock hit an all-time high, following the news that it was able to increase its upfront ad sales commitments by 150% from 2023.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Daniel Wiessner\n\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com has been accused by a U.S. labor board of illegally refusing to bargain with a union representing drivers employed by a contractor, the agency announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe complaint from the National Labor Relations Board claims that Amazon is a so-called \"joint employer\" of drivers employed by the contractor, Battle Tested Strategies (BTS), and used a series of illegal tactics to discourage union activities at a facility in Palmdale, California.\n\nBTS drivers voted to join the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union last year, becoming the first Amazon delivery contractors to unionize.\n\nThe NLRB in the complaint, which was issued on Monday, said Amazon broke the law by terminating its contract with BTS after the drivers unionized without first bargaining with the Teamsters.\n\nThe board in August had said that it had found merit to the union's claims that Amazon exerts control over BTS drivers and should be considered their employer under federal labor law. The NLRB at the time said it would issue a complaint unless Amazon settled the case.\n\nLast month, the board said it planned to issue a second complaint involving a different group of Amazon drivers.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has said in the past that it does not have enough control over drivers' working conditions to be considered their joint employer.\n\nJoint employment has been one of the most contentious U.S. labor issues over the last decade, and the NLRB's standard for determining when companies qualify as joint employers has shifted numerous times since the Obama administration. Business groups favor a test that requires direct and immediate control over workers, while unions and Democrats back a standard that covers indirect forms of control.\n\nThe case will be heard by an administrative judge in Los Angeles, who is scheduled to hold an initial hearing next March. The judge's decision can be reviewed by the five-member NLRB, whose rulings can be appealed to federal court.\n\nA ruling that Amazon is a joint employer under federal labor law could be applied in cases involving other Amazon contractors and force the company to bargain with drivers' unions.\n\nThe board, meanwhile, is facing claims by a growing number of companies, including Amazon, that its structure and in-house enforcement proceedings violate the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAmazon has filed a lawsuit against the board seeking to block it from deciding whether the company must bargain with a union representing workers at a New York City warehouse. A federal appeals court on Monday temporarily blocked the NLRB from ruling while it reviews Amazon's claims.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi, Alexandra Hudson)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News Investors Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nCompanies are investing heavily in AI infrastructure to meet the growing demands of machine learning, data processing, and AI-driven applications. This spending is largely concentrated on building data centers, acquiring specialized hardware, and optimizing cloud infrastructure. According to a report by McKinsey, global AI infrastructure spending could reach up to $500 billion by 2027, highlighting the critical role it plays in the future of AI development. A large part of this investment is focused on AI-specific hardware like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are crucial for training and deploying AI models. NVIDIA, a dominant player in AI chips, has seen demand for its GPUs soar, largely due to their centrality in deep learning tasks. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the firm, has remarked that the AI boom is underpinned by massive infrastructure needs, and the market is just at the beginning of this growth curve.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nData centers are another focal point for AI infrastructure spending. AI workloads are highly demanding, requiring specialized facilities that can support high-density computing environments. Blackstone’s $16 billion acquisition of AirTrunk, a leader in AI-driven data centers, underscores the increasing importance of such infrastructure. The deal will add 800 MW of data center capacity, with projections to grow beyond 1 GW, a testament to the rising demand for infrastructure to support AI-driven applications. Cloud infrastructure is also a major area where companies are pouring resources. Cloud giants are increasing their investments in AI infrastructure. These companies are developing new AI-optimized cloud services to cater to businesses adopting AI. Gartner predicts that by 2026, cloud AI infrastructure spending will surpass $200 billion, as enterprises increasingly shift from on-premise AI deployments to scalable cloud-based solutions.\n\nThomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, recently remarked that AI is unlocking entirely new revenue streams for enterprises, and cloud infrastructure is the backbone enabling this transformation. Beyond just hardware, organizations are also investing in data management platforms and storage solutions to handle the massive amounts of data AI systems require. In fact, estimates suggest that the global AI data infrastructure market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18%, driven by increased data volumes and the need for real-time data processing capabilities. Companies are significantly ramping up their investments in AI infrastructure, focusing on hardware, data centers, and cloud computing. With projections showing continued growth in AI workloads, this spending will only increase in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Earlier this week, the regulatory authorities in Britain cleared the partnership that the tech giant had made with AI startup Anthropic back in March. Under the partnership, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) had agreed to invest over $4 billion into the company in the coming months.\n\nThe British regulator said the partnership did not qualify for investigation under merger rules. Anthropic, which was co-founded by former OpenAI executives and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, has received billions of dollars in investments from several tech giants, including Amazon rival Google. The startup is preparing to raise fresh funding at a valuation of around $40 billion.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has gained 7.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share, indicating a change of +34.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 points to a change of +63.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 indicates a change of +23.1% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $157.05 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9.8%. The $634.49 billion and $702.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.4% and +10.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $147.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.1%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $148.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.44%. The EPS surprise was +17.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "YEXT and Berry have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – October 2, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares YEXT YEXT as the Bull of the Day and Berry BRY as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and Adobe Inc. ADBE.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks.\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nYEXT is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that has a D for Value and a B for Growth. Yext provides digital media technology services. It offers advertising, monetization, phone and directory services which includes business listings on search sites and real-time reputation management. Let’s explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.\n\nDescription\n\nYext offers a cloud-based digital knowledge platform, which allows businesses to manage their digital knowledge in the cloud such as financial information, resources and performance of these resources on a consolidated basis and sync it to other application such as Apple Maps, Bing, Cortana, Facebook, Google, Google Maps, Instagram, Siri, and Yelp. It offers the Yext Knowledge Engine package on a subscription basis, which has an access to Listings, Pages, Reviews and other features.\r\n\r\nThe Listing feature provides customers with control over their digital presence, including their location and other related attributes published on the used third-party applications. The Pages feature allows customers to establish landing pages on their own websites and to manage digital content on those sites, including calls to action. The Reviews presence enables customers to encourage and facilitate reviews from end consumers. The company was founded by Howard Lerman, Brent Metz, and Brian Distelburger in 2006 and is headquartered in New York, NY..\n\nEarnings History\n\nWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.\n\nYext has a solid earnings history with the company topping the Zacks Consensus in three of the last four quarters.\n\nOver the course of the last four quarters the average positive earnings surprise works out to be 48%.\n\nEarnings Estimates Revisions\n\nEarnings estimates revisions is what the Zacks Rank is all about.\n\nAnnual Estimates are moving higher for YEXT.\n\nThis quarter has decreased from $0.15 to $0.13.\n\nNext quarter has also slid from $0.16 to $0.15.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe full year fiscal 2025 has increased from $0.40 to $0.41 over the last 30 days.\n\nNext year has seen a slight decrease from $0.66 to $0.64 over the last 30 days.\n\nGrowth\n\nFor fiscal 2025 the company is expected to show 4% growth with $420 million in sales. Next year that number grows to $463 million for a 10.2% increase.\n\nValuation\n\nThe forward earnings multiple for YEXT comes in at 17x which is right around this historic market multiple. It should be noted that the current market multiple is at 23x. The price to book multiple comes in at 5.4x and being a mostly asset slim model that gives this metric plenty of room to run. Price to sales comes in at 2.2x and that number will improve next year as revenue growth accelerates.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nBerry is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) after the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate when the last reported on August 9 of this year. Berry is an independent upstream energy company which focuses on the conventional, long-lived oil reserves principally in the San Joaquin basin of California. This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as it is the Bear of the Day.\n\nDescription\n\nBerry Corp. is an energy exploration company, which engages in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of domestic oil and natural gas reserves. It operates through the Exploration and Production (E&P) and Well Servicing and Abandonment segments. The E&P segment consists of the development and production of onshore, low geologic risk, long-lived conventional oil and gas reserves, primarily located in California, as well as Utah. The Well Servicing and Abandonment segment is involved in the wellsite services in California to oil and natural gas production companies, with a focus on well servicing, well abandonment services and water logistics. The company was founded by C. J. Berry in 1909 and is headquartered in Dallas, TX.\n\nEarnings History\n\nWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.\n\nIn the case of Berry, I see four straight misses of the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the last year. The most recent quarter was the miss with the company posting $0.18 when the consensus was calling for $0.20. This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn’t make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.\n\nThe Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.\n\nEarnings Estimates\n\nThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower. For BRY I see annual estimates moving lower of late.\n\nThe current fiscal year consensus number moved lower from $0.84 to $0.63 over the last 60 days.\n\nThe next year has moved from $0.87 to $0.59 over the last 60 days.\n\nNegative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nIt should be noted that a lot of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions. That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nAdditional content:\n\n3 Stocks with Extensive AI Applications to Hold Tight for Now\n\nThe astonishing rally in U.S. stocks that started at the beginning of 2023 was predominantly driven by the technology sector. An unprecedented adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology across the world was the prime factor.\n\nLately, a section of market analysts and financial researchers have raised concerns about the potential profitability of massive investments in generative AI by several technology giants. We believe that AI applications will continue to gather pace in the coming years, buoyed by the rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet.\n\nAt this stage, investors should keenly watch three technology behemoths with extensive applications of generative AI. These companies are - Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Adobe Inc.\n\nThese stocks have double-digit price upside in the short term. In the long term, these stocks have a higher earnings per share (EPS) growth rate than the broad-market S&P 500 index, which should drive their stock prices in the next 3 to 5 years. Each of these stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\n3 Tech Giants with Extensive AI Applications in Focus\n\nFocus on these three technology bigwigs for handsome returns in both the short and long terms.\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nA deepening focus on generative AI technology is a major positive for GOOGL in this data-driven world. Google has been well-poised to capitalize on the growing proliferation of generative AI-backed chatbots on the back of Bard, which enables users to collaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support and app integration.\n\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered with Gemini Pro in order to deliver enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\n\nIn addition, GOOGL’s Vertex AI enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models. These generative AI capabilities are aiding Google in enhancing search results, accelerating Android development, boosting healthcare reach and delivering enhanced cloud experience.\n\nHuge Price Upside Potential for GOOGL Stock\n\nAlphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14% and 31.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 60 days. Alphabet has a long-term (3-5 year) earnings growth rate of 17.5%.\n\nThe average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 23.3% from the last closing price of $165.85. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $170-$225.\n\nAmazon.com Inc.\n\nAmazon is pushing well with its devices strategy. Alexa powered Echo devices are going great guns and help the company sell products and services. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven Alexa has already been integrated into a host of everyday devices for the digital home, which has converted the nascent smart home market into a potential area of growth in a very short time.\n\nMoreover, AMZN is benefiting from an increasing number of Alexa-compatible smart devices. AMZN is racing to build an ecosystem around Alexa and it’s safe to say that it has taken an early lead over Google's smart assistant.\n\nAmazon is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure as a service to enterprise customers. The expanding customer base of Amazon Web Services (AWS) driven by its strengthening cloud offerings, will continue to aid AMZN’s dominance in the global cloud space.\n\nImpressive Price Upside Potential for AMZN Shares\n\nAmazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.4% and 63.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3% over the last 60 days. Alphabet has a long-term (3-5 year) earnings growth rate of 27.4%.\n\nThe average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 19.9% from the last closing price of $186.33. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $200-$265.\n\nAdobe Inc.\n\nAdobe has extensively implemented AI applications across its flagship products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Premiere. Earlier this year, ADBE introduced generative AI-driven Adobe Firefly. Moreover, Adobe Acrobat and Reader AI Assistant help users to summarize documents and answer questions, which can save time and help users accomplish tasks faster.\n\nUsing its new AI-driven cloud-based platform, ADBE is also diversifying into digital marketing services, offering data mining services, which help businesses measure page views, purchases and social media sites. Adobe Marketing Cloud enables marketers to deliver personalized web experiences across multiple devices, manage multichannel campaigns and optimize media monetization.\n\nThese services help businesses streamline marketing and products for targeted consumer groups, including chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers, advertising agencies, publishing executives and digital marketers.\n\nADBE has launched Adobe Express, an application for quick editing effects. Leveraging generative AI, this tool is useful for short-form video content like Instagram Reels. Adobe also launched an AI-based Express app for iOS and Android.\n\nSolid Price Upside Potential for ADBE Shares\n\nAdobe has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.5% and 13.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last 30 days. Alphabet has a long-term (3-5 year) earnings growth rate of 13.1%.\n\nThe average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 19% from the last closing price of $517.78. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $450-$703.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Online Retail Stocks Q2 Highlights: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)",
        "content": "Online Retail Stocks Q2 Highlights: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nQuarterly earnings results are a good time to check in on a company’s progress, especially compared to its peers in the same sector. Today we are looking at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the best and worst performers in the online retail industry.\n\nConsumers ever rising demand for convenience, selection, and speed are secular engines underpinning ecommerce adoption. For years prior to Covid, ecommerce penetration as a percentage of overall retail would grow 1-2% annually, but in 2020 adoption accelerated by 5%, reaching 25%, as increased emphasis on convenience drove consumers to structurally buy more online. The surge in buying caused many online retailers to rapidly grow their logistics infrastructures, preparing them for further growth in the years ahead as consumer shopping habits continue to shift online.\n\nThe 6 online retail stocks we track reported a slower Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.6% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 1.3% below.\n\nBig picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled.\n\nLuckily, online retail stocks have performed well with share prices up 15.7% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nFounded by Jeff Bezos after quitting his stock-picking job at D.E. Shaw, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest online retailer and provider of cloud computing services.\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $148 billion, up 10.1% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations, but overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ earnings estimates but revenue guidance for next quarter missing analysts’ expectations.\n\n“We’re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO. Amazon Total Revenue\n\nThe market was likely pricing in the results, and the stock is flat since reporting. It currently trades at $184.58.\n\nIs now the time to buy Amazon? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free.\n\nStory continues\n\nBest Q2: Carvana (NYSE:CVNA)\n\nKnown for its glass tower car vending machines, Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) provides a convenient automotive shopping experience by offering an online platform for buying and selling used cars.\n\nCarvana reported revenues of $3.41 billion, up 14.9% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 4.6%. Overall, the business had a strong quarter. Carvana Total Revenue\n\nCarvana delivered the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 31.2% since reporting. It currently trades at $174.87.\n\nIs now the time to buy Carvana? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free.\n\nWeakest Q2: Wayfair (NYSE:W)\n\nLaunched in 2002 by founder Niraj Shah, Wayfair (NYSE: W) is a leading online retailer for mass market home goods in the US, UK, Canada, and Germany.\n\nWayfair reported revenues of $3.12 billion, down 1.7% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 2%. It was a disappointing quarter as it posted a miss of analysts’ buyer estimates and slow revenue growth.\n\nWayfair delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group. The company reported 22 million active buyers, up 0.9% year on year. As expected, the stock is down 3% since the results and currently trades at $52.80.\n\nRead our full analysis of Wayfair’s results here.\n\nRevolve (NYSE:RVLV)\n\nLaunched in 2003 by software engineers Michael Mente and Mike Karanikolas, Revolve Group (NASDAQ: RVLV) is a next generation fashion retailer that leverages social media and a community of fashion influencers to drive its merchandising strategy.\n\nRevolve reported revenues of $282.5 million, up 3.2% year on year. This print surpassed analysts’ expectations by 1.9%. Taking a step back, it was a mixed quarter as it also recorded a decent beat of analysts’ buyer estimates but slow revenue growth.\n\nThe company reported 2.58 million active buyers, up 4.8% year on year. The stock is up 34.6% since reporting and currently trades at $23.65.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Revolve here, it’s free.\n\nChewy (NYSE:CHWY)\n\nFounded by Ryan Cohen who later became known for his involvement in GameStop, Chewy (NYSE: CHWY) is an online retailer specializing in pet food, supplies, and healthcare services.\n\nChewy reported revenues of $2.86 billion, up 2.6% year on year. This result was in line with analysts’ expectations. Zooming out, it was a weaker quarter as it logged slow revenue growth.\n\nThe stock is up 13.4% since reporting and currently trades at $29.27.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Chewy here, it’s free.\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Widely Held Stocks by Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other widely held stocks.\n\nTwo 25 Point Cuts May be the Most Likely Outcome\n\nThe last trading day of September is upon us and so are many questions about the market. On September 30, Dana D’Auria, Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the financial market.\n\nD'Auria regards employment data to be a major concern at the moment. Since inflation rates are subsiding, employment data is something investors should be on the lookout for, along with other data points including GDP and consumer confidence. She suggests that to ensure a soft landing, the Fed must initiate larger rate cuts, and that recessionary conditions are out of the picture.\n\nSeptember is notoriously volatile along with October, and, with elections in another 35 days, the conditions may be slightly different or even more turbulent. According to D'Auria, the 50 basis point cut is a catch-up for July, and expecting a 50 basis point cut in November is borderline questionable.\n\nOverall, she believes that the market has been overshooting and we may have to settle for two 25 basis point cuts before the end of 2024. She reiterates that the job market is crucial and investors must get out of their comfort zone to invest in non-cash opportunities. Investors concerned about low-risk options may consider equities in the defensive sectors that are innately low volatile.\n\nThe Market is Broadening\n\nWall Street is heading to close September and Q3 on a high note and stocks have experienced their best September in over a decade. On September 30, Kevin Gordon, harles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis.\n\nGordon believes that stocks in the utilities and defensive sectors have caught up to tech stocks amid the AI boom, compared to their financials at the end of FY 2023. However, he does acknowledge that sectors like industrials, financials, and materials are performing relatively well, calling it a case of market broadening.\n\nIn terms of market breadth, most sectors are experiencing an upward trajectory. Almost 81% of the S&P 500 members are experiencing an uptrend, despite the quality bias investors may have towards certain stocks. According to Gordon, large-cap quality stocks will continue to perform well despite the volatility and the Fed's decisions. Speaking of smaller-cap stocks, he believes that some stocks may struggle a bit especially when it comes to earnings growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 10 most widely held stocks by hedge funds, we sifted through Insider Monkey's database that tracks over 900 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. We ranked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services. Its e-commerce platform is functional in 20 countries and ships to over 100 countries. Its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services, on the other hand, is used by millions of active customers and has over 130,000 AWS partners in 200 countries.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also prominent on the AI front. Over the past few months, the company has partnered with AI startups like Anthropic and signed deals with the US government to test new AI models. As for AI hardware, the company has produced several AI chips to reduce its dependence on other companies. Amazon is efficiently branching out to multiple industries, which explains why it is widely held by hedge funds.\n\nSpeaking of AI, AWS is now housing the next generation of Llama models from Meta, giving customers more choices to build, deploy, and scale generative AI applications. The new models are capable of visual reasoning, document processing, and multilingual translation. On September 19, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched Project Amelia, a selling assistant backed by generative AI. Sellers will immensely benefit from the tool, allowing them to receive answers and advice immediately, for better customer assistance and reach.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to an 18% upside from current levels. Overall, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds and Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder, according to the Insider Monkey database.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\"\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley andJim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Amazon’s RTO charge is just layoffs in disguise, experts say",
        "content": "Amazon’s return-to-office policy announced last month, mandating employees work in person five days a week starting in 2025, already has workers irritated. Some have even begun “rage applying” to new positions, wanting to stick it to the tech company. The trouble for them is that could be exactly the response Amazon was hoping for.\n\nThe tech mammoth’s strict RTO push might just be a sneaky means of laying off workers, some future of work experts say. Amazon likely already knows the new policy will nudge dissatisfied workers out, meaning the company will no longer have to go through the tough process of formal layoffs. As a tradeoff, the RTO crusade could come at the expense of the company’s own talent and tech advancements.\n\n\"Amazon presumably took the view they would rather control costs by cutting head count and take the hit of technology and innovation,\" Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom told Business Insider.\n\nThe company may be content with making the sacrifice of some brain drain. The RTO crackdown came in tandem with CEO Andy Jassy calling for a reduction in managers and a bump in the ratio of workers to managers by 15% by the end of 2025’s first quarter. Amazon said its RTO shift is an effort to strengthen company culture and that the company has no plans to reduce its head count.\n\nBrian Elliott, future of work advisor and author of How the Future Works: Leading Flexible Teams to Do the Best Work of Their Lives, agreed with Bloom. He told Fortune Amazon will “undoubtedly” see employee attrition as a result of the mandate because it continues to be widely unpopular among most U.S. workers.\n\n“The vast majority of people want something that is in the middle: They want a couple days a week together that are meaningful with their teams,” he said. “And, by the way, those people the flexibility is taken away from are much more likely to jump ship.”\n\nA study from human resources consulting firm Robert Half conducted last month revealed 39% of office workers in Australia would quit if their company slashed flexible working. Amazon employees are already bolstering that statistic. Anonymous job review site Blind, which surveyed 2,585 verified Amazon workers a day after Jassy’s RTO announcement, found that 73% of employees considered quitting their jobs as a result of the mandate.\n\nAmazon’s high risk strategy\n\nThese “backdoor layoffs,” as Bloom refers to them, have already made a splash in other workplaces. According to research by BambooHR published in May surveying over 1,500 U.S. managers, about a quarter of executives said they hoped employees would voluntarily leave the company after the implementation of an RTO mandate. When AT&T mandated its 60,000 workers across nine of its 350 offices work in-person again, some employees interpreted the push as a way to eliminate workers unable or uninterested in relocating to their offices. CEO John Stankey estimated that 15% of the affected workforce, about 9,000 employees, would face the choice of relocating or leaving the company altogether.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It’s a layoff wolf in return-to-office sheep’s clothing,” an anonymous AT&T employee told Bloomberg.\n\nThe sneaky layoff strategy hasn’t always worked out for employers. Almost half of employers that implemented RTO policies saw a greater-than-anticipated level of employee attrition, according to a 2023 report from Unispace. Almost 30% reported recruitment difficulties.\n\nAmazon will face this same risk, Elliott argued. Other tech companies may keep their flexible work policies as a means to poach Amazon’s talent, and Amazon may struggle to hire new faces, he said. This talent pool shrinks even more for women, who may need flexibility for child care, and managers, who can leverage experience to find a cushier job elsewhere.\n\n“You lose a set of people in your organization,” Elliott said. “You lose high performance.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy Faces Employee Revolt Over Full-Time Return To Office Mandate, 73% Consider Quitting: Survey\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) employees are contemplating leaving their jobs following CEO Andy Jassy’s new policy requiring a full-time return to the office.\n\nWhat Happened: A recent survey on Blind stated, “Just days after the company's announcement, some Amazon professionals said they plan to take more drastic steps, including looking for another job. Nearly three out of four Amazon professionals (73%) said they are considering looking for another job because of the in-office work policy.”\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nGeneral Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum. The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\nThe survey, which included 2,585 Amazon workers, showed that 80% know colleagues also thinking about leaving. The policy, announced by Jassy, has reportedly affected morale, especially among parents.\n\nAmazon employees are hoping leadership will reconsider the policy, which is set to begin in 2025. An internal survey shared on Slack channels, including a “remote advocacy” group, aims to provide feedback to Jassy and other leaders, reported Fortune.\n\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nThe new return-to-office mandate is part of a broader strategy by Amazon to streamline operations and reduce managerial layers.\n\nIn a memo sent on Sep. 16, Jassy announced that Amazon would cut management layers and require employees to return to the office five days a week starting January 2025. This move aims to address inefficiencies caused by excessive meetings and approvals.\n\nWhy It Matters: The return-to-office policy has reportedly not been applied across Amazon’s subsidiaries. For instance, workers at Amazon’s One Medical subsidiary are only required to come to the office three times a week, starting in October. This discrepancy has fueled further dissatisfaction among Amazon’s broader workforce. However, the Amazon spokesperson has denied the report.\n\nTrending: Teens may never need wisdom teeth removed thanks to this MedTech Company – Be an early investor for just $300 for 100 shares!\n\nThe return-to-office policy has also faced external criticism. Ahead of the holiday season, Amazon’s mandate clashed with the UK government’s push for flexible working rights. The UK government argues that flexible working improves performance and employee loyalty, contrary to Amazon’s stance that in-office work fosters better collaboration and innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe dissatisfaction with Amazon’s rigid return-to-office policy has already led to a significant increase in resignations, particularly within its cloud division, In December, Amazon Web Services (AWS) employees reportedly resigned in large numbers, citing the inflexible policy as a primary reason.\n\nRead Next:\n\nGroundbreaking trading app with a ‘Buy-Now-Pay-Later' feature for stocks tackles the $644 billion margin lending market – here’s how to get equity in it with just $500 Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here’s how you can earn passive income with just $100.\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) shares jumped at the open on Tuesday after receiving upbeat endorsements from Goldman Sachs and RBC Capital, both of which see significant growth potential for the social media platform.\n\nPinterest shares are currently up more than 1% at around $32.75 a share.\n\nGoldman Sachs added Pinterest to its Americas Conviction List, forecasting robust topline growth and EBITDA margin expansion, while RBC Capital highlighted the company's under-monetized platform and strategic ad partnerships.\n\nGoldman Sachs is particularly optimistic about Pinterest's growth trajectory, predicting mid-to-high teens percentage topline growth and annual EBITDA margin expansion of around 300 basis points over the next five years.\n\n\"PINS is set up well to continue to compound topline growth at a mid-to-high teens percentage pace and drive steady adjusted EBITDA margin expansion,\" Goldman noted, adding that the company is trading at a valuation similar to Meta (NASDAQ:META) while growing cash earnings at a much faster pace.\n\nKey drivers include increased ARPU (average revenue per user), better user engagement, and high incremental margins. Goldman set a 12-month price target of $46 for Pinterest, citing a significant upside potential.\n\nRBC Capital also emphasized Pinterest's growth potential, particularly due to the company's changes, such as the implementation of direct links and a 3rd party partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nThe initiatives are expected to boost ad relevance and conversion rates, improving advertiser returns on ad spend (ROAS).\n\nRBC Capital sees Pinterest as under-monetized but believes the platform has significant potential to accelerate revenue growth without needing to drastically expand its user base. RBC maintained an Outperform rating and set a price target of $48, based on 25.5x expected 2025 EBITDA.\n\nBoth investment banks noted the importance of Pinterest's ad strategy and partnerships, with Goldman highlighting the company's ability to leverage expanded advertising offerings, and RBC underscoring the potential for higher ad load and improved engagement.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPinterest stock jumps on bullish comments from Goldman, RBC\n\nBrokerage Charles Schwab's long-time CEO Bettinger to retire\n\nApple falls as Barclays flags 'weak demand' for iPhone 16; Citi cuts estimates\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon Rises 44% in a Year: Can GenAI Strength Drive the Stock?",
        "content": "Amazon AMZN has experienced a 44% rally in its share price in the past year, outperforming the industry’s rise of 39.8% and the S&P 500 index’s return of 33.7%.\r\n\r\nThe company has been riding on solid momentum in its cloud computing arm — Amazon Web Services, which is being driven by strength in Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is continuously making strides in the Generative AI (GenAI) technology, which has now become mainstream in the cloud industry. \r\n\r\nAmazon has been at the forefront of the AI revolution, integrating GenAI capabilities across its AWS product suite. Growing AI capabilities have positioned AMZN as a leader in the cloud market.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDespite being the dominant player in the cloud market, the company faces strong competition from cloud giants like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google, which are also making concerted efforts to power their cloud solutions with GenAI.\r\n\r\nThis raises a crucial question of whether Amazon’s AI advancements will drive the momentum in its share price amid stiff GenAI and cloud competition.\n\nGenerative AI Strength: Key Catalyst for AMZN\n\nAWS is gaining significantly from the solid adoption of Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.\r\n\r\nThe company’s introduction of Bedrock innovations, including custom model import and model evaluation capabilities and Guardrails, is a positive. These features are designed to provide customers with a secure, easy and fast way to develop advanced generative AI applications.\r\n\r\nWith a wide selection of foundation models from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI and Stability AI, Bedrock offers seamless deployment, scalability and continuous optimization.\r\n\r\nAWS also offers a generative AI-powered assistant called Amazon Q, which generates codes, tests and debugs, and has multi-step planning and reasoning capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe company’s collaboration with NVIDIA, through which it will make the latter’s Blackwell GPU platform available on AWS, is a plus. This will help speed up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion-parameter language models.\r\n\r\nAmazon recently unveiled a GenAI-powered service called AWS App Studio, which helps create enterprise-grade applications by leveraging natural language. It simplifies and fastens the process of developing an application from scratch.\r\n\r\nAWS partnered with Intel INTC to enhance its AI capabilities. Per the terms, Intel will produce an AI fabric chip for AWS based on its most advanced process node, Intel 18A. It will also make a custom Xeon 6 chip on Intel 3 for AWS.\n\nStory continues\n\nExpanding AWS Clientele Drives Growth\n\nAWS is witnessing solid customer momentum on the back of its strengthening AI and GenAI capabilities.\r\n\r\nRecently, Digital Domain partnered with AWS to scale its Autonomous Virtual Human Technology and introduce GenAI-powered features by leveraging the latter’s cloud infrastructure, GenAI and Machine Learning capabilities.\r\n\r\nSmarsh entered a five-year agreement with AWS to enhance its offerings for the financial services industry by leveraging Amazon Bedrock.\r\n\r\nAWS was selected by the Central Japan Railway Company. The latter is using AWS's Internet of Things, machine learning (ML) and GenAI capabilities to drive efficient operations for its next-generation, high-speed train service.\r\n\r\nA global gold producer named Gold Fields shifted its end-to-end SAP and treasury systems to AWS. Gold Fields is also leveraging AWS’s analytics, ML and GenAI solutions to modernize technology infrastructure.\r\n\r\nAccenture joined forces with AWS to develop the Accenture Responsible Artificial Intelligence platform. Accenture leverages AWS’s AI services, including Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker, along with AWS Control Tower, Amazon DataZone and AWS observability tools.\r\n\r\nInfor, a leading provider of a global leader in business cloud software, recently selected Amazon Bedrock to deploy GenAI solutions embedded within Infor CloudSuite.\r\n\r\nRobin AI teamed up with AWS to power its legal assistant by using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker.\r\n\r\nGE HealthCare selected AWS as its strategic cloud provider to accelerate healthcare transformation with GenAI. GEHC intends to utilize AWS’s ML and GenAI capabilities for this purpose.\n\nRising Estimates Paint Bright Picture for AMZN\n\nAWS’s expanding customer base on the back of its growing GenAI capabilities is expected to aid its long-term prospects.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $634.49 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 10.4%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings stands at $4.74 per share, implying year-over-year growth of 63.5%. The estimate has moved north by 2.4% over the past 60 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAMZN Stock Seems Overvalued\n\nAmazon's current valuation presents a premium scenario, with its forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio of 2.85X exceeding the industry’s average of 1.72X and the company’s historical median of 2.76X. This reflects a stretched valuation. Hence, investors should wait for a better entry point. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Note\n\nAmazon, being a cloud giant, presents a solid investment opportunity due to its deepening focus on generative AI, AI integration and innovative product development.\r\n\r\nHowever, stiff cloud competition, lofty valuation and macro uncertainties do not bode well for the company’s near-term prospects.\r\n\r\nFor current shareholders, holding on to the stock seems prudent, as the company’s fundamental strengths and growth drivers are intact. New investors should, however, wait for a favorable entry point for Amazon.\r\n\r\nAmazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks With Extensive AI Applications to Hold Tight for Now",
        "content": "The astonishing rally in U.S. stocks that started at the beginning of 2023 was predominantly driven by the technology sector. An unprecedented adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology across the world was the prime factor.\n\nLately, a section of market analysts and financial researchers have raised concerns about the potential profitability of massive investments in generative AI by several technology giants. We believe that AI applications will continue to gather pace in the coming years, buoyed by the rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet.\n\nAt this stage, investors should keenly watch three technology behemoths with extensive applications of generative AI. These companies are - Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and Adobe Inc. ADBE.\n\nThese stocks have double-digit price upside in the short term. In the long term, these stocks have a higher earnings per share (EPS) growth rate than the broad-market S&P 500 index, which should drive their stock prices in the next 3 to 5 years. Each of these stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\n3 Tech Giants With Extensive AI Applications in Focus\n\nFocus on these three technology bigwigs for handsome returns in both the short and long terms.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of three stocks in the past three months. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nA deepening focus on generative AI technology is a major positive for GOOGL in this data-driven world. Google has been well-poised to capitalize on the growing proliferation of generative AI-backed chatbots on the back of Bard, which enables users to collaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support and app integration.\n\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered with Gemini Pro in order to deliver enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\n\nIn addition, GOOGL’s Vertex AI enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models. These generative AI capabilities are aiding Google in enhancing search results, accelerating Android development, boosting healthcare reach and delivering enhanced cloud experience.\n\nHuge Price Upside Potential for GOOGL Stock\n\nAlphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14% and 31.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 60 days. Alphabet has a long-term (3-5 year) earnings growth rate of 17.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 23.3% from the last closing price of $165.85. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $170-$225.\n\nAmazon.com Inc.\n\nAmazon is pushing well with its devices strategy. Alexa powered Echo devices are going great guns and help the company sell products and services. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven Alexa has already been integrated into a host of everyday devices for the digital home, which has converted the nascent smart home market into a potential area of growth in a very short time.\n\nMoreover, AMZN is benefiting from an increasing number of Alexa-compatible smart devices. AMZN is racing to build an ecosystem around Alexa and it’s safe to say that it has taken an early lead over Google's smart assistant.\n\nAmazon is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure as a service to enterprise customers. The expanding customer base of Amazon Web Services (AWS) driven by its strengthening cloud offerings, will continue to aid AMZN’s dominance in the global cloud space.\n\nImpressive Price Upside Potential for AMZN Shares\n\nAmazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.4% and 63.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3% over the last 60 days. Alphabet has a long-term (3-5 year) earnings growth rate of 27.4%.\n\nThe average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 19.9% from the last closing price of $186.33. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $200-$265.\n\nAdobe Inc.\n\nAdobe has extensively implemented AI applications across its flagship products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Premiere. Earlier this year, ADBE introduced generative AI-driven Adobe Firefly. Moreover, Adobe Acrobat and Reader AI Assistant help users to summarize documents and answer questions, which can save time and help users accomplish tasks faster.\n\nUsing its new AI-driven cloud-based platform, ADBE is also diversifying into digital marketing services, offering data mining services, which help businesses measure page views, purchases and social media sites. Adobe Marketing Cloud enables marketers to deliver personalized web experiences across multiple devices, manage multichannel campaigns and optimize media monetization.\n\nThese services help businesses streamline marketing and products for targeted consumer groups, including chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers, advertising agencies, publishing executives and digital marketers.\n\nADBE has launched Adobe Express, an application for quick editing effects. Leveraging generative AI, this tool is useful for short-form video content like Instagram Reels. Adobe also launched an AI-based Express app for iOS and Android.\n\nSolid Price Upside Potential for ADBE Shares\n\nAdobe has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.5% and 13.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last 30 days. Alphabet has a long-term (3-5 year) earnings growth rate of 13.1%.\n\nThe average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 19% from the last closing price of $517.78. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $450-$703.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks to Buy for Long Term.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks.\n\nMarket Strategist Says The Economy May Re-Accelerate on its Own\n\nOn September 23, Chris Watling, Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the rate easing path and the impact it may have on the market.\n\nAccording to Walting, the market is deeply divided on not two but three different sides. While some analysts and investors foresee a recession, others believe the economy is going towards a soft landing, and of those a small minority believe that the economy may accelerate at a rapid pace. Walting also added that while predicting the appropriate terminal rate is interesting, there is a lot more going on with the economy. Comparing economic conditions to the 2008 recession, households and corporations are in much better shape, hinting that a recession may not be the most likely outcome.\n\nHe believes that the economy may be slowing right now but it may experience faster reacceleration than before without the need for further falls. His advice to investors is to judge the economy based on multiple data points. As for the appropriate portfolio, Walting suggests that bonds are overcooked and gold must be given a pause. At the moment, the market is rotating away from tech into defensive sectors, and in the future, it may rotate more towards cyclical stocks.\n\nThe Fed is Thinking About Growth\n\nAs the S&P 500 recorded an upside following the Fed's easing cycle, investors and analysts alike eye a soft landing for the economy. On September 26, Liz Miller, Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the future of markets.\n\nMiller states that the pivot has been great for the financial markets and now that the Fed is thinking about growth, investors are hopeful of a soft landing. She suggests that stocks in sectors such as housing, rental, finance, and consumer goods may benefit immensely from the easing interest rate cycle.\n\nMiller suggests that the S&P 500 is not the best way to measure the performance of financial markets, given that it is skewed to the mega-cap tech stocks. Looking at other indices, other sectors have not made highs since December 2021. She believes the market may be flat but there is huge potential for upsides. Miller shares concerns over the Chinese economy and how it influences the global outlook. She suggests that for the global economy to balance, companies must work to regain consumer confidence in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow that we have studied the appropriate portfolio mix for investors following the Fed's decision, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term we examined promising stocks hedge funds are piling into. These are blue chip stocks with wide moats and have long track records of driving shareholder returns.

We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve.

        "content": "Investing.com -- RBC Capital Markets announced a quarterly update to its “Top 30 Global Ideas List,” adding eight new stocks, including Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS), while removing seven, one of them being Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nThe inclusion of Pinterest comes amid the social media company’s strong growth potential, driven by increased ad relevance and conversion through initiatives such as direct links and a partnership with third-party retail media.\n\nThese changes are expected to significantly improve return on ad spend (ROAS), with Pinterest’s stock poised for a potential upward re-rating as growth reaccelerates to around 20%. RBC notes that the company is not reliant on U.S. user base expansion, as even its current users are seen as capable of driving higher growth through better ad engagement.\n\n“While it’s unclear whether these changes will be a tailwind to US monthly active users (MAUs), we think the current user base is under-monetized to a degree that the company doesn’t necessarily need to grow US users meaningfully in order to accelerate revenue growth and drive margins higher.”\n\nRBC set an Outperform rating on Pinterest stock with a price target of $48, representing a 48% upside from current levels.\n\nIn addition to Pinterest, several other stocks were added to RBC’s list this quarter, including American International Group (NYSE:AIG), Cameco (NYSE:CCJ), Healthequity Inc (NASDAQ:HQY), and Zalando SE (ETR:ZALG).\n\nAt the same time, Amazon, along with other notable names like Chubb (NYSE:CB) and Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), was removed from the list.\n\nAmazon's stock fell by 6.8% in Q3 2024, underperforming RBC's broader Top 30 list, which delivered a 7.8% total return during the quarter.\n\nRBC analysts, however, continue to see long-term value in Amazon, particularly in its AWS division, though it was removed in favor of higher-conviction ideas.\n\nAmerican Homes (NYSE:AMH) 4 Rent, Marks and Spencer Group PLC (LON:MKS), Restaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR), and S&P Global Inc (NYSE:SPGI) were also removed.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPinterest added to RBC's 'Top 30 Global Ideas List', Amazon out\n\nStellantis to halt production of electric Fiat 500 for longer due to poor demand\n\nAnalysis-Global investors gear up to go back into China\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) saw its profits surge 35% in the third quarter, as it looks to show investors that its multi-billion dollar investments into artificial intelligence are bearing fruit.\n\nMeta saw $15.69 billion in net income last quarter, or $6.03 per share, up from $11.58 billion in the same quarter last year, the company reported after the markets closed on Wednesday. Wall Street had expected $13.49 billion in profit, or $5.21 per share, according to estimates compiled by FactSet.\n\nRevenue came in at $40.59 billion, up 19% from $34.15 billion a year ago and surpassing Wall Street’s estimated $40.19 billion for the quarter.\n\n“We had a good quarter driven by AI progress across our apps and business,” said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO. “We also have strong momentum with Meta AI, Llama adoption, and AI-powered glasses.”\n\nShares of Meta were down 3% in after hours trading.\n\nThe company said it expects fourth-quarter total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. It lowered its full-year expense expectations to $96-98 billion, and raised capital expenditure estimates to $38-40 billion. Meta expects“significant capital expenditures growth in 2025” and “significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year.”\n\nAnalysts have said this this big spending is being driven in large part by burgeoning AI costs, including data centers, chips, and research and development.\n\nZuckerberg showed the impact of some of those investments at the company’s annual Connect conference in September. Zuckerberg said Meta AI is on track to become the most-used AI assistant in the world by the end of this year, with almost 500 million monthly active users as of today. Meta added the AI assistant to its popular social media platforms, including Instagram and Facebook, in April.\n\nAt the event, Zuckerberg also announced Llama 3.2, Meta’s first open-source, multimodal large language model (LLM). The CEO said that the AI industry has reached an inflection point and that Llama has become “something of an industry standard.”\n\nThis enthusiasm has fueled a strong year for the company, with shares up more than 70% year-to-date.\n\nMeta is also reportedly building its own search engine to supply answers to its chatbot, in an effort to reduce its reliance on Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), according to The Information. Bank of America (BAC) said in an Oct. 28 note that this would be “consistent with Meta’s long-term goal to reduce dependence on competitor platforms & technology,” and that it expects an announcement on new AI and search capabilities in Meta’s third-quarter earnings call.\n\nBank of America analysts added, however, that Meta’s search engine would “be at a data and web scraping disadvantage” compared to Google due to a “limited number of Meta AI users.”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Dow and other indices surged Monday in anticipation of the upcoming earnings week, reflecting expectations for how the current quarter might influence the remainder of the year. This week will see big tech earnings, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others.\n\nIn morning trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 323 points, or 0.77%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 gained 0.4%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 0.5%.\n\nMeanwhile, oil prices have dropped significantly, with West Texas Intermediate futures trading at approximately $67.30 per barrel. This decline followed Israel’s limited attack on Iran, which notably spared energy and nuclear facilities.\n\nWhat to expect from Meta and Microsoft earnings\n\nWall Street is projecting double-digit profit and sales growth from Facebook parent Meta Platforms as the tech giant continues to ramp up its artificial intelligence efforts. Meta is expected to report earnings per share of $5.21 when it posts third-quarter results after the bell Wednesday, according to estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.49%). That’s a profit of $13.49 billion, up more than 16% from period a year ago.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT+0.13%) is set to report earnings for its fiscal first quarter on Wednesday, after disappointing artificial intelligence sales in the last quarter. The tech giant is expected to report revenues of $64.57 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.49%).\n\n– Rocio Fabbro and Britney Nguyen contributed to this article\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta earnings are coming this week. Wall Street expects big growth",
        "content": "Wall Street is projecting double-digit profit and sales growth from Facebook parent Meta Platforms, as the tech giant continues to ramp up its artificial intelligence efforts.\n\nMeta is expected to report earnings per share of $5.21 when it posts third-quarter results after-the-bell Wednesday, according to estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). That’s a profit of $13.49 billion, up more than 16% from the year ago period.\n\nThey are similarly projecting an 18% jump in sales from the same period last year to $40.19 billion for the quarter.\n\nThese results would be an early reflection of the tech giant’s ramped up AI efforts. This year alone, the company’s total spending is expected to hit between $35 billion and $40 billion, driven in large part by burgeoning AI costs, according to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) analyst Doug Anmuth. That figure could reach $42 billion next year.\n\nChief executive Mark Zuckerberg showed how some of those investments have already begun to pay off at the company’s annual Connect conference in September. Zuckerberg said Meta AI is on track to become the most-used AI assistant in the world by the end of this year, with almost 500 million monthly active users as of today. Meta added the AI assistant to its popular social media platforms, including Instagram and Facebook (META), in April.\n\nZuckerberg also announced Llama 3.2, Meta’s first open-source, multimodal large language model (LLM). The CEO said that the AI industry has reached an inflection point and that Llama has become “something of an industry standard.”\n\nThis has fueled a strong year for the company, with shares up roughly 67% year-to-date. A single share of Meta stock is valued at around $577, approaching an all-time high.\n\nIn a recent note, Jefferies (JEF) analysts reiterated their belief in Meta’s ability to sustain double-digit revenue growth, pointing to a combination of higher engagement from AI investments, increased advertiser efficiency, and the ramping up of other monetization formats, including WhatsApp and Llama.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Meta-owned social media platforms Instagram (META) and Threads have suspended accounts that track the private jets of celebrities and billionaires.\n\nJack Sweeney, a Florida college student who runs several jet-tracking accounts, said in a post on Threads on Tuesday that his pages where he tracks flights by Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian, and others have been suspended on Instagram and Threads without warning.\n\nAccounts tracking Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump were also suspended after a Fortune report, Sweeney said.\n\n“No matter the intent, this situation reflects poorly on Meta,” he wrote of the Facebook parent company.\n\nHe added that across platforms like Threads and Musk-owned X (X) (formerly Twitter), 38 of his accounts have been removed. In a separate post, Sweeney said, “Today feels like December 15th 2022” — referring to the day when Sweeney’s X account tracking Musk, @ElonJet, was permanently taken down.\n\n“These platforms don’t care about transparency,” Sweeney said. “They selectively enforce their rules, allowing some users to stay while others are shut down without reason.”\n\nMeta and X did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n“Given the risk of physical harm to individuals, and in keeping with the independent Oversight Board’s recommendation, we’ve disabled these accounts for violating our privacy policy,” Meta told TechCrunch in an emailed statement.\n\nSweeney blasted the response on Threads, questioning why the tech giant announced its reasoning after the fact without communicating with Sweeney or the public. “They wanted it to go unnoticed,” he wrote.\n\nThe account he used to post updates about Swift, @TaylorSwiftJets, was among the first to be suspended on Meta-owned platforms, Sweeney said. Swift’s attorney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Sweeney back in December, threatening to sue him over accusations of “stalking and harassing behavior,” The Washington Post reported.\n\nHe argued that the suspension of that account while others remained active was “a clear case of selective enforcement,” pointing to the pop superstar’s partnership with Meta.\n\nFor his part, Sweeney has claimed that his tracking accounts don’t violate any rules, given that they share information that’s publicly available through the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Dan Ives Acknowledges Nvidia, Microsoft As 'Core Drivers Of AI' But Sees Palantir, IBM, AMD And Apple Joining The Party As Well\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives forecasts a “robust” third-quarter earnings season for technology companies, citing artificial intelligence adoption, improved enterprise spending, and rebounding digital advertising as key growth drivers.\n\nWhat Happened: In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Ives highlighted an expanding roster of companies beyond traditional AI leaders that are now capitalizing on the technology revolution.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. The Arrived Homes investment platform has created an Income Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nWhile NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) are “the core drivers of AI, now we are seeing many other tech stalwarts join the AI Party,” Ives wrote, listing Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR), Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL), IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) among the companies making significant moves in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe analyst expressed optimism about the technology sector’s near-term prospects, stating, “We believe the next phase of the AI Revolution has begun.” He expects this momentum, combined with strengthening enterprise spending and a recovery in digital advertising, to push technology stocks higher through the end of the year.\n\nThis expanding AI landscape indicates a broader range of investment opportunities beyond the few companies that initially dominated the AI narrative earlier in the year, according to Ives.\n\nWhile Nvidia and Microsoft are the core drivers of AI, now we are seeing many other tech stalwarts join the AI Party including Oracle, SAP, ServiceNow, Palantir, Salesforce, Dell, IBM, Apple, and AMD among others 🔥🏆🐂🍿 https://t.co/kfpqGZYmYu\n\n— Dan Ives (@DivesTech) October 20, 2024\n\nSee Also:If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy It Matters: The anticipation of a strong third quarter for tech firms aligns with recent trends in the industry. Nvidia remains a top pick within the AI sector, with analysts labeling it a “generational opportunity” due to its dominant market position in AI chips.\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd.‘s (NYSE:TSM) recent earnings, which exceeded expectations due to strong demand for AI chips, further supporting the bullish outlook for tech companies.\n\nAdditionally, the third quarter earnings preview suggests that the tech sector is poised to outperform, while other sectors like energy may face challenges.\n\nThis optimism is further supported by increased ad spending, as seen with Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), where analysts have raised price targets ahead of its earnings report, driven by strong ad spending.\n\nLock In High Rates Now With A Short-Term Commitment\n\nLeaving your cash where it is earning nothing is like wasting money. There are ways you can take advantage of the current high interest rate environment through private market real estate investments.\n\nEquityMultiple's Basecamp Alpine Notes is the perfect solution for first-time investors.

        "title": "Why Lumen Stock Is Falling After Surging Early in Today's Trading",
        "content": "Lumen Technologies(NYSE: LUMN) stock is surging in today's trading. The telecommunications company's share price was up down 2.5% as of 2:30 p.m. ET, after having been up as much as 15.4% earlier in the day's trading.\n\nLumen stock is making big gains following an announcement that the company has signed a new deal with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) to provide network infrastructure and services. Through the new partnership, Lumen will be providing fiber internet services to increase Meta's network capacity and support its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. In addition to providing Meta with access to existing fiber routes, Lumen will also be providing new fiber routes between data centers.\n\nLumen announces another big AI partner\n\nThe deal with Meta Platforms comes on the heels of contracts that Lumen landed to support Microsoft's AI projects earlier this year, and the pullback for the stock after initially posting big gains likely stems from investors of whether the Meta deal was a new contract win or one that was previously mentioned in less concrete terms.\n\nWhat's next for Lumen stock?\n\nLumen stock is now up roughly 259% across this year's trading. Most of the explosive growth for the telecom company's share price has been driven by excitement surrounding the company's opportunity to provide networking services for data center and AI applications.\n\nWhile no details were given about the value of Lumen's new partnership with Meta were given, the company's previously announced deal with Microsoft suggests that the new deal could be a substantial sales driver for the telecom company. Following the announcement of its deal with Microsoft, Lumen announced that it had secured $5 billion in new business thanks to demand connected to AI. The telecom also said at the time that it was in discussions to provide additional infrastructures and services potentially worth as much as $7 billion in new deal value.\n\nLanding substantial new deals is undoubtedly a bullish development for Lumen's business, and the new contracts being connected to AI likely does even more to create excitement for the company's stock. On the other hand, investors should keep in mind that there's a lot about the specifics of these new deals that is still unknown -- and the telecom still has a massive debt load to overcome.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lumen Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lumen Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lumen Technologies wasn’t one of them.

Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 8th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nPositive sentiment is prevailing in the market after strong bank earnings and increasing hopes of a soft landing. Ryan Detrick, Carson Group chief market strategist, said while talking during a recent program on CNBC that he sees more runway for the current bull market.\n\n“This is a bull market. Now we’re in the third year of a bull market. My friend Sam Stovall said once you get to 65 years old, the odds of getting to 85 are really, really high. Bull markets work that way. Going back 50 years, there’s five other bull markets that made it into their third year, like this one is right now. The worst any of them went was another three years. A five-year total. The average was eight years. I’m not saying we have another six years of a bull market but what we’re saying is this is an economy that keeps surprising to the upside.”\n\nREAD ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nHowever, the analyst said large-cap tech stocks are “pricey.” He believes small- and mid-cap stocks are cheap and labeled financials and industrials as fairly valued.\n\nThere are some top AI stocks that are seeing insider selling activity. In this article, we take a look at those stocks and analyze their fundamentals and market sentiment. With each company, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Insiders Selling Meta (META) Amid Massive AI Investments and Market Skepticism\n\nPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\n\nOn September 19, 2024, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Chief Product Officer Christopher K. Cox sold 20,000 shares at $557.52 per share, reducing his ownership by 5% to 393,708 shares. The transaction was valued at approximately $11.15 million. The stock is up about 3.3% since then.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its Q2 results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future.\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We are pleased to report that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\n\nWe would like to remind you that achieving these types of returns is never a straight path. From time to time, we might experience volatility — that’s simply part of the investment journey. In fact, wealth creation and volatility go hand in hand. There’s no escaping it; it’s the “price of admission” the market demands. If you take a look at the chart below, you’ll notice the drawdowns META stock has faced over the years, with 2022 standing out as a particularly challenging period, where the stock saw a 75% drop…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, META ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Insiders are Selling These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Meta Platforms Inc. (META): A Strong Contender for Long-Term Investment in 2024",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Best American Stocks To Buy and Hold in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024.\n\nNeutral Stance Amid Uncertainties\n\nThe tech sector has been showing positive performance amid market concerns, driven by improved earnings estimates and substantial investments in artificial intelligence. Approximately 40% of operating cash flow is currently allocated to AI, raising questions about when these investments will begin to yield returns. The strong profit margins of mega-cap stocks, averaging over 23%, compared to just over 8.5% for other sectors, suggest continued capital inflows into tech companies demonstrating earnings strength. While some consolidation and growth slowdown may occur, there is confidence that investor sentiment will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.\n\nAs sentiments shift regarding major tech stocks, other profitable tech companies are maintaining positive momentum in the market. There was a conversation regarding this, covered a few days back in our article about the 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In, where Jason Snipe, Odyssey Capital Advisors principal, discussed the tech sector’s mega-cap momentum, particularly in light of recent mega-cap stock downgrades and significant investor outflows. Here’s an excerpt from his sentiment:\n\n“…This focus on AI has contributed to some recent downgrades but also suggests continued upside potential for select names within the sector.\n\n…He acknowledged that while there may be some consolidation and a slowdown in growth, he believes that investors’ muscle memory will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.\n\nSnipe’s analysis underscores the complexities facing the tech sector amid market volatility and evolving economic conditions. While challenges persist, particularly with mega-cap stocks experiencing downgrades, there are also significant opportunities driven by innovation and strong profit margins that could support continued growth in this space…”\n\nKatie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on October 17 and highlighted that there’s a likelihood that the markets could move into choppier territory. Katie Stockton characterized her stance as neutral regarding the indices despite the strength of the trend and the participation of most stocks on the upside. She noted that while short-term momentum is currently positive, particularly behind major indices, there are concerns about potential problems if key players like NVIDIA falter. She highlighted that sentiment appears overly bullish or greedy, as evidenced by the Fear and Greed Index reaching an extreme level of 5%. This situation makes it challenging for the market to sustain overbought conditions, which are prevalent across various timeframes.\n\nStory continues\n\nStockton anticipates a pullback or possibly a more significant corrective phase in the fourth quarter for the S&P 500, suggesting that this could mark the beginning of a range-bound environment. She pointed to indicators such as the VIX, which has entered a new higher volatility cycle, and mentioned signs of long-term exhaustion indicated by the DeMark indicators, levels not seen collectively since late 2021. While this does not necessarily signal an impending bear market, it does enhance the likelihood of experiencing a choppier trading environment.\n\nWhen asked about the recent performance of banks and cyclical stocks compared to defensive stocks, Stockton acknowledged that while there has been a positive move from the financial sector contributing to the S&P 500’s recent gains, it is too early to conclude that this represents a breakout in relative strength for financials. She indicated that most metrics suggest financials will likely perform in line with broader market trends rather than leading them. Furthermore, she expressed concern that mega-cap sectors are poised to lose their leadership position, which could pose challenges to overall market performance.\n\nRegarding small-cap stocks, Stockton noted that while the Russell 2000 index made another attempt at an upside move, closing close to 2,300 with a 1.6% increase, long-term trends still indicate underperformance relative to the S&P 500. She pointed out that there has not been a breakout in the Russell 2000, which remains stalled below resistance levels established during summer highs. Consequently, she does not see actionable opportunities in small caps at this time and anticipates neutral trading conditions for this segment.\n\nOn the topic of bonds, Stockton mentioned that Treasury yields have shown some upside momentum but backed off recently. She sees potential entry points in Treasury bond proxies like TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF), suggesting signs of short-term downside exhaustion within a broader long-term uptrend for fixed income. She believes there is an opportunity for investors to enter Treasury bond proxies now, while also expecting yields to stall without significant long-term declines.\n\nHer insights highlight her focus on maintaining balance amid prevailing uncertainties in both equity and bond markets.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo find the best American stocks, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database to find US stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Meta Platforms Inc. (META): A Strong Contender for Long-Term Investment in 2024\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a multinational technology company that focuses on social media and online communication, best known for its flagship social networking platform, Facebook. It also owns other popular social media apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. The mission is to connect people around the world and build communities.\n\nThe company’s AI-enhanced advertising and business user monetization led to Q2 2024 ad growth twice that of Google, despite higher ad costs. Daily active users rose 7%, while earnings per share surged 73% and revenue increased 22.10% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a 10% increase in ads served and cost per ad. It acquired 600,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs and is developing its own AI chip.\n\nIts Reality Labs division is driving immersive experiences with products like the Meta Quest VR headset and Ray-Ban smart glasses. The company’s AI language model, Llama, is poised to enhance hardware-social media integration. Recent updates to Ray-Ban Meta glasses have boosted sales, and a renewed partnership with EssilorLuxottica signals a strong commitment to smart eyewear technology. In October, it launched features designed to help young adults discover new interests and connect with like-minded people.\n\nDriven by a robust user base, cutting-edge AI, and sophisticated advertising, the company is rapidly expanding. A commitment to innovation, including a strategic push into the metaverse, positions it for continued success. AI-powered products, such as Meta AI and Meta Smart Glasses, offer users unparalleled experiences.\n\nHere’s what Mar Vista Investment Partners, LLC said about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company’s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street’s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels). The subsequent decline in Meta’s stock price during 2022 reflected these concerns.\n\nOverall, META ranks 3rd on our list of best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other profitable stocks.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on October 14, Michael Kantrowitz, Chief Investment Officer at Piper Sandler noted that while the market is expensive, it's not a reason to get bearish and that unless a risk arises, the market will likely stay expensive. Kantrowitz explains that the market's valuation is driven by the pricing out of risks that existed two years ago, such as inflation and higher interest rates. He believes that if these risks were to resurface, it would be a reason to get worried, but currently, that's not the backdrop.\n\nHe also notes that investors should focus on stocks with continued earnings momentum, as these names will likely see the best outperformance and can hold their expensive multiples for longer. Kantrowitz is not too concerned about higher bond yields but notes that they can be a problem at some point. He thinks that yields would need to reach 4.25% to show up in the broader market.\n\nRegarding earnings revisions, Kantrowitz believes that revisions coming down have not overdone it and that it's normal to see estimates from the sell-side start out high and then trickle down throughout the year. He expects to see more downward earnings revisions but notes that large-cap stocks have held up far better in terms of earnings, which is why they continue to outperform.\n\nTom Lee, Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors discussed the markets and his recent observations. Lee believes that the market's resilience is due to the large amount of cash on the sidelines. He thinks that investors have been under-invested in stocks and that the market is becoming less dependent on macro data.\n\nLee pointed out that the market has been able to shrug off negative news and that the recent PPI and CPI reports were not enough to knock the market off track. He believes that the Fed will continue to be dovish, especially since inflation is still tracking towards the 2% target. Lee also thinks that the election, which is becoming less of a coin toss, is also contributing to the market's conviction.\n\nRegarding the impact of the election on the market, Lee believes that markets like visibility, but they also need to like what they see on the other side of the election. He thinks that whether Trump or Harris wins, stocks will do well next year, but there will be differences in sector and asset class performance depending on who wins.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile some may be concerned about the market's expensive valuation, others see it as a sign of strength and resilience, with that in context, let’s take a look at the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 30 largest companies by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to companies with positive TTM net income and 10-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 10-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income. Our list is sorted in ascending order of the 10-year net income growth rates.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Internet of Things (IoT) Stocks to Buy.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other IoT stocks.\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a vast network connecting physical objects to the internet. Industries are embracing IoT technologies for applications like smart manufacturing and supply chain management. Enterprise IoT spending is expected to slow down in the second half of this year due to economic concerns which will affect corporate spending in general. However, corporate spending on IoT will rebound in 2025. The global market for IoT is expected to grow at a rate of 24.3% annually between 2024 and 2032. In 2032, it is expected to reach a value of $4,062.34 billion.\n\nThe rise of smart homes, buildings, and manufacturing, along with advancements in smart infrastructure, is driving significant growth in the IoT market. Moreover, smart city initiatives are becoming increasingly prevalent due to the growing population and expansion of cities. Consumers are adopting smart city solutions, including smart utility meters, transportation, waste management, grids, and air quality controllers.\n\nIoT adoption is also growing rapidly in other sectors, particularly healthcare. The global IoT in healthcare market is projected to expand significantly and reach $952.3 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18%. IoT is a major force behind healthcare's digital transformation, revolutionizing the way medical data is collected, analyzed, and used. This is leading to better patient care, greater operational efficiencies, and innovative treatments.\n\nIoT is also seeing increased adoption in warehouse management. The global IoT warehouse management market is projected to grow from $14.8 billion in 2023 to $57.2 billion by 2033, reflecting a CAGR of 14.5% over the next decade. This growth is driven by the need for better inventory management, increased automation, and improved operational efficiency in logistics and supply chain operations.\n\nRead Also: 10 Best Internet Content Stocks to Buy\n\nIn terms of market segmentation by technologies, WiFi, Bluetooth, and cellular IoT make up 80% of the global IoT market.

Incorporating AI into IoT devices within industries offers numerous benefits, including improved operational efficiency, safety, and decision-making. It plays an important role in predictive maintenance and supply chain management.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe future of IoT looks promising. Businesses and investors can expect significant returns as the technology continues to evolve. Keeping this context in mind, let’s take a look at the best IoT stocks to buy now.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of the 10 best IoT stocks to buy, we focused on companies that offer IoT solutions or products, including firms involved in manufacturing IoT devices and hardware. The companies have been shortlisted based on hedge fund sentiment, sourced from our database of over 900 hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the tech giant formerly known as Facebook, has been taking significant steps to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to improve its social media platforms. The company's recent introduction of AI-powered image editing tools and new chat stickers on Instagram is a prime example of this strategy.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has demonstrated impressive financial performance over the past decade, with a compound annual revenue growth rate of 29.7%. As the global digital ad market is going to expand significantly, reaching over $1 trillion by 2030, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has maintained an average operating margin of 34.8% in the past five years. These strong financials are fueled by cost-cutting measures and a focus on operational efficiency.\n\nMeta's substantial cash reserves of $58.1 billion and free cash flow generation of $10.9 billion reported during the most recent quarter enable it to invest aggressively in AI initiatives.

        "title": "Meet the Unstoppable Growth Stock That Could Join Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft in the $3 Trillion Club by 2030.",
        "content": "There's been a noteworthy shift over the past couple of decades that has seen technology companies ascend the ranks of the world's most valuable companies. Twenty years ago, industrial and energy bellwethers General Electric and ExxonMobil reigned supreme when measured by market cap, valued at $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively. Now, just two decades later, some of the best-known names in technology are tops.\n\nLeading the charge are three of the most familiar companies in the world today. All are leaders in the field of technology and need no introduction. Apple currently tops the list at $3.5 trillion, with its stock recently hitting new all-time highs. Nvidia also notched a new record high this week, moving ahead of Microsoft, as the two now boast market values of $3.4 trillion and $3 trillion, respectively.\n\nWith a market cap of $1.4 trillion, it might seem presumptuous to suggest that Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has all the makings of a $3 trillion club member. However, the stock has been on a roll, gaining 80% over the past year and 694% over the past 10 years (as of this writing), and its winning streak appears poised to continue.\n\nThe consistent growth of the company's social media platform, ongoing strength in digital advertising, and brilliant strategy for leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) should combine to help Meta take its place in this exclusive society. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA rebound for the ages\n\nThere's no denying that Meta Platforms suffered during the economic slump. Yet the mark of a resilient business is the ability to bounce back, and the evidence of that rebound is undeniable. In the second quarter, Meta delivered revenue that rose 22% year over year to $39 billion, fueling diluted earnings per share (EPS) that surged 73% to $5.16.\n\nFueling its success is the company's reliable user growth, as those who stopped by one of Meta's family of social media platforms -- which includes Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Messenger, and WhatsApp -- increased 7% year over year to 3.27 billion.\n\nThese billions of daily users form the captive audience for its digital advertising, an industry that rebounded sharply since the economic downturn. Meta is part of a duopoly in the online marketing space. Alphabet's Google captured an estimated 39% of the worldwide digital advertising market, with Meta taking up the second spot with 18%, according to data compiled by business intelligence platform Statista.\n\nIts online marketing is inextricably woven into the fabric of its social media empire, helping drive Meta's ongoing success.\n\nStory continues\n\nMultiple ways to win\n\nGlobal advertising is expected to increase by roughly 8% and reach more than $1 trillion this year, according to ad industry researcher WARC Media. Social media is forecasted to be the fastest-growing segment in digital advertising, growing to 22% of total ad spending, according to the data. Meta figures prominently in the report, which says Meta is \"on course to record oversized gains in the coming months.\" As one of the biggest players in the adtech industry, Meta will benefit from the ongoing rebound.\n\nAdvertising aside, Meta has made a number of strategically important moves to profit from the accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). With billions of daily social media visitors, the company mined its vast treasure trove of data to create a suite of top-tier language models, which form the foundation for generative AI.\n\nThe fruit of those labors is LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI), the AI system that fuels its Meta AI chatbot. The latest version -- LLaMA 3 -- is \"one of the world's leading AI assistants,\" according to the company. By making LLaMA open source, Meta is hoping to boost adoption, which will lead to even more data to leverage. While Meta AI is free to individual users, the company charges enterprises and cloud infrastructure providers, which peddle it on their cloud platforms.\n\nWhile AI makes all the headlines, there are other potential ways for Meta to win. The company has invested heavily in Meta's Reality Labs, which housed its Oculus virtual reality (VR) business, Quest VR headsets, and its ambitions for the metaverse. While these are little more than sidelines at this point, CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes these will be key to Meta's future growth and, eventually, its bottom line.\n\nWith the trifecta of a recovery in digital advertising, the opportunity represented by generative AI, and its other initiatives, it isn't hard to envision a path for Meta Platforms to make its way into the $3 trillion club.\n\nThe path to $3 trillion\n\nMeta has a market cap of roughly $1.46 trillion (as of market close on Oct. 17), so it will take stock price gains of roughly 105% to increase its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Meta is expected to generate revenue of $161.9 billion in 2024, giving the stock a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 9. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Meta would need revenue of roughly $332 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.\n\nWall Street is currently forecasting growth of nearly 14% annually over the coming five years for Meta. If the company achieves that target, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2030. It's worth noting that Meta has grown its annual revenue by more than 900% over the past decade, so those estimates could well be conservative.\n\nFurthermore, at 29 times earnings, Meta is selling for a discount compared to a multiple of 30 for the S&P 500 -- yet boasts stock price gains of 694% over the past 10 years, far exceeding the 214% increase for the S&P 500. That helps illustrate why Meta Platforms is worth every penny, particularly as it pursues multiple paths to success.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks owned by hedge funds.\n\nWall Street stocks surged this month after the Federal Reserve released minutes of its September meeting, which resulted in the first interest rate cuts in over four years. The details disclosed a ‘substantial majority’ of central bankers backing the 0.5 percentage-point cut, raising optimism among investors for further cuts ahead.\n\nThe broader market hit record highs on October 11, driven by several financial stocks reporting stronger-than-expected results during the recently concluded quarter. Another factor encouraging investors has been the downturn in US inflation, which fell to 2.4% in September and is inching toward the Federal Reserve’s goal of a two percent annual rate. This has raised hopes of a quarter-point cut in the central bank’s next meeting in November.\n\nHowever, some analysts warn against diving into stocks after interest rate cuts, citing uncertainty around the upcoming presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider in early September discussed historic patterns in US markets towards the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth.\n\nShe noted how the market performs well between June and August due to thinner volumes when traders are on vacation, while volatility picks up with an uptick in activity after they return to their desks in September. However, during the election year, this volatility peaks around mid-October, instead of September, according to Young Thomas.\n\nFundstrat Global Advisors’ co-founder, Tom Lee, has also cautioned investors against election-related uncertainty. Here is what he stated in an interview with CNBC late last month:\n\nThis Fed cut cycle I think is setting the stage for markets to be really strong over the next one month or next three months. But, what the stocks do between now and let’s say election day, I think is still a lot of uncertainty. And that’s the reason why I’m a little hesitant for investors to dive in.\n\nEarlier that month in the weeks leading to the interest rate cuts, Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, forecasted a 7-10% dip between September and October amid nervousness around the presidential elections. However, Lee urged investors to ‘buy the dip’, indicating that he sees the likely fall as an opportunity to buy stocks while they trade for a lower value.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdam Turnquist from LPL Financial also anticipates seasonal volatility in the weeks ahead but reiterated what Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes. Turnquist advises investors not to readjust their existing portfolios because seasonal volatility has short-term effects and is difficult to forecast.\n\nWith that said, let’s now shift focus to hedge fund sentiment on the stock market and discuss some of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the largest technology companies in the world. It operates several popular social media platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Threads. An estimated 3.2 billion people use one of META’s applications every day.\n\nThe company’s ability to generate handsome advertisement revenue despite the global economic slowdown has been one of the primary drivers behind its growth. It had another impressive quarter during Q2 2024, in which revenue expanded 22% year-over-year to reach $39.1 billion. Meta’s Family of Apps generated $38.1 billion of the overall revenue, fueled by strong performances in online commercial verticals and gaming. Earnings for the quarter were posted at $13.5 billion, or $5.16 per share, beating analysts’ EPS expectations of $4.72 per share.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s share price has surged 25% since the announcement of Q2 results on July 31. Investors are also buoyant about the company’s investments in artificial intelligence, which has resulted in successful launches of new products like the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses and Meta Quest 3, whose demand has outpaced the tech giant’s expectations.\n\nWall Street analysts agree on the stock’s Strong Buy rating. Hedge fund sentiment also remains strong, given the company’s positive future outlook. According to Insider Monkey, 219 hedge funds had investments in META as of Q2 2024, making it one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now.\n\nHowever, some aspects can affect META’s short-term financials. The company plans to incur an additional $40 billion in capital expenditure this year, which will likely put pressure on its share price. Moreover, management expects a slowdown in Reel impressions and advertisements on its social media platforms in Q3, as the surge of China-based advertisers on its social media apps which was witnessed last year is unlikely this time around.\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Tech Stocks According to Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other promising tech stocks.\n\nNASDAQ is Poised for Long-Term Returns\n\nBig tech is expected to outperform in the coming months. On October 2, Ari Wald, Oppenheimer's Head of Technical Analysis, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis and explain why investors must consider high-growth companies.\n\nWald highlights that market breadth is expected to remain high supporting extended highs throughout the end of 2024. In addition to that, he expects the bull cycle to remain intact and believes the trend will continue in 2025. During the late summer, the market saw a change in the high beta versus low volatility ratio stocks. It was seen that high-beta stocks could not keep up with high dividend-paying and lower-volatility names.\n\nGiven the rotational nature of the market, Wald expects higher beta names to make a strong comeback and reclaim their leadership position. Wald suggests that investors should consider investing in higher growth companies, as the Nasdaq and Russel 100 are expected to lead again. Trends show that the mag seven is growing and climbing, as the market conditions continue to settle.\n\nViewing Tech Stocks on Valuations Alone is Wrong, Strategist Says\n\nTechnology stocks have more room to run. On October 14, Malcolm Ethridge, Capital Area Planning Group managing partner, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the technology market outlook and revealed his favorite picks.\n\nEthridge suggests that judging stocks based on their valuations alone is a big mistake, especially in the current market cycle which is heavily influenced by the AI boom. Looking at the broader perspective, he believes there are a lot of positive opportunities among the magnificent seven and outside of it.\n\nHe adds that companies among the mega tech have been pouring billions into generating large language models and the likes of it. He also suggests that most of this technology is yet to be understood and therefore the true value we can derive from these technologies is yet to come. These companies also have a lot of intrinsic value and there is more to be realized soon.\n\nNow that we have studied the technology market outlook, let's take a look at the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. You can also read our piece on the most promising AI stocks according to analysts.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the most promising technology stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through multiple ETFs, our own rankings, and similar rankings on the internet. We then ranked the most promising tech stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment as of Q2 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Over the past few months, the company has launched AI tools and features and in September launched its debut AR glasses, Orion. On the same day, the company revealed its most affordable mixed-reality headset, Meta Quest 36.\n\nOn the AI front, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is making strides to become the best recommendation technology company through its social media platforms. On October 4, the company launched new features, helping young adults explore their interests and find new people easily. In addition to that, the company also released, \"Imagine Yourself,\" an AI tool that users can now access in their feeds and stories.\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has a sustainable business model and owns superior technology, making it difficult for competitors to take precedence. Its platforms are deeply integrated into the lives of users and the inclusion of AI and tech inventions make it a powerful force.\n\nOverall META ranks 2nd on our list of the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz chief economic advisor, talked about the possibility of a soft landing vs no landing during a program on CNBC. When asked what would it take for the market to have a no-landing scenario, the analyst said:\n\n“I think we need the productivity enhancers from A.I., from life sciences to come earlier, we need to continue to have positive shocks to our labor force. And if we get those two things, you can get the bigger but not hotter economy which actually would be perfect for almost everything you can think of, from households to companies to financial markets.”\n\nThe analyst does not rule out the possibility of a recession, however.\n\n“My probability of a soft landing is 55%, and a recession is 30%. A soft landing is the most likely scenario, but it’s not dominant. Why isn’t it dominant? Because we have weakness in the household sector, particularly on the lower-income side, and the Fed has been unpredictable. Just think, Morgan—at the end of July, the Fed didn’t cut rates because everything seemed fine. By the next meeting in mid-September, it cut 50 basis points. And now it’s talking about cautious cuts. So, the Fed needs to be careful.”\n\nFor this article we picked 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment.

Analysts Say Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) Among Top Beneficiaries of AI Data Center Spend\n\nphotostock77 / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 61\n\nCiti Research predicts that capital expenditures for data centers among the leading four cloud companies will surge by 40% year over year, offering a boost to data center interconnect (DCI) providers. The major players in this segment include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Citi anticipates that these firms will ramp up their data center investments by 40% to 50% in 2025.\n\nCiti analysts, led by Atif Malik, noted in an investor report that “we estimate that the AI networking opportunity is expanding beyond the server connection within a data center to AI platforms connecting multiple data centers through DCI.”\n\nCiti named Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) as one of the beneficiaries of this spending.\n\nMalik emphasized the challenges of containing AI model clusters within a single data center as their size approaches 300,000 GPUs by 2025, stating that “containing models in one data center unit will not be sustainable in the long term amid constraints related to power, regulations, among others.” Consequently, hyperscalers are increasingly adopting and planning to expand the use of a multi-data center training approach.\n\nCiti highlighted that Google has utilized this multi-data center strategy for training its Gemini 1 Ultra, and that OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic are also embracing this model. As a result of increased DCI spending, Citi projects that Arista’s revenue could grow by up to 25% year over year in 2025, primarily driven by Ethernet switching in AI networks.\n\nCisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) earlier this year announced a major restructuring plan that includes a 7% reduction in workforce and an estimated $1 billion in pre-tax cost savings. Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)’s legacy hardware businesses have been stagnating, with average revenue growth lingering at just 1.6%. Job cuts and cost savings will allow Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) to allocate capital to high-growth areas like AI and Cloud networking.\n\nThe expected cost savings, which will cut about 2.4% of total operating expenses, could boost Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) operating margins by more than 220 basis points in FY25. Although the company is ramping up its AI efforts, it only expects AI to bring in around $1 billion in revenue next year, less than 2% of the total. So, while AI isn’t likely to be a game-changer for Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) just yet, the focus on growth markets might accelerate overall revenue in the future.\n\nParnassus Value Equity Fund stated the following regarding Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“During the second quarter, the Fund’s overweight position in the Information Technology sector decreased slightly as we sold our position in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) and used most of the proceeds to buy Broadcom, a leading semiconductor company and provider of custom silicon products. Both stocks provide similar exposure to networking technology, but we believe Broadcom offers more upside from AI infrastructure spend and defensiveness due to its software assets.”\n\nOverall, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. While we acknowledge the potential of Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

That’s right. Whatever you want to call them, these big tech plays are demonstrating their staying power no matter what happens.”\n\nCramer said that the latest earnings season would be critical for the overall market and investor portfolios. He also pointed out the broadening of the rally, saying other groups besides the tech industry are also rebounding.\n\n“This rally is not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can work, too, in this market. There’s a lot of money going around, and we know there’s a lot of money coming into the market. The Fed is cutting rates, and friendly cash won’t be worth as much as it was. But the staying power of the Magnificent 7 is truly unbelievable.”\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 important stocks he’s talking about.

Facebook\n\nPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program expressed his bullish views on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), saying the company is using AI to make effective advertising products. He said while his charitable trust took some profits on Meta, he continues to be bullish on the stock.\n\n“His (Mark Zuckerberg) last conference call offered you a tale that said all ad campaigns will start on Instagram and Reels. Am I going to doubt this fella? No”\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its Q2 results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future.\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We are pleased to report that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\n\nWe would like to remind you that achieving these types of returns is never a straight path. From time to time, we might experience volatility — that’s simply part of the investment journey. In fact, wealth creation and volatility go hand in hand.

        "title": "Nvidia to win the race to $4 trillion market cap, experts say",
        "content": "Buy the dip.\n\nThat was the mindset around chip stocks this week as investors scooped up beaten-down shares, sending Nvidia to a record high. A strong outlook for Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) was enough to revive Wall Street’s enthusiasm for AI as growing confidence in the AI boom overshadowed chip supplier ASML’s sluggish forecast and reports of export caps of advanced AI chips to some Middle Eastern countries.\n\nNvidia closed the week above $138 per share, bringing its market value to $3.39 trillion. It’s now the world's second-largest company behind Apple. But that might not be for long. Experts I spoke with this past week say there’s growing confidence the chip giant will be the first Big Tech firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation.\n\n“There's no question about it,” Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, told me on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts. “The demand for GPU chips is strong, and you're seeing early adopters starting to get some ROI.”\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang fueled the stock’s rally earlier this month after describing demand for the new Blackwell chips as “insane.”\n\nEven amid the stock’s dramatic outperformance, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Tony Wang told me investors still “continuously underestimate” Nvidia’s growth potential. He sees “exceptional” demand for AI making it “definitely possible” that the chip giant crosses that $4 trillion threshold first.\n\nIn the coming weeks, earnings from fellow Magnificent Seven companies will give investors better insight into Nvidia’s market dominance. Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), which account for more than 40% of the chipmaker’s revenue, have all pledged to continue investing in AI.\n\nLast quarter, spending by Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft totaled more than $40 billion, while Amazon said spending in the second half of the year will likely surpass the $30 billion spent during the first half.\n\nBofA analyst Vivek Arya, who views Nvidia as a “generational opportunity,” cites capital expenditure commentary from top hyperscalers among the reasons that he sees Nvidia \"strengthening its position.\"\n\nArya lifted his price target on the chipmaker to $190 this week, implying a rally of nearly 40% from Friday’s closing price.\n\nArya and his team also cited Taiwan Semiconductor’s robust demand outlook as a positive. TSMC — a top supplier for Nvidia and other giants, including Apple — triggered a sector-wide rally after posting a more than 50% jump in net income for the third quarter and forecasting full-year revenue growth of nearly 30%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSafe to say, Big Tech's third quarter numbers will be a crucial test for Nvidia and key to the stock's momentum in the short term. Any disappointment in AI spending plans could lead to volatility for Nvidia and the broader chips market.\n\nBut if that happens, the sell-off may not last long. Niles Investment Management founder Dan Niles recently told me on Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid podcast he remains bullish on Nvidia’s long-term prospects.\n\n“You've got several more years of AI investment before you hit saturation or a more maturing AI landscape,” Niles said. “You'll see Nvidia's revenues double over the next several years, and I think you'll see the stock double over the next several years.”\n\nNvidia shares have rallied 21% so far this month, bringing its gains to 179% year to date.

Also against company policy is transferring vouchers from the original employee.\n\nAccording to CNN, Meta supplies food vouchers for employees at offices without food services—breakfast ($20) as well as lunch and dinner ($25)—so they can have meals delivered at work, where the hours can be brutal and down time scant. This was the case at the Los Angeles office.\n\nBut, according to an internal investigation, Meta learned that some used the vouchers to have food delivered at home or to buy non-food items, a source told CNN. The news of the firings was first reported by Financial Times.\n\nBusiness Insider reports that Meta employees usually earn between $100,000 and $400,000.\n\nThe news of the firings came as the company began major layoffs across all of its platforms including Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Reality Labs.\n\n“Today, a few teams at Meta are making changes to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy,” Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said in a statement. “This includes moving some teams to different locations and moving some employees to different roles. In situations like this when a role is eliminated, we work hard to find other opportunities for impacted employees.”\n\nMore layoffs are coming down at Meta, with multiple departments reportedly impacted: https://t.co/lFK7HqaSK5pic.twitter.com/tuO1Mv7AXG\n\n— chartr\n\n(@chartrdaily) October 17, 2024\n\nIt is unclear if the terminated employees will receive severance pay.\n\nRELATED CONTENT: Meta Axes News Tab On Facebook In U.S., Faces Backlash As Users Express Concerns Over Access To Information\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Katie Paul\n\nNEW YORK - Facebook owner Meta said on Friday it was releasing a batch of new AI models from its research division, including a \"Self-Taught Evaluator\" that may offer a path toward less human involvement in the AI development process.\n\nThe release follows Meta's introduction of the tool in an August paper, which detailed how it relies upon the same \"chain of thought\" technique used by OpenAI's recently released o1 models to get it to make reliable judgments about models' responses.\n\nThat technique involves breaking down complex problems into smaller logical steps and appears to improve the accuracy of responses on challenging problems in subjects like science, coding and math.\n\nMeta's researchers used entirely AI-generated data to train the evaluator model, eliminating human input at that stage as well.\n\nThe ability to use AI to evaluate AI reliably offers a glimpse at a possible pathway toward building autonomous AI agents that can learn from their own mistakes, two of the Meta researchers behind the project told Reuters.\n\nMany in the AI field envision such agents as digital assistants intelligent enough to carry out a vast array of tasks without human intervention.\n\nSelf-improving models could cut out the need for an often expensive and inefficient process used today called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, which requires input from human annotators who must have specialized expertise to label data accurately and verify that answers to complex math and writing queries are correct.\n\n\"We hope, as AI becomes more and more super-human, that it will get better and better at checking its work, so that it will actually be better than the average human,\" said Jason Weston, one of the researchers.\n\n\"The idea of being self-taught and able to self-evaluate is basically crucial to the idea of getting to this sort of super-human level of AI,\" he said.\n\nOther companies including Google and Anthropic have also published research on the concept of RLAIF, or Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback. Unlike Meta, however, those companies tend not to release their models for public use.\n\nOther AI tools released by Meta on Friday included an update to the company's image-identification Segment Anything model, a tool that speeds up LLM response generation times and datasets that can be used to aid the discovery of new inorganic materials.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Alistair Bell)",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Jefferies analysts upgraded their price target for AppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) from $108 to $175 in a note Friday, citing optimistic trends in mobile gaming ad spending revealed in their latest survey.\n\nThe survey, representing over $1.2 billion in app install spending, reportedly suggests that major players like APP, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are expected to gain market share in 2025, while Unity (U) may lose ground.\n\nIn their note, Jefferies analysts said the initial outlook for 2025 app install spending indicates a significant acceleration to 6.7% growth.\n\nWhile the survey forecasts a modest 2.7% growth for 2024, 2025 is projected to benefit from increased spending on new game launches and successful existing titles.\n\n\"We see this initial view into 2025 as optimistic for the ad networks,\" stated Jefferies. The analysts also highlighted that ad spending is expected to grow by 3.2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nMoreover, Jefferies reported that APP was the largest share gainer in 2024 and is anticipated to continue this momentum into 2025.\n\n\"APP's user quality and ability to scale spend\" were underscored as key advantages.\n\nThe analysts pointed out that the rising cost per install (CPI) on platforms like YouTube and Meta, particularly due to holiday and political spending, could lead to a shift in shares toward mobile-game-specific networks.\n\nDespite pressures on effective cost per thousand impressions (eCPMs), Jefferies forecasts that the overall mobile game ad revenue will experience growth in 2025.\n\n\"Our survey suggests that APP should be able to sustain 20-30% Software Platform revenue growth for at least the next two years,\" the note added.\n\nWith this outlook, Jefferies sees a potential bull case price target of $246 for APP, driven by incremental ad budgets from e-commerce.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJefferies lifts AppLovin stock target after positive AdTech survey\n\nMorocco stocks lower at close of trade; Moroccan All Shares down 0.32%\n\nActivist Jana owns Lamb Weston stake, pushing for possible sale\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Good Stocks To Buy Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other good stocks to buy right now.\n\nStocks to Perform Well in 2025\n\nOn October 14, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss the latest market trends and share his expectations.\n\nIn a previous interview, Lee hinted that a period of market volatility is expected, as 2024 heads for a soft landing. However, in this interview, Lee revealed that he had underestimated the market and that it had been extremely resilient and confident, contrary to what he believed earlier. He adds that this indicates the decreasing importance of macroeconomic data to investors.\n\nLee also adds that for the past two years, investors have been expecting a recession and have held back. Henceforth, with all this cash on the sidelines, investors have been more than willing to invest. October so far has been a great month for the market, despite CPI data being higher than expectations.\n\nLee emphasizes the need for the Fed to be more supportive as concerns over the job market rise and the upcoming election draws closer. He suggests that despite the election results he expects stocks to perform well in 2025.\n\nThe Fed Should Go Slower, Strategist Says\n\nThe market rose to an all-time intraday earlier today and the Fed governor stressed the need for caution amid decreasing interest rates. On October 15, Warren Pies, from 3Fourteen, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss his market thesis for the rest of the year.\n\nPies suggests that rates are the biggest risk to the market at the moment, especially if drastic measures are introduced. He further adds that if the Fed decides to bring the rate down to 3% immediately, the long-term market outlook could be extremely volatile.\n\nHe explained that the concern is more about the rate of change and not the absolute level the Fed is trying to achieve. Pies adds that the market still has a lot of room to run before another drastic cut is implemented. He emphasized that the Fed must operate at a pace the market can digest. He also suggested that the market has started to reaccelerate, hinting that a soft landing is more likely.\n\nNow that we have studied the market outlook up until the end of 2024, let's take a look at some of the good stocks to buy right now.\n\nOur methodology\n\nWe used a consensus-based approach and sifted through financial media reports to first compile a list of good stocks to buy right now. We then shortlisted and ranked these stocks by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is a technology conglomerate and is the company behind Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company has a large user base of over 3.27 billion daily active users across all its platforms.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is a good stock to buy right now and we say that because of its advanced technological inventions. Over the past few months, the company has ventured into AI and augmented reality, having launched its debut AR glasses, Orion, in September. On the same day, the company released its most affordable mixed-reality headset, Meta Quest 36.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is pouring money into AI to become the best recommendation technology company.  To align with this goal, the company recently launched new features, helping young adults explore their interests and find new people easily.\n\nOn September 10, Gil Luria, D.A. Davidson senior software analyst, appeared on CNBC where he named META as a top pick for AI and tech. Luria shares that the mega-cap tech stocks are expected to benefit from the AI boom, and while most of them are getting credit for it, META is not being talked about enough. He adds that META is the only company making significant investments in open platforms, concluding, that the stock is well-positioned to exploit the next two big waves of computing.\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has a sustainable business model and owns crucial technology, making it difficult for competitors to take precedence. Its platforms are deeply integrated into the lives of users and the inclusion of AI and tech inventions makes it a powerful force.\n\nOverall META ranks 1st among the 10 good stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – October 18, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights FTAI Aviation FTAI, Vistra Energy VST, Nvidia NVDA, Vertiv Holdings VRT and Facebook-parent Meta Platforms META.\n\nBull Market Turns Two: 5 Stocks Turn $25K into $207,212\n\nThis past weekend, the latest bull market celebrated its 2nd birthday, providing us with another good illustration to show how we can go about constructing a diversified portfolio of winning stocks.\n\nOne of the best ways to build wealth over time is to invest in high-quality businesses and allow the magic of compounding to drive the performance of our portfolio.\n\nContrary to popular belief, it doesn't take a lot of money to get started and gains can really add up very quickly.\n\nBuilding Out a Winning Portfolio\n\nI'm a big fan of having a smaller and more concentrated portfolio. If we try to include 40-50 stocks, it's nearly impossible to outperform because our big winners aren't going to be a large enough percentage of our portfolio.\n\nWhy do we invest in individual stocks? We do it because we want to invest in the best companies and outperform the market.\n\nIn our example, we have 5 stocks in a relatively diversified portfolio. These include FTAI Aviation, Vistra Energy, Nvidia, Vertiv Holdings and Facebook-parent Meta Platforms.\n\nIt's a bit overweight technology, which I think has been warranted in this environment given the bullish artificial intelligence theme. The returns listed below are from the previous bull market bottom in mid-October of 2022 to the 2-year mark from that date. We assume a $25,000 total investment or just $5,000 invested equally in this portfolio of stocks.\n\nAnd we can see that over that time period, this $25,000 investment grew to an incredible $212,787, widely outperforming the S&P 500 over the same timeframe. A $25,000 investment in the S&P 500 grew 62% to just over $40,500, which is still a great return over just two years. Keep in mind that these results shown are without the use of leverage or margin.\n\nConstructing a well-diversified portfolio doesn't need to be overly complicated or include too many positions. There is such a thing as over-diversification. In my opinion, simple is better when it comes to investing and in life in general. This is a long-term game that requires a long-term mindset to succeed.\n\nThis example should serve as an important reminder that you don't need to trade overly speculative positions to achieve an incredible rate of return.\n\nIdentifying Stocks with the Best Profit Potential\n\nAt any given time, there could be hundreds or even thousands of stocks on a technical buy signal. One of the ways we further narrow down our list of stocks is through the Zacks Rank system.\n\nStory continues\n\nCorporate earnings are one of the main drivers of stock market activity over time. That's why earnings expectations and estimates are so important. And it's the change in earnings estimates (called earnings estimate revisions) that our research has shown to be the most powerful force impacting stock prices.\n\nOnce we've identified and confirmed a stock's trend, the Zacks Rank systems help us narrow down the investment universe to stocks that are experiencing positive earnings estimate revisions. We then use a combination of fundamental and technical analysis to identify stocks primed for explosive gains.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): ‘How Can You Have A Bull Birthday Party Without Inviting Meta?’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Best Performers List: 12 Stocks Cramer is Talking About.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other best performers on Jim Cramer's list.\n\nOn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer took a moment to celebrate the two-year anniversary of the current bull market. He mentioned that this particular bull market has been quiet and gentle, which he attributes to the unusual circumstances surrounding its rise. “The whole first year of this bull’s life was an anomaly. That’s because the Fed was furiously tightening and the market went up anyway,” Cramer explained.\n\nHe emphasized that for the past two years, opportunities have been evident, stating, “Every night I say there’s always a bull market somewhere, and for the last two years, well, it’s been right in front of you.”\n\nCramer then went on to discuss the lead performing stocks and ended the segment, saying:\n\n“The bottom line, if you're going to buy these stocks, I’d go first with Nvidia, then with Broadcom, and finally Fair Isaac, if only because we need something that's not connected to the data center, even as we know, it will remain a strong story for the ages.”\n\nCramer also advised investors to shift their focus away from the consumer price index (CPI) report, suggesting that its significance has diminished since the Federal Reserve began cutting rates.\n\n“We had to be concerned about this stuff when the Fed was on the warpath, either raising rates or leaving them higher for longer. Now, though, the Fed is your friend, so I wouldn't obsess about the details.”\n\nHe did emphasize, however, that the monthly labor report remains important in the current climate. He remarked on the tendency for many to become “Fed watchers,” suggesting that this reliance on government data can detract from the deeper analysis of individual companies. Cramer referenced Austan D. Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed, who advised against an overemphasis on CPI data, as the Fed is unlikely to base decisions on it. Cramer explained:\n\n“When the Fed's raising rates in order to stamp out inflation, it can be very important. When we're in a rate hike cycle, you're trying to figure out when that's going to end. But we're not in that kind of cycle anymore. We're in a rate cutting cycle.”\n\nCramer explained that last month the Fed implemented a double rate cut, setting a downward trend that is expected to continue. He added:\n\n“Sure, if we had a huge spike in the CPI this morning, then maybe the Fed would change its stance. But that would have to be an extreme reading. And there's nothing extreme about today's 2.4% inflation number, just a tick above the expected 2.3, still down from the 2.5% reading from the prior month.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer concluded with a strong reminder about the nature of investing. “Forget the macro, people. It’s not that meaningful when the Fed’s cutting rates. And keep your eyes on the prize: Earnings,” he urged. Ultimately, he reinforced that earnings dictate stock prices in the long run, and that’s where the focus should be for those looking to make money in the market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks with the biggest gains over the past 2 years that were mentioned by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 10. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nCramer mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in his list of stocks with the biggest gains. He emphasized Mark Zuckerberg's assertion that future ad campaigns will focus on Instagram and Reels and said:\n\n“Honestly, how can you have a bull birthday party without inviting Meta, without inviting Mark Zuckerberg? I would never think of it. His last conference call told you a tale that made it sound like all ad campaigns will soon start on Instagram and reels. Am I going to doubt this fella? No. He has the AI to design the most effective targeted ads and you don't need to hire an advertising agency. Much better return on investment.”\n\nIt is a leading technology company that focuses on creating products designed to facilitate connections and sharing among users through a variety of devices, including mobile phones, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables.\n\nThe financial performance of Meta (NASDAQ:META) has been remarkable over the years, largely driven by the ongoing shift toward digital advertising. As the global digital advertising market is expected to expand from $366 billion in 2022 to over $1 trillion by 2030, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth.\n\nWith nearly 3.3 billion daily active users across its platforms, the company generates significant advertising revenue. In its most recent quarterly report, Meta (NASDAQ:META) recorded an impressive $38.3 billion in ad revenue and a 22% increase in overall revenue compared to the previous year. The growth is particularly noteworthy given the scale of the company, which points to a strong demand for its advertising capabilities.\n\nOverall META ranks 1st on Jim Cramer's list of best performing stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Continues Her Stock-Buying Bonanza; Here Are 6 Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, is doggedly working toward rallying votes for the GOP on Election Day, but she's certainly not losing sight of her investments. Greene continues to make additions to her portfolio as she has steadfastly done over the past few months.\n\nConsistent with her previous rounds of buying activity, Greene recently added to her artificial intelligence (AI) exposure, picking up shares of Applied Materials(NASDAQ: AMAT), ASML(NASDAQ: ASML), DellTechnologies(NYSE: DELL), LamResearch(NASDAQ: LRCX), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). But it wasn't only AI stocks that caught her attention. Greene also clicked the buy button on CostcoWholesale(NASDAQ: COST). Although the exact amounts that Greene invested in each of the stocks is not clear, her regulatory filing acknowledges that each transaction on Oct. 4 was valued between $1,001 and $15,000.\n\nMore of the same AI names -- at lower prices\n\nTaking even a cursory glance at Greene's trading history, investors will find that the representative from the Peach State often builds positions over time, practicing a dollar-cost averaging approach. In July, for example, Greene bought shares of both semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials and Dell, a stalwart in building computers and data centers. On the day that Greene bought Applied Materials and Dell in July, they closed at $219.65 and $125.85, respectively, and it's likely she lowered the average price she paid for them. On Oct. 4, Applied Materials closed at $201.97, while Dell ended the trading session at $120.42.\n\nSimilarly, Greene increased her position in semiconductor powerhouse ASML during her latest buying round. On June 24, when Greene first bought ASML stock, shares ended the day at $1,002.01, having climbed about 37% since the start of the year. The latest purchase, however, was considerably less expensive. Shares of the semiconductor equipment maker have suffered recently as analysts have espoused bearish stances of ASML stock. This helped Greene to lower her average price paid for the stock as she picked up shares on a day when the stock ended the trading session at $833.\n\nGreene isn't afraid of stocks that aren't hanging on the discount rack\n\nNot every repeat purchase for Greene during this latest buying round required a stock to be at a lower price. Initially, Greene gained exposure to Lam Research, which provides wafer fabrication equipment and services to semiconductor manufacturers, on Sept. 20, when shares closed at $77.32 (adjusted for the recent stock split). On Oct. 4, shares of Lam Research closed at $81.54.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike Lam Research, Greene paid a higher price for Costco stock in October than when she first bought shares of the membership warehouse company. When Greene first invested in Costco on June 24, shares closed at $848.16, yet when she bought shares on Oct. 4, they ended the trading session at $883.11. While Greene paid more for Costco stock, many analysts believe that the stock has additional room to run. Oppenheimer and Evercore ISI, for example, have price targets of $980 and $990, respectively.\n\nA new name added to the portfolio\n\nIn addition to growing established positions, Greene bought Meta stock for the first time earlier this month. Expanding Greene's AI exposure beyond semiconductor stocks, Meta is at the forefront of AI due to its diverse offerings such as its large language model, Llama, which Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang contends \"has profoundly impacted the advancement of state-of-the-art AI.\" Meta also offers content creators a valuable tool with its recently released generative AI product, Movie Gen.\n\nIs now a good time to pick these stocks up for yourself?\n\nFor those of us outside the Beltway who are interested in AI stocks, all of Greene's recent purchases are compelling options that are well worth deeper investigation. Investors who are keen on finding stocks in the bargain bin will find ASML appealing right now as shares are trading at 31.4 times operating cash flow -- admittedly, a little pricey but a discount nonetheless considering their five-year average cash flow multiple of 38.2.\n\nOn the other hand, investors looking to generate passive income from their AI investments will want to consider Lam Research and Dell, which offer forward yields of 1.2% and 1.4%, respectively.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ASML wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Just weeks before the U.S. presidential election, TikTok approved advertisements that contained election disinformation even though it has a ban on political ads, according to a report published Thursday by the nonprofit Global Witness.\n\nThe technology and environmental watchdog group submitted ads that it designed to test how well systems at social media companies work in detecting different types of election misinformation.\n\nThe group, which did a similar investigation two years ago, did find that the companies — especially Facebook — have improved their content-moderation systems since then.\n\nBut it called out TikTok for approving four of the eight ads submitted for review that contained falsehoods about the election. That's despite the platform's ban on all political ads in place since 2019.\n\nThe ads never appeared on TikTok because Global Witness pulled them before they went online.\n\n“Four ads were incorrectly approved during the first stage of moderation, but did not run on our platform,\" TikTok spokesman Ben Rathe said. \"We do not allow political advertising and will continue to enforce this policy on an ongoing basis.”\n\nFacebook, which is owned by Meta Platforms Inc., “did much better” and approved just one of the eight submitted ads, according to the report.\n\nIn a statement, Meta said while “this report is extremely limited in scope and as a result not reflective of how we enforce our policies at scale, we nonetheless are continually evaluating and improving our enforcement efforts.”\n\nGoogle’s YouTube did the best, Global Witness said, approving four ads but not letting any publish. It asked for more identification from the Global Witness testers before it would publish them and “paused” their account when they didn’t. However, the report said it is not clear whether the ads would have gone through had Global Witness provided the required identification.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a message for comment.\n\nCompanies nearly always have stricter policies for paid ads than they do for regular posts from users. The ads submitted by Global Witness included outright false claims about the election — such as stating that Americans can vote online — as well as false information designed to suppress voting, like claims that voters must pass an English test before casting a ballot. Other fake ads encouraged violence or threatened electoral workers and processes.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Tech giant Meta reportedly fired roughly two dozen staffers based in Los Angeles for abusing the company's $25 meal vouchers to purchase non-food household items.\n\nThe Financial Times reported that Meta fired the workers last week after the company discovered that the workers were abusing its food credit system by using the funds to buy other household items, ranging from acne pads and wine glasses to laundry detergent.\n\nAccording to the report, Meta staff are given daily allowances of $20 for breakfast, $25 for lunch and another $25 for dinner — similar perks to what other large tech companies offer workers on top of their typical compensation packages.\n\nMeta employees who were fired had been abusing the system for a long period of time, in some cases pooling their money together or having meals sent home when the company intended for the credits to be used at the office, the FT reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. They added that workers who broke the food voucher rules only occasionally received a reprimand but weren't fired.\n\nMark Zuckerberg Passes Jeff Bezos As World's Second-richest Person Meta reportedly fired some employees who were abusing its food credit program.\n\nThe FT reviewed a post on the anonymous messaging platform Blind, in which a former Meta staffer, who indicated that they had a salary of about $400,000 at the tech giant, said they had used the $25 meal credits to purchase groceries like toothpaste and tea at the Rite Aid pharmacy.\n\nRead On The Fox Business App\n\nThe staffer said in the post that they admitted to misusing the credits when Meta's human resources department began investigating the practice, and that they were later fired unexpectedly, saying it was \"surreal,\" according to the report.\n\nFOX Business reached out to Meta for comment.\n\nMeta Ceo Admits Biden-harris Admin Pressured Company To Censor Americans Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced about 21,000 layoffs over the past two years.\n\nMeta — the parent company of Facebook and Instagram — has been on a restructuring push the last few years, and the FT reported that the tech giant is also in the midst of a fresh round of layoffs and changes to some of its teams.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in November 2022 that Meta was laying off more than 11,000 workers, and followed that up with another round of layoffs that affected 10,000 workers in the spring of 2023 during what he dubbed the \"Year of Efficiency.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Zuckerberg said the layoffs weren't due to the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) but rather because Meta, like other tech companies, had invested heavily during the COVID era e-commerce surge and \"overbuilt\" as a result.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I think across the economy, a lot of companies just kind of overbuilt, and then when things went back to pretty close to exactly what they were the way before... I think a lot of companies realized, 'Hey, we're kind of not in a good financial place because we overbuilt,'\" Zuckerberg told hosts Neal Freyman and Toby Howell on the \"Morning Brew Daily\" podcast.\n\nFOX Business' Daniella Genovese contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Meta fires staff who abused $25 meal vouchers: report\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta’s quest for ‘efficiency’ sparks new wave of layoffs across departments",
        "content": "Scores of Meta employees have been laid off this week, as the company embraces a new corporate culture of “efficiency” around resources and headcount.\n\nAround 100 people were impacted by the latest round of reorganizations and a related reallocation of some resources inside Meta, three people with knowledge of the company told Fortune. Such changes and related incremental cuts to teams have been frequent at Meta this year, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg sticks to his vow that 2023’s “year of efficiency” would become a “permanent” part of how his company operates going forward. A handful of workers at Instagram and Messenger were cut earlier this year amid other team reorganizations and the elimination of certain job titles.\n\nThis week's cuts mark at least the third time this year that incremental layoffs occurred at Meta. This time, it mostly impacted people working in Instagram, Facebook, and Reality Labs, according to the people familiar. Many of those affected were software engineers whose specific roles were eliminated, but some jobs in monetization were also cut. The Verge first reported that layoffs occurred at Meta, although none of the specifics have been reported.\n\nMost of the people impacted received several weeks of advance notice that their roles were being either eliminated or moved to a new team or location, and were allowed to apply internally for other jobs made available to them. Some were successful. Some were not. Others accepted four months of severance in advance instead of going through that process, according to the people familiar.\n\nThe layoffs are separate from a disciplinary action Meta carried out last week that saw about 20 people in its Los Angeles office let go for improper use of GrubHub credits. The credits were given specifically for workers to buy meals while working at the office, but some were found to have used the credits for personal items or home delivery over the course of several months, as first reported by the FT.\n\nMeta, which had 70,799 full-time employees at the end of its most recently reported quarter, cut tens of thousands of employees over the course of 2022 and 2023 in the wake of the pandemic. While the company has not had such mass layoffs in 2024, team-specific reorganizations this year have felt “constant,” one person told Fortune, noting that Reality Labs seems to go through a re-org “every few months.”\n\nAnother person said that while such changes have long been a part of Meta’s operation, a new push toward work on AI projects means more and more resources are being directed to AI and infrastructure teams. The company is also going through a process of “remapping” roles, deciding where the bulk of specific teams will be physically located given a three-day in-office work mandate that has caused some jobs to be moved or eliminated, the person said.\n\nStory continues\n\n“A few teams at Meta are making changes to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy,” a Meta spokesperson told Fortune. “This includes moving some teams to different locations, and moving some employees to different roles. In situations like this when a role is eliminated, we work hard to find other opportunities for impacted employees.”\n\nHowever, not all of the people laid off were given such notice, two sources told Fortune. Several people were “surprised” by emails that hit their inboxes this week explaining that their last day of work would be this Friday because their role had been eliminated. “Everyone was not treated the same in this,” one of the people said.\n\nSeveral laid-off employees were in their jobs for one year or less, according to two of the sources. Jane Manchu Wong, who gained online notoriety for reverse-engineering incoming features for social media platforms before they were announced, joined Meta last year to work on its newest platform, Threads. However, she moved this year to a team within Instagram that was impacted by this round of layoffs. Wong posted that she was impacted by the cuts on Threads. However, no one working on the Threads team was laid off.\n\nDespite the incremental nature of this recent round of layoffs, workers within Meta are expecting more such cuts, either later this year or early next year. Although the company is hiring more, headcount is being kept “very tight,” the person said, and performance reviews are tougher than ever.\n\nAre you a Meta employee or someone with insight or a tip to share?

        "title": "Tech firms remove social media accounts of a Russian drone factory after an AP investigation",
        "content": "Google, Meta and TikTok have removed social media accounts belonging to an industrial plant in Russia's Tatarstan region aimed at recruiting young foreign women to make drones for Moscow's war in Ukraine.\n\nPosts on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok were taken down following an investigation by The Associated Press published Oct. 10 that detailed working conditions in the drone factory in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, which is under U.S. and British sanctions.\n\nVideos and other posts on the social media platforms promised the young women, who are largely from Africa, a free plane ticket to Russia and a salary of more than $500 a month following their recruitment via the program called “Alabuga Start.”\n\nBut instead of a work-study program in areas like hospitality and catering, some of them said they learned only arriving in the Tatarstan region that they would be toiling in a factory to make weapons of war, assembling thousands of Iranian-designed attack drones to be launched into Ukraine.\n\nIn interviews with AP, some of the women who worked in the complex complained of long hours under constant surveillance, of broken promises about wages and areas of study, and of working with caustic chemicals that left their skin pockmarked and itching. AP did not identify them by name or nationality out of concern for their safety.\n\nThe tech companies also removed accounts for Alabuga Polytechnic, a vocational boarding school for Russians aged 16-18 and Central Asians aged 18-22 that bills its graduates as experts in drone production.\n\nThe accounts collectively had at least 158,344 followers while one page on TikTok had more than a million likes.\n\nIn a statement, YouTube said its parent company Google is committed to sanctions and trade compliance and \"after review and consistent with our policies, we terminated channels associated with Alabuga Special Economic Zone.”\n\nMeta said it removed accounts on Facebook and Instagram that “violate our policies.” The company said it was committed to complying with sanctions laws and said it recognized that human exploitation is a serious problem which required a multifaceted approach, including at Meta.\n\nIt said it had teams dedicated to anti-trafficking efforts and aimed to remove those seeking to abuse its platforms.\n\nTikTok said it removed videos and accounts which violated its community guidelines, which state it does not allow content that is used for the recruitment of victims, coordination of their transport, and their exploitation using force, fraud, coercion, or deception.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe women aged 18-22 were recruited to fill an urgent labor shortage in wartime Russia. They are from places like Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, as well as the South Asian country of Sri Lanka. The drive also is expanding to elsewhere in Asia as well as Latin America.\n\nAccounts affiliated to Alabuga with tens of thousands of followers are still accessible on Telegram, which did not reply to a request for comment. The plant's management also did not respond to AP.\n\nThe Alabuga Start recruiting drive used a robust social media campaign of slickly edited videos with upbeat music that show African women smiling while cleaning floors, wearing hard hats while directing cranes, and donning protective equipment to apply paint or chemicals.\n\nVideos also showed them enjoying Tatarstan's cultural sites or playing sports. None of the videos made it clear the women would be working in a drone manufacturing complex.\n\nOnline, Alabuga promoted visits to the industrial area by foreign dignitaries, including some from Brazil, Sri Lanka and Burkina Faso.\n\nIn a since-deleted Instagram post, a Turkish diplomat who visited the plant had compared Alabuga Polytechnic to colleges in Turkey and pronounced it “much more developed and high-tech.\"\n\nAccording to Russian investigative outlets Protokol and Razvorot, some pupils at Alabuga Polytechnic are as young as 15 and have complained of poor working conditions.\n\nVideos previously on the platforms showed the vocational school students in team-building exercises such as “military-patriotic” paintball matches and recreating historic Soviet battles while wearing camouflage.\n\nLast month, Alabuga Start said on Telegram its \"audience has grown significantly!”\n\nThat could be due to its hiring of influencers, who promoted the site on TikTok and Instagram as an easy way for young women to make money after leaving school.\n\nTikTok removed two videos promoting Alabuga after publication of the AP investigation.\n\nExperts told AP that about 90% of the women recruited via the Alabuga Start program work in drone manufacturing.\n\n___\n\nFind more AP coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nView comments",

        "title": "‘Let’s Talk About Sextortion’: Instagram Warns Teens of Cybercrime",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Instagram is sending a video to millions of teenagers to warn them about sextortion, a cybercrime that has proliferated on the app and in some cases has driven young users to suicide.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nInside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says How Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes\n\nThe video, which opens with the line “Let’s talk about sextortion,” will be pushed to teens and young adults in the US, the UK and Canada on Thursday, Instagram parent company Meta Platforms Inc. said in a statement. The video highlights red flags to watch for — such as “someone coming on too strong” or asking to trade explicit photos — and directs teens where to seek help.\n\nThe educational campaign is part of Meta’s effort to fight sextortion, a crime where scammers pose as teen girls on social media apps like Instagram and Snap Inc.’s Snapchat to coerce their targets into sending nude photos. The perpetrators then blackmail victims by threatening to forward those images to their friends and family, whom sextortionists find by scrolling through their followers and following lists on Instagram.\n\nMore than two dozen minors, mainly teen boys, have killed themselves after being blackmailed by sextortionists since 2022, an April Businessweek investigation found. Many of the scammers were based in Nigeria, home to cyber-criminal networks like the Nigerian Princes and Yahoo Boys.\n\nAfter the investigation was published, Meta, which also owns Facebook, purged more than 60,000 accounts in Nigeria linked to sextortionists by using technology to identify suspicious profiles. Snap also announced it was using technology to identify sextortionists and remove bad actors from its platform. Unlike Instagram, Snapchat hides the friends’ lists of its users, making it harder for sextortionists to blackmail victims because they don’t know who their friends or family members are.\n\nIn its announcement Thursday, Meta said it was attempting to further safeguard its platforms by blocking “potential scammy accounts” from seeing the networks of other users. If an account is flagged as suspicious, the company will automatically shut down access to followers and following lists on Instagram.\n\nWhile these new features may help curb sextortion, critics say there’s a more effective solution: letting teens hide their followers and following lists. Instagram has no option to hide a user’s list of friends from followers. So a scammer just needs to send a friend request in order to access everyone that user is connected with.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta “could pretty much decimate this crime completely by hiding the followers and following list for all teens and making that the default,” said Paul Raffile, an independent intelligence analyst who has studied sextortion patterns for years. “We know this list is the No. 1 source of leverage used in sextortion scams.”\n\nA Meta spokeswoman said the company is trying to strike a balance between allowing teens to benefit from the following and follower lists so it’s easy to discover new accounts, while protecting them from exploitation by bad actors.\n\n“These are important for connecting and finding the people you are interested in and we want to protect those valuable features for enjoying the app, but we want to make sure they cannot be exploited by these scammers,” Antigone Davis, Meta’s global head of safety, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Thursday.\n\nTeens will receive a warning if they are contacted by someone in another country who they don’t share mutual followers with, Meta also announced, and said it is teaming up with Crisis Text Line in the US to roll out a 24/7 live chat function for users to report child safety issues. These new features build on the safety settings Meta announced for teens last month, including limiting who can contact teens and how much time they spend online.\n\nThe changes come as the crime of sextortion itself changes, Davis said. “It is moving to become a financial crime as more people ask for more money, and within that there is a spike of this across the internet.”\n\nMeta and other social media companies face hundreds of lawsuits from families, public school districts and state attorneys general, which claim the platforms have addicted young people, harmed their mental health and created a public nuisance. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California sided with 34 attorneys general in allowing some claims against Meta’s Facebook and Instagram to proceed. In those cases, the states allege Meta knowingly contributed to a youth mental health crisis by getting kids hooked on social media.\n\nMenlo Park, California-based Meta on Tuesday said it disagreed with the overall ruling, pointing to its recent changes to Instagram meant to protect teenage users, while saying it welcomes the dismissal of some of the claims under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — a longstanding federal law shielding internet companies from lawsuits.\n\n--With assistance from Paayal Zaveri.\n\n(Updates with quotes from Bloomberg Television in the 10th paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nBYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs Neuralink Co-Founder’s New Startup Sells a Brain Computer Toolkit A Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work How Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium How Spindrift Broke Through the Cluttered Seltzer Craze\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Meta Platforms (META)",
        "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this social media company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 18%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 44% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 28.3%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nRight now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.67, which means that the company gets $0.67 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.58, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nIn addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Meta Platforms looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 20% this year versus the industry average of 7.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Meta Platforms. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.3% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMeta Platforms has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Meta Platforms well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Employees based out of other offices around the country are instead offered cash credits for services like Uber Eats (UBER) and Grubhub.\n\nStaff are given daily credits worth $20 for breakfast and $25 for lunch and dinner each, according to the Financial Times.\n\nThe credits were meant to be used for food only and delivered at Meta offices. However, some employees have been pooling the credits together or using the money to send food home.\n\nA former Meta employee, with a salary of $400,000, said on the anonymous messaging platform Blind that they used the credits to buy toothpaste and tea, the Financial Times reports.\n\n“On days where I would not be eating at the office, like if my husband was cooking or if I was grabbing dinner with friends, I figured I ought not to waste the dinner credit,” the employee wrote.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Quartz.\n\nMeta declined to comment on the fired employees to the Financial Times. The company did, however, send a statement about a restructuring initiative, that it said could result in layoffs.\n\n“Today, a few teams at Meta are making changes to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy,” the company said. “This includes moving some teams to different locations, and moving some employees to different roles. In situations like this when a role is eliminated, we work hard to find other opportunities for impacted employees.”\n\nThe company is reportedly currently laying off staff from various teams, including WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta partners with Hollywood's Blumhouse to test out its AI movie generation model",
        "content": "By Katie Paul\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta said on Thursday it had teamed up with Blumhouse Productions, the Hollywood company behind popular horror films such as \"The Purge\" and \"Get Out,\" to put its new generative AI video model Movie Gen to the test.\n\nThe announcement comes after Meta unveiled Movie Gen, which it said can create realistic-seeming video and audio clips in response to user prompts, earlier this month. Meta claimed the tool could rival offerings from leading media generation startups such as OpenAI and ElevenLabs.\n\nIn a blog post, the social media company said Blumhouse had selected filmmakers Aneesh Chaganty, The Spurlock Sisters and Casey Affleck to try out Movie Gen and use clips generated by the tool in their short films.\n\nChaganty's film would appear on Meta's Movie Gen website, while films from Affleck and The Spurlock Sisters were forthcoming, Meta said.\n\nBlumhouse CEO Jason Blum said in a statement that artists remain the lifeblood of the industry and innovative technology can aid in their storytelling.\n\n\"We welcomed the chance for some of them to test this cutting-edge technology and give their notes on its pros and cons while it’s still in development,” Blum said. “These are going to be powerful tools for directors, and it’s important to engage the creative industry in their development to make sure they’re best suited for the job.”\n\nWith the partnership, Meta is signaling how it aims to collaborate with creative industries, whose members have largely recoiled in response to the arrival of generative AI technologies over concerns around copyright and consent.\n\nSeveral groups of copyright owners have sued major tech companies, including Meta, over the unauthorized use of their works to train generative AI systems. Meta has argued its AI training is protected by the copyright doctrine of fair use.\n\nHowever, Meta and other tech companies have shown they are willing to pay for certain types of content for AI. Aside from the Movie Gen partnership, Meta said last month it had struck deals with actors including Judi Dench, Kristen Bell and John Cena to give voice to its Meta AI chatbot.\n\nSimilarly, Microsoft-backed OpenAI has been meeting with Hollywood executives and agents this year to discuss possible partnerships involving its video generation tool Sora, which it first showed off in February.\n\nNo deals have been reported to have come out of those talks yet, though Lions Gate Entertainment said in September that it had struck a deal with another AI startup, Runway.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York with additional reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Meta Platforms (META): Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Meta Platforms (META).\n\nMeta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.35, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 48 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.35 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 48 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 41 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.4% and 2.1% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for META Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for META\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Meta Platforms here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Meta Platforms, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in META?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.3% over the past month to $21.42.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Meta Platforms. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Meta Platforms may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Morgan Stanley hikes price targets on networking equipment stocks",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Morgan Stanley raised its price targets for two key networking equipment stocks on Thursday, although the firm cautioned that the sector’s recovery remains slow.\n\nThe bank’s price target for Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), one of the industry leaders, was maintained at $58, as analysts view the company as well-positioned to benefit from the resolution of inventory digestion issues and initial synergies from its Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) acquisition.\n\nMoreover, Cisco is expected to capitalize on the disruption caused by the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) and Juniper Networks Inc (NYSE:JNPR) dislocation.\n\nThese catalysts, Morgan Stanley notes, “could help cloud the valuation gap to the S&P 500.”\n\nMeanwhile, Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) saw its price target lifted from $355 to $410, driven by the company’s strong performance in cloud and enterprise sectors, particularly benefitting from the ongoing weakness of Juniper and HPE.\n\nArista’s positive data points during the quarter include making inroads with major cloud customers and gaining share from competitors.\n\n“Overall, Arista's CQ3 VAR performance was the strongest of the networking vendors, with resellers seeing between +2-15% Y/Y growth in CQ3,” analysts said.\n\nThey believe that capital expenditure (capex) figures from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) will be a key catalyst for Arista Networks' stock ahead of earnings. The next major driver for the stock may be the deployment of Meta's 100,000 cluster, though there is still uncertainty regarding the timing of these deployments.\n\nF5 Networks Inc (NASDAQ:FFIV) also received a price target boost, from $200 to $215, reflecting better confidence in its multi-cloud project opportunities, though growth remains more gradual.\n\nHowever, “while there has been some pickup in multi-cloud projects, our checks indicate this has not meaningfully translated to results for F5,” the report explained.\n\nIn terms of valuation, analysts said their $215 is based on a 15 times price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for 2025, representing a discount compared to mature large-cap software companies. However, it reflects increased confidence that current demand levels have reached their lowest point.\n\nIn broader terms, analysts said the overall demand environment for networking equipment remains tepid, with their checks indicating \"no meaningful pickup in overall networking demand\" in recent quarters.\n\nService provider spending continues to be a weak spot, contributing to slower-than-expected recovery, though the firm sees pockets of incremental spend in data centers and campus networks.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMorgan Stanley hikes price targets on networking equipment stocks\n\nWipro shares dip as Q4 guidance falls short of expectations\n\nIBM stock momentum to continue: Morgan Stanley\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Here's How Much You'd Have If You Invested $1000 in Meta Platforms a Decade Ago",
        "content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nFOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Meta Platforms (META) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to META for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nMeta Platforms' Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Meta Platforms' main business drivers.\n\nMeta Platforms is the world’s largest social media platform. The company’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta’s family of products used by almost 3.24 billion people on a daily basis as of Mar 31, 2024.\r\n\r\nHeadquartered in Menlo Park, CA, Meta generated revenues worth $134.9 billion in 2023. Advertisement accounted for 97.8% of revenues. Marketers buy ads that can appear on multiple platforms including Meta, Instagram, Messenger and third-party applications and websites.\r\n\r\nMeta, thanks to its huge user base gained a significant market share in the advertising space wherein it faces tough competition from Google, Twitter, Amazon and Snapchat-parent Snap.\r\n\r\nMeta also faces significant competition from the likes of Apple (messaging), YouTube (advertising and video), Bytedance (social media) and Tencent (messaging and social media).\r\n\r\nMeta core app enables people to connect, share, discover and communicate with one other on mobile devices and personal computers. User engagement on core Meta platform is fostered by News Feed that displays an algorithmically-ranked series of stories and advertisements customized for each user.\r\n\r\nInstagram is a community for sharing photos, videos and messages, enabling people to discover interests that they care about. People can express themselves through photos, videos and private messaging via Instagram Feed and Stories.\r\n\r\nMessenger helps people to connect with friends, family, groups and businesses across platforms and devices. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable and secure messaging application, used by people and businesses around the world to communicate in a private way.\r\n\r\nMeta also offers virtual reality (VR) products through its Oculus division.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Meta Platforms ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in October 2014 would be worth $7,941.48, or a 694.15% gain, as of October 17, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 213.65% and the price of gold increased 107.71% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for META.\n\nMeta is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone. It witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\n\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 7.22%, and there have been 3 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

One look at its top holdings and it is easy to see why.\n\nCompany Weight in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF Apple 16.2% Nvidia 14.1% Microsoft 13.9% Broadcom 4.4% Adobe 1.7% Salesforce 1.6% AMD 1.6% Oracle 1.6% Accenture 1.4% Cisco Systems 1.4%\n\nData source: Vanguard.\n\nApple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Broadcom have a combined market cap of over $10.5 trillion -- making the sector very top-heavy.\n\nAnd while the tech sector used to be dominated by software and hardware companies, semiconductors are now the largest industry within the sector, making up 28.9% of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF.\n\nSo, while investors could turn to pure-play semiconductor funds like the iShares Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SOXX), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may be a better long-term investment. For starters, the iShares Semiconductor ETF has a 0.35% expense ratio compared to just 0.1% for the Vanguard Information Technology ETF.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is also highly cyclical, making an ETF that focuses only on chip stocks volatile.\n\nWith the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, an investor gains access to the infrastructure and processing might that is powering AI, as well as AI-driven tools like those deployed by software companies Microsoft, Adobe, or Apple phones with AI chips.\n\nFactors to consider before buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a great way to invest in today's top tech companies. However, its greatest drawbacks are that it offers little exposure to smaller companies (given the size of the largest tech companies), and it leaves out some important names that you may think are in the tech sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Google's parent company, Alphabet, are in the communications sector. So you won't find these four names in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF.\n\nAmazon Web Services is the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure -- which is critical for running global AI models. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms has arguably been the single best example of a company investing heavily in AI (and buying a lot of Nvidia chips) and showing why those investments are paying off.\n\nVanguard offers a low-cost mega-cap growth fund that targets top growth stocks regardless of their sector. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF(NYSEMKT: MGK) may be a better fit for investors who want less exposure to tech stocks and better coverage of the largest growth stocks by market cap.\n\nLet ETFs work for you\n\nNvidia has captured the spotlight as the leader in AI innovation in the semiconductor space. Still, some investors may prefer AMD as an underdog that could take market share from Nvidia over time.\n\nMeanwhile, Broadcom offers a nice blend of value, growth, and income, given its diversified business and growing dividend.\n\nThe fact that the tech sector has a 20% weighting in these three stocks alone shows how valuable these companies have become. Buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a simple way to add to your exposure to these three names and the rest of the semiconductor industry. It's also an excellent way to avoid the risks of betting on a single company to invest in AI or another trend.\n\nThe best way to approach individual stocks and ETFs is to use them to suit your interests, investment objectives, and risk tolerance. Investors who closely follow the sector may prefer to build their tech portfolio around chip stocks and leave out the big software names. But folks looking for a low-cost passive approach may prefer the hands-off nature of simply buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and resting easy knowing it is chock-full of semiconductor stocks -- so they won't miss out if the industry continues to soar higher.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "content": "By Supantha Mukherjee\n\nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta's Oversight Board on Thursday invited comments from the public on the posting of immigration-related content that may be harmful to immigrants, and shared two cases that Facebook moderators decided to keep on the platform.\n\nThe board plans to assess whether Meta’s decision to only protect refugees, migrants, immigrants and asylum seekers from the most severe attacks on its social media platforms under its hate speech policy is adequate.\n\nThe board is funded by the social media giant but operates independently. After gathering public comments it can issue non-binding policy recommendations to Meta.\n\nThe first case the board shared relates to a Facebook page of a Polish far-right coalition party that posted a meme in May using a term for Black people widely considered to be offensive and derogatory in Poland, the board said.\n\nThe post was viewed over 150,000 times, shared over 400 times, has more than 250 comments and was reported 15 times by users for hate speech but was left on Facebook following a human review by Meta, it said.\n\nIn the second case, a German Facebook page in June uploaded a picture of a blond-haired, blue-eyed woman holding up her hand in a stop gesture, with text saying that people should no longer come to Germany as they don’t need any more \"gang rape specialists\".\n\nMeta decided to leave up the image after human review.\n\nAfter the Oversight Board raised the issue, Meta’s policy subject matter experts reviewed both posts again but confirmed its original decisions were correct.\n\n\"These symbolic cases from Germany and Poland will help us determine whether Meta should be doing more and whether it is doing enough to prioritise this critical issue that matters to so many around the world,\" board co-chair and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said.\n\n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm; Editing by Toby Chopra)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia is set to dominate another Big Tech earnings season",
        "content": "We’re rolling into what is expected to be another wild tech earnings season, and you can bet AI is going to be front and center. And if there’s one company that everyone is watching, it’s Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nShares of the chip giant are up more than 16% in the last month, and the stock is currently on pace to unseat Apple as the largest publicly traded company by market capitalization.\n\nThe jump comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for the company’s upcoming Blackwell chip is “insane” during an interview with CNBC on Oct. 3. Since then, shares of Nvidia have climbed roughly 18%, topping out at $130. But reports that the Biden administration will establish a cap on the number of AI chips that can be shipped to certain countries put the rally on hold Tuesday before recovering some ground Wednesday.\n\nNvidia’s incredible stock performance and meteoric rise in data center sales over the last year have put the company in a difficult position for its upcoming earnings announcement, which it has yet to officially schedule. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during his keynote address at Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif. on March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn the company’s fiscal Q3 2024, overall revenue soared 206% to $18.1 billion, while data center revenue rose a whopping 279% to $14.5 billion. And while Nvidia isn’t staring down a decline in revenue, its growth will likely slow versus the same period last year, which could spook investors.\n\nDon’t believe me? Just take a look at what happened after the company announced its Q2 earnings back in August. While the company beat on revenue and earnings per share, with data center revenue increasing 154% year over year to $26.3 billion, Nvidia shares still fell more than 6% immediately following the announcement. It took more than a month for the company’s stock price to recover.\n\nThe AI trade hasn’t raised all ships, either. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) jumped 59% year to date, outpacing the broader S&P 500 (GSPC), which rose 21%. Qualcomm (QCOM) climbed 19% and AMD (AMD) added just 6% to its stock price. Intel (INTC), meanwhile, fell a stunning 55%.\n\nBroadcom benefits from its involvement in AI infrastructure, connecting servers and the like, while Qualcomm is seen as a potential beneficiary of on-device AI growth via AI smartphones and AI PCs. AMD is facing off against Nvidia and serves as an alternative on both price and availability.\n\nThen there’s Intel, which is struggling amid its enormous turnaround effort that includes building out its third-party chip fabrication capabilities as well as trying to catch Nvidia and AMD in the AI processor space.\n\nBut Nvidia is still the hands-down star of the show this earnings season. Investors will be looking for signs of continued AI spending from hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN), which make up a huge portion of AI sales, to get a sense of how well Nvidia chips are selling.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey’ll also look at how other chip companies perform this quarter ahead of Nvidia’s announcement, which tends to be far later in the earnings cycle than its contemporaries.\n\nWall Street will similarly be on the lookout for information about Nvidia’s Blackwell rollout and whether the company is facing any supply constraints as it did with its Hopper chips. Either way, it’s going to be a wild few weeks. Buckle up. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. (yahoofinance)\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on the Magnificent Seven Stocks Plus Netflix.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other magnificent stocks in Jim Cramer's list.\n\nOn Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the ongoing success of major technology stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven. He noted that these companies are proving their resilience in the market, no matter the circumstances, likening their performance to having a unique \"Poltergeist 2 magic.\"\n\nCramer pointed out that this latest rally for the Magnificent Seven differs from previous ones, as it is not merely a zero-sum game where gains for one group come at the expense of another. Instead, other sectors are also thriving, likely due to the influx of capital into the market.\n\n“Unlike previous Mag 7 rallies, this one’s definitely not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can roar, too, in this market, perhaps because there’s just a lot of money going around.”\n\nHe noted that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts mean that cash is losing value, creating an environment ripe for growth. He mentioned that the staying power of the Magnificent Seven is truly unbelievable.\n\n“We know these stocks will once again be hit by endless worries, giving you more opportunities to buy and more weakness before they snap right back and start climbing all over again.”\n\nCramer highlighted that this week marks the beginning of a crucial four-week earnings season, emphasizing that these quarterly reports hold significant weight for investors and the broader stock market. He acknowledged the current climate of anxiety, especially following the market's impressive rally. He added:\n\n“Why stress about how quickly the Fed will cut rates, Oh? God, I'm sick of that. What matters is they're giving vast swaths of the economy a big boost and I doubt they'll stop anytime soon.”\n\nCramer also observed that investors often gravitate toward underdogs in the market, suggesting that banks could be the next promising sector. In addition to banks, Cramer also mentioned the potential in pharmaceutical stocks, suggesting that investors might want to consider major players in that sector as well.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of stocks that were discussed by Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nIn the latest episode, Mad Money’s host mentioned many factors that are contributing to Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) success presently. Here’s what he said:\n\n“Meta's off to the races again. Why not? Thanks to the success of reels, the targeted ads on Instagram, WhatsApp, the Meta-loaded Ray-Bans. Oh, it's awfully hard to bet against this one, isn't it? Very easy to make the case for Meta when you exclude the cash on the balance sheet, the stock is absurdly cheap. It's kind of strange how cheap it is.”\n\nCramer recently highlighted it among the stocks that have seen the most significant gains. He pointed out Mark Zuckerberg's statement that upcoming advertising efforts will prioritize Instagram and Reels.\n\nOne of the significant segments within Meta (NASDAQ:META) is Reality Labs, which focuses on developing hardware aimed at immersive experiences. A key offering in this area is the Meta Quest, a virtual reality gaming headset that plays an important role in the company's metaverse vision. In addition to virtual reality, the company is venturing into augmented reality with products like Ray-Ban smart glasses and the Orion spectacles, both of which hold promise for broader market adoption. The company has also made substantial investments in its AI initiatives, especially with the development of Llama, an AI language model.\n\nAs Llama evolves, it offers the potential to seamlessly integrate hardware and social media platforms, boosting user engagement. For instance, Ray-Ban Meta's smart glasses enable users to make phone calls, listen to music, and capture photos with a simple tap on the frame. In May, a multimodal AI function was introduced for customers in the U.S. and Canada, expanding the glasses' capabilities.\n\nAlthough the initial launch of the smart glasses faced challenges in gaining consumer interest, the latest iteration, released in late 2023, has already surpassed the sales figures of its predecessor models over two years, indicating a positive reception. Furthermore, in September, a report from Reuters highlighted a significant extension of the partnership between EssilorLuxottica and Meta Platforms, solidifying a ten-year collaboration focused on advancing smart eyewear technology.\n\nMeta’s (NASDAQ:META) expansive reach is reflected in its user base, which has nearly 3.3 billion daily active users across its various platforms, contributing to substantial advertising revenue. In the latest quarterly report, the company achieved $38.3 billion in ad revenue, alongside an overall revenue increase of 22% compared to the previous year\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on Jim Cramer's list of magnificent stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) the Best Internet Content Stock to Buy?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Internet Content Stocks to Buy. In this article, we will look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks among the best internet content stocks.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, The global digital content creation market value stood at $25.6 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% from 2023 to 2030. In 2023, North America dominated the digital content market. The primary drivers are the increasing use of social media and the digital change occurring across different industries. According to a study by Kepios, 62.3% of individuals in the entire globe use social media. As of April 2024, the average daily usage is 2 hours and 23 minutes per this study. Kepios analysis reveals that the number of people using social media grew meaningfully during the first three months of 2024, and annual growth rates are still significantly more than 5%.\n\nContent creation is also being transformed by artificial intelligence. According to Custom Market Insights, the global market for AI-powered content creation was valued at $2.3 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.7% to reach USD 7.9 billion by 2033. Moreover, AI programs like GPT-4 are being used to generate graphics, music, and text. Gartner projects that 30% of all digital content will be artificial intelligence generated by 2025. This facilitates hyperpersonalization, which allows material to be personalized to specific consumers while also streamlining the content creation process.\n\nSecondly, the popularity of short-form video material is skyrocketing, emerging as a major trend in the content production industry. Platforms like Instagram Reels and TikTok have paved the way for this movement. In 2024, 85% of marketers anticipate short-form videos to be the most successful type of social media content, according to a HubSpot survey. The snackable aspect of this format makes it ideal for grabbing the attention spans of increasingly transient internet consumers.\n\nThirdly, digital content is projected to become more interactive in the future. Advancements in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are opening up greater opportunities for immersive experiences. The AR and VR market is expected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2030, according to a PwC report.\n\nIf we take a broader view, according to the PWC’s Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2024-2028, there are a number of significant growth prospects in the industry, which is expected to reach US$3.4 trillion by 2028. Notwithstanding persistent upheavals and the necessity of reinventing company models, the industry presents substantial income opportunities. Growth is anticipated to be driven by advertising, with spending forecast to reach US $1 trillion by 2026 because of connected TV and internet advertisements. Due to market saturation, streaming services are being forced to investigate ad-supported business models and creative content. Revenues from gaming are predicted to surpass $300 billion by 2028, particularly in Asia Pacific. The industry is still thriving. Companies navigating shifting market dynamics will find more opportunities in high-growth regions and market categories.\n\nStory continues\n\nMethodology:\n\nWe sifted through holdings of Internet Content ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 Internet Content stocks. Then we selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among institutional investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s Facebook had more than 3 billion monthly active users. This demonstrates how firmly Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has established itself in the social media industry. Facebook is a major player in the online content market. According to Sprout Social, Instagram has over 2 billion monthly active users and is owned by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nAdvertisers are drawn to the platforms of large American IT companies because of their growing user base and engagement, as well as the valuable data they provide. The company’s top-line growth and cash flow should benefit from these valuable assets, and Morningstar analysts predict that advertisers will continue to spend more money online.\n\nThrough its Reality Labs branch, META is making significant investments in the metaverse, virtual reality, and augmented reality spaces. Nonetheless, the company has come under fire for paying large sums of money to these new customer channels.\n\nDespite the company’s intention to reduce Reality Labs’ hardware spending by 20% by 2026, BofA Securities continues to maintain the $550 price objective. Considering the sustained high level of customer interest in AR glasses, a potential budget reduction is seen as a planned response to the diminishing market for VR products.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported a $13.5 billion profit in Q2 2024, above estimates and driving up the stock price by almost 7%. Revenue for the most recent quarter was $39 billion, a 22% rise YoY and above market estimates.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) the Best High Growth NASDAQ Stock That is Profitable in 2024?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 10 High Growth NASDAQ Stocks That Are Profitable in 2024. In this article, we will look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks among the high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable.\n\nWill the Bull Market Continue as We Enter the Earnings Season?\n\nMalcolm Ethridge, Capital Area Planning Group managing partner, joined CNBC to talk about where the market could go and his sentiment regarding the AI and overall tech sector. While many analysts believe that it will be the small caps that will lead the growth with interest rates easing and the economy slowing down. We recently covered the 8 Most Undervalued Penny Stocks To Buy According To Analysts, where we talked about how Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors likes the small cap in the current market environment. Here’s a piece from the article:\n\n“To talk about what the stock market looks like today and in the near future. Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors joined CNBC in a recent interview. He has been one of the strong proponents and supporters of small-cap stocks. Lee says that we are in a volatile environment currently, due to a few reasons, one being the elections in less than 30 days, the second being the Middle Eastern crisis which is scaring investors, and lastly the port strike that has the potential to cripple the economy. However, he still expressed his optimism that the year-end has a lot of tailwinds and investors shouldn’t be afraid to buy the dip. Moreover, Lee also highlighted that these current events are all short-term headwinds in a buying cycle and are expected to die down quickly.\n\nLee thinks that bottoms are tough and processed, and small caps are in the process of what could be a multi-year bottom. Therefore the conviction is that some people might want to buy the big names on NASDAQ and the AI market, however, with small caps trading at lower multiples of P/E less than 10, the risk and reward lie in small caps. Lee further mentioned that interest rate cuts and better earnings growth make the path for small-cap growth more visible.\n\nTom Lee has also reaffirmed his belief that the S&P 500 could close above 5,700 by year-end, supported by strong economic fundamentals and a dovish Federal Reserve beginning to cut interest rates. He noted that significant cash reserves are available for investment, which could drive stock prices higher in the next three to twelve months.”\n\nEthridge thinks otherwise, he believes that mega-cap stocks will continue to lead market growth, although not at the same pace as in recent years but still at a steady pace. He attributes this to the ongoing influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on various sectors, including real estate and manufacturing, which are becoming increasingly vital due to rising demands on infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, while explaining why the mega caps will lead the growth, Ethridge pointed out that for the big tech stocks, Fed rate cuts were not necessary as they had significant cash on their balance sheets to reinvest into newer AI ventures. We have already seen Magnificent Seven invest heavily in AI despite the high rate of borrowing thereby leading the bull market in difficult times.\n\nThe rate cuts have now made it easy for other companies that didn’t have enough cash to borrow and invest in technology. However, he also pointed out that the pace of rate cuts might slow down moving forward, thereby making it hard for small caps to keep up the technology investment race. Ethridge suggests that investors may need to adjust their expectations regarding future Federal Reserve rate cuts.\n\nMoreover, we are also entering earnings season, will the earnings derail the momentum or continue to boost the market? Drew Pettit, Citi Research Director of US Equity Strategy joined CNBC in another interview. He thinks that we are in for a decent quarter, although we are in an expensive market.\n\nWhile talking about how various sectors will perform, Pettit mentioned that software has the highest bar within tech, meaning its growth expectations are high, yet many software companies are not monetizing effectively. This creates volatility in stock performance. As earnings reports come in, Pettit suggests investors should focus on consumer behavior and credit conditions, particularly in the banking sector, which is expected to perform well this quarter. He also encouraged investors to look beyond the recent quarter earnings into 2025 and 2026, while choosing companies to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo curate the list of 10 high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable in 2024 we used the Finviz stock screener, Seeking Alpha, and Yahoo Finance as our sources. Using the stock screener, we got an initial list of major NASDAQ stocks sorted by their market capitalization. Next, we sourced the 5-year net income growth and revenue growth rates for these stocks from Seeking Alpha and the GAAP trailing twelve-month net income from Yahoo Finance. We only selected stocks that had 5-year net income and revenue growth of more than 15%. Lastly, we ranked the stocks by the number of hedge fund holders in Q2 2024 from Insider Monkey’s database. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\n5-Year Net Income Growth: 24.69%\n\n5-Year Revenue Growth: 19.06%\n\nTTM Net Income: $51.43 Billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is another high-growth NASDAQ stock that is profitable in 2024. It is the creator and manager of famous social media platforms, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and runs everything related to the social media that we have today.\n\nThe strategic edge of the company comes from its huge user base, which makes it impossible for any competitor to challenge its growth. While any tech company can create a social media platform, what they can’t do is drive active users like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) does. During the fiscal second quarter of 2024, the company reported more than 3.3 billion active daily users on its social media apps including Facebook, WhatsApp, and others.\n\nAnother quality that the company has developed over time is its high rate of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). We recently saw investor confidence shattering due to a lack of return on AI investment by tech giants. But not with Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the company currently has a ROIC of 31%, which is more than 3 times the average of the S&P 500.\n\nIf we look at the past 5 years performance we see that the company has grown its bottom line by 25% and top line by 19%. During the second quarter of 2024, it brought in $10.9 billion in free cash flow indicating strong and profitable fundamentals.\n\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We are pleased to report that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\n\nWe would like to remind you that achieving these types of returns is never a straight path. From time to time, we might experience volatility — that’s simply part of the investment journey. In fact, wealth creation and volatility go hand in hand. There’s no escaping it; it’s the “price of admission” the market demands. If you take a look at the chart below, you’ll notice the drawdowns META stock has faced over the years, with 2022 standing out as a particularly challenging period, where the stock saw a 75% drop…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall META ranks 2nd on our list of the high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a promising AI stock that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "It's been a fantastic year for the stock market. The S&P 500, NasdaqComposite, and DowJonesIndustrialIndex are up 21.9%, 22.2%, and 13.7% year to date, respectively, at this writing.\n\nWith so many stocks moving higher, there are bound to be a few stock splits coming, and I think these three tech stocks could be among them. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Netflix\n\nWith a share price above $700 as of this writing, it's clear that Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) is ready for a stock split. The company last split its shares back in 2015, and with its stock trading near its all-time high, another split could be announced as soon as this month.\n\nYet even if Netflix's board of directors passes on a stock split, investors should strongly consider adding shares of this streaming giant to their portfolios. The company has demonstrated that it can more than hold its own against stiff competition from the likes of Amazon, Apple, and Disney, among others.\n\nDespite increased competition over the last three years, Netflix has grown its revenue by 22% over that period. Moreover, its operating margin now stands at 24% -- the highest in its time as a public company. NFLX Operating Margin (TTM) ChartNFLX Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nThat's all thanks to keen policy decisions such as cracking down on password sharing and instituting an advertising-supported tier.\n\nIn short, Netflix has withstood serious challenges over the last few years and is arguably stronger than ever. Investors should take notice.\n\n2. Spotify Technology\n\nSpotifyTechnology(NYSE: SPOT)had its initial public offering (IPO) in 2018, and has never split its stock. That could change soon, as the company's shares have almost doubled year-to-date to more than $360, making the stock one of the hottest performers this year.\n\nAmong the reasons why Spotify could be poised to announce its first-ever split is the company's newfound profitability. CEO Daniel Ek pledged to bring costs down, and since then Spotify's operating margin has increased substantially. At its lowest, the company's operating margin stood at negative 6.9%. It has boosted that to 2.7% by raising subscription fees and engaging in several rounds of layoffs. SPOT Operating Margin (TTM) ChartSPOT Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nIn any event, stock split or not, Spotify remains a company that investors should consider.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMetaPlatforms (NASDAQ: META) has been one of 2024's best-performing stocks. Year-to-date, Meta shares are up 68% to nearly $600, near their all-time high.\n\nThat said, Meta may not split its shares -- even if investors would love for it to do so.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, it is the only \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that has never split its shares. That doesn't mean that Meta won't do it eventually, but history is not on the side of those wishing for a split.\n\nNevertheless, investors may want to consider buying shares of Meta given its incredible growth and profitability. In the second quarter, Meta's revenue surged by 22%, while net income soared by 73%. The company's massive scale makes it one of the biggest players in the still rapidly growing digital ad market. With that in mind, many portfolios would benefit from adding shares of Meta -- whether they split or not.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,122!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $43,756!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $384,515!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 14, 2024\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "By Brendan Pierson\n\n(Reuters) - Facebook parent company Meta must face lawsuits by U.S. states accusing it of encouraging social media addiction among teens, a federal judge in California ruled on Tuesday.\n\nOakland-based U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected Meta's bid to toss the claims made by the states in two separate lawsuits filed last year, one including more than 30 states and the other including only Florida.\n\nThe company had argued that federal law blocked some of the claims and that the states failed to point to misleading statements that it had made.\n\nThe judge put some limits on the claims that the states - numbering more than 30 in all - could pursue, but allowed the case to go forward largely intact. The judge also rejected the social media company's motion to dismiss some claims over social media addiction brought by individual plaintiffs.\n\nThe states are asking the court for injunctions against Meta's allegedly illegal business practices and are seeking unspecified monetary damages.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHundreds of lawsuits have been filed by various plaintiffs against Meta, ByteDance's TikTok and Alphabet's YouTube, accusing the companies of designing addictive algorithms that led to anxiety, depression and body-image issues among adolescents, and failing to warn of their risks.\n\n(Reporting by Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Will Dunham)\n\nView comments",

Such laws are often used to target and illegally arrest people suspected of being gay, with abuses against them often ignored.\n\nThe report said the damage done by the video, which was viewed more than 3.6 million times between December 2023 and February this year, was “immediate and impossible to undo.”\n\nThe board said the content “shared and mocked violence and discrimination” and though reported multiple times and reviewed by three human moderators, it stayed on Facebook for about five months despite breaking four different rules.\n\n“With the video left up, the odds of someone identifying the men and of the post encouraging users to harm other LGBTQIA+ people in Nigeria increased,” the panel said. “Even after it was removed, the Board’s research shows there were still sequences of the same video remaining on Facebook.”\n\nIn the video, two men were seen bleeding as a crowd of people interrogated them about their identity and sexual orientation.\n\nMeta couldn’t be reached for immediate comment.\n\nThe company admitted two errors regarding the said video, the panel said, in that its automated systems identified the language spoken in the video as English while it was the Igbo language spoken in southeastern Nigeria “but not supported by Meta for content moderation at-scale,” and that Meta’s human review teams also misidentified the language as Swahili.\n\n“This raises concerns about how content in unsupported languages is treated, the choice of languages the company supports for at-scale review and the accuracy of translations provided to reviewers working across multiple languages,” the panel said.\n\nIn its report, the board recommended Meta update its Coordinating Harm and Promoting Crime Community Standard to include clear examples of “outing-risk groups,” conduct an assessment of enforcement accuracy of the prohibition on exposing the identity or locations of those alleged to be a member of such groups, ensure language detection systems identify content in unsupported languages and provide accurate translations while routing content for review.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Social Networking Stocks Q2 Recap: Benchmarking Pinterest (NYSE:PINS)\n\nEarnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q2 behind us, let’s have a look at Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) and its peers.\n\nBusinesses must meet their customers where they are, which over the past decade has come to mean on social networks. In 2020, users spent over 2.5 hours a day on social networks, a figure that has increased every year since measurement began. As a result, businesses continue to shift their advertising and marketing dollars online.\n\nThe 5 social networking stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2.2% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 0.9% above.\n\nInflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal recently, leading the Fed to reduce its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent or 0.5%) in September 2024. This is the first cut in four years. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be debating whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\n\nIn light of this news, social networking stocks have held steady with share prices up 1.4% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS)\n\nCreated with the idea of virtually replacing paper catalogues, Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) is an online image and social discovery platform.\n\nPinterest reported revenues of $853.7 million, up 20.6% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations, but overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a miss of analysts’ user estimates.\n\n“We had another impressive quarter, reporting a 21% increase in revenue and 12% growth in monthly active users globally,” said Bill Ready, CEO of Pinterest.

The business had a strong quarter with optimistic revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decent beat of analysts’ user estimates. Nextdoor Total Revenue\n\nNextdoor delivered the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The company reported 45.13 million monthly active users, up 8.4% year on year.

It was a weaker quarter as it posted underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and slow revenue growth.\n\nSnap delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group. The company reported 432 million daily active users, up 8.8% year on year. As expected, the stock is down 13.3% since the results and currently trades at $11.10.\n\nRead our full analysis of Snap’s results here.\n\nYelp (NYSE:YELP)\n\nFounded by PayPal alumni Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is an online platform that helps people discover local businesses through crowd-sourced reviews.\n\nYelp reported revenues of $357 million, up 5.9% year on year. This result topped analysts’ expectations by 1.1%. Taking a step back, it was a weaker quarter as it logged slow revenue growth.\n\nYelp had the slowest revenue growth among its peers.

        "title": "Nvidia and other chip stocks surge with no sign of AI spending slowdown — for now",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NVDA) record close on Monday comes as AI hardware stocks continue a recent tear fueled by investor enthusiasm over surging artificial intelligence demand.\n\nNvidia shares are up 8% from last week, pushing the chipmaker closer to unseating Apple (AAPL) as Wall Street's most valuable company. The stock's rally follows recent comments from CEO Jensen Huang and the chipmaker's partners touting an intense need for its AI chips.\n\nOther AI chip and hardware stocks Arm (ARM), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Astera Labs (ALAB) and Micron (MU) have risen, too, as the companies have given separate indications of strong demand for their products thanks to the AI boom. TSMC (TSM) stock also closed at a record high Monday.\n\nAll in all, the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) is up 4.7% over the past five days, outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which rose 3% over the same time frame.\n\nThe upward trajectory of AI chip stocks is a positive sign for AI hardware spending that assuages Wall Street’s concerns of a near-term slowdown on investment.\n\n\"While Phase 2 stocks [i.e. AI-infrastructure related stocks such as Arm, TSMC, and SMCI] appear modestly expensive relative to history, it is possible that the demand for AI leads the mega-cap tech stocks to spend even more on AI-related capex than investors and analysts currently expect,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in their report on Oct. 10.\n\nGoogle (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) have all indicated that they will continue to spend large sums on AI infrastructure through next year, to the benefit of AI hardware companies, led by Nvidia. As a whole, mega-cap tech stocks are set to spend $215 billion on AI capital expenditures in 2024 and $250 billion in 2025, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nOpenAI’s recent $6.6 billion funding round is also expected to put cash in the hands of hardware companies — namely Nvidia — as it continues evolving its AI models. People visit the booth for Nvidia during the Apsara Conference 2024 of Alibaba Cloud in China in Sept. 2024. (Photo credit should read LONG WEI / Feature China/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (Feature China via Getty Images)\n\nJPMorgan (JPM) analyst Harlan Sur sees revenues for the semiconductor industry growing 6% to 8% in 2024. “We remain positive on semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks,” he said in a recent note to investors, “as we believe stocks should continue to move higher in anticipation of better supply/demand in 2H24/25 and stable/rising earnings power trends in CY24/25.”\n\nA slowdown in investment will eventually come, though. The question is when.\n\nWhereas AI software is typically offered on a subscription basis, hardware is a one-time sale. Analysts have warned that AI chip stocks are in a bubble that will eventually burst once Big Tech’s massive spending on AI infrastructure eases.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, tech giants' most recent earnings reports put on display a widening gap between their hefty spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure and their return on investment — and tested Wall Street’s thinning patience. The stocks of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon all fell late this summer following their quarterly financial reports, which showed billions in AI spending.\n\n“We continue to believe that spending on data center infrastructure will be strong this year and possibly into next year,” DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an email, “but that there is an eventual peak of capex spending by the hyperscalers, as early as next [calendar] year.”\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other Most Promising Growth Stock According to Hedge Funds.\n\nBull Market and Investor Sentiment\n\nInvestors had been anxiously anticipating the start of a bull market, which the S&P 500 confirmed earlier this year. The bull run has seen the market continue to rise to new record highs, supporting revenue and earnings growth across the board.\n\nFast forward, the upward momentum appears to have peaked, with market indices at record highs. While it was highly expected that stocks would explode on the Federal Reserve offering support to a struggling economy with interest rate cuts, that has not been the case.\n\nREAD ALSO: David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy and 7 Best Nanotech Penny Stocks to Buy.\n\nIt’s become increasingly clear that investors have become more sensitive to growth scares as the global economy faces many issues. Top on the list is the rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that threaten to disrupt supply chain networks. Energy prices rising owing to the escalation of a full-blown war could trigger higher inflation, something that is unsettling the markets.\n\nAnalysts at UBS are already warning investors that they should get overweight on defensive names as global growth slows at the back of deteriorating fundamentals. While UBS doesn’t anticipate a severe downturn, the bank is cautious, advising its clients to focus on important sectors like utilities and pharmaceuticals, which always outperform in a downturn.\n\nWhile investors are increasingly rotating into defensive plays amid concerns about geopolitical tensions and the slowing global economy, Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s Andrew Slimmon recommends against this strategy.\n\n“Now is the time to just be cautious. Don’t chase the defensives that are working because I think when we get to the fourth quarter, that won’t work,” the portfolio manager told CNBC’s “The Exchange.\n\n“While our expectation is for October to remain choppy, we don’t view the overall market action to be bearish and encourage investors to maintain perspective on the longer-term trends,” Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, wrote to clients.\n\nThe sentiments echo the need to focus on high-growth companies. Investors who diversify their portfolio into high-growth companies eventually earn great returns regardless of how much a stock rises or falls in the short term.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts project that S&P 500 stocks will grow at a median annual EPS rate of 8.5% over the next five years. On the other hand, the best growth stocks are well poised to outperform this benchmark by a factor of two to three or more.\n\nFor starters, companies exposed to artificial intelligence spectacles or those leveraging technology continue to deliver record earnings and revenue growth, thus dominating most hedge fund portfolios. Additionally, the most promising growth stocks, according to hedge funds, are those whose core business would be positively impacted by improving consumer purchasing power. As the Fed steers the economy into a soft landing, consumer purchasing is expected to improve, benefiting consumer cyclical stocks. Moreover, the rate cuts will likely benefit growth and tech stocks as well.\n\nMarket fluctuations are inevitable, but the secret to a growth stock’s success lies in the robustness of its core operations. Regardless of whether a stock is rising or falling in the short term, if you consistently invest in a competitively solid business, you’ll eventually reap substantial rewards.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the most promising growth stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to find 30 popular growth stocks. Then we selected the 10 that were the most widely held by hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is arguably the most promising growth stock, according to hedge funds, for diversifying an investment portfolio in the social media space. As the top social media company, Meta has cemented its position in the lucrative advertising business. It also leverages artificial intelligence to strengthen its competitive edge and enhance user experience.\n\nAs of June, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) commanded over 3.3 billion active users across its suite of applications, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads. The massive target market has made Meta the go-to for advertising campaigns, allowing the company to strengthen its advertising empire.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands out in advertising services as it enables advertisers to reach specific audiences by considering their age, interests, and geographical location. This highly effective business strategy propelled Meta’s stock to unprecedented levels.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, Meta’s advertising division brought in $38.3 billion in revenue, marking a 22% increase from the previous year. This figure represented 98% of Meta’s total income, indicating its significant influence on its strategic direction.\n\nGrowth has been excellent, propelled by the ongoing trend of digital advertising. Over the last ten years, Meta has achieved a yearly revenue increase of 29.7%. Considering that the worldwide digital ad market is expected to rise to more than $1 trillion by 2030, Meta still has a strong opportunity for further growth.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s economic moat is solid as it boasts a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 31%, threefold the mean ROIC of the S&P 500. This indicator shows Meta’s remarkable skill in producing sufficient profits from its reinvested capital. Without this barrier, the ROIC number would be significantly reduced. Likewise, the stocks command an average buy rating on Wall Street with a $611.20 price target, implying a 4.32% upside potential.\n\nBy the end of the second quarter, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) appeared in the portfolios of 219 hedge funds, with a combined stake value of $42.5 billion.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Goldman Sachs has adjusted its ratings on several digital advertising companies ahead of the Q3 2024 earnings season.\n\nIn a recent note, the firm highlights that Q3 digital ad trends remained robust, with notable strength in areas like digital video and retail media networks. However, challenges such as tougher year-over-year (YoY) comparisons and evolving ad pricing dynamics are influencing performance across the sector.\n\n“Certain platforms/channels are beginning to face tougher YoY comps in terms of ad impression growth, particularly in short-form video,” Goldman analysts said.\n\nMeanwhile, ad pricing trends remain strong overall, especially for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Analysts believe this could boost ad revenue growth momentum for the social media giant in the second half of 2024. However, they also note growing interest among advertisers “in widening out their budget allocation to mid-sized and emerging platforms in search of relatively more attractive Return On Advertising Spend (ROAS).”\n\nAs for the rating changes, Goldman upgraded Ibotta to Buy from Neutral, citing an “attractive risk/reward as we view current valuation levels as under-appreciating IBTA’s forward growth opportunity around scaling 3P redemptions partnerships.”\n\nOn the other hand, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) was downgraded from Buy to Neutral amid expectations that continued headwinds within its core RR&O segment will continue to outweigh growth within its Services unit.\n\nGoldman Sachs reiterated a Buy rating on key industry players such as Meta, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), DoubleVerify (NYSE:DV), Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA), and Mediaalpha Inc (NYSE:MAX), with Meta and Alphabet being viewed as particularly strong due to their AI integration efforts.\n\nFor Meta, the Wall Street firm raised its price target to $636 from $555, expecting continued topline growth driven by AI-related opportunities and the ramp-up of Reels monetization.\n\nMeanwhile, Pinterest is also projected to see strong returns, with its price target set at $46, backed by the platform’s expanding global user base and the continued adoption of AI in its ad products.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoldman Sachs adjusts ratings on digital advertisers ahead of earnings\n\nDenmark's Lundbeck bets on epilepsy drug in $2.6 billion Longboard deal\n\nS&P 500 hits record high on chip stocks; corporate results, key data in focus\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Stocks On the Rise: 8 Best Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other best rising stocks to invest In now.\n\nThe market experts believe that Q3 2024 saw stocks experience increased volatility, witnessing rapid declines and then rebounding. As per the US Bank, a significant Q3 2024 trend is the rotation away from the tech sectors. All the investors continue to ask the same question: Will the rally in mega-cap stocks continue? JP Morgan believes that their outperformance has been noteworthy for quite some time. The investment firm stated that, from a research perspective, the valuations of the biggest stocks appear historically expensive, not just in the US but throughout the developed markets. Therefore, the investment firm’s expected return signals now favour the smaller market cap cohorts.\n\nThat being said, fundamentals for mega-cap stocks remain outstanding. Such giants have much higher profitability, lower debt, and improved earnings momentum. The bank believes that for investors who are worried about a slowdown, pivoting to mid/small caps remains difficult. On the other hand, investors seeing AI enthusiasm entering the speculative phase will find it easier to liquidate the winners. Therefore, the firm believes that the case for building mid/small cap exposure remains reasonable but not compelling.\n\nGoldman Sachs increased its year-end target for the S&P 500 and expects more gains for the benchmark in 2025. These gains stem from the stocks, which continue to increase on the back of strong economic growth, lower Federal Reserve interest rates, and expansion of corporate earnings. The US stocks are expected to be aided by numerous tailwinds in the final months of the year, after the Fed’s pivot to rate cuts and the new fiscal stimulus from China. Both these measures improved the risk sentiments. Market experts believe that stocks should see support from the Q3 earnings season and expansion of corporate profits in the final 3 months as the economy continues to surpass expectations.\n\nLSEG data demonstrates that collective S&P 500 earnings for Q3 2024 should grow 5% as compared to the previous year to ~$5.11 billion. This reflects a decline from the earlier projections of a $5.19 billion tally. Nonetheless, it still indicates strong momentum for this year and next, with Q4 profits anticipated to increase by ~12.5%.\n\nRecently, Goldman trimmed its 2024 earnings growth forecast to 8.2% from 8.4%. However, the investment firm expects that earnings momentum will continue to build in the next year. The firm increased its profit growth projection by 5 percentage points to 11%. This upward revision to its 2025 EPS estimate revolves around increased margin expansion. The firm added that the broader macroeconomic backdrop is conducive to slight margin expansion.\n\nMoreover, the firm increased its year-end S&P 500 target to 6,000 points, exhibiting a rise from the prior forecast of 5,600. The investment firm expects a P/E multiple of ~22x for the S&P 500, which remains in line with the company’s macro model of fair value. This will largely remain unchanged over the upcoming 3 months. For 2025, the bank expects the S&P 500 to increase by another ~300 points, to reach the year-end target of 6,300.\n\nMarket strategists believe that the momentum in the broader equities is likely to be aided by a blowout September 2024 jobs report, the start of the US Fed’s rate-cutting cycle, and China’s economic stimulus.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo make a list of 8 Best Stocks to Invest in Now, we used stock screeners to find quality stocks that have gained at least 30% on a YTD basis, as of October 7. We also made sure that these stocks were popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): Rising Stock with AI-Powered Products and Advertising\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\n% Gain on a YTD Basis: ~70%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nGiven Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s network effects regarding the massive user base, and its intangible assets consisting of a collection of data users have shared on the company’s sites and apps, it is well-positioned to sustain its growth trajectory. The company’s capability to profitably monetize its network via advertising should help it generate excess returns on capital for the foreseeable future. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s AI-powered products, such as Ray-Ban Meta Glasses and Quest 3 headset, continue to see healthy demand, exceeding the anticipations. Wall Street believes that its partnership with EssilorLuxottica should drive future generations of AI glasses.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) continues to focus on AI to enhance user experiences and drive engagement. Also, it has plans to develop a unified recommendation system and AI-generated creative for advertisers. It plans to scale Gen AI training capacity and build infrastructure for directing training capacity. Overall, investments in the metaverse, AI, and digital advertising should act as tailwinds.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) focuses on improving the shopping experience on platforms and monetizing assets such as Marketplace. It has been building out capacity for AI training and is considering expected use cases for data centers. Given its solid financial foundation and a strong focus on innovation, the company is well-placed to remain at the forefront of the tech sector.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald reiterated an “Overweight” rating on the shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), setting a $660.00 target price on 7th October. Rowan Street Capital released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“We are pleased to report that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\n\nWe would like to remind you that achieving these types of returns is never a straight path. From time to time, we might experience volatility — that’s simply part of the investment journey. In fact, wealth creation and volatility go hand in hand. There’s no escaping it; it’s the “price of admission” the market demands. If you take a look at the chart below, you’ll notice the drawdowns META stock has faced over the years, with 2022 standing out as a particularly challenging period, where the stock saw a 75% drop…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, META ranks 1st on our list of Best Stocks to Invest in Now. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +12.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 12.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.15 per share, indicating a change of +17.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.38 points to a change of +43.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.18 indicates a change of +13.1% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $40.1 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +17.4%. The $161.69 billion and $184.42 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +19.9% and +14.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $39.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.91%. The EPS surprise was +9.79%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Adobe Launches AI Video Generator in Race With OpenAI, Meta",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Adobe Inc. unveiled artificial intelligence tools that can create and modify videos, joining Big Tech companies and startups in trying to capitalize on demand for the emerging technology.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working How Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization\n\nOne feature, integrated into Adobe’s video-editing software, Premiere, will let users extend video clips using generative AI, the company announced Monday at its annual product conference in Miami. Other tools, available online, will let users produce video from text prompts and existing images.\n\nWhile OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have shown off AI video generators, Adobe is the first big software company to have it widely available for customers. Some startups, such as Runway AI, have already released their video-generating products publicly.\n\n“What we hear when we talk to our customers is it’s all really cool but they can’t use it,” Ely Greenfield, Adobe chief technology officer for digital media, said of the competitor’s technology.\n\nCustomers want AI features within applications they already use, Greenfield said. Adobe’s new video models are “designed for real work flows and integration into tools,” he said.\n\nOver the past year, Adobe has focused on adding generative AI features to its portfolio of software for creative professionals, including flagship products Photoshop and Illustrator. The company has released tools that use text to produce images and illustrations that have been used billions of times so far.\n\nAdobe has sought to differentiate its models as “commercially safe” due to cautious training data and restrictive moderation. For example, there are certain faces Adobe will block if users try to generate videos of them, Greenfield said. Rivals have come under fire for widely scraping the internet to build AI models.\n\nAdobe’s video models were trained primarily on videos and photos from its vast library of stock media for marketers and creative agencies, Greenfield said. In some cases the San Jose, California-based company used public domain or licensed data, he added. Adobe has offered to procure videos for about $3 per minute from its network of creative professionals.\n\nOpenAI’s demonstration of its video-generation model Sora earlier this year ignited investor fears that Adobe could be disrupted by the new technology. The company’s shares declined 17% this year through Friday’s close.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdobe isn’t yet charging for the use of its AI features beyond its standard subscription fees. Each user is allotted a number of credits for AI generations, but the limits aren’t being enforced for most plans, Greenfield said. In the future, Adobe may charge more to use its video-focused AI than its similar tool for photos, company executives have said.\n\nAt its conference, Adobe also announced improvements to other software, such as making it easier to view 3D content in Photoshop. The company also is working on developing AI models that can generate 3D graphics.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man Inside the Companies That Set Sports Gambling Odds Jamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary: The Idea That Never Fades How Airbnb Hosts and Frustrated Neighbors Can Find Common Ground Lina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes)\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Although the market is still hitting record highs, many stocks are still good buys. The key isn't to look at where the market is now; it's to look at where some stocks may be heading if they can keep up their growth trajectory.\n\nIf these four can maintain their general direction, they'll continue rising faster than the market, which makes them excellent buys now.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nRegardless of where you look in the tech sector, you'll find that highly sophisticated chips are within every device. It doesn't matter if a GPU is being used for training artificial intelligence (AI) models or the latest smartphone, they all have cutting-edge chips. There's a good shot that these chips are manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), known commonly as TSMC, as it works with nearly all of the biggest tech players to produce their chips.\n\nThis positions TSMC nicely in today's tech-heavy environment. In fact, management believes it will grow revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 15% and 20% over the next \"several years.\" That's market-beating growth, making it a company that every investor should consider owning.\n\nTaiwan Semi is the most expensive stock by far in this group, trading at 28 times forward earnings. TSM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nHowever, with its long-term execution, market-beating growth, and industry-leading position, it has earned that premium. I think Taiwan Semi is a great buy here and will be a successful investment over the next few years.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is likely better known as Google's parent company. Its dominance in the search market has resulted in a massive revenue stream, although it is a mature business and isn't growing nearly as fast as some of its peers.\n\nHowever, Alphabet is also heavily invested in the generative AI tech race and has plenty of financial resources to make one of the best offerings in this space. Still, even with all of this upside from two industries that are slated to boom over the next decade, Alphabet's stock only trades for 21.2 times forward earnings. The most common index that Alphabet is compared to is the S&P 500, which trades for 23.5 times forward earnings.\n\nThat's a healthy discount to the market, even though Alphabet has consistently grown its earnings above 30% year over year for the past year. Alphabet stock has a strong value in a market full of expensive stocks, making it a great place to put cash.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is similar to Alphabet, as most of its revenue comes from its social media platforms, like Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. This produces unbelievable cash flows, as its \"Family of Apps\" segment delivered an operating margin of 50% in Q2.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt uses a lot of that money on AI research and developing mixed-reality products, like its new Orion glasses, which are still in the works. While many investors wish it wasn't burning cash on this pursuit, Meta is still a great business, even with its Reality Labs division being a drag on margins. Plus, if Meta develops a must-have technology in this space, it will have a new revenue stream.\n\nMeta trades for 27.6 times earnings, but it has experienced incredible growth (revenue rose 22% year over year, and earnings per share rose 73% in Q2), allowing it to earn that premium price tag.\n\n4. PayPal\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) has been in a turnaround scenario for a few years now. However, CEO Alex Chriss, who was brought on board in August 2023, has been doing a phenomenal job. Although revenue isn't growing at breakneck speed anymore (it was up 8% in Q2), Chriss has directed a lot of PayPal's cash flows to repurchase shares and launch new products.\n\nIt took a while for investors to catch on, but the stock seems to be making a pivot, as it has risen around 40% since July. The stock still only trades for 18.5 times forward earnings, so it's still a good buy at these prices.\n\nHowever, if management continues innovating and repurchasing shares, forward earnings projections may increase, making the stock look even cheaper. This is just the beginning of PayPal's turnaround, and it's a great stock to get in on now.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Invest In.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other profitable blue chip stocks.\n\nThe September inflation report came in hotter than expected and showed that it remains sticky. Headline inflation rose by 2.4%, slightly above the anticipated 2.3%, and down from 2.5% in August. Month-over-month, CPI increased by 0.2%, exceeding the forecast of 0.1%.\n\nCore inflation, excluding food and energy, also came in higher than expected at 3.3%, compared to the anticipated 3.2%, marking a slight increase from August. On a monthly basis, core CPI rose by 0.3%, which matched August’s figures but was above expectations of 0.2%.\n\nFollowing the report, the market is expecting a 25 basis points rate cut to no rate cuts in the upcoming Fed meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, 79.9% of interest rate traders expect the rate cuts to be at 450-475 bps at the coming Fed meeting while 20.1% expect the rate cut to stay the same. At the beginning of the month, 32.1% expected a 50 bps rate cut, while 67.9% anticipated a 25 bps cut.\n\nUnderstanding Inflation Trends and Federal Reserve Strategy\n\nDespite the sticky inflation, IBM's vice chair, Gary Cohn believes that the Fed will cut rates by 100 bps this year. In an interview at CNBC's ‘Money Movers',he suggested that the U.S. is experiencing what a soft landing looks like, with inflation decreasing but not steadily. He indicated that reaching the Fed's 2% target will be challenging, as inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around this level.\n\nCohn noted that for the first time in nearly two decades, the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate, employment, and price stability, after focusing primarily on one at a time. He believes the Fed is making the right decisions and is currently in a delicate position as it missed meeting opportunities this year.\n\nCohn expects that the Fed will implement a total of 100 basis points in rate cuts this year, likely consisting of 25 basis point reductions over the next couple of months. When asked about inflation targets, he expressed a preference for slightly exceeding the target inflation rate, suggesting that a rate of around 2.2% would be more acceptable in a growing economy than undershooting the target.\n\nCohn also highlighted concerns about geopolitical risks and said that global tensions could lead to inflationary pressures by disrupting supply chains and increasing shipping costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we use stock screeners to identify nearly 30 stocks above $100 billion market cap and $10 billion TTM net income. Next, we narrowed our list to 8 stocks that had a 5-year net income compound annual growth rate of above 10% and were most widely held by institutional investors. The most profitable blue chip stocks are listed in ascending order of the hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of 912 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nMarket Cap: $1.494 Trillion\n\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 24.69%\n\nTTM Net Income: $51.435 billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nThird on our list of most profitable blue chip stocks is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which is one of the American Big Tech that has evolved significantly since its inception. It has expanded its portfolio to include widely used platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp.\n\nWhile the company is making significant investments in several technology-related platforms and products, most of its revenue is generated through advertisement. Through strategic acquisitions and an expanding suite of products, it remains a key player in shaping the future of technology and communication.\n\nOn September 25, Meta (NASDAQ:META) introduced Orion, its first true augmented reality (AR) glasses, previously known as Project Nazare. These glasses aim to blend the appearance of traditional eyewear with advanced AR capabilities, marking a significant advancement in wearable technology.\n\nThe company is currently providing access to Orion for its employees and select external testers to refine the product before launching a consumer version. While it is still in the prototype phase and not yet available for consumers, it shows the commitment to creating a polished product. It plans to improve display quality, reduce the size further, and make the glasses more affordable as they move toward a consumer release.\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) is expected to release its earnings on October 30 and some analysts are already showing optimism in its results. On October 9, The Fly reported that Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Deepak Mathivanan raised the price target for the stock from $660 to $670 while maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock.\n\nThe firm expects its Q3 results and Q4 outlook to surpass consensus estimates and noted strong ad performance in recent months and positive trends for future growth for the company. Cantor believes Meta (NASDAQ:META) will benefit from rising contributions from sectors like travel. Mathivanan mentioned that investor expectations are high due to recent strong performance, and they expect revenue guidance of $48 billion for Q4 to drive further share growth.\n\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We are pleased to report that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\n\nWe would like to remind you that achieving these types of returns is never a straight path. From time to time, we might experience volatility — that’s simply part of the investment journey. In fact, wealth creation and volatility go hand in hand. There’s no escaping it; it’s the “price of admission” the market demands. If you take a look at the chart below, you’ll notice the drawdowns META stock has faced over the years, with 2022 standing out as a particularly challenging period, where the stock saw a 75% drop…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the most profitable blue chip stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Is A Top Goldman Sachs Phase 2 AI Stock Up 70% YTD",
        "content": "We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks. In this piece, we will look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks among the list of Goldman Sachs' Phase 2 AI stocks.\n\nWhile consumer technology stocks had soared in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, back then, their share price gains were due to. the growing demand for technology products and services due to lock downs. Now, big technology stocks have persisted in their strong performance despite high interest rates since they have been judged by the market as the top innovators and performers in the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nSince AI is somewhat of a ubiquitous technology, its impact is on several industries. So far, we’ve seen most of the stock market returns related to AI directly tied to just one stock. This stock continued to be the fifth most trending AI stocks as recently as in mid October and its share price returns are nothing short of unbelievable. From its bottom in October 2022 when the split adjusted share price was a mere $11.23, the shares have gained a stunning 1,100%. In other words, if you had invested just $100 back then in the shares and then held onto them for dear life, your investment would be worth $1,200 today.\n\nThis is the magic of AI, a technology that has caught Wall Street and retail investors alike by storm. However, AI’s impact, and its enablement, aren’t limited to the GPU designer we’ve mentioned above. While GPUs are the ‘oil’ for this technology, a wide variety of other components from data center infrastructure, networking equipment, connectivity, and energy all will have to play their part if OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s plans of initially building as many as 7 AI data centers across the US, with each data center guzzling an unbelievable 5 Gigawatts of electricity, are to come to fruition.\n\nThis then makes us ask, what are such stocks that might enable 35 Gigawatts of AI data centers across the US? After all, in order to meet the world’s demand for AI chips, Altman believes that an unfathomable $7 trillion will need to be spent for building 36 chip manufacturing fabs and additional AI data centers. This money has to be spent somewhere, and therein lies the answer to our question. Things get clearer when we look at a detailed research report from investment bank Goldman Sachs. This report segregated the AI sector into four categories.\n\nThe first category only included Wall Street’s AI darling, the second was made of AI capacity providers like server companies, other semiconductor firms, and utilities, the third included firms that sell AI products and software, and the fourth category firms were those that will benefit from AI adoption. In its report, the investment bank shared that year to date in July, the first category had returned 139%. As of mid October, this category has gained 179% on the stock market, so safe to say returns have accelerated despite some turbulence in between. By July, the second group of firms was also doing well. Its returns ranged between ~-8% to ~50%, with the average stock having delivered 22%.\n\nZooming into these firms, the utility sector is one which had particularly impressed the bank. It shared that utilities were the best performing sector in the flagship S&P index between March and May courtesy of their 16% returns. Their three month returns ranked in the 98th percentile since 2022 and were the third highest after 2003 and 2020 rallies. This outperformance is unsurprising given the strong investments in data centers that have taken the US by storm this year.\n\nThese investments have led to estimates suggesting that America’s data center hub, Northern Virginia, will require 11,000 megawatts of electricity by 2035 – demand which has already spurred $5.2 billion in investments for transmission lines and coal fired power plants. Estimates from Boston Consulting Group believe that by 2030, AI will account for 16% of America’s energy consumption and touch 130 gigawatts. For a detailed look at the link between electricity use and data centers, you should read 15 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Jefferies, Citi and Wall Street Analysts.\n\nThe bustling optimism surrounding AI is also reflected in revenue estimates. Goldman’s September 2024 research shows that 2025 revenue estimates of semiconductor firms, software enablers, and hardware firms except semiconductors are roughly 2.3x, 2.05x, and 1.8x over 2019 levels, respectively. Similarly, non semiconductor hardware companies have seen their revenue forecasts for Q4 2025 jump to $450 billion for a $380 billion gain over Q1 2024’s $70 billion. Makes us wonder whether it’s this group of companies that might see a stock mirror the 1,100% returns of Wall Street’s AI darling.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs’ best phase 2 AI stocks, we ranked the 20 stocks with the highest year to date returns and some other big tech and data center names that have announced multi billion dollars in capital expenditure by their year to date performance.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA close up of a confident investor making a decisive transaction in the stock market.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nYear To Date Share Price Gain: 70.36%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the final mega cap big tech company on our list with access to self developed foundational AI models. While originally being a social media company that currently has a user base of 3.2 billion people, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s focus on high technology has meant that it is one of the leaders in the AI industry. The firm’s Llama foundational AI model and broader AI focus have enabled it to become one of the few that are offering AI products to consumers. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s AI offerings include a voice AI assistant, AI based photo editing, AI translations, and AI image generation. Its Facebook platform earns through running advertisements, and like Amazon, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also offering a suite of AI products to businesses. These include AI customer support tools and AI advertisement tools. They give the firm one of the broadest AI portfolios in the market, making it unsurprising that the stock is up 70.36% year to date.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s management shared details for Meta Studio during the Q2 2024 earnings call:\n\n“And this week we launched AI Studio, which lets anyone create AIs to interact with across our apps.\n\nI think the creators are especially going to find this quite valuable. There are millions of creators across our apps, and these are people who want to engage more with their communities, and their communities want to engage more with them, but there are only so many hours in the day. So now they are going to be able to use AI Studio to create AI agents that can channel them to chat with their community, answer people’s questions, create content and more. So I’m quite excited about this. But this goes beyond creators too. Anyone is going to be able to build their own AIs based on their interests or different topics that they are going to be able to engage with or share with their friends. Business AIs are the other big piece here. We’re still in Alpha testing with more and more businesses.\n\nThe feedback we’re getting is positive so far. Over time, I think that just like every business has a website, a social media presence, and an email address, in the future I think that every business is also going to have an AI agent that their customers can interact with. And our goal is to make it easy for every small business, eventually every business, to pull all of their content and catalog into an AI agent that drives sales and saves them money. When this is working at scale, I think that this is going to dramatically accelerate our business messaging revenue. There are a lot of other new opportunities here that I’m excited about too, but I’ll save those for another day when we’re ready to roll them out. The engine that powers all these new experiences is the Llama family of foundation models.”\n\nOverall META ranks 11th on our list of Goldman Sachs' top phase 2 AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nAs the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHoward Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "title": "What's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy if Trump Wins in November?",
        "content": "Only once in U.S. history has a former president who lost reelection after his first term managed to become president again. The last time it happened was in 1892 when Grover Cleveland became the first -- and, so far, only -- president elected for two non-consecutive terms.\n\nBut Cleveland might soon have company. Former President Donald Trump is running neck-and-neck with Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race. If elected, his policies could impact the businesses of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" companies: Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). What's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump wins in November? Former President Donald Trump. Image source: Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead.\n\nTrump's proposals that could impact the Magnificent Seven\n\nThree major Trump proposals could impact the Magnificent Seven the most. The GOP presidential nominee's proposed corporate tax cuts arguably belong at the top of the list.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump signed legislation that overhauled the federal corporate tax rate structure. Previously, large corporations paid federal taxes of 15% to 35%. After the Trump tax cuts, these businesses paid a flat tax of 21%. The former president wants to slash this rate to 15% if he's elected again.\n\nAnother key part of Trump's economic policy for a potential second term is the implementation of across-the-board tariffs. He promises to impose tariffs of up to 20% on all imported products. Trump, who has referred to himself as \"Tariff Man,\" wants to impose tariffs of 60% on goods imported from China. He has also threatened to enact tariffs of 100% on products made in Mexico.\n\nWhen Trump was president before, he was a fan of deregulation. Reducing federal regulations is likely to be a major focus again if he returns to the White House. Trump wants to eliminate 10 existing regulations for every new regulation. One promise that's especially relevant to the Magnificent Seven is his pledge to repeal an executive order signed by President Biden that regulates artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nHow the Magnificent Seven could be affected\n\nPaying less in federal taxes should be good for all the Magnificent Seven. However, the impact of Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts perhaps won't be as great as it might seem. As the following table shows, none of these giant companies pay the 21% federal tax rate in place now.\n\nCompany Effective Tax Rate in the Last Fiscal Year Alphabet 13.9% Amazon 9.7% Apple 14.7% Meta Platforms 17.6% Microsoft 18.0% Nvidia 12.0% Tesla (50% Tax Benefit)\n\nData sources: Company 10-K filings. *Tesla received more tax benefits than it paid in taxes in 2023.\n\nSteeper tariffs could especially impact the Magnificent Seven companies that rely on imported products and components. Although the companies would probably pass the increased costs along to consumers, the higher prices could negatively impact sales.\n\nApple would likely be the hardest hit by tariffs because of its global supply chain. All the others could also feel some effects of higher tariffs. The Magnificent Seven members that generate more revenue from services, particularly Alphabet and Meta, would probably be the least impacted by Trump's proposed tariffs.\n\nWhat about Trump's deregulation focus? I think the major cloud service providers -- Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- could be helped by reduced AI regulations. So would Nvidia and, perhaps to a lesser extent, Meta and Tesla.\n\nHowever, Trump has specifically criticized Alphabet, telling Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo in a recent interview, \"Google has been very bad. They've been very irresponsible. And I have a feeling that Google's going to be close to shut down, because I don't think Congress is going to take it.\" The former president has also called Meta's Facebook \"a true enemy of the people\" in a social media post.\n\nAnd while Tesla CEO Elon Musk supports Trump for president, Trump's proposed policies could hurt Tesla. The GOP presidential nominee has railed against federal incentives for electric vehicles in the past. On the other hand, he told an audience at one of his rallies, \"I'm for electric cars. I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\"\n\nThe best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump wins\n\nSo, what's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump wins in November? I think it's a close contest between Microsoft and Nvidia.\n\nMicrosoft might be helped more by Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts because it pays the highest effective tax rate of the Magnificent Seven companies. Both Microsoft and Nvidia could be hurt to some extent by the former president's tariffs but helped by his regulatory stance. Neither has been singled out for attacks by Trump as Alphabet and Meta have nor have the industries in which they operate been the target of his ire like Tesla.\n\nI believe Nvidia has stronger growth prospects than Microsoft, though. If I had to pick just one Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump returns to the White House, I would buy Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nTwo years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAmid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Raymond James analyst Josh Beck recently raised the price target on the stock to $650 from $600 and kept a Strong Buy rating on the shares. Heading into digital advertising earnings season, the advisory retained its constructive stance on Meta Platforms and Reddit. Raymond James's ad agency checks suggested 1%-1.5% Q3 growth upside on total ad spend with outperformance skewed towards Meta and Google. The tech titan recently announced new ways for advertisers to improve their campaign performance with updates to the video ecosystem, creator content, and a suite of generative AI creative tools.\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Surprise! These 3 High-Growth Artificial Intelligence (AI) Players Are Looking More and More Like Value Stocks",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks offer investors great potential for gains thanks to the promise of the technology to revolutionize many areas -- from making companies more efficient to developing the next game-changing medicine, AI could make a huge mark on history. That's why many AI stocks have roared higher, boasting lofty valuations, and many investors had the feeling that if they wanted to score an AI win, they would have to pay a high price.\n\nBut I have a surprise for you: Some very promising AI players actually are looking more and more like value stocks, as their valuations have reached bargain levels, considering their track records and future potential. They may not exactly have crossed the line into value-stock territory, but they're close enough to prompt growth and value investors to take notice. Let's check out three AI stocks that look dirt cheap right now and might offer you an excellent buying opportunity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer's (NASDAQ: SMCI) earnings and stock soared earlier this year as customers flocked to the company for its AI data center equipment -- products such as workstations and servers. In fact, Supermicro's quarterly revenue, climbing into the billions, even surpassed its annual revenue as recently as in 2021.\n\nEarnings remain strong, and the company even offered investors fantastic news this past week when it said it's been shipping 100,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI on a quarterly basis. The company works with top chip designers like Nvidia to integrate their chips into its equipment.\n\nBut recent headwinds have stopped the stock in its tracks. These include a report from a firm shorting the stock, alleging troubles at Supermicro, and a Wall Street Journal report of a possible Justice Department probe. At the same time, Supermicro has delayed its annual 10-K report. All of these elements have weighed on investor confidence.\n\nI don't recommend Supermicro right now for cautious investors until these uncertainties are resolved, but aggressive investors may consider a small position in this top AI player, as it's trading for a bargain-basement price, at only 14x forward earnings estimates.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), trading for 21x forward earnings estimates, is the cheapest of the high-growth tech stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Yet, the company has a track record and future prospects that are just as exciting as those of these peers.\n\nYou probably know Alphabet best thanks to Google Search, the world's most popular search engine, and advertising on Google generates the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue. But the company also has another very promising business that's reached big milestones recently thanks to the company's investment in AI. I'm talking about Google Cloud.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe cloud business reported a double-digit gain in revenue and a triple-digit increase in operating income in the recent quarter, and these metrics also reached important milestones. Google Cloud revenue advanced beyond $10 billion for the first time, and the business' operating income rose past $1 billion. The company says its AI infrastructure and solutions for cloud customers have brought in billions of dollars in revenue this year -- and more than 2 million developers are using these tools.\n\nAlphabet is offering customers AI solutions for all of their needs, and also has applied AI to its Google Search business -- so Alphabet could become an AI powerhouse over the long run.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is another Magnificent Seven player trading for a very reasonable price, at 27x forward earnings estimates. The company is a leader in the world of social media, as it owns Facebook, Messenger, Threads, WhatsApp, and Instagram -- and its investment in AI could reinforce its position here.\n\nMeta pledged to make AI its biggest investment theme of this year, aiming to have on board the equivalent of 600,000 graphics processing units of compute by year end. The tech giant is working to develop AIs that all of its users could apply to their needs -- from leisure to business. This should prompt us to spend more time on Meta's apps, and in turn, advertisers may increase their already hefty advertising presence there in order to reach us.\n\nAdvertising represents most of Meta's billion-dollar revenue today, so investing in an area that could secure advertising spending is wise. On top of this, Meta is going all-in on AI, so other products or services may be on the horizon. At today's price, Meta is a great addition to the portfolios of investors with a focus on both growth and value.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Scotiabank initiated coverage on three major tech giants—Alphabet (Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms—assigning Sector Outperform (Buy) ratings to Google and Amazon, while rating Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as Sector Perform (Neutral).\n\nThe analysts, in a note Friday, highlighted key differences in their growth trajectories and long-term competitive positions, helping to explain their ratings.\n\nThey explained that one of the primary distinctions between these companies is the predictability of future consumer usage.\n\n\"In the cases of Amazon and Google, we have a high level of confidence that consumers will use their services more in the future,\" said Scotiabank, while Meta’s future usage is less predictable.\n\nAccording to the bank, hours in a day are the \"ultimate limited resource,\" and while Amazon and Google help consumers save time, Meta’s business model relies on keeping users engaged for longer periods.\n\n\"Amazon and Google give you time, Meta sells your time,\" they stated. Amazon and Google make money by quickly directing users off their platforms—through paid search ads for Google and completed transactions for Amazon—while Meta earns by increasing user engagement, similar to traditional media models.\n\nScotiabank is also optimistic about the company’s potential in artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon and Google are expected to capitalize the most on AI investments, with their cloud services playing a pivotal role in monetizing corporate AI applications.\n\nIn contrast, Scotiabank sees Meta’s AI efforts as more focused on improving ad targeting and consumer engagement, which they describe as \"incremental rather than revolutionary.\"\n\nOverall, while Scotiabank sees strong potential for Amazon and Google in AI-driven growth, they are less certain about Meta’s long-term competitive edge in the evolving tech landscape\n\nRelated Articles\n\nScotiabank Starts big tech coverage: Amazon and Google Outperform, Meta Neutral\n\nNippon Steel to sell Calvert JV to ArcelorMittal if U.S. Steel deal completed\n\nStrong bank earnings push S&P 500, Dow to record highs\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AI 'Godfather' Yoshua Bengio: We're 'creating monsters more powerful than us'",
        "content": "Whether you think artificial intelligence will save the world or end it — there’s no question we’re in a moment of great enthusiasm. AI, as we know, may not have existed without Yoshua Bengio.\n\nCalled the “Godfather of Artificial Intelligence,\" Bengio, 60, is a Canadian computer scientist who has devoted his research to neural networks and deep learning algorithms. His pioneering work has led the way for the AI models we use today — such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude.\n\n\"Intelligence gives power and whoever controls that power — if it's human level or above — is going to be very, very powerful,\" Bengio said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. \"Technology in general, is used by people who want more power: economic dominance, military dominance, political dominance. So before we create technology that could concentrate power in dangerous ways — we need to be very careful.\"\n\nIn 2018, Bengio and two colleagues — former Google (GOOG) VP Geoffrey Hinton (winner of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics), and Meta (META)’s chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun — won the Turing Award (known as the Noble Prize of computing). In 2022, Bengio was the most cited computer scientist in the world. And Time magazine has named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nDespite helping to invent the technology, Bengio has now become a voice of caution in the AI world. That caution comes as investors continue to show a great deal of enthusiasm on the space — bidding up shares of AI plays to fresh records this year.\n\nAI chip darling Nvidia's (NVDA) stock is up 162% year to date, for example, compared to the S&P 500's 21% gain.\n\nThe company is now valued at a staggering $3.25 trillion according to Yahoo Finance data, trailing Apple (AAPL) slightly for the title of most valuable company in the world.\n\nI interviewed Bengio on the possible threats of AI and which tech companies are getting it right.\n\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhy should we be concerned about human-level intelligence?\n\n\"If this falls in the wrong hands, whatever that means, that could be very dangerous. These tools could help terrorists pretty soon, and they could help state actors that wish to destroy our democracies. And then there is the issue that many scientists have been pointing out, which is the way that we're training them now — we don't see clearly how we could avoid these systems becoming autonomous and have their own preservation goals, and we could lose control of these systems. So we're on a path to maybe creating monsters that could be more powerful than us.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOpenAI, Meta, Google, Amazon — Which big AI player is getting it right?\n\n\"Morally, I would say the company that's behaving the best is Anthropic [major investors include Amazon and Google]. But I think they all have biases because of the economic structure in which their survival depends on being among the leading companies, and ideally being the first to arrive at AGI. And that means a race — an arms race between corporations, where the public safety is likely to be the losing objective.\n\nAnthropic is giving a lot of signs that they care a lot about avoiding catastrophic outcomes. They were the first to propose a safety policy where there's a commitment that if the AI ends up having capabilities that could be dangerous, then they would stop that effort. They are also the only ones along with Elon Musk who've been supporting SB 1047. In other words, saying 'yes, with some improvements we agree that having more transparency of the safety procedures and results and liability if we cause major harm'.\n\nThought on the huge run up on AI stocks, like Nvidia?\n\n\"What I think is very certain is the long term trajectory. So if you're in it for the long term, it's a fairly safe bet, except if we don't manage to protect the public... [Then] the reaction could be such that everything could crash right? Either because there's a backlash from societies against AI in general or because really catastrophic things happen and our economic structure crumbles.\n\nEither way, it would be bad for investors. So I think investors, if they were smart, would understand that we need to move cautiously and avoid the kind of mistakes and catastrophes that could harm our future collectively.\"\n\nThought on the AI chips race?\n\n\"I think the chips clearly are becoming an important piece of the puzzle, and of course, it's a bottleneck. It's very likely that the need for humongous amounts of computation is not going to disappear with the kinds of events, the scientific advances I can envision in the coming years, and so it's going to be a strategic value to have high end AI chips capabilities — and all the steps in the supply chain will matter. There are very few companies able to do it right now, so I expect to see a lot more investments going on and hopefully a bit of a diversification.\"\n\nWhat do you think about Salesforce introducing 1 billion autonomous agents by 2026?\n\n\"Autonomy is one of the goals for these companies, and it's a good reason for it economically, commercially, this is going to be a huge breakthrough in terms of the number of applications that this opens up. Think about all the personal assistant applications. It requires a lot more autonomy than what current state of the art systems can provide. So it's understandable they would aim for something like this. The fact that Salesforce (CRM) is thinking they can reach it in two years, for me, is concerning. We need to have guardrails, both in terms of governments and technologically, before that happens.\"\n\nGovernor Newsom vetoed California's SB 1047 — Was that a mistake?\n\n\"He didn't give reasons that made sense to me, like wanting to regulate not only the big systems but all the small ones... There's a possibility that things can move quickly — we talked about a few years. And maybe even if it's a small possibility, like 10% [chance of disaster] we need to be ready. We need to have regulation. We need to have companies already going through the moves of documenting what they're doing in a way that's going to be consistent across the industry.\n\nThe other thing is the companies were worried about lawsuits. I talked to a lot of these companies, but there's already tort law, so there could be lawsuits anytime, if they create harm. And what the bill was doing about liability is reducing the scope of lawsuits... There were 10 conditions, you need to have all of these conditions for the law to support the lawsuit. So I think it was actually helping. But there's an ideological resistance against any involvement — anything that's not the status quo, any more involvement of the state into the affairs of these AI labs.\"\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI News You Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\n\nThe AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification.\n\nAnother notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "title": "2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in October",
        "content": "The term \"Magnificent Seven\" was coined by Wall Street last year to describe a powerful group of technology companies with a combined market capitalization of $15.7 trillion. The seven companies are:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Nvidia  Apple  Amazon  Alphabet Tesla\n\nSo far in 2024, these Magnificent Seven stocks delivered an average return of 40%, which is double the 20% gain in the S&P 500 index. That's a key reason investors watch them so closely.\n\nCorporate America is heading into a new earnings season for the quarter ended Sept. 30, which will give investors a fresh look at the financial performance of their favorite companies. Microsoft and Meta Platforms are due to release their results at the end of October, and here's why it might be a good idea to buy shares in these two Magnificent Seven right now.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nFew companies are better positioned to profit from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution than Microsoft. The company invested $1 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI back in 2019 and followed that up with a new $10 billion partnership with the start-up early last year. Microsoft has used OpenAI's latest AI models to create the Copilot virtual assistant, and it also offers those models to businesses on its Azure cloud platform.\n\nCopilot is capable of answering complex questions and generating text content, images, and even computer code with a simple prompt. It's now embedded in many of Microsoft's flagship software products, such as Windows, Bing, and Edge. For an additional monthly subscription fee, it's also available in 365, which includes Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.\n\nDuring Microsoft's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended June 30), the number of corporate customers who purchased over 10,000 Copilot add-ons for their 365 subscriptions doubled from just three months earlier. Since there are more than 400 million paid 365 seats in the corporate sector worldwide, Copilot could become a substantial source of revenue if even a fraction of them sign up. Investors should watch for further updates on that front in the upcoming quarterly report.\n\nBut the Azure cloud platform will probably headline the report once again because it's consistently the fastest-growing segment of Microsoft's entire organization. Azure's revenue increased by 29% year over year during the last quarter, and eight percentage points of that growth came from its AI services -- that number increased eightfold from one percentage point in the year-ago period. Those services include providing data center computing capacity for AI developers and access to the latest large language models (LLMs), like OpenAI's GPT-4.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft stock is currently down 12.4% from its all-time high. It's trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34.7 as of this writing, which is a premium to the 31.7 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 technology index. In other words, Microsoft stock looks slightly expensive relative to its big tech peers.\n\nHowever, investors will be hard-pressed to find another company capable of monetizing AI through both consumers and businesses at such a large scale. Therefore, buying Microsoft stock at a discount to its all-time high might be a great move ahead of its upcoming earnings report, which should feature several AI updates.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms stock has been on a tear since hitting its bear-market bottom in October 2022. It's up by a whopping 544% since then, and the company's earnings have been a key part of that story. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg dubbed 2023 the \"year of efficiency\" and proceeded to slash costs across the entire company, driving a surge in its profitability, and that momentum carried into 2024.\n\nDespite Meta spending heavily on AI infrastructure recently, it still managed to generate $13.4 billion in net income during the second quarter of 2024, a 73% increase from the same quarter last year. That propelled the company's trailing-12-month earnings per share to $19.59 -- an eye-popping 128% higher than in the prior 12 months.\n\nWall Street expects Meta's upcoming third-quarter earnings per share to come in at $5.21, representing 18.6% year-over-year growth. The decelerating increase implies a focus on sustainable profitability without compromising important capital expenditures on its critical AI initiatives. To date, Meta has launched a number of AI features for users and advertisers on its social networks, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\nThe Meta AI virtual assistant is accessible across all the company's apps. It's capable of answering complex questions, settling debates in your group chat, offering gift ideas, and even generating images. It lays the foundation for Meta's upcoming Business AI tools, which will include virtual agents to handle customer queries around the clock without human intervention. Meta believes every business will eventually have a unique AI agent, which could unlock new revenue streams for the tech giant.\n\nMeta's AI features are powered by Llama, the LLM it developed in-house. The company is currently developing Llama 4, which is the latest version due for release next year. Zuckerberg thinks it will be so advanced that it could set the benchmark for the entire AI industry. Reaching that point won't be cheap, though, with Meta planning to spend up to $40 billion on AI data center infrastructure this year and even more next year, which could impact its earnings.\n\nWith that said, Meta stock is trading at a P/E ratio of 30.3 right now, so it's still cheaper than the Nasdaq-100 index despite its spectacular gain since 2022. That presents a great setup for investors heading into an exciting earnings report, which should reveal more information about the company's AI opportunities and growth trajectory.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)  ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nVenu Krishna, Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that he is not revising his S&P 500 year-end projection of 5,600 because he believes stock valuations are “full.”\n\n“If you see what’s happening, numbers (earnings)  have been cut sharply going into the end. What is still anchoring the market is big tech, even though their earnings themselves are kind of decelerating. Then seasonality comes into play. October is the weakest month, and you don’t want to get ahead of that.”\n\nAsked whether he does not believe the market really broadened out, Krishna said while there were some signs of market broadening, the “anchor” of the rally remains big tech, which according to him, are just six stocks.\n\nMoving beyond the earnings and valuations debate, another factor still impacting investor sentiment is the Federal Reserve’s next moves.\n\nTalking about the latest Fed minutes released October 9,  Wolfe Research’s Stephanie Roth said on CNBC that a “substantial” majority of Fed officials wanted a 50-basis-point rate cut. However, she said in the next meeting, a 50bps rate cut is “off the table.”\n\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news. With each stock we mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) Innovation Edge: Leading the Tech Race\n\nPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\n\nGene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner, while discussing Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) latest products and the company’s competition with Apple during a program on CNBC, said:\n\n“If you were going to think of this as kind of a match between Apple and Meta from that perspective, there has been more momentum around Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and innovation. And to the higher-level question—what’s more important to an investor, an innovative CEO or an operator? The answer is, it’s clearly an innovator. An innovator is more important. On that question, more specifically, an innovator is much more important.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAnswering about what side he’d take as a whole, the analyst said:\n\n“If you look at the growth rate of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) over the past five years, they’ve grown their business by, let’s call it, 68%. Apple has grown by 42%. But Apple’s stock is up 195%, and Meta is up 160%. These are both class-act CEOs, no question about that.”\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its Q2 results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future.\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We are pleased to report that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\n\nWe would like to remind you that achieving these types of returns is never a straight path. From time to time, we might experience volatility — that’s simply part of the investment journey. In fact, wealth creation and volatility go hand in hand. There’s no escaping it; it’s the “price of admission” the market demands. If you take a look at the chart below, you’ll notice the drawdowns META stock has faced over the years, with 2022 standing out as a particularly challenging period, where the stock saw a 75% drop…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "AMD's AI product event likely to be 'a fade-the-news event' says analyst",
        "content": "Investing.com -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is set to host its \"Advancing AI\" event this week, where analysts expect to hear about new product announcements that could lift sales and drive the chipmaker’s stock price.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts at Lynx Equity Strategies believe this will be “a fade-the-news event.”\n\n“AMD stock has had a modest run-up over the past week on investor expectations for clarity on MI325X and its follow-ons. We think investors are likely to be disappointed,” they emphasized.\n\nLynx’s team is skeptical about AMD's ability to close the gap with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), noting that the latter continues to dominate the market. Despite AMD’s ambitious claims at the MI300X launch nearly a year ago, it has made minimal progress in challenging NVIDIA’s stronghold.\n\n\"We do not expect MI325X to change the narrative meaningfully,\" the analysts state, suggesting that AMD is likely to “remain a distant second” to its rival.\n\nWhile AMD is expected to highlight developments in data center CPUs and AI PCs, Lynx believes investor attention will remain firmly on the MI-series. The analysts warn that unless AMD can demonstrate a clear driver for market share gains, the stock could potentially retest its yearly lows.\n\nAfter AMD’s Computex presentation a few months ago, there was some optimism around the company’s next-gen data center GPUs, especially given the higher HBM density on AMD's MI325X—288GB compared to NVIDIA's 141GB on the H200.\n\nHowever, Lynx notes that customer traction has been weak in the months since. Although AMD management may boast superior benchmark results compared to NVIDIA’s Hopper series, the firm’s analysts remain unconvinced, noting that \"while running real workloads in the field, we think MI300X continues to trail NVDA’s H100.\"\n\n“We do not expect MI325X to change the narrative meaningfully. Superior HBM density is merely one of the factors at work; the software stack, backplane networking and power consumption matter just as much,” analysts continued.\n\nThey believe AMD has high hopes for the MI325X and is expanding its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity in anticipation of future demand. Notably, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s strong guidance for its ethernet connectivity business at GPU-based AI data centers next year could indicate growing demand from AMD AI servers. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also appears to be a key customer, though Lynx remains uncertain about “who the needle-movers are.”\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which endorsed AMD’s launch of MI300X last year, may have seen its commitment to AMD diminish recently.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We believe META may have firmed up its plans for internally developed silicon as a future alternative to NVDA. And Amazon/AWS too, we doubt if AMD is seen as a viable alternative to NVDA,” Lynx explains.\n\nThe firm also mentions Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) as a potential customer, along with interest from enterprises, but it cautions that the MI-series, along with its software stack, may not be the plug-and-play solution AMD has marketed it as.\n\n“Outside of MSFT we do not believe end customers are likely to spend resources to help bridge the gap as it is unclear what would be the payoff,” said the analysts.\n\n“We expect the stock to trade down after the event today and likely to revisit the lows of the year.”\n\nAs for potential surprises at the event, Lynx suggests that while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) might be announced as new customers, this would likely be limited to externally facing cloud instances.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAMD's AI product event likely to be 'a fade-the-news event' says analyst\n\nUS futures extend losses after higher-than-expected inflation data\n\nUBS downgrades Nutrien to 'neutral' on weak Ag outlook, lowers PT to $51\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta Platforms or Microsoft: Oppenheimer Chooses the Superior AI Stock to Buy",
        "content": "The tech sector has been powering market gains over the past year, and AI stocks have been at the forefront of tech. AI has the potential to overturn the tech world and recast the general economy; in doing so, it also has the potential to be a gold mine for investors.\n\nBut not every AI stock will fully realize that potential. Some are clearly going to lead in innovation or bring higher returns, and Wall Street’s analysts are busy now sorting out the equity landscape to find those shining opportunities.\n\nCovering the AI/tech world from Oppenheimer, two 5-star analysts are taking divergent views on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Both companies have been making waves in the AI world lately; Microsoft was an early backer of generative AI, while Meta has recently been finding innovative ways to use the technology.\n\nSo, let’s take a closer look to find out which one is the investment bank’s choice as the superior AI stock to buy.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nWe’ll start with Meta, the parent firm of Facebook and the world’s leader in the social media field. The company was founded as Facebook, 20 years ago; in 2021, after Facebook had made several social media acquisitions, the company rebranded as Meta Platforms. Today, Meta owns and operates Facebook, as well as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Through these platforms, the company can reach out to a huge audience – at the end of 2Q24 this year, Meta reported a Daily Active People (DAP) number of 3.27 billion, or nearly 40% of the world’s total population. An audience of that magnitude is an asset that cannot be discounted.\n\nMeta’s audience-asset lies at the heart of the company’s chief revenue driver, digital advertising. This is Meta’s core business, and in the second quarter of this year, the last quarter reported, the company showed a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across its platforms – as well as a 10% increase in the average price paid per ad. That led to a 22% year-over-year revenue gain, to a quarterly top line of $39.07 billion – a figure that also beat the forecast by $760 million. At the bottom line, Meta beat the Q2 forecast again, with the $5.16 EPS coming in 40 cents per share ahead of expectations.\n\nSolid revenues and consistent profits are only part of the story, however. Meta has been preparing itself to meet the future of the online world – and understands that that future is AI. The company is no stranger to AI tech, having put it to use in developing targeted digital advertising over the past several years, and using AI in its translation algorithms to make its social media platforms more widely accessible.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the real work is in generative AI, and Meta has two chief developments in this field. The first is Llama, Meta’s open-source AI software model. The company has already released Llama 3, and aims to use the platform to create a flexible and readily usable AI environment. Making the platform open-source allows users to develop tweaks and additions that will meet idiosyncratic needs, as well as permitting the public to make improvements.\n\nIn addition to Llama, Meta has released an online AI chatbot/assistant, dubbed Meta AI. This interactive tool is available across all of the company’s social platforms, and has rapidly become a successful addition to the company’s toolbox – and popular with users. The chatbot had 400 million monthly active users at the end of August this year, with that number trending upwards quickly. Meta created Meta AI as a gen AI challenger to ChatGPT, and is well on that path.\n\nFor Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, the most important factor here is Meta AI. He notes the recent expansion of the online assistant, and lays out how it will benefit the company as a whole. “META AI on track to be most-used AI assistant by year-end, ~500M MAU, with more country launches,” the 5-star analyst explained. “We believe the long term benefits from AI content recommendation, ad targeting, business messaging and ads generation will become more exciting to investors overtime, and support META’s terminal value. We believe China ecommerce remains strong, with results/guidance implying continued acceleration on 2-year growth (and no cautionary comments). Near term, we are also encouraged from the positive commentary surrounding US Facebook and Whatsapp young adult engagement.”\n\nThese comments support Helfstein’s Outperform (Buy) rating on the shares, although his price target of $615 implies a modest 4% gain on the 12-month horizon, a low upside that is indicative of the stock’s continued gains (up 68% year-to-date). (To watch Helfstein’s track record, click here)\n\nOverall, META shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 46 recent reviews that include 42 to Buy, 3 to Hold, and 1 to Sell. However, due to the strong rally, the average target price of $611.20 suggests an upside of just 3% over the coming year. (See Meta stock forecast)\n\nMicrosoft Corporation\n\nNow on to another tech giant. Microsoft made its name in the 70s and 80s as a leader in the PC market, and now its Windows operating systems and Office software packages have become the industry standard for home, small business, and enterprise-level PCs and laptops. Microsoft has managed this through a combination of developing quality products that do what the user needs and wants – and through smart marketing, making its Windows logo one of the world’s most recognizable brands. Today, Microsoft boasts a market cap of $3.08 trillion and is the world’s third-largest publicly traded company.\n\nLike Meta above, Microsoft has not been resting on its laurels. The company reached the top of the heap on its track record of proven products, and it’s using its deep resources and long expertise to adapt itself to the changes that AI is bringing to the world of tech. One of the most prominent of Microsoft’s uses of AI is the integration of the AI-powered Copilot online assistant feature to its Windows and Office software packages.\n\nMicrosoft has been able to do this by building on its status as an early backer of generative AI tech. The company put billions into OpenAI, the firm that brought ChatGPT to the market – $13 billion, more precisely. In return for that investment, Microsoft has secured rights to 75% of OpenAI’s future profits. Microsoft’s royalties will drop to 49% once the initial investment is recouped.\n\nThe company’s large AI investment hasn’t just brought it an additional income stream – Microsoft has also been able to integrate generative AI technology into its search engine, Bing. Bringing AI to the search engine has made the engine more responsive to natural language queries and improved search results, both of which make the search feature easier to use and more competitive with Google.\n\nAI has also become ever-more important to Microsoft’s cloud computing system, Azure, which competes with Google’s Cloud and Amazon’s AWS. Azure already has more than 200 cloud-based software tools available to subscribers, and adding AI to the mix provides enhancements and greater flexibility for users.\n\nBuilding out all of these AI features and tools, and adding them to existing platforms, does not come cheap – but as noted, Microsoft has deep pockets. And the company has buttressed that with consistent revenue growth. In the last quarter reported, fiscal 4Q24, the company brought in $64.7 billion at the top line, beating the forecast by $260 million and growing 15% year-over-year. The company’s earnings came to $2.95 per share, up 10% y/y and 2 cents per share ahead of the forecast.\n\nThe company’s Azure cloud segment, however, grew at a slower pace than expected – rising 29% y/y compared to the 30% to 31% revenue growth that analysts were looking for.\n\n5-star analyst Timothy Horan, however, is more worried about potential slowdowns and headwinds in the AI field. In his Oppenheimer note on MSFT, Horan explains his position, “We believe estimates for revenue and EPS are too high. Open AI losses are the primary concern and could be in the $2-3B range in FY25, which we were not previously modeling. As per our recent AI report, enterprises have been slow to adopt AI and associated revenues will likely disappoint. Other factors include the impact of heightened CapEx on higher depreciation, lower interest income and higher OpEx to support AI. Because MSFT are investing in once-in-a-generation technology, we don’t believe expanding margins will be a short-term priority. MSFT is trading at the midpoint of its five-year range of ~25x-35x P/E, and could trade to the lower end.”\n\nHoran follows this by downgrading his stance on MSFT from Outperform to Perform (Hold) and withholding a price target for the stock. (To watch Horan’s track record, click here)\n\nWhile the Oppenheimer view is cautious, Wall Street remains bullish on Microsoft. The 30 recent reviews, including a lopsided 22 to 3 Buy-Hold ratio, give the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating, while the $504.73 average target price and $414.71 trading price together suggest a 22% gain on the one-year horizon.

        "title": "GOOGL vs. META: Which AI/Big Data Stock Is Better?",
        "content": "In this piece, I evaluated two AI/Big Data stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META). A closer look suggests bullish ratings for both, although a clear winner emerges.\n\nAlphabet, Google’s parent company, generates revenue from online advertising, sales of apps and content on Google Play and YouTube, and fees on cloud services and other licensing revenue. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, also generates revenue from online advertising.\n\nShares of Alphabet have tumbled 12% over the last three months, bringing their year-to-date gain to 20%, which accounts for nearly all of the 21% one-year return. In contrast, Meta Platforms stock is up 12% over the last three months for a year-to-date jump of 69% and a one-year bounce of 88%.\n\nThe two companies’ equally opposite three-month performances create a setup for an interesting matchup, as outlined below.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAt a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.5x, there’s no ignoring the fact that Alphabet is cheap. While concerns about generative AI could threaten the technology giant, the current P/E is just too cheap to ignore, suggesting a bullish view is in order.\n\nNotably, advertising still accounts for the lion’s share of Alphabet’s quarterly revenue, including $64.6 billion of the $84.7 billion in total revenue. Google Search alone accounted for $48.5 billion of total revenue. Thus, it’s easy to see why some might give credence to the concerns raised by a fund manager last week. However, I would suggest that his view might be a bit short-sighted, especially since Search revenue is still growing.\n\nAt the 2024 Quality-Growth Conference last week, Stephen Yiu of Blue Whale Capital explained why he’s bearish on Alphabet right now. He expects generative AI to significantly change Alphabet’s business model, although he does see some upside left in the near term.\n\nNonetheless, he maintains a negative view due to signs of a market share decline from Google Search, which once held a 90% share. Furthermore, Alphabet’s AI model, Gemini, has yet to meet the expectations set by competing models.\n\nDespite Yiu’s longer-term concerns for Alphabet, this looks like a buy-the-dip opportunity. On a P/E basis, the shares have been range-bound since about April 2023. However, they’re currently at the bottom of the valuation range, suggesting another leg up could be in the offing soon.\n\nEven if Alphabet does enter a period of struggle, as Yiu maintains, this company isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. In short, Alphabet is one of those stocks that’s good to buy and hold for the long term, although the size of the position in your portfolio might fluctuate based on valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, I would recommend a small position right now if you don’t already have one, potentially with plans to add a few more shares if you already have a position. After all, Alphabet has more than doubled over the past five years, rising 174%.\n\nAdditionally, should Gemini deliver positive surprises, Alphabet shares will rise further, potentially breaking out of their current range. We’re already starting to see signs of this with the integration into Google Search and the recent Gemini at Work event, which covered a range of AI use cases for enterprises.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for GOOGL Stock?\n\nAlphabet has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, nine Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $200.29, the average Alphabet stock price target implies upside potential of 21.85%.\n\nSee more GOOGL analyst ratings\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nAt a P/E of 30x, Meta Platforms is trading at a premium to Alphabet, and it’s on the rise after hitting bottom at around 25.5x in early August. Meta has been rangebound for about a year or so on a P/E basis and is approaching the middle of that range. Nonetheless, a long-term bullish view looks appropriate.\n\nMeta Platforms is less diversified than Alphabet, capturing 98% of its revenue from advertising in the second quarter. This could prevent a problem in the event that digital advertising goes south, though that looks doubtful.\n\nYiu also commented on Meta Platforms, picking it as his top Magnificent Seven stock aside from NVIDIA (NVDA). He believes that Meta has greater access to personal information than Alphabet, thanks to the interactions occurring across its various platforms. He noted that this provides more personal information about individuals than just searching for things on Google.\n\nFurther, Yiu mentioned that he believes ads on Meta Platforms will become more personalized through generative AI, which he expects to have a greater impact on Meta than on Alphabet. He argues that personal interactions are more likely to drive immediate purchase decisions compared to Google searches. Additionally, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg supported Yiu’s remarks, stating that AI will allow Meta to offer even more tailored advertisements.\n\nI would agree with Yiu on these points, but I don’t think Meta will enjoy greater benefits from AI than Alphabet, especially over the long term. Notably, Meta’s ad revenue growth rate reached 22% in the second quarter, double that of Google’s growth rate. However, it’s important to consider that Alphabet’s growth rate was based on a much larger scale versus Meta’s total revenue of $39.1 billion for Q2.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for META Stock?\n\nMeta Platforms has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $607.92, the average Meta Platforms stock price target implies downside potential of 2.54%.\n\nSee more META analyst ratings\n\nConclusion: Bullish on GOOGL and META\n\nAlthough both Alphabet and Meta Platforms receive bullish ratings, Alphabet is the clear winner here. Google Cloud revenues continued to rise sequentially, surpassing $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in the second quarter. The Cloud division accounts for Alphabet’s AI revenue, which is critical because AI is already starting to cover for the drop in ad revenue.\n\nOn the other hand, Meta Platforms is trading at a premium to Alphabet, and it’s verging on overbought territory with a Relative Strength Index of 69.4. Ultimately, I expect Alphabet and Meta to both capture significant AI revenues.\n\nHowever, Alphabet takes the crown this time around due to valuation and the fact that it was able to put an actual number on AI-related revenue, while Meta just talked about AI making a difference in its revenue growth.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) the Best AI Data Center Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI data center stocks.\n\nThe AI data center industry is experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the massive computational power they require. AI data centers are specialized facilities designed to handle high-intensity AI workloads, including machine learning, natural language processing, and neural network training. These facilities integrate advanced hardware and software to process large-scale data efficiently, creating a crucial infrastructure for the global digital economy. Leading technology companies are making substantial investments in AI data centers. For instance, Meta announced plans to invest $33 billion in data center expansion to support AI research and development. Google is also investing billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, committing $3.3 billion in just one region of the United States​. These investments highlight the significance of AI data centers in the broader tech ecosystem.\n\nAI workloads demand hardware that can process vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This need has led to the development of AI-specific chips, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These chips are essential components in AI data centers.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhile AI data centers are essential for technological progress, they consume enormous amounts of energy. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers worldwide account for about 1% of global electricity demand, a figure that could increase significantly with the rise of AI. Cooling systems, necessary to maintain optimal hardware performance, further contribute to this energy demand. To address this, companies are increasingly focused on building energy-efficient data centers. For example, Google has implemented machine learning algorithms to reduce energy use in its data centers by 30%.\n\nThe AI data center industry will continue to evolve as the demand for AI-driven applications grows. Experts predict a significant shift toward edge computing, where data centers are decentralized and located closer to the source of data generation. This reduces latency and improves performance for real-time AI applications such as autonomous driving and smart cities. Moreover, the integration of quantum computing into AI data centers could revolutionize the field. Quantum computers are capable of processing complex calculations at speeds unattainable by classical computers, making them ideal for AI and big data applications. Companies like IBM and Google are already exploring quantum technology in their AI research.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. At the beginning of this year, the company announced that it would be allocating nearly $37 billion towards capital expenditures, the bulk of which would go towards building AI data centers. This was $2 billion more than anticipated. Susan Li, the chief financial officer at the company, underlined that continued investment in the hardware needed to train and run artificial intelligence systems would necessitate an increase in spending. As part of this effort, the company has struck a geothermal energy deal with Sage and pledged $800 million towards building a data center in India.\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the best AI data center stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

But the social media company has quickly become an artificial intelligence darling up there with the likes of OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nMeta’s AI success comes via its Llama family of models, which the company is infusing across its various social platforms — including its Meta AI assistant for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Businesses are also putting Llama to work. In August, Meta reported organizations ranging from Accenture (ACN) and DoorDash (DASH) to Goldman Sachs (GS) are using Llama to develop their own AI software.\n\nIt’s not just that Meta is implementing its AI into its own products, though. The company is also offering up its Llama models as open-source software. Open-source software is, generally, software that companies create and then allow developers to download and augment for free. That contrasts with, say, OpenAI, which uses a closed-source software approach for its GPT family of models.\n\nAll of that has helped to make Meta a formidable force in the AI space and a potential threat to its AI rivals.\n\n“If Llama did not exist, OpenAI and [Google’s] Gemini would be in a better position,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance. “There are undoubtedly some developers who, if not for Llama existing, would have been probably forced to go to Gemini or GPT.”\n\nBut the AI industry is still in its infancy, and there’s no telling which company will be the big winner in the long run.\n\nMeta is playing the long game\n\nMeta’s AI strategy should provide a number of benefits for the company in the near and long term. Out of the gate, the company is able to apply its Llama models to its products, helping to improve its own offerings while simultaneously proving the software’s worth in real-world scenarios.\n\nAfter all, if Meta is using its models in its own products, why shouldn’t third-party developers? And because the Llama family is open source, developers can take a look under the software’s hood, allowing them to address any flaws or risks over time.\n\n“Meta has been democratizing AI, open sourcing it, utilizing what they're building in their own platforms,” said Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman. “They've been doing it really at all the layers.” AI domination?

Vásquez) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nOf course, Llama won’t just help Meta improve its existing software and build goodwill among developers, it could also prove to be a steady revenue stream in the long run.\n\n“We want this to be open, but if you're someone like Microsoft or Amazon or Google and you're going to basically be reselling these services, that's something that we think we should get some portion of the revenue for,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during Meta’s third quarter 2023 earnings call. “So those are the deals that we intend to be making, and we've started doing that a little bit.”\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Zuckerberg said he doesn’t think those deals will contribute much to Meta’s revenue now, the CEO said he hopes it can in the long term.\n\nShares of Meta are up 85% over the last 12 months, compared to Microsoft and Google, which are up 25% and 18%, respectively. Analysts say the company’s shares are priced well relative to earnings, but the promise of how AI will boost the social media company’s own products could prove to be a tailwind.\n\nMeta’s competitors aren’t sitting idly by\n\nMeta’s open-source family of models may give it a competitive edge, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to knock OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, or any of the host of other companies fighting for position in the AI wars out of the game.\n\n“It's competitive in the sense that it's a great, cheap alternative for developers,” Munster said. “It's the most advanced, cheapest alternative.”\n\nAnd just as Meta’s models continue to evolve, so do its competitors'. Rivals OpenAI and Anthropic have funding deals with Microsoft and Amazon (AMZN), respectively, that give them the cash they’ll need to grow over the years.\n\nGoogle also has the benefit of being able to offer its Gemini platform on hundreds of millions of Android smartphones around the world, while OpenAI is expected to land on iPhones via Siri in the coming months.\n\nAnd although consumers will be able to use Meta’s AI services via its family of apps, users will find it easier to call on an AI assistant that’s built into their devices rather than having to open up a third-party app.\n\nStill, with more than 3.27 billion daily active users across its family of apps, Meta has plenty of opportunities of its own.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is expanding its AI-powered chatbot to 21 new locations, including the UK and Brazil, where the social media giant has significant numbers of users, the company announced Wednesday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums Singapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes\n\nMeta AI, the company’s chatbot, lets users converse and get recommendations on its Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger apps. It’s also available as a voice assistant in the social media giant’s smart glasses and mixed reality headsets. Almost 500 million people use Meta AI each month, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said last month.\n\nMeta AI will be available beginning Wednesday in the UK, Brazil and additional countries in Latin America and Asia, the company announced in a statement. Along with the expansion, the chatbot will also add support for new languages, including Tagalog on Wednesday and Arabic and Thai in the near future. Eventually, Meta AI will be available in 43 countries and a dozen languages, the company said.\n\nZuckerberg has focused the company since last year on adding artificial intelligence to its products, a strategy that is credited for some recent user growth and advertising success. The emphasis on AI, which requires spending huge amounts of money in computing power, is a pivot away from the company’s earlier attention on the metaverse, a virtual world for work and play. The shift has appealed to investors, who have driven the shares up 67% this year compared with a 20% jump in the S&P 500.\n\nMeta earlier this year had also planned to launch its AI chatbot in the EU, before facing regulatory pushback. The company’s large language model, called Llama, is trained in part using public posts on Facebook and Instagram. In June, Meta announced plans to start training Llama on posts from European users, but just days later said it would pause those plans indefinitely after the Irish Data Protection Commission pushed back on its decision. At the time Meta said it still planned to bring the product to Europe, but declined to share a timeline.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the company didn’t have anything further to share about its plans to expand the chatbot to the EU.\n\nMeta’s products have faced regulatory challenges in the EU over the company’s handling of personal data. In July, the EU warned Meta that it risked fines for making Europeans pay to block their data on Instagram and Facebook from being used for ads. Last week, the EU’s Court of Justice ordered Meta to stop using data related to a person’s sexuality for ad targeting.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlong with the expansion of Meta AI across its apps, the chatbot will also be available on the Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the UK and Australia.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMusk Reveals Why He’s Jumping Into Trump’s Arms How Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession Rate Cuts Need Time to Work Their Way Through the Economy Hamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "content": "Meta’s generative AI tools, including a chatbot which can be used across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, are now beginning to roll out in the UK, the tech giant has confirmed.\n\nFirst launched last year, Meta AI allows users to ask questions using text, voice or images to get more information, creative assistance or inspiration, and edit or generate new images.\n\nThe tools have already launched in the US, but not yet reached the UK or EU because of concerns raised by regulators over Meta’s plans to train the AI models it uses to run its tools using public posts from users of its platforms.\n\nHowever, the tech giant confirmed last month that it had reached an agreement on the issue with the UK’s data protection regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), and that it would start training its models on posts from UK users who do not raise an objection to their data being used.\n\nAt the time, Sir Nick Clegg – the former deputy prime minister who is now president of global affairs at Meta – said the move meant Meta AI tools could be introduced in the UK “much sooner”.\n\nIn a blog post announcing the UK rollout, Meta confirmed the technology will also be coming to its Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses, as well as to a number of other countries in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia either immediately or in the coming months.\n\nIn the UK, the tools will initially be available inside Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThere was, however, still no word on an EU rollout, where the company remains in deadlock with regulators.\n\n“We’re sharing our plan to open up access to Meta AI in more countries and languages throughout the rest of the year,” Meta said.\n\n“We’ll be rolling out Meta AI to 21 new locales around the world, starting today with the United Kingdom, Brazil and more countries in Latin America and Asia.\n\n“It’s coming soon to the Middle East for the first time, too.\n\n“This will help people get answers to their questions, brainstorm content, and bring their ideas to life in places where they can easily share the results with their local network and our broader global community.\n\n“Meta AI is conveniently located in the apps you know and love, like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. Just tap on the Meta AI icon or type ‘@Meta AI’ in a group chat to use it with friends.\n\n“You can even use it on the web at meta.ai.”\n\nThe technology giant has hoped to place itself at the centre of the AI arms race by quickly introducing its tools across its popular social media platforms to users free of charge, with the aim of establishing itself as the most popular AI chatbot firm, taking on the likes of ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Following this gradual rollout, Meta AI will be available in 43 countries and a dozen languages,” Meta said.\n\n“That means more people than ever will be able to use Meta AI to dive deep on topics that spark their interest, get helpful how-tos and find inspiration for art projects, home decor, OOTDs (outfit of the day) and more.\n\n“In fact, Meta AI is already on track to become the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year with almost 500 million active users monthly.”",

        "content": "Investing.com -- BMO Capital analysts believe Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are the top ad stocks heading into the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2025, citing their scale and advanced AI tools as key drivers.\n\nAccording to BMO’s recent checks with advertising industry experts, discussing key trends and observations across the US, UK, and Canadian advertising ecosystems, both companies are well-positioned to capture additional ad spend as their AI tools help advertisers optimize campaigns more effectively.\n\n“Specifically, our experts agree that META is best positioned to benefit from a TikTok ban, with YouTube and SNAP also benefiting to a lesser extent,” wrote BMO.\n\nThe experts are also said to have highlighted that Google’s Performance Max (PMax) is driving incremental ad dollars toward search ads, thanks to AI-driven improvements in return on ad spend (ROAS).\n\nHowever, YouTube has seen some headwinds due to competition from sports engagement for July in events like Copa America and UEFA European Cup. Despite these challenges, Google is still seen as a strong player in the digital ad space.\n\nBMO said Meta is expected to see revenue growth in the 10%-12% range for Q4 2024, with some experts predicting the lower end of this guidance due to a slowdown compared to the first half of the year.\n\nHowever, they explained that Meta is poised to benefit from increasing retail and social commerce, with in-app shopping ads generating higher CPMs.\n\nBMO’s experts foresee social commerce becoming a significant growth driver for Meta, with transaction-related ads expected to grow from 8.2% to over 40% of total spend over time.\n\nConnected TV (CTV) is also anticipated to play an important role in advertising growth, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) identified as the best-positioned platforms.\n\nThey note that Amazon’s Prime Video has shifted from experimental ad spending to committed budgets, while Netflix’s CPMs have fallen from $40 to $23, making it more attractive to advertisers.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThese 2 ad stocks are best positioned into Q4 says BMO\n\nAmazon targets faster deliveries and buying with new tech\n\nOpenAI sees increasing use of its AI models for influencing elections\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Trending AI Stocks in October. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nTom Lee, Fundstrat co-founder, while talking to CNBC in a latest program, explained his bullish case for the market and why he believes the S&P 500 is headed to close the year “well beyond” 5,700.\n\n“Bull markets are supported by a strong fundamentals and this is a case where not only has the economy survivie extremely high interest rates but the Fed is beginning to cut rates, and an economy that has been sort of languishing has been China. Now we have stimulus and what looks like some bazooka policies that are supporting that region, and we have a lot of cash on the sidelines. I think this is a formula for stocks to do pretty well the next three to 12 months, and that’s why we think that we would be well beyond 5700 before year-end.”\n\nLee said that he’s inclined to buy “risks outright” as he believes more upward momentum would come for stocks after the election.\n\n“Small caps still have good fundamentals, earnings growth is accelerating, the media P/E is eleven times which is almost seven turns lower than the S&P so I think there is still case to be made that small-cap are starting a multi-year gain.”\n\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks that are making big moves on the back of latest news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Analyst Points to Significant Upside for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Amid GenAI Impact\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\n\nWilliam Blair recently added Meta Platforms to its list of top picks. The social media giant stands out for its open-source approach and is finding new ways to monetize generative AI (GenAI).\n\n“There are early signs of positive GenAI impacts for Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), with significant upside opportunity via new GenAI products and potential CPM uplift,” said William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart. He also noted that Meta has considerable potential to scale and monetize bots using GenAI.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its Q2 results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We are pleased to report that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\n\nWe would like to remind you that achieving these types of returns is never a straight path. From time to time, we might experience volatility — that’s simply part of the investment journey. In fact, wealth creation and volatility go hand in hand. There’s no escaping it; it’s the “price of admission” the market demands.

        "content": "The US Justice Department said in a new court filing that it may recommend a break up of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) as an antidote to unhealthy competition in the search engine market, showing just how far Washington is willing to go to rein in Big Tech.\n\nDOJ lawyers used a 32-page document to outline a framework of options for DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta to consider, including \"behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search.\"\n\nGoogle in a blog post said that \"DOJ’s radical and sweeping proposals risk hurting consumers, businesses, and developers.\"\n\nIts stock fell slightly in pre-market trading Wednesday.\n\nThe proposal is the first step from the Justice Department to break up a tech empire since it tried to do so more than two decades ago with Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nThat case — which the DOJ referenced in its Tuesday court filing — resulted in a 2002 settlement that opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market.\n\nThe move by DOJ also sends a signal to other tech giants currently facing antitrust cases from DOJ and other Washington regulators as part of a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries.\n\nThe administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly.\n\nThe case against Google targeting its dominance in search resulted in a landmark decision in August, where DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta sided with DOJ and concluded Google illegally monopolized the online search engine market and the market for search text advertising. DOJ said in a new court document that it is considering a breakup of Google, among other options, as potential remedies in a landmark antitrust trial. A judge has to make the final decision. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nMehta concluded that Google’s agreements with browser providers and devices powered by Google’s Android operating system stifled rivals from entering and growing within the markets.\n\nIt will now be up to Mehta to decide what should happen now in a separate \"remedies\" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025.\n\nDOJ is expected to provide a more detailed document by Nov. 20 outlining these remedies. But the 32-page document filed late Tuesday offers several points of focus beyond forcing Google to sell parts of its business.\n\nOne has to do with contracts that secure Google’s search engine as a default on internet browsers and internet-connected devices that use Google’s Android operating system.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle pays as much as $26 billion per year to maintain its position on mobile devices like Apple (AAPL) and Samsung smartphones.\n\nJustice Department lawyers said to prevent further harm they may seek to limit or terminate Google’s use of those contracts that use Chrome, Play and Android to advantage Google search, as well as \"other revenue-sharing arrangements related to search and search-related products, potentially with or without the use of a choice screen.\" Judge Amit Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) (Mark Wilson via Getty Images)\n\nThe DOJ could also ask the judge to force Google to share with rival browsers and search providers the data that it uses to refine its search algorithms, and limit the company's dominance over search text ads.\n\nDOJ suggested the judge should also consider blocking Google from illegally monopolizing related markets, in addition to the search and search text advertising markets.\n\nIt may ask the judge to force Google to give websites more ability to \"opt out\" of \"any Google-owned artificial-intelligence product.\"\n\nGoogle pushed back on the DOJ's suggestions.\n\n“We believe that today’s blueprint goes well beyond the legal scope of the Court’s decision about Search distribution contracts,” Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post.\n\nGoogle has promised to appeal. And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google's behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.’s Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal.\n\nAnd even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored.\n\nGoogle faces antitrust challenges on other fronts. It is currently defending itself in a separate lawsuit from DOJ alleging a monopoly in the technology used to but and sell online ads.\n\nAnd earlier this week another federal judge ordered Google to open up its app store as part of the resolution of a suit brought by Epic Games Inc.\n\nDOJ cited that ruling in its Tuesday court filing that outlined a Google breakup as one possible remedy, noting that the judge in the Epic Games case said remedies should \"bridge to moat\" to combat network effects.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) a Top Buy After a Stellar Q2 Performance?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Renaissance Technologies Portfolio: 10 Best Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other best stocks to buy which are part of the Renaissance Technologies portfolio.\n\nRenaissance Technologies is an American hedge fund that specializes in systematic trading and employs statistical and mathematical tools to drive its investment programs. As of March 2024, the fund managed discretionary assets over $89 billion, according to their Form ADV. It was founded in 1982 by Jim Simons, a mathematician who worked as a code breaker for the US National Security Agency during the Cold War.\n\nSimons is considered among the pioneers of quantitative investing. At the time of his death in May 2024, he had an estimated net worth of $31.4 billion, making him the 51st richest person in the world. His use of mathematical models and algorithms to drive long-term investment returns earned him a legacy that rivaled the likes of Warren Buffet and George Soros.\n\nHis signature Medallion generated average annual returns of 66% for three decades between 1988 and 2018, earning more than $100 billion in profits during the period. The fund started with charging a 5% fixed fee and also had performance charges of 20%, which were later increased to 44% in 2002. Despite those cuts, Medallion earned annual returns of around 39% on average.\n\nThe fund was closed to outside investors in 1993 and has since then only been available to past and current employees, and their families. Renaissance Technologies does have other funds that are open to outsiders, such as Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF) and Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha (RIDA).\n\nSimons stepped down from active management of Renaissance Technologies in 2010 and resigned as its executive chairman in 2021. Peter Brown is the current CEO of the capital market company. He graduated with a B.A. in Mathematics from Harvard University and also holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. Brown’s father, Henry B.R. Brown, invented the Reserve Primary Fund in 1970, which was the first money market fund to be set up.\n\nBrown is committed to the use of mathematical models to discover and unlock the value of stocks in the market. However, Renaissance hedge funds that are open to outside investors have been shrinking for some while. According to a recent report in the Financial Times, RIEF currently manages around $19.6 billion, significantly down from $35.8 billion in 2020. The collapse of RIDA and Renaissance Institutional Diversified Global Equities (RIDGE) has been even worse. The two funds were merged this year. In 2019, RIDA managed about $15 billion, while RIDGE had a portfolio of $14.3 billion. Today, the combined fund manages only $3.6 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, Renaissance’s external assets under management have declined from $65.1 billion in 2019 to $23.2 billion today. Much of the exodus happened following the coronavirus pandemic and was driven by a shock performance by the hedge fund as the stock market rattled. In contrast, the Medallion Fund, which is limited to past and current employees, gained 76% in 2020 despite Covid-19. This is because the fund indulges in high-frequency trading with a lower capacity, a strategy that is strikingly different from those applied for external funds.\n\nHowever, the performance of external funds is beginning to stabilize after the lows over the last few years. RIEF is up 19.8% this year, while RIDA has also gained 17.4%. Though financial experts believe the improvement is owed more to the fund’s performance, rather than flows.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe scanned Renaissance Technologies’ 13F portfolio, as of June 30, 2024 and picked the top 10 stocks according to their stake value. The figures were sourced from Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nStake Value as of Q2 2024: $527,481,878\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the largest technology companies in the world. Headquartered in Menlo Park, California, it owns numerous popular social media platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Threads. According to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, an estimated 3.2 billion people use at least one of Meta’s apps every day.\n\nThe company reported a stellar quarter in Q2 2024, with revenue soaring 22% to a total $39.1 billion, fueled by a strong show again by Meta’s Family of Apps which contributed $38.7 billion of the share. Most of this was advertisement revenue, led by online commercial vertical and gaming. Net income for the quarter was reported at $13.5 billion, which resulted in an EPS of $5.16, smashing analysts’ expectations of $4.72 per share.\n\nThe ability to generate robust advertisement revenue despite the global economic slowdown has been the catalyst behind Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s growth. This has boosted investor confidence and resulted in a YTD share price appreciation of over 64%. Another factor driving the positive wave around the stock has been the heavy capital investment in artificial intelligence projects by the company, which has resulted in the successful launch of new products such as Meta Quest 3 and Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, whose demand has outpaced Meta’s expectations.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the best stocks to buy now, with 219 hedge funds having investments in the company, according to Insider Monkey’s database for Q2 2024. This includes Renaissance Technologies which had a stake volume of over $527 million, as of June 30, 2024, accounting for 0.89% of its portfolio. There is also a consensus among Street analysts on the stock’s Strong Buy rating.\n\nWhile the company looks set for long-term growth, there may be some headwinds on the horizon that could impact the stock’s short-term performance. One of them is the slowdown in revenue anticipated for Q3. Last year, much of the revenue was driven by a surge in Reels impressions and an increasing number of China-based advertisers on its social media platforms. That is unlikely to happen this year. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) also plans on spending a staggering $40 billion on further capital expenditure this year, which could adversely affect its short-term financials, and subsequently, its share price.\n\nOverall, META ranks 7th among the Renaissance Technologies Portfolio: 10 Best Stocks To Buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "2 Unstoppable Growth Stocks to Buy if There's a Stock Market Sell-Off",
        "content": "Earlier this year, the S&P 500 confirmed something investors had been eagerly awaiting: the onset of a bull market. The index didn't stop there, though, and continued to reach new record highs. And today, that benchmark is heading towards a 20% gain for the year.\n\nIn the current environment, you may not be thinking about the next market sell-off -- but this is actually a good time to consider what you should do when that next point of market weakness rolls around. We know it will happen because even when the markets are strongest, indexes don't rise in a straight line. There are always moments when stocks will pull back, pause, and ideally roar higher once again.\n\nWhat's the best move an investor can make? Plan ahead by considering which quality growth stocks would make great long-term buys on the dip. These players should have a solid earnings track record, a clear competitive advantage to keep them in leadership positions, and bright prospects. Let's check out two unstoppable players that should be on your buy list if (when) there's a market sell-off. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has built a leading position in social media, via Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. These apps have become part of our daily lives -- in fact, more than 3.2 billion people worldwide use at least one of them every day.\n\nAnd Meta's moat, or competitive advantage, is simple. Users of these platforms know that if they leave for another app, they'll lose many of their contacts. This, and the solid reputation of Meta's apps, keep users loyal -- both of which are the key to the company's revenue growth. Advertisers, which make up the lion's share of Meta's revenue, know consumers will spend a lot of time on those apps.\n\nThis has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue and net profit for Meta. In the most recent quarter, the company reported a 22% increase in revenue to $39 billion. And net income came in at more than $13 billion. The company has been so successful that earlier this year it launched its first-ever dividend, saying it is in the financial position to reward shareholders and fund growth.\n\nNow, what's the next step for Meta? Potentially becoming a winner in the hot growth area of artificial intelligence (AI). The company is investing heavily and aims to create AIs for every Meta user -- to help you with everything from leisure to professional activities.\n\nMeta shares have soared 68% so far this year, but the stock remains inexpensive at 27x forward earnings estimates. And a purchase on the dip could offer you an even better bargain.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) has been around for 20 years -- but it's only taken center stage with investors recently. Historically, this software company was known for its contracts with governments, but over the past couple of years, has shifted. Palantir's government contract revenue is still growing, but commercial growth has far surpassed it.\n\nThis potential for increased commercial contracts, as well as Palantir's use of AI, are driving growth at the company which has helped the stock surge 130% so far this year.\n\nSo, what does Palantir do? It helps its customers aggregate their data and make better use of it -- this often results in game-changing decisions or an entirely new way of approaching a challenge. Aggregating data across an organization is a complex task, one that's difficult for a company to do on its own -- and that's kept Palantir's business growing.\n\nLast year, the company launched a new product, its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which truly supercharged growth. To introduce potential customers to this platform, Palantir invites them to \"Bootcamps\" which are sessions that help them go from zero to use cases in a matter of hours.\n\nAll of this is reflected in Palantir's financial results. In the most recent quarter, for example, U.S. commercial revenue surged 55% to $159 million, while U.S. commercial customer count soared 83% to nearly 300 customers. It's important to remember that Palantir counted only 14 U.S. commercial customers just four years ago. Meanwhile, as mentioned, government revenue continues to climb too -- by 23% in the quarter.\n\nPalantir shares have gotten more expensive this year, reaching 112x forward earnings estimates, so any pullback could create an interesting opportunity for investors to get in on this unstoppable growth stock.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late.

        "title": "Wall Street's Newest Stock-Split Stock Has Arrived -- and Here's the Magnificent Stock Likely to Follow in Its Footsteps",
        "content": "For almost two years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been the top trend powering Wall Street's major stock indexes higher. But over the last nine months, excitement surrounding stock splits has played an equally important role in boosting the value of select market-leading companies.\n\nA stock split gives publicly traded companies the option of superficially adjusting their share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. These changes are surface-scratching in the sense that they have no impact on a company's market cap or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSince retail juggernaut Walmart kicked off stock-split euphoria in late January, north of a dozen prominent businesses have announced or completed a split. All but one of these are of the forward-split variety, which is designed to make shares more nominally affordable for retail investors who lack access to fractional-share purchases through their broker.\n\nToday, Oct. 9, marks the arrival of Wall Street's newest stock split, as well as paves the way for another market-leading business to potentially follow in its footsteps.\n\nWall Street's newest stock-split stock is ready to shine\n\nNearly five months ago, in mid-May, Japan-based consumer electronics colossus Sony Group(NYSE: SONY) revealed plans to conduct a 5-for-1 forward split. Although the effective date for this split was Oct. 1 in Japan, it was a week later (Oct. 8) for its American depositary receipts (ADRs) listed in the U.S. When trading commences today, Sony's stock should be close to $19 per share, down from $95 per share, where it began the week.\n\nSony is best-known for its gaming prowess. The company's PlayStation 5 (PS5) is the top-selling ninth-generation gaming console. Although the PS5 has been on retail shelves for almost four years, Sony recently announced plans to increase the price of its top-selling console by 19% in Japan. On top of raising additional revenue, this demonstrates just how commanding of a position Sony holds in the gaming arena.\n\nFurthermore, revenue for the company's PlayStation Plus subscription has been climbing. PlayStation Plus is the multitiered subscription service that allows users to save their gaming data in the cloud, game with their friends, and access exclusive gaming titles. This considerably higher-margin segment is perhaps the best way for Sony to counter the staleness of having its PS5 in stores for nearly four years.\n\nBased on what history tells us, Sony's next-generation console should be available in two to three years. It wouldn't be a surprise to see Sony's stock rally in advance of this release.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut as I pointed out earlier this week, Sony Group is about more than just gaming. Its Imaging and Sensing Solutions (ISS) segment is currently growing by double digits. What's powering this growth in ISS is strong demand for the company's image sensors, which are used in smartphones. Wireless carriers upgrading and expanding the coverage of their networks to support 5G download speeds have encouraged consumers to upgrade their wireless devices.\n\nSony also has a shareholder-friendly capital-return program. As of Sept. 30, it had completed the repurchase of 14.67 million shares of its common stock for 194.5 billion yen, which equates to roughly $131.5 million U.S. For companies with steady or growing net income, such as Sony, share repurchases can improve earnings per share and make their stock more attractive to investors.\n\nThe $64,000 question is: Which company is set to follow in Sony's footsteps and become Wall Street's next stock-split stock? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis generational business might be Wall Street's next stock-split stock\n\nWhile there are quite a few standout businesses that appear ripe for a stock split, including warehouse club Costco Wholesale, software company Adobe, and pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, the one that may be the likeliest to walk in Sony's footsteps and announce a split is social media leader Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META).\n\nInterestingly enough, Meta is the only member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" to have never completed a stock split. But with its shares topping $600 on an intra-day basis to open this week, there's a clear reason to make its stock more nominally affordable for everyday investors.\n\nMeta is best-known as the parent of leading social media destinations Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger, among other sites. During the June-ended quarter, Meta attracted 3.27 billion people to its apps on a daily basis. No social media company comes remotely close to luring this many daily active users (DAUs).\n\nThe advantage of having more than 3.2 billion DAUs is that advertisers will often pay a premium to get their message(s) in front of consumers. Since economic expansions last considerably longer, on average, than recessions, an ad-driven operating model like Meta is usually able to command exceptionally strong ad-pricing power.\n\nBut Meta is also gearing up for a future that should feature sustained double-digit growth potential. It's aggressively investing in its AI ambitions by spending in the neighborhood of $10.5 billion to purchase 350,000 AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia. These chips will power Meta's AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's money-losing Reality Labs segment is building on CEO Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse vision behind the scenes. Meta is positioning itself to be a key on-ramp to the metaverse, although it could take years before the company's investments yields meaningful revenue.\n\nTo add, Meta Platforms is sitting on a truly enviable amount of cash. It closed out the midpoint of 2024 with $58.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and is pacing north of $77 billion in net cash generated from its operations for the current year. Meta's balance sheet affords it the luxury of taking risks.\n\nPerhaps no company is primed to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock more than Meta Platforms.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Sony Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sony Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sony Group wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – October 9, 2024 – Zacks Value Investor is a podcast hosted weekly by Zacks Stock Strategist Tracey Ryniec. Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2347643/the-cheapest-mag-7-stocks-in-2024\n\nThe Cheapest Mag 7 Stocks in 2024\n\nWelcome to Episode #385 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\n(0:30) - Can You Find Value Within The Magnificent 7? (6:15) - Breaking Down Recent Performances: What Stocks To Keep On Your Radar? (28:30) - Episode Roundup: META, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, TSLA Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nIt’s time to check in on the Mag 7 stocks, formerly known as FAANG stocks or FANGMAN stocks. The Mag 7 stocks are the large cap innovators with high growth. The Mag 7 includes Tesla, NVIDIA, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Meta Platforms.\n\nTracey has often discussed how value investors can own both growth and value stocks. Value investors are not limited only to value stocks.\n\nWhy not look at the largest big cap growth stocks out there? Why not own some Mag 7 stocks?\n\nWhat’s the Definition of a “Cheap” Stock?\n\nBut just because a value investor might buy a growth stock, doesn’t mean that investor doesn’t want attractive valuations. A “cheap” stock, for value investors, doesn’t mean the share price. Cheapness is not talking about a stock under $1.00. Cheapness means the company’s valuations are attractive.\n\nFor value investors, valuations are often determined by looking at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. P/E ratios are usually the first default though, so Tracey looked at them for this podcast.\n\nThe P/E ratio is price divided by earnings.\n\nBut there’s a good case for the P/S ratio, especially when looking at technology stocks.\n\nTracey considers both on the podcast.\n\nAre There Any Deals in the Mag 7 Stocks?\n\n1. Tesla, Inc. TSLA\n\nTesla has underperformed so far in 2024. Shares of Tesla are down 3.1% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is up 19.4%.\n\nBut the sell-off doesn’t mean Tesla is cheap. It’s trading with a forward P/E of 113, which is at the nosebleed levels. And it has a P/S ratio of 8.7. That’s not cheap but at least it’s under 10.\n\nIs Tesla a deal on the weakness or is it a value trap?\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN\n\nHas Amazon EVER been cheap? Investors have always paid a premium for the stock, at least on a P/E basis. But Amazon is currently trading with a forward P/E of 39, which is among its lowest P/E ratios over the last decade.\n\nShares of Amazon have gained 19% year-to-date yet it’s still sporting an attractive P/E. Earnings are expected to rise 63.5% this year and 23% next year, which explains it.\n\nBut it is Amazon’s P/S ratio which is the real surprise. It has P/S ratio of just 3.2, the lowest of the Mag 7.\n\nShould Amazon be on a value investor’s short list?\n\n3. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\n\nNVIDIA can’t be a deal, can it? It has been one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street this year. Shares of NVIDIA are up 157.9% year-to-date. But earnings are also expected to be up 116% this year and another 33% in fiscal 2026.\n\nNVIDIA is trading with a forward P/E of “just” 41.5. But that is well under Tesla at 113x, and other growth stocks like Costco, which is trading at 49x.\n\nIs NVIDIA still a buy here?\n\n4. Apple Inc. AAPL\n\nWarren Buffett might have sold a bunch of his Apple position in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio this year, but he still owns a big chunk of shares. And if the greatest value investor ever owns your stock, there must be some value there, right?\n\nBut Apple isn’t that cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 30. Earnings are expected to be up this year, but just 9.3%. Shares of Apple have gained 15.1% year-to-date.\n\nIs Apple losing its shine with value investors in 2024?\n\n5. Meta Platforms, Inc. META\n\nMeta Platforms has been a quiet winner in 2024. Shares of Meta Platforms are up 65.2% year-to-date.\n\nIt’s a growth stock. Earnings are expected to rise 43.6% this year and another 12.8% next year. But Meta Platforms also has an attractive forward P/E of just 27. And it’s now paying a dividend, yielding 0.4%.\n\nIs Meta Platforms the cheapest Mag 7 stock?\n\nWhat Is the Cheapest of the Mag 7 stocks?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL, MSFT and AMZN in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is rolling out new artificial intelligence tools to help advertisers create and edit videos more easily, seeking to reach Facebook and Instagram users who are spending more time watching videos.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums Singapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes What Do US Vehicle Regulators Have Against Tiny Cars? For a Master of Brutalist Provocations, a Modest Museum Appraisal\n\nThe new features, which will be available broadly next year, will let advertisers use generative AI to turn static images into video ads, the company announced Tuesday. Marketers will also be able to edit and adjust the size of video ads automatically.\n\nMeta has been steadily launching new AI tools for advertisers. The company already helps marketers automatically create text and images that can appear in ads, and has long used artificial intelligence to help brands find and target their ideal customers. Last month, advertisers created more than 15 million ads using Meta’s generative AI tools, the company said.\n\nThe social media giant has been pushing heavily into video as it seeks to increase the amount of time people spend on its Facebook and Instagram apps, which, in turn, lets the company show more ads.\n\nAs part of those efforts, Meta is adding a new video feed to its Facebook app that will allow users to watch videos in full-screen mode. The new feed will combine short-form videos called Reels, livestream content and longer-form videos.\n\nMeta last week unveiled a new AI tool for generating and editing videos from a text prompt, which is designed to help users post more video content to its sites. Facebook and Instagram users now spend 60% of their time on the apps watching video content, the company said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer October Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program commented on the latest stronger-than-expected jobs report, calling it “good news” and expressed surprise at how the stocks “roared” on the report.\n\n“For years, we have been taught that when buying yields go up, stocks go down. Ever since the Fed gave us that double rate cut last month, we have been afraid that they have been acting so decisively. Something might be wrong with the economy—something they knew about, but we didn’t.”\n\nJim Cramer was also surprised by bank stock gains. He said that these stocks probably rose because a strong employment situation means fewer bad loans. Cramer also said we might be heading to “no landing at all.”\n\n“People have a collective sigh of relief that we weren’t headed for a crash landing. They held onto their stocks with both hands.”\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he’s talking about. With each company we have mentioned its number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Jim Cramer Thinks Meta is ‘Not Expensive’\n\nd8nn / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\n\nTalking about a bullish analyst note on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) during a program on CNBC, Jim Cramer called the new Ray-Brans “the greatest product.”\n\n“Let me give you a positive note today. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Pivotal (analyst firm), especially regarding Instagram, Reels, and Stories, all of which are expected to come out on top. They recommend buying it with a price target of $780. Keep in mind, this stock is not expensive.”\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its Q2 results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future.\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We are pleased to report that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\n\nWe would like to remind you that achieving these types of returns is never a straight path. From time to time, we might experience volatility — that’s simply part of the investment journey. In fact, wealth creation and volatility go hand in hand. There’s no escaping it; it’s the “price of admission” the market demands. If you take a look at the chart below, you’ll notice the drawdowns META stock has faced over the years, with 2022 standing out as a particularly challenging period, where the stock saw a 75% drop…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer October Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Wood in an interview with Yahoo Finance predicts this could translate into a staggering “trillion-dollar-plus revenue opportunity for Tesla in the next five years.”\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.

Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\n“The company that gets people from point A to point B the fastest, safest, and with the least wait time is going to dominate the market,” Wood explained, emphasizing the high stakes in the race for autonomous technology supremacy.\n\nHer comments come as OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, raised $6.6 billion in a recent funding round, achieving a valuation of approximately $157 billion. ARK Invest has been among the firms investing in OpenAI, signaling Wood’s broader bet on the AI sector.\n\nWood identified OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Alphabet Inc‘s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) as companies “stealing the march” in the AI space.\n\nShe expressed optimism about the development of agentic AI, which she believes will pave the way for increased profitability as companies can charge premium rates for more advanced AI capabilities.\n\nTesla’s \"We, Robot\" event is scheduled for Thursday at 10 p.m. EDT, with investors hoping that the event will give a lift to the stock.\n\nSee Also: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.

Read them carefully before investing.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy It Matters: Addressing concerns about OpenAI’s recent executive departures, Wood praised the leadership of CEO Sam Altman and CFO Sarah Friar. She noted that rapid growth often necessitates management changes, stating, “What we witness in companies that are growing very quickly from startup into scaling is you need a different kind of management team.”\n\nOn the topic of AI companies potentially going public, Wood observed a trend of firms staying private longer. She cited regulatory burdens and short-term investor mindsets in public markets as deterrents. However, she suggested that lower interest rates and increased investor patience for long-term strategies could make public offerings more attractive in the future.\n\nTurning back to Tesla, Wood addressed the company’s long-promised autonomous driving capabilities. “It’s no longer a question of if, but when, for Tesla,” she said, pointing to Google-owned Waymo’s progress as evidence that autonomous driving is becoming a reality.\n\nWood’s firm has published a model on its website and GitHub, allowing investors to explore various scenarios for the autonomous vehicle market’s growth. According to their research, the platform opportunity for companies hosting autonomous networks could represent a “$4 to $5 trillion revenue opportunity over the next 5 to 10 years.”\n\nThe ARK Venture Fund agreed to invest at least $250 million in OpenAI’s historic funding round. This investment marks ARK’s second in the AI firm, which has been pivotal in the generative AI space since launching ChatGPT.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

        "title": "Meta Platforms Just Hinted That Nvidia Is Going to Have a Monster 2025",
        "content": "As we enter the final quarter of 2024, some investors might be thinking about how they want to position their portfolio heading into 2025. This includes assessing winners and losers, and if you bought Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock at the start of the year, you're sitting on some nice gains.\n\nWith the stock rising around 150% so far in 2024, investors would be forgiven for thinking that it couldn't rise any higher. However, some hints on other companies' conference calls indicate that 2025 will be just as good a year for the company as 2024 has been. The question is, will the stock see the same benefit?\n\nMeta is going to buy a bunch more GPUs in 2025\n\nNvidia's incredible rise has been tied to the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race. Its primary product is the graphics processing unit (GPU), which can be used to perform multiple calculations in parallel. Additionally, companies don't just buy one or two of these units. Instead, they buy them by the thousands. This gives AI researchers ridiculous computing power and allows them to train AI models quickly.\n\nAs these models get more complex, the amount of time it takes to train them rises exponentially. Take Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) Llama generative AI model, for instance. The current iteration is Llama 3.1, but Meta has already started training Llama 4. However, CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that the training time for Llama 4 will likely be 10 times as long as it took to train Llama 3. Beyond Llama 4, the training time will likely increase again.\n\nThis isn't just a Meta problem. OpenAI's ChatGPT, Alphabet's Gemini, and other generative AI models will experience the same phenomenon as these models improve and become more complex.\n\nDo you think these AI innovators will just wait 10 times longer for their next AI model to train? Probably not. Instead, they'll increase their computing power to speed up the process, significantly benefiting Nvidia.\n\nIn its Q2 earnings release, Meta also commented that its infrastructure cost expense will significantly rise in 2025. This is clearly tied to its computing power build-out to create the best AI model it can. Nvidia will be a primary beneficiary of this, making it an intriguing stock for 2025.\n\nNvidia should have strong growth in 2025\n\nNvidia also has some tricks up its sleeve for 2025. Its Blackwell technology is expected to launch and, according to CEO Jensen Huang, provides 3 to 5 times more AI throughput in a power-limited data center than Hopper, Nvidia's current architecture. That's a big deal, and Blackwell could become a new source of revenue growth for Nvidia. Currently, demand for Blackwell is \"well above supply,\" according to management.\n\nThis is just part of the reason why Wall Street analysts believe that Nvidia can grow fiscal year 2026 (ending January 2026) revenue by 42%. It also expects strong earnings growth, with earnings per share (EPS) expected to rise from $2.84 in fiscal 2025 to $4.02 in fiscal 2026. At today's prices, that would value the stock at around 30 times fiscal 2026 earnings.\n\nConsidering Nvidia's growth, that's not a terrible price to pay for the stock if it can keep up its business past fiscal 2026.\n\nLooking one year out is hard enough, but looking two years out is considerably harder. The major question is whether the demand for Nvidia's GPUs will last past fiscal 2026. If it won't, then Nvidia's not worth buying here. But if it does, Nvidia's stock could be a great purchase right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Meta Stock Returns Pale Next To Peter Thiel's Secretive Data Company Even As Mark Zuckerberg Company's AI Advancements Generate Excitement\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Palantir Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) are among the artificial intelligence stocks that have seen strong gains since early to mid-September. While the former is perched at a record high, the latter, despite its recent strong run, is yet to reclaim its Jan. 2021 peak.\n\nHere’s a look at the relative performance of these two stocks and what the near-term holds for them:\n\nMeta Vs. Palantir: Meta has gained over 68% for the year-to-date period, while Palantir is up a steeper 133%. The data analytics company co-founded by Peter Thiel is the fourth best-performing S&P 500 company this year, while Meta, co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg, holds the 11th spot on the list.\n\nDon’t Miss Out:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.

This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Interest rates are falling but you can still make high yields in real estate. Find out how.\n\nBoth stocks have outperformed the broader market, as represented by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) – an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 Index.\n\nValuations of both stocks have become expensive following the recent spike. The forward price-earnings ratio for Palantir is currently at a hefty 95.2 but Meta is trading at a more modest forward P/E valuation of 24.75. The social media giant’s P/E ratio is fairly in line with 21.3 which is applicable to the communications services sector.\n\nThe Palantir Rally: Palantir has been on an uptrend since it gap-opened higher on Sept. 9, the first session after the S&P Dow Jones Indices said the company would be added to the S&P 500 Index, effective prior to the start of trading on Sept. 23. Commenting on the feat, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said, “The profitability profile of this story has significantly been bolstered with this another validation moment for the Palantir story.”\n\nAlthough there was a ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ moment after the inclusion, the stock has been grinding solidly higher since the start of October.\n\nMeta Connects With Investors: After the early August broader market swoon set in motion by yen carry-trade unwinding, Meta’s stock found its feet shortly after and climbed higher until mid-August. The stock experienced a mild pullback that lasted through mid-September.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe two-day Meta Connect conference held on Sept. 25-26 saw the company announcing a slew of products and other offerings. These include AI-driven chatbots, an updated Llama large-language model, the latest Ray-Ban smart glasses with improved camera functionality, voice controls, and deeper integration with AI, Meta Quest 4, the next-generation virtual reality headset, and the Orion augmented reality glasses.\n\nThe stock has been on a steady climb since then.\n\nTrending: Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\nFurther Upside? The average analysts’ price targets, compiled by TipRanks, suggest modest upside potential for Meta but downside for Palantir.\n\nCurrent Price 1-Year AverageAnalysts’ Price Target Upside/Downside Potential Meta $595.94 $608.20 +2.06% Palantir $40.01 $27.67 (-30.84%)\n\nThe next big catalyst for Meta is likely to be the company’s third-quarter results due on Oct. 30, with the consensus modeling over 30% earnings per share growth and nearly 20% revenue growth. Meta’s fortunes to a large extent is tied to ad spending, which in turn hinges on macroeconomic conditions. With the Fed showing a proclivity to take rates down in the coming months, credit conditions could ease, potentially benefiting Meta.\n\nPalantir is a favorite among retail investors. Continuing deal flow, and strong third-quarter results and positive fourth-quarter guidance could keep the upward momentum intact.\n\nMore importantly, the market has entered a seasonally strong quarter when a confluence of factors typically lifts the market. The stretched valuations, therefore, may not preclude further gains. That said, investors may remain wary of geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds, with two wars ongoing and a hard-landing scenario still not off the table.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

        "title": "What's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy If Kamala Harris Wins in November?",
        "content": "The stock market has performed pretty well as the Biden-Harris administration draws to a close. Despite the steep decline in 2022, the S&P 500 has soared nearly 50%. Much of this performance was driven by huge gains for the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nCould this momentum continue in a Kamala Harris administration? And, if so, what's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Harris wins in November? Kamala Harris. Official White House photo by Lawrence Jackson.\n\nHarris' proposals that could affect the Magnificent Seven\n\nHarris has unveiled a wide range of economic proposals. Her campaign released an 82-page document outlining what she'd like to do to create what she calls \"an opportunity economy.\" Not all of the proposals in this document affect the Magnificent Seven, but several could.\n\nThe vice president's plan to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% has received significant media attention. Although this is a large increase, it's still lower than the maximum corporate tax rate of 39% that was in place before former President Donald Trump's tax cuts went into effect in 2018.\n\nAnother Harris proposal is to quadruple the tax rate on corporate stock buybacks. The rationale behind this plan is \"to encourage businesses to invest in growth and productivity.\"\n\nHarris also wants the federal government to invest in industries that are important to the country's economic and national security. Her plan specifically identifies the following types of businesses that would be eligible for tax credits:\n\nAerospace companies Artificial intelligence (AI) data centers Automobile manufacturers Biotechnology companies Clean energy manufacturers Semiconductor manufacturers Steel and iron producers\n\nEvaluating the impact of these proposals\n\nIn theory, the members of the Magnificent Seven -- Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) -- would be affected equally by Harris' proposed corporate tax rate increase. However, in practice, this change could impact the big companies differently.\n\nThe following table shows the effective tax rates paid by the Magnificent Seven in their most recent fiscal years:\n\nCompany Effective Tax Rate Alphabet 13.9% Amazon 9.73% Apple 14.7% Meta Platforms 17.6% Microsoft 18% Nvidia 12% Tesla (50% Tax Benefit)\n\nData sources: Company 10-K filings. *Tesla received more tax benefits than it paid in taxes in 2023.\n\nAs you can see, none of the Magnificent Seven companies paid the full 21% corporate tax rate. Microsoft and Meta had the highest effective tax rates of the group. However, all of the companies have been adept at using the tax code to their advantage.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat about stock buybacks? Most of the Magnificent Seven members have repurchased shares in significant amounts. Apple has by far spent the most money on stock buybacks -- $70.6 billion in the nine months ended July 1, 2023. Increased taxes on stock buybacks could cause Apple and others to change their capital deployment strategies. However, I don't expect this would significantly impact their stock performance or underlying businesses.\n\nEach of these companies could benefit from the tax credits for AI data centers proposed by Harris. As the three largest cloud services providers, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet might be the biggest winners on this front. However, Nvidia could also be helped quite a bit because its GPUs are used heavily in AI data centers. In addition, Nvidia and Tesla could potentially receive tax credits offered to semiconductor makers and automakers, respectively.\n\nThe best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Harris wins\n\nSo what's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Harris wins the presidential race? The honest answer is that there's insufficient information to know which stock might benefit the most from the aforementioned policies proposed by the vice president. Furthermore, it's uncertain if she would be able to implement all of her plans should she be elected. The U.S. Congress advances legislation; the president only signs the bills into law.\n\nThat said, many economists believe that Harris' economic policies would help control inflation, while Trump's plans (especially his proposed tariffs) could cause inflation to rise. If these economists are right, interest rates would more likely be lower during a Harris administration than they would otherwise be.\n\nWhile all the Magnificent Seven stocks should benefit from a lower-rate environment, I think the best pick of the group is Amazon. The company has a substantial debt load, which makes it a potentially bigger beneficiary of lower rates than the other Magnificent Seven members. Lower interest rates could also boost consumer and corporate spending, helping Amazon's e-commerce, advertising, and cloud services businesses.\n\nRegardless of which person occupies the White House over the next four years, Amazon should benefit from the shift of IT spending to the cloud from on-premises. This migration will likely be accelerated by AI advances.\n\nSurprisingly, Amazon stock has only climbed around 12% during Harris' time as VP. I suspect it could deliver much greater gains if she becomes president and interest rates decline further.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,006!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $42,905!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $388,128!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 7, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 of Wall Street's Most Influential Stocks Can Plunge if Kamala Harris Wins in November",
        "content": "Four weeks from today, on Nov. 5, voters will determine which direction our great country takes over the next four years.\n\nAlthough not every bill that comes out of Washington, D.C., has bearing on the stock market, the economic proposals that are, ultimately, put into place by the incoming president and Congress will help shape the landscape for corporate America in the coming years. Kamala Harris delivering remarks. Image source: Official White House Photo by Adam Schultz.\n\nCurrent vice president and Democratic Party presidential nominee Kamala Harris has proposed sweeping changes designed to lower food and drug costs, expand a variety of tax credits for middle-class families, and wants to reduce the federal deficit by raising the corporate tax rate by 33%.\n\nWhile some businesses would likely thrive with Harris in the White House, other high-flying companies may struggle.\n\nWhat follows are three of Wall Street's most-influential stocks that can plunge if Kamala Harris wins in November.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first highly influential business that could find the going tough if Harris proves victorious in November is social media colossusMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, among other social sites.\n\nMeta sits atop the pedestal when it comes to social media websites. For the June-ended quarter, it attracted 3.27 billion daily active users across its family apps. No other social platform comes close to generating this level of daily visits, which is what provides Meta with exceptional ad-pricing power more often than not.\n\nThe concern for Meta is the potential for Harris and her administration to go after monopoly like businesses. In an interview with CNN while running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019, Harris suggested that she wanted to \"take a serious look\" at breaking up the company, and alluded that Meta (formerly known as Facebook) was \"essentially a utility that has gone unregulated.\"\n\nAdmittedly, the political views of elected officials can and do change over time. It's not clear if Harris still believes that Mark Zuckerberg's company is in need of stronger regulations designed to protect consumer privacy interests. Nevertheless, her remarks from 2019 signal the very real possibility of pitting the Harris administration against some of Wall Street's most dominant companies.\n\nThe other reason Meta Platforms might struggle if Harris wins in November is her aforementioned plan to raise the corporate tax rate by a third -- from 21% to 28%. Even though Meta is quite profitable from its advertising operations, a higher tax rate would expose the widening losses it's contending with from its Reality Labs segment. This is the operating division focused on augmented/virtual reality devices and the company's metaverse ambitions, among other projects.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile a higher corporate tax rate has historically been positive for the benchmark S&P 500, this might not be the case for Meta Platforms. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNovo Nordisk\n\nA second market-leading company that could struggle mightily if Kamala Harris wins in four weeks is Danish-based pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk(NYSE: NVO).\n\nNovo Nordisk found its way into the spotlight thanks to its blockbuster duo of injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. Ozempic is approved as a type 2 diabetes and long-term weight management treatment, while Wegovy is a weight management therapy for patients with at least one weight-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure. GLP-1 drugs are the first prescription weight-loss breakthrough from big pharma in quite some time.\n\nHowever, Harris has made bringing prescription drug costs down a key theme of her campaign. While the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris administration praised Eli Lilly for lowering the cost of GLP-1 drug Zepbound in August, it's called on other GLP-1 drugmakers to follow suit.\n\nNovo Nordisk doesn't seem eager to heed that call. The company's CEO, Lars Jorgensen, defended his company's stance in front of a U.S. Senate committee in September to charge $1,349 (retail) for a 28-day supply of Wegovy and $968 (retail) for a 28-day supply of Ozempic. Novo Nordisk is heavily reliant on Ozempic to propel future earnings growth. Not to mention, Wall Street is counting on Ozempic to buoy the company's outsized earnings multiple -- 27 times forward-year earnings.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding domestic drug pricing and what Harris would be able to accomplish in the Oval Office might be enough to halt what's been nothing short of a parabolic move higher for Novo Nordisk over the last three years.\n\nApple\n\nThe third highly influential stock that could plunge if Kamala Harris wins in November is none other than Wall Street's largest publicly traded company by market cap, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Interestingly enough, this is a company that may also struggle if Donald Trump wins.\n\nApple is best-known for being a dominant force in tech products, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. But the lion's share of the company's growth at the moment traces back to its Services segment. CEO Tim Cook is overseeing a multiyear transformation that's emphasizing the importance subscription services. A subscription-driven model should, ideally, improve the company's operating margin over time and smooth out the revenue valleys that often occur during iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nBut Apple could face something of a double whammy if Harris were to win and is able to implement the full scope of her economic proposals.\n\nTo begin with, raising the corporate tax rate by 33% would potentially leave Apple with less capital to funnel toward share buybacks. No public company has more directly benefited from share repurchases than Apple.\n\nSince the start of 2013, Apple has repurchased $700.6 billion worth of its common stock, which has helped to increase its earnings per share (EPS) from what would be less than $4 in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30, 2024) if it had never bought back its stock, to a consensus estimate of $6.68 per share in the current fiscal year. Without significant buybacks, Apple's stalled growth engine would be exposed.\n\nAdditionally, Kamala Harris has proposed taxing unrealized capital gains. Although this tax is strictly focused on individuals with net wealth above $100 million, a lot of the wealthiest tax payers are likely to have a stake, directly or via exchange-traded fund, in Wall Street's largest company by market cap.\n\nWhether it's Donald Trump's proposed 60% tariff on imports from China or Harris's plan to increase taxes on the ultra-wealthy and businesses, there's a real possibility Apple comes out a loser on Nov. 5.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Facebook, YouTube and TikTok users in Europe get forum to challenge social media content decisions",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Social media users in the European Union will soon have a new forum to challenge decisions by platforms to remove posts and videos for breaking their rules or leave up others that may violate them.\n\nAn “out of court dispute settlement body” named the Appeals Center Europe said Tuesday it has been certified by Irish regulators to act as a referee on content moderation disputes across the 27-nation EU, starting with cases involving Facebook, YouTube and TikTok.\n\nThe center is similar to Meta’s Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body set up in 2020 that acts like a supreme court for thorny decisions about content moderation issues on Facebook, Instagram and Threads submitted by users around the world.\n\nUnder the EU's digital rulebook known as the Digital Services Act, or DSA, tech companies and social media platforms are required to work with dispute settlement bodies and comply with any decisions they make. EU officials in Brussels wanted to give EU citizens a way to challenge any decisions made by Big Tech companies as they sought to balance the right to free speech against the goal of curbing online risks.\n\nThe center will hear appeals from users or groups located in the EU about “everything from violence and incitement to hate speech to bullying and harassment,” CEO Thomas Hughes said.\n\n“It could be everything from a case that relates to a head of state all the way through to a neighborly dispute,” Hughes said.\n\nThe Digital Services Act is a sweeping set of regulations that requires tech and social media companies operating in Europe to clean up their platforms under threat of hefty fines.\n\nThe Appeals Center, based in Dublin, where many Silicon Valley tech companies have their European headquarters, will start hearing complaints from users before the end of the year. It's initially dealing with Facebook, YouTube and TikTok users because it wanted to start with the biggest platforms, with plans to add others later. Unlike the Oversight Board, which can cherry pick the biggest and most important cases, the center will have to rule on every case it gets.\n\nThe Oversight Board both issues binding decisions on individual cases, such as ruling in September on three separate posts with the controversial Palestinian rallying cry “ from the river to the sea,\" and also weighs in on wider policy issues with non-binding recommendations, such as guidance in July on updating Meta's policies on non-consensual deepfakes after reviewing a case involving deepfake intimate images of two women.\n\nThe Appeals Center’s decisions, in contrast, will be limited to whether content such as a post, photo or video violates each platform’s rules.\n\nStory continues\n\nHughes said the center will hire staff from across the EU to handle what he said could be up to tens of thousands of cases each year. The staff will have expertise in specific regions, languages and policy areas.\n\nMeta's Oversight Board is providing 15 million euros ($16.5 million) in startup funding, said Hughes, who was previously the Oversight Board's director. He added that the two bodies will operate separately but will “point in the same direction in terms of platform accountability and transparency, user rights” and applying a human rights framework to online speech.\n\nThe Appeals Center will fund its ongoing operations by charging tech companies 95 euros for every case it hears, as well as a 5 euro fee from users who raise disputes. This \"nominal\" fee is intended to stop people from “gaming or abusing” the system and will be refunded if a user wins, Hughes said.\n\nThe decisions are not binding, but users will still get their money back if the center rules in favor of their disputes, regardless of the action the platform does or does not take.\n\nThere's a 90-day deadline for decisions, but in most cases they will be made much more quickly, he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Barbara Ortutay in San Francisco contributed to this report.\n\nView comments",

These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone. It witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\n\nMeta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\n\nShares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the year-to-date period (+7.8% vs. +7.1%). The company’s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. Splunk acquisition enhances its recurring revenue base.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco’s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco’s security portfolio.\n\nHowever, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition.

Robust momentum in smoke-free products, IQOS and ZYN, along with combustible pricing, has been working well for the company. Higher pricing variance and solid cost efforts aided the bottom line amid strong currency headwinds in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe consistent success of IQOS and the noteworthy economics of ZYN have further solidified the company’s position, keeping it well-placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2030. These upsides encouraged management to raise its guidance for 2024, wherein net revenues are likely to increase 7.5-9% on an organic basis.\n\nHowever, Philip Morris expects SG&A expenses to remain high in the third quarter due to its planned key commercial activities.

It reported a net profit of $1.1 million against the prior year’s loss.\n\nRxCompound’s licensing in 22 states provides significant expansion potential, and synergies with Peaks’ telemedicine platform enhance growth opportunities. Despite a strong balance sheet, the company faces risks including reliance on key customers, rising expenses, supplier concentration and regulatory hurdles.\n\nWhile its 75% gross margin supports profitability, challenges in cost control and supply-chain disruptions could impact future performance.

        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Meta Platforms (META) standing at $584.88, reflecting a -1.86% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.96%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.94%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.18%.\n\nThe social media company's shares have seen an increase of 19.12% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 7.35% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.3%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Meta Platforms in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on October 30, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $5.15, indicating a 17.31% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $40.08 billion, up 17.38% from the year-ago period.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $21.36 per share and revenue of $161.62 billion. These totals would mark changes of +43.64% and +19.8%, respectively, from last year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.3% higher within the past month. Currently, Meta Platforms is carrying a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nIn terms of valuation, Meta Platforms is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 27.9. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 30.53.\n\nMeanwhile, META's PEG ratio is currently 1.47. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. Internet - Software stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.03 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 74, finds itself in the top 30% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Meta Platforms META announced new features for Facebook and Messenger on Friday at its Facebook IRL event in Austin. These features will help Facebook users, particularly young adults (18-29-year-olds), access and discover content beyond their close friends.\r\n\r\nMETA is launching Messenger Communities, which offers a new way for small-to-medium-sized communities to connect over shared interests.\n\nMETA’s New Local & Video Tab to Boost Facebook’s Users\n\nMeta Platforms is leveraging AI to boost Facebook’s appeal among young adults, a demography that used to prefer Alphabet’s GOOGL YouTube and Snapchat.\r\n\r\nAs a part of this initiative, META is launching a single tab Local that brings together content curated from places like Marketplace, Groups and Events. \r\n\r\nWeekly and Weekend Digest for Events are a compilation of upcoming event recommendations delivered to users through a notification on Facebook. META is testing an Explore Tab that will offer varied content to Facebook users. \r\n\r\nIt is also set to launch a full-screen Video tab under which users can find Reels and other videos they love. This is expected to boost Facebook’s popularity among young adults who roughly spend 60% of their time watching videos.\n\nGroup AI, Matchmaker - New Features From META\n\nMETA is testing a customizable Group AI that will help members of a Facebook Group find answers to questions that have been previously asked. \r\n\r\nMeta Platforms launched Matchmaker, a new feature on Facebook Dating that allows users to invite up to five friends to swipe for potential matches on their behalf.\r\n\r\nMETA has started rolling out Meta AI and is on track to achieve its goal of becoming the most used AI assistant by the end of the year. Meta AI is currently available in more than 20 countries and eight languages. \r\n\r\nIn the United States, Meta Platforms is rolling out new features like Imagine edit, which allows people to edit images they generate with Meta AI. \r\n\r\nMETA’s Llama family of foundation models has been a game changer. The latest Llama 3.1 includes the first frontier-level open-source model, as well as new and industry-leading small and medium-sized models. It is already working on Llama 4, which is expected to boost META’s capability in the long run.\n\nMETA Shares Ride on Expanding User Base\n\nMeta Platforms shares have returned 69.7% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 23.5% and the Zacks Internet Software industry’s appreciation of 24.1%. \r\n\r\nExcept for NVIDIA NVDA, it has outperformed the rest of “Magnificent 7” over the same time frame.

        "title": "Google is about to learn how DOJ wants to remake its empire",
        "content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is about to find out what the Justice Department believes should be done to dismantle the tech giant’s dominance of the online search market.\n\nProsecutors are expected to submit a document as early as Tuesday in federal court outlining potential remedies after successfully arguing in a landmark trial that Google acted as an illegal monopoly.\n\nIt will be up to District of Columbia District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who sided with DOJ’s monopoly argument, to decide what should happen now in a separate \"remedies\" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025.\n\nPotential remedies range from an outright breakup of Google, to making its search engine data available to competitors, to ending agreements that secure its search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers. Judge Amit Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, will decide what remedies Google should face. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) (Mark Wilson via Getty Images)\n\n\"I think it's going to be more complicated coming up with injunctive relief than it was finding the liability,\" antitrust attorney Carl Hittinger said.\n\nGoogle has promised to appeal. And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google's behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.’s Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal.\n\nAnd even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored.\n\nA breakup\n\nCertainly, a breakup of Google’s empire — the most rare of antitrust remedies — has the most potential to reorder the tech universe.\n\nThat could include divestitures of its Android operating system, Chrome browser, or AdWords platform — all of which steer users into Google search.\n\nAny one of the three solutions would rip away a multibillion-dollar revenue stream from the tech giant, plus cut off data that fuels its broader search and advertising ecosystem.\n\nLegal experts disagree about whether this will actually happen. Hittinger said it’s unlikely because Judge Mehta must select a remedy that best serves the public interest.\n\n\"You can't just yank the rug out from under the American public that's been using Google's service, now ingrained in our culture, without a substitute,\" Hittinger said. \"Unless other competitors have a platform which is the same or better than Google, what's the public supposed to use in the meantime?\"\n\nA divestment of Android away from Google could have consequences for devices aside from those installed on devices used for internet search. Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai departs federal court last October after testifying to defend his company in the largest antitrust case since the 1990s. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nPeloton, for example, uses the open sourced system to power its exercise equipment. Airplane manufacturers use it to power video screens, and supermarkets use it to run their consumer kiosks.\n\nStory continues\n\nDevelopers also rely on Google to maintain Android’s ability to work across platforms.\n\nHittinger expects Judge Mehta to fashion a remedy similar to the one imposed against Xerox (XRX) in 1975 to end its dominance of the office copier market.\n\nThe company was no longer allowed to configure its copiers so that ink cartridge suppliers and other third-party components could not run on its machines.\n\nBut Bill Baer, former attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division, said he could foresee Judge Mehta requiring Google to divest Android or Chrome.\n\n\"The judge, in order to make this remedy meaningful, is going to have to do something that allows competition to flourish,\" Baer said.\n\n\"Because they're a monopolist, they charge the advertisers, who in turn charge us, a whole lot more than if the market were competitive.\"\n\nExclusive contracts\n\nOne likely scenario, antitrust lawyers said, is for the judge to put an end to agreements that secure Google’s search engine as a default on internet browsers and internet-connected devices that use Google’s Android operating system.\n\nGoogle pays as much as $26 billion per year to maintain its position on mobile devices like Apple (AAPL) and Samsung smartphones.\n\nProskauer antitrust lawyer Colin Kass said he suspects Judge Mehta to be particularly receptive to remedies that undo those contracts because their anti-competitive effects were at the heart of the ruling.\n\n\"This was a relatively narrow complaint and an even narrower ruling,\" Kass said.\n\nRepresentatives from Apple and other companies that benefit from the contracts testified that they chose Google for the quality of its search engine. Competing evidence from the DOJ showed Microsoft's Bing search engine attracted more users on its Edge browser when Google was not the default option.\n\nAn end to these revenue-sharing contracts would have considerable consequences for Google and Apple.\n\nThe contracts — which require Apple to install Google Search as the default across its Safari browser, Spotlight Search, and Siri — bring in an estimated $20 plus billion for Apple each year.\n\nTargeted search platforms like Yelp (YELP) and Amazon (AMZN) could also benefit from fewer search users being automatically directed to Google. CEO of Apple Tim Cook. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nTim McGinn, an antitrust litigation attorney with Gunster, said device manufacturers and browser services could choose Google as a default even if a court blocks Google from default placement agreements.\n\nPlus, he said, it's possible that the court could still allow Google to secure default placements for search but under new non-exclusive contracts that don’t raise antitrust concerns.\n\nIf Google can't get default placement any longer, it could also be required to give consumers a choice of search provider.\n\nMcGinn predicted the DOJ would ask that mobile devices, browsers, and wireless carriers give consumers a choice between search providers.\n\n\"It’s possible we’ll eventually see more phones and browsers pre-programmed to use another search engine,\" McGinn said.\n\nLast year, the European Union’s antitrust regulator, the European Commission, required Google to give a choice screen based on its determination that the lack of choice violated its antitrust law.\n\nSharing data with rivals\n\nThe DOJ could also ask the judge to force Google to share with rival browsers and search providers its “click and query” data that it uses to refine its search algorithms.\n\nSpecifically, the data includes Google’s intellectual property that tracks and learns from information that its search engine users type into its search field and links they choose by clicking on query results.\n\nRival US search providers include Microsoft (MSFT) Bing, Yahoo Search, and DuckDuckGo. International search providers include Russia’s Yandex and China’s Bidau.\n\nA spokesman for DuckDuckGo told Yahoo Finance before the trial that the company hoped the case would result in Google having to share its click and query data.\n\nThe data could help more privacy oriented browsers like DuckDuckGo and search engines compete against Google.\n\nThe spokesman said it can be more difficult for DuckDuckGo to attract advertisers because, unlike Google, it does not assemble user search profiles or search histories and then use that data to target users with advertisements.\n\nAnother remedy that some legal experts expect to be on the DOJ’s list is for Google to temporarily open up its internet index data to rival browser providers, such as Microsoft’s Edge, Apple’s Safari, Mozilla’s Firefox, Brave, and Opera.\n\nAI\n\nEven if Google were forced to divest search-related entities, or unravel contracts for default placement, these moves may not have a dramatic effect on the company, according to Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill.\n\nIts bigger threats, Thill said, are from new AI-assisted search engines and recent gains made by rival Meta in attracting advertisers.\n\n\"I don't think spinning off a browser or an Android operating system is going to have a dramatic impact on the company,\" Thill said.\n\nJudge Mehta, however, may have to consider how remedies to restore competition in the traditional search engine market may impact competition in the emerging market for AI-assisted search.\n\nOne concern, legal experts said, is that Google's search dominance could unfairly entrench its position in the market for next generation search.\n\nAt the same time, these fresh threats may work to Google’s advantage in the remedies trial, allowing it to argue that its overall search dominance is already under threat.\n\n\"If a violation is found, Google will say the market is already solving itself,\" said former US Federal Trade Commission Chairman and George Washington University antitrust law professor William Kovacic.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Betting Big on These FAANG Stocks, and This $700 Billion Opportunity Explains Why",
        "content": "The stock market is the greatest wealth-building machine ever created, and it's available to anyone with a little money to invest. Over a quarter of those on the Forbes 400 list of the richest people in America built their wealth on Wall Street.\n\nYou can tag along with the most successful investors by following their disclosures with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Every quarter, investors with over $100 million under management are required to report their holdings on SEC form 13F.\n\nThe filings for the second quarter revealed that prominent billionaires continue to favor holding shares of elite tech companies, including the FAANG stocks, which are the following:\n\nMeta Platforms (formerly Facebook) (NASDAQ: META) Apple Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Netflix Alphabet (formerly Google)\n\nSome of the most respected billionaire investors are favoring two stocks on this list that control a growing slice of the $699 billion digital advertising market.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon is the largest holding for Daniel Loeb's Third Point and Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Investors. Amazon is widely known as a go-to shopping destination for over 200 million Prime members, but the online tech titan also has fast-growing revenue streams in several non-retail businesses, and one of those is retail media advertising.\n\nRetail media is the fastest-growing market within digital advertising. It is projected to grow 22% in 2024 to reach $140 billion. Amazon is growing right along with it. The company's advertising revenue grew 20% year over year in the second quarter.\n\nAmazon's advertising revenue is mostly driven by sponsored ads, which the company displays on product pages. But it's also expanding its ad business on Prime Video, where it's in the early stages of growth. The appeal for brands is to get their products in front of a large customer base across Amazon's consumer-facing properties. Brands can advertise their product on a popular e-commerce platform where customers can easily click and make a purchase, which is why retail media is such a fast-growing market.\n\nAmazon's trailing advertising revenue is $51 billion, and at the rate it's growing, it could have a significant impact on the company's profitability. North American operating income jumped 58% year over year last quarter, while Amazon's international segment turned a year-ago loss into an operating profit of $273 million.\n\nBillionaire investors are generally looking for strong companies with clear catalysts for profitable growth, and that's why Loeb and Halvorsen have large bets on Amazon. Analysts expect Amazon's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 22%, which could send the stock soaring in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nChase Coleman's Tiger Global Management held a $3.7 billion stake in Facebook owner Meta Platforms in Q2 -- the firm's top holding. Meta has enormous advantages in the digital advertising market with over 3.2 billion daily active people across its family of apps, including Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp.\n\nThe recovery in the broader ad market over the last year has benefited Meta's share price. Revenue grew 22% year over year in Q2. The company's share of digital ad spending was 21.3% in June, according to eMarketer, which is far higher than competing platforms. The second closest competitor is Alphabet's YouTube at just 5.6% a share.\n\nMeta must walk a delicate line, monetizing its platform with ads while not disrupting the user experience. Meta's large share and recent growth indicate it has mastered this ability to deliver relevant ads that blend with users' interests. In fact, recent improvements to its apps are driving up user engagement.\n\nMeta's investments in artificial intelligence (AI) are paying off, with Meta AI bringing better content recommendations on Facebook and Instagram. This feature is powered by Meta's Llama large language model and has led to billions of search queries by users, which can grow ad impressions and revenue. In Q2, Meta saw a 10% increase in the number of ad impressions and the average price per ad.\n\nAI could drive 94% of ad revenue by 2029, according to GroupM. Meta has tremendous resources to invest in AI infrastructure to create more sophisticated AI models that can benefit advertisers, improve the user experience, and ultimately generate big returns for shareholders.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta's earnings to grow at annualized rate of 17% in the coming years. The stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio is just 24 using 2025 earnings estimates, which is very attractive relative to growth expectations.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) The Best Morgan Stanley Overweight &amp; Quality Stock?",
        "content": "We recently made a list of Morgan Stanley’s Best Overweight & Quality Stocks: Top 25 Stocks. In this piece, we will look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks on the list of the top overweight and quality stocks.\n\nThe close of September has cemented the paradigm shift on Wall Street. With the Federal Reserve’s first interest rate cut being all that investors could hope for as it reduced rates by 50 basis points, since the cut, the flagship S&P stock index and the broader NASDAQ stock index are up by 2% and 3%, respectively. The rate cut has also now moved Wall Street’s focus to the next big catalyst for the stock market, i.e, the third quarter earnings season.\n\nFor a market that has touched new highs this year due to artificial intelligence, the second quarter earnings season was nothing short of fireworks. It saw the AI narrative wobble temporarily after mixed results from the world’s leading AI GPU designer and the semiconductor industry reckoned with the fate of the semiconductor manufacturing stock that ranked 5th on the list of Jim Cramer’s Top 12 Must-Watch Stocks.\n\nStarting with the chip maker, its second quarter earnings were nothing short of a bloodbath. They saw the firm’s non GAAP net income drop by a whopping 85% annually and turn a year ago GAAP net income into a non GAAP loss of $1.6 billion. At the same time, its gross margins dropped by 0.4 percentage points, and in the worst example of the cherry on top, the firm also announced that it will be suspending dividends starting from the fourth quarter. As a result, its shares tanked by 30% after the earnings, and since then, we’ve seen multiple reports claim that other companies are interested in acquiring it.\n\nAs for the GPU designer, its second quarter revenue jumped by 122% – a no small feat considering that the year ago quarter’s revenue was $13.5 billion. However, even as the Q2 revenue of $30 billion beat analyst estimates of $28.7 billion which was fueled by its AI data center division’s revenue jumping by 154% annually, the shares fell by 6% in extended trading. At the heart of the fall was a tepid third quarter guidance of $32.5 billion (analyst estimates were $31.77 billion), a gross margin miss by 0.1 percentage point, a Q3 margin guidance miss by 0.5 percentage points, and the delay of its Blackwell GPU to the fourth quarter. For investors already worried about the ability of AI to generate a profit, the margin miss in particular wasn’t comforting. Consequently, since the earnings report, the firm’s shares are down by 1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, investment bank Morgan Stanley sent the GPU designer’s shares soaring by 6.8% in September in a bullish note that shared that the firm could earn $10 billion in its fourth quarter alone from the latest Blackwell chips. This upgrade came on the back of MS remaining consistent in its analysis of the stock market this year. The key themes that it has identified are the labor market, commercial real estate, and the split in the stock market between large and small cap stocks.\n\nIn July, the bank shared that there was “ample room for equities performance to broaden, but this requires a cyclical recovery.” In simpler terms, it means that MS believed that for small cap equities to catch up to large caps in performance, the economy has to perform well. If you’re wondering how wide this gap is, data shows that for small and medium cap and large cap stocks which are in the top 20% in terms of free cash flow margins, the small and mid caps have a forward price to earnings ratio of 0.74x relative to large caps as of April 2024, which is quite low when compared to the April 2009 peak of 1.62x. MS reiterated this belief in its August report, which shared that small cap outperformance “requires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates. While recent inflation data and the resulting decline in rates was a lift to small cap, softer economic data may constrain its continued outperformance.”\n\nHowever, MS’ September report took somewhat of a different tune. It focused on the clean energy and infrastructure investments in the US to share that these could help some segments of the American stock market that are typically dependent on growth in economic activity. Government spending through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and the CHIPS and Science Act have led to roughly $500 billion in commitments by the private sector to invest in a diverse set of areas ranging from roads, to clean energy manufacturing and heavy industry.\n\nAs per the bank, “Government policies such as the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the Infrastructure Act are sponsoring growth in many areas of U.S. manufacturing. These trends could offer through-the-cycle structural support to areas of the economy that are traditionally very cyclical.” On the data front, MS reveals that while in 2022, US manufacturing capacity as a percentage of 2017 output sat at ~126%, this has jumped to nearly 129% as of 2024.\n\nShifting gears, the third quarter earnings season will soon start to shape how investors view the market. Data from LSEG shows that the flagship S&P index is expected to deliver 5.4% annual earnings growth during Q3. FactSet is more cautious, as it shares that the index should grow earnings by 4.6% annually to mark its sixth straight quarter of growth. MS is of the view that the economy has to continue to deliver on the data front if the stock market is to perform well.\n\nIn a recent podcast, the bank’s chief investment officer and chief strategist, Mike Wilson, shared that “the unemployment rate will need to decline and the payrolls above 140,000 with no negative revisions to prior months. Meanwhile, I am also watching several other variables closely to determine the trajectory of growth. Earnings revision breadth, the best proxy for company guidance, continues to trend sideways for the overall S&P 500 and negatively for the Russell 2000 small cap index. Due to seasonal patterns, this variable is likely to face negative headwinds over the next month.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of Morgan Stanley’s best Overweight and quality stocks, we ranked the bank’s recent list of 66 stocks with Overweight ratings, a higher than median quality score, and one month upward EPS revisions by their percentage one month average analyst revisions. The average EPS data was sourced from Yahoo Finance as of September 26th 2024, and the top 25 stocks with non zero percent revisions were selected.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nNiloo / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 219\n\nAverage Analyst EPS % Revision: 0.2%\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the biggest social media companies in the world. As of March, the firm had 3.2 billion people using its platform. This provides Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)  with a sizeable moat as the firm is able to woo advertisers to its platform. In fact, advertising is the firm’s bread and butter as it accounted for $74 billion out of its $75 billion in revenue for the first half of 2024. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s sizeable resources, as evidenced by its $32 billion in cash and equivalents have also allowed it to invest heavily into artificial intelligence. It is among the handful of companies that have access to foundational AI models, allowing it to build a portfolio of AI products and services. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is offering these to its advertisers and to its social media users, and given the billions it has spent on AI, monetization and profit from these services will prove to be a key driver of the social media company’s hypothesis.\n\nEvercore’s Mark Mahaney is quite optimistic about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s ability to monetize AI. Here’s what he had to say during a recent talk with CNBC:\n\n“If you look at what happened with Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). they went to almost 30% revenue growth, they are growing dollar-wise faster than anybody else that’s because they used AI to rebuild their ad-tech stack because they used AI to rebuild their user interface and get us more engaged, so it actually worked for them.”\n\nOverall META ranks 15th when we look at Morgan Stanley's top overweight stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)’s Stock Price Target Increased Amid Advertising Revenue Rebound; Faces Legal Setback in Europe",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI Superstars According to Goldman Sachs.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nUS technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk.\n\nWhile tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nThis has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave — particularly in software and cloud services.\n\nStory continues\n\nTheir scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants.\n\nLet's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds and hedge fund sentiment is an important indicator that we pay a lot of attention to at Insider Monkey.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. Argus analyst Joseph Bonner recently raised the price target on the stock to $660 from $600 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. In an investor note, the analyst detailed that Meta was benefiting from a re-acceleration in advertising revenue, significant margin expansion as a result of deep cost cuts, and robust cash flow. Per the analyst, the company had also become competitive in the generative artificial intelligence space. Bonner expects AI to begin to pervade Meta's applications to provide another means of optimizing company performance and efficiency.\n\nLatest reports indicate that the top court in Europe has ruled against Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) over the approach of the tech giant to data retention in the continental ad business. The ruling will add hurdles for social media names looking to garner European ad dollars. The Court of Justice of the European Union found in favor of activist Max Schrems, who challenged Facebook Ireland on issues including harvesting data from the social platform indefinitely for targeted advertising.\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "The massive demand for energy as Big Tech races to build its AI infrastructure has been a tailwind for GE Vernova (GEV), the power equipment maker that spun out of iconic GE earlier this year.\n\nShares of the Cambridge, Mass.-based company have been hovering near all-time highs, along with the broader S&P 500 Industrial ETF (XLI), as investors look to play off the electrification and artificial intelligence theme led by AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA).\n\n\"[Vernova] seems to be caught up in the broader trade of AI and power demand,\" Daniel Rich, analyst at CFRA, told Yahoo Finance. The firm has a Buy rating and a price target of $230 on the stock.\n\nMuch of Wall Street's bullishness stems from expectations of power demand growth stemming from Big Tech's commitment to record infrastructure technology investments.\n\nAmazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) are expected to spend a combined $200 billion this year on cloud and AI investments, including building and maintaining data centers. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., May 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nPower demand from infrastructure technologies in the US is expected to more than double by 2030 thanks to use of AI, according to consulting firm McKinsey & Co.\n\n\"Because of how much more power we're going to need —if the projections are accurate to power data centers — to power AI applications, Vernova is definitely a winner,\" he added.\n\nOne Wall Street analyst dubbed the $72 billion company the \"supermarket\" for the electric power industry — from natural gas turbines used to generate electricity to servicing of power plants, modernizing electric grids, and building wind turbines.\n\n\"This company does everything,\" Raymond James managing director Pavel Molchanov told Yahoo Finance in an interview this week.\n\n\"Because the buildout of electric power infrastructure is an all-of-the-above story, that means all of these solutions are going to be needed,\" he added.\n\nVernova's reach is global, with roughly 30% of its revenue stemming from the US. Some of its biggest competitors, like Siemens Energy, Schneider Electric, and ABB, are based abroad.\n\nVernova expects to deliver 70 to 80 heavy-duty gas turbines per year in 2026, up from roughly 55 for the last few years. Servicing those units is also expected to grow substantially.\n\n\"We're seeing increasing demand for power generation, driven by manufacturing growth, industrial electrification, EVs, and emerging data center needs,\" Vernova CEO Scott Strazik said during the company's latest earnings call over the summer.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe recent deal between software giant Microsoft and nuclear power provider Constellation Energy (CEG) to restart a reactor at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island is one recent example of the growing energy demand among Big Tech.\n\nThe partnership has made Morgan Stanley analysts more bullish on the prospects of gas-powered plants adjacent to data centers.\n\n\"We believe a co-located data center and gas-fired power plant utilizing GEV's gas-turbine equipment could be announced in 2025,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Percoco wrote in a note last week.\n\nThe analyst reiterated an Overweight rating and increased his bull case scenario price target on the stock to $397 from $371. A rendering of GE's 7HA gas turbine. (Business Wire) (Business Wire)\n\nVernova stock is up more than 100% since its March spinoff, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 21% year-to-date gain. That's despite negative headlines in the company's most challenged unit — its wind turbines — after incidents of blades breaking off in key offshore projects.\n\nMolchanov from Raymond James cautions the strong run-up means there could be little room to run, though.\n\n\"It’s an S&P 500 stock that has doubled in the last six months. If that sounds a little bit like certain other AI-related companies that people are familiar with, well, that’s not a coincidence,\" said Molchanov.\n\nCalling the AI-fueled rally \"overstretched,\" the analyst and his team downgraded the stock from Outperform to Market Perform based on valuation. Much of the enthusiasm over AI is already baked into Vernova's share price, he said.\n\n\"The bottom line is that we think the stock could use a period of consolidation after its sentiment-driven gains, and we look forward to revisiting our rating if and when the trade becomes less crowded,\" he said.\n\nThe stock has 19 Buy, six Hold, and two Sell analyst recommendations.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Prediction: These 2 Stocks Will Join Nvidia, Meta, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft in the Trillion-Dollar Club by 2030",
        "content": "Getting to a $1 trillion market cap is such a challenging milestone that only a handful of corporations have done it. The list includes several tech giants, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Though this elite club is highly exclusive, more companies will eventually join it. Stocks that are headed that way might be worth serious consideration. Let's look at two: Visa(NYSE: V) and Novo Nordisk(NYSE: NVO). These companies could be trillion-dollar stocks by 2030.\n\n1. Visa\n\nVisa runs one of the largest payment networks in the world, helping facilitate millions of daily credit card transactions. The company has delivered excellent returns during the past decade as cash transactions continue to be replaced by other payment forms. Visa's market cap is just under $550 billion as of this writing -- so it needs a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 10.5% to become a trillion-dollar company by the end of 2030. That's well within the company's powers. For one, Visa has performed much better than that during the past decade. V Total Return Level Chart\n\nOf course, that doesn't guarantee the company will deliver the same returns in the future, but some of the underlying factors that led to such solid performances in the past for the business are still in place. Visa remains a leader in its industry, with its only true noteworthy competitor being Mastercard(NYSE: MA). Visa still benefits from network effects: The more people carry credit cards that bear its logo, the more attractive its ecosystem becomes to merchants, and vice versa. That helps ensure that it will remain a major player in this industry for a while.\n\nVisa also still has plenty of room to grow. Credit card penetration is relatively high in many developed countries, but not so in others. In developing countries, there is even more potential. Visa sees a $20 trillion opportunity across a range of payments it can capture. The company's revenue of about $35 billion in the trailing 12-month period is a tiny percentage of that total. If Visa can make headway in its addressable market, the company's revenue, earnings, and stock price should move in the same direction they have during the past 10 years.\n\nThe company is well-equipped to deliver a CAGR of more than 10.5% through 2030.\n\n2. Novo Nordisk\n\nAs of this writing, Novo Nordisk's market cap is about $400 billion. To hit $1 trillion, it would need a CAGR of about 16.5%. That would be an impressive average to maintain for six years, but Novo Nordisk has been more than impressive recently. Brand names like Wegovy and Ozempic have become famous. Both are GLP-1 medicines that treat obesity and diabetes, respectively. Novo Nordisk has been one of the pioneers in the GLP-1 weight loss market, which is now attracting pharmaceutical companies left and right.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome analysts estimate that the weight loss drug market will hit $150 billion by the early 2030s -- it was worth just $24 billion last year. And although there will be plenty of challengers, Novo Nordisk's pipeline in this field is second to none. The company's most promising programs include an oral medicine called amycretin, and CagriSema, which some have estimated could generate as much as $20.2 billion in revenue by 2030.\n\nThat barely scratches the surface of Novo Nordisk's pipeline, though. Semaglutide (the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic) is being tested in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, two areas with high unmet needs. The company is developing several other diabetes and obesity medicines, and a range of treatments for various rare diseases. Novo Nordisk's revenue has grown rapidly during the past five years, as have its stock price and market cap. NVO Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nThe drugmaker should earn important approvals during the next few years, which will help it continue generating excellent financial results through the end of the decade. Becoming a trillion-dollar stock by 2030 is well within Novo Nordisk's reach, and it should continue beating the market beyond that.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Alphabet 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Alphabet is one of the world's largest companies. With a market cap of $2 trillion, there are only a handful of stocks that can compete with its size.\n\nHowever, there are companies that could grow even larger than Alphabet within the next five years. Here, I'll cover two that could pull off that feat: MetaPlatforms (NASDAQ: META) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nAs of this writing, Meta Platforms' market cap stands at about $1.5 trillion. That trails Alphabet by a little more than $500 billion.\n\nYet while Meta is only 75% the size of Alphabet, I think it could overtake its rival in the very near future. Here's why.\n\nFirst, Meta is enormous. The company can claim nearly 3.3 billion daily active users (DAUs) across its platforms, which include Facebook and Instagram. That means more than a third of the global population uses Meta's platform regularly.\n\nAccordingly, given the size of its user base, the company reaps an enormous windfall in terms of ad revenue. In its most recently reported quarter, Meta tallied $38.3 billion in ad revenue. That works out to about $425 million per day.\n\nTrue, Alphabet makes even more in ad revenue right now, but it's facing some challenges in its key category of internet search. That's to say nothing of the recent federal antitrust ruling that labeled the company a monopoly.\n\nIn short, Meta's bread and butter is ad revenue, and it's an area that is not only highly lucrative -- Meta's operating margin is a stout 38% -- it's growing like a weed. The company's overall revenue grew by 22% in its most recent quarter, despite its size.\n\nIn other words, Meta has plenty of gas in the tank to catch Alphabet by 2029 -- if not sooner.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nIf Meta still has a sizable gap to overtake Alphabet, Amazon has only a tiny crack. As of this writing, Amazon's market cap of $1.9 trillion trails Alphabet's market cap by about $100 billion, or roughly 5%.\n\nIndeed, during the past 10 years, these two companies have traded places several times, with Alphabet holding a steady lead from 2014-2018. Amazon edged ahead from 2018-2022, only to see Alphabet retake the lead in recent years.\n\nHowever, I think Amazon will not only retake the lead, but move significantly ahead of Alphabet during the next five years. The main reason why is that Amazon is starting to hit its stride under Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who took over from Jeff Bezos in 2021.\n\nThree years into the job, Jassy is putting his own mark on Amazon, starting with the company's increased efficiency. As of its most recently reported quarter, Amazon's operating margin climbed to almost 10%.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms Inc. (META)the Best Stock to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio. In this article, we will look at where Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks among the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio.\n\nRay Dalio was born in 1949 and graduated from Long Island University in 1971. After a brief stint as a clerk on the New York Stock Exchange, he attended Harvard Business School and earned his MBA in 1973. That same year, he became the Director of Commodities at Dominick & Dominick LLC and later traded futures at Shearson Hayden Stone for a year. Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates in 1973 in his apartment. In July 2011, he stepped down as CEO but continued to work as a co-CIO alongside Robert Prince and Greg Jensen, taking on the title of “Mentor.”\n\nBridgewater Associates is notable for its focus on transparency and accountability. The firm promotes a culture where team members take responsibility for mistakes and learn from them. It encourages questioning and alignment, ensuring everyone regularly evaluates the validity of their ideas. This approach is crucial to the firm’s management style and investment strategies.\n\nRay Dalio Warns of U.S. Decline\n\nRay Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, emphasized that since 1945, the United States has been the dominant global empire, but it is now in a state of relative decline. This decline isn’t just an opinion, it’s supported by concrete measures such as the nation’s share of global GDP, military strength, and the quality of its education system. These factors indicate that the U.S. is losing its position.\n\nIn addition to these, Dalio points out two other key elements that often disrupt world order: natural events like droughts, floods, and pandemics, which have historically caused more damage and upheaval than wars, and human creativity and technological innovation, which bring about substantial changes. Dalio believes all five factors are influencing the U.S. today. However, he stresses that the most critical issue is how people manage these challenges together.\n\nThe ability to address them intelligently and without creating further conflict is essential. If conflict arises, it could lead to a devastating outcome. But if people can come together and handle the situation effectively, the country can navigate these issues successfully. For Dalio, how society deals with one another is the number one factor in determining the future.\n\nChina Faces Economic Challenges and Urgent Need for Restructuring After Four Years of Change\n\nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Ray Dalio also highlighted significant issues in China that have emerged over the past four years. He explained that China is in need of a major restructuring, as a large portion of individual spending, around 70%, was invested in real estate. With the decline in real estate, stocks, and salaries, people have become more cautious, reducing their spending and holding onto cash. In a deflationary environment, cash has become a relatively safe asset. This situation is affecting both households and businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nDalio also pointed out that the government sector is facing serious challenges. Local governments, responsible for 83% of public spending, previously relied on land sales to generate revenue. With land sales drying up, these governments have accumulated significant debt, and now they’re struggling to pay it off. The key question is how to inject money into these local economies to keep them functioning. Dalio compared the situation to Japan’s struggles in 1990, noting that China’s challenges are even more severe and will require deep restructuring to resolve.\n\nIn addition to economic concerns, Dalio raised questions about property ownership and values. He referenced Deng Xiaoping’s famous statement, “It’s glorious to be rich,” and wondered if that sentiment still holds true in China today. The overall environment in the country is becoming more complex and difficult, as these economic and political issues intensify.\n\nDalio also emphasized the importance of being cautious when investing in China. He made it clear that every country goes through economic cycles, experiencing both highs and lows. According to Dalio, it’s crucial not to invest too heavily in any one country, including China, to avoid having it dominate your portfolio. Despite the challenges China faces, Dalio continues to invest there, but he stressed that the key consideration is the size and structure of the investment. Overall, his experience investing in China has been positive, though careful management is essential.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through Bridgewater Associates’ Q2 2024 13F portfolio and picked the top 10 stocks held by the fund. We also added the total number of hedge fund investors per company, as of Q2 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of Bridgewater Associates’ stake in them.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nTotal Number of Shares Owned: 962,410\n\nTotal Value of Shares Owned: $485,266,370\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\n\nRanking 6th in our list of the 10 best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). In Q2 2024, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported $32 billion in revenue, a 15% increase from the previous year, with net income of $10 billion. This increase was largely fueled by a 20% rise in advertising revenue as more brands invest in digital marketing on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). A major part of this success comes from Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s focus on innovation, especially by using artificial intelligence to improve advertising, allowing for better targeting and higher returns for advertisers.\n\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is making strides in the metaverse, recently launching new virtual reality products and updating its Horizon Worlds platform, which could create new revenue opportunities in the future. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also committed to enhancing user safety and privacy, which helps build trust with consumers and meets regulatory standards. Overall, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s solid financial performance, innovative advertising strategies, ambitious plans for the metaverse, and dedication to user safety make a strong case for future growth.\n\nBridgewater Associates holds 962,410 shares of Meta Platforms Inc.(NASDAQ:META), worth $485.3 million.\n\nOverall, META ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio. While we acknowledge the potential of META, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META, but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Should You Forget Apple and Buy These 3 Tech Stocks Instead?",
        "content": "Right now, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the world's largest company by market cap. However, investors need to be aware of some problems under the hood.\n\nInstead of Apple, I think there are much better buys right now, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). These three provide significant long-term upside that should allow them to outperform Apple.\n\nWhat's going on with Apple?\n\nApple reached the top of the rankings of the world's largest companies with shockingly low revenue growth. Sales of iPhones haven't increased meaningfully since the pandemic began, and investors put a lot of hope into the iPhone 16 being the generation that turns it around, mainly because of its Apple Intelligence integration. But the latest reports say that its sales are below expectations, which could spell disaster for the stock.\n\nIt trades at 34 times trailing earnings and 31 times forward earnings. That's a premium investors would expect to pay for a company that's growing rapidly. AAPL PE Ratio Chart\n\nIn Apple's latest quarter, however, sales only grew by 4.9% and earnings per share (EPS) by 10.2%. Those aren't figures that support the stock's lofty valuation.\n\nThe immediate future looks slightly better, but not enough to justify today's price. In fiscal 2025, ending Sept. 30, 2025, Wall Street expects 8% higher revenue and 17% EPS growth. Compared to the following three options, Apple stock doesn't look attractive.\n\nThese tech stocks look to outperform Apple over the next few years\n\nInstead, I would urge you to consider Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms (and many other companies as well).\n\nLet's start with Nvidia. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering artificial intelligence (AI), and demand doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon.\n\nAlphabet is Google's parent company, and its market dominance among search engines allowed it to capitalize on advertising in one of the most lucrative areas on the internet.\n\nMeta Platforms is the parent of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram, and it also generates a lot of its money from ads on its platforms.\n\nAll three of these companies are far outperforming Apple in revenue and EPS growth. NVDA Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nDespite doing substantially better than Apple, two of them don't hold a premium in comparison to it, while Nvidia isn't that much more expensive. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAs an investor, I'm looking for companies with sustainable business models, faster growth, and lower stock valuations. Compared to Apple, both Meta and Alphabet achieve that, so buying those two instead makes a lot of sense.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia isn't cheaper now, but its prospects are far more lucrative. While its days of increasing revenue at a triple-digit pace are over, if it keeps up its current rate, it will still post impressive growth.\n\nIn its 2025 second quarter (ending July 28), Nvidia grew revenue 15% sequentially, and its third-quarter projections indicate sales will rise another 8.3% over the previous period. Apple can't muster this kind of increase year over year, yet Nvidia is doing it one quarter after another.\n\nIf the stock price doesn't move, this will rapidly drive down Nvidia's valuation. However, with AI being such a hot investment topic, the stock will continue to be strong and will likely maintain its premium over other tech stocks.\n\nAs a result, its stock performance will be closely tied to its revenue and EPS growth, which will easily allow it to outperform the iPhone maker.\n\nApple is a great company, but it isn't the juggernaut it used to be. Investors should start looking for other investment opportunities.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 30 AI News Investors Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) data centers are one of the hottest topics on Wall Street as companies across the industrial spectrum compete in a race to deploy AI technologies in their operations. The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers are the largest in the industry, typically developed by technology giants based in the US, and offer massive networking capacity and often consume as much power as a big city or even a small country.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAs technology stocks stage a comeback on the back of Fed rate cuts and AI optimism, the news coming from the commerce department in the US has buoyed investors further. The US government said earlier this week that it plans to award nearly $100 million to boost the use of artificial intelligence in developing new sustainable semiconductor materials. The funding is part of the more than $52 billion in US chip manufacturing and research grants promised by US President Joe Biden.

In an investor note, the analyst highlighted that Meta was the dominant social media company in the world with 3.3 billion daily active users.

        "title": "The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 in Right Now",
        "content": "Right now is a great time to invest in technology stocks -- for two reasons. First, we're at the beginning of the growth story for a promising new area, and that's artificial intelligence (AI). JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has even said that AI could be as transformational for the world as the steam engine and the internet. And analysts predict that in just the time frame of today through 2030, the AI market could grow from $200 billion to more than $1 trillion.\n\nSecond, some of these players are trading at reasonable valuations right now considering their long-term prospects. That offers investors an opportunity to get in on this exciting growth story at a fair price.\n\nSo, if you have $50,000 to invest and are looking to buy growth stocks, it's a great idea to pick up technology players that operate in the AI space, from designers of AI products to those who use them or sell AI services to others. I would spread this investment across several players and of course, make sure that this is in the context of a diversified portfolio; it's always best to invest across a few sectors in case one falls on hard times.\n\nTo increase the safety of this bet, I favor companies that don't rely uniquely on AI and prior to this boom, already built profitable businesses. Considering all of this, here are the best stocks to invest $50,000 in right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) may be the safest of all AI bets thanks to its diversification across high-growth industries. The company is a leader in e-commerce and in cloud computing through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. These two major areas have helped Amazon generate billions of dollars in revenue and profit in recent years. And today, Amazon's investment in AI is adding to the gains.\n\nThis market giant is benefiting from AI in two ways. First, Amazon uses the technology to increase its own efficiency in e-commerce -- for example, selecting the fastest delivery routes for packages. This should lower Amazon's costs and in turn, boost profit. Second, AWS is going all in on AI, offering a wide range of products and services to fulfill just about every need of a customer launching an AI project. AWS recently reached a $105 billion annual-revenue run rate thanks to this focus on AI.\n\nToday, Amazon shares trade for 39 times forward-earnings estimates. This isn't dirt cheap but remains very reasonable considering the company's solid market position.\n\nOracle\n\nOracle(NYSE: ORCL) is an up-and-coming AI powerhouse. Originally known for its database software, Oracle has shifted to prioritizing cloud infrastructure in recent times -- and it's been a worthwhile bet because the company has seen demand and revenue take off.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the most-recent quarter, for example, cloud-infrastructure revenue soared 45% to $2.2 billion, and total remaining-performance obligations (RPO) -- representing contract backlog -- surged 53% to $99 billion. All of this offers investors a reason to be optimistic about growth ahead.\n\nAnother positive point is Oracle has signed multicloud agreements with market giants AWS, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. These allow customers to use Oracle's database technology through any of these cloud providers. So Oracle has made itself easy to access and on top of this, gives customers additional types of flexibility, such as Oracle Alloy, which allows partners to customize their cloud experience.\n\nOracle shares trade for 26 times forward-earnings estimates right now, higher than in the past but a deal considering Oracle's AI growth.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nYou may use a Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) service daily if you message a friend on WhatsApp or Messenger, or post something to Instagram or Facebook. Meta owns these top social media apps and thanks to advertisers on these platforms, the company has generated billions of dollars in earnings.\n\nI expect this to continue since Meta has a solid moat, or competitive advantage. It's very difficult for users to switch to other platforms, knowing that many of their contacts may not follow. After all, about 3.2 billion people worldwide use at least one of Meta's apps daily.\n\nBut Meta isn't stopping there. The company has made AI its biggest investment area this year and already has launched its first virtual assistant. In fact, the company aims to create AI tools for professional and leisure purposes to suit the needs of every Meta user. And that may be just the beginning, as Meta is exploring a wide array of AI products and services with the aim of being a leader in the space.\n\nAll of this makes the stock look particularly cheap at only 26 times forward-earnings estimates.\n\nNvidia\n\nThis article wouldn't be complete without mentioning the star of the AI market right now, and that's Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Some investors have worried about investing in this chip designer since earnings and share performance have soared so much in recent years. Profit has climbed in the triple digits into the billions of dollars quarter after quarter, and the stock has advanced more than 400% over the past three years.\n\nSo, the worry is Nvidia's strongest wave of growth may have passed, and rivals may slip ahead. I wouldn't expect Nvidia to register such earnings or share performance non-stop. But I think the growth opportunity is far from over, and a new wave of growth may be just ahead. It's important to remember that Nvidia is the market leader, and its focus on innovation should keep it there.\n\nThe company now is planning for the launch of new architecture Blackwell, a platform that should supercharge growth and could lead to more share performance down the road.\n\nAnd that's why Nvidia's valuation at 42 times forward-earnings estimates looks fair, and it's worth picking up this winning stock at these levels.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Facebook just updated its feed—get ready for more content from strangers",
        "content": "Meta is looking to collapse barriers between its platforms and give users more recommended content with its newest update.\n\nThe social media giant announced changes to Facebook and Messenger at its Facebook IRL event in Austin, Texas, on Friday, including multiple new tabs.\n\nThe key changes include:\n\nA Local tab that will show posts from Marketplace, Groups and Events near your Facebook location An Explore tab reminiscent of the Instagram tab of the same name, with posts curated by an algorithm tailored to your interests AReels tab more prominently displayed on Facebook's navigation with a full-screen video player built for \"seamless\" scrolling Expanded event invites that will allow users to invite guests to RSVP to Event pages via SMS and email, allowing users beyond just the platform itself AI search in Groups to help group members search for posts that answer previously asked questions in a community A Matchmaker feature for Dating meant to let your friends help select your matches Upgrades to AI photo editing and search that will let you find and create more content with the help of AI Music and mentions in Notes in Messenger will allow more expressive functionalities to \"spark conversations\" Memories and Communities in Messenger will give users throwbacks of shared content as well as options to curate group messages around specific topics, without having to create a new Group A new creator monetization program that aims to bring more creators to Stories, Reels and other content formats\n\nWhile users will still be able to interact with and view their friends' activity and posts from the Facebook homepage as usual, the new curated tabs will emphasize content discovery from users you're not already following.\n\nFor example, let's say you like a Facebook post about watching The Nightmare Before Christmas at Halloween. When you navigate to the Local tab, you might find a recommended Tim Burton-themed Halloween event in your area that was shared by a person or group you don't already follow. Using data from your past likes and shares, Facebook's new tabs will curate and serve content it assumes you will like. And that will mean more content from strangers.\n\n\"We’re adding features that help young adults – and all Facebook users – explore their interests and connect with the world beyond their close friends,\" Meta's announcement read. \"We want to make it easy for you to discover the content and people you care about, because that’s exactly the kind of social discovery that Facebook is built for.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta said the new features are currently being rolled out to users at different speeds. Some features, such as the new Facebook Dating Matchmaker, will start appearing for users in the coming days. Other features will slowly roll out for testing across the U.S. and Canada in coming weeks, according to Meta. The Local tab is currently being tested in Austin, New York City, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago, Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco and Phoenix.\n\nFriday's announcement marks a continued shift by social media platforms toward recommended content following the breakout success of TikTok in the last five years. X, formerly Twitter, introduced its algorithmic \"Home\" feature back in 2016, though it has grown more sophisticated and since been renamed \"For You\" under owner Elon Musk. He also changed X in 2023 so that users would automatically open to the \"For You\" page rather than the tab of your curated followers.\n\nMeta has already been moving toward more recommended content in its feeds and embracing algorithms that predict and display which posts users are most likely to engage with. Instagram's \"Explore\" page is also based on users' interactions with other content on the platform.\n\nMeta's updates also lean into its ongoing effort to be a one-stop-shop of social offerings, with its updates to Groups and Events as well as monetization aiming to bring more users into the platform and keep them there instead of TikTok, Reddit, X, Nextdoor and other spots.\n\nThe company has had a big year, with shares rising 23% since it reported better-than-expected sales in the second quarter and began its push into AI chatbots and language learning models. It closed at an all-time high Thursday of $582.77, pushing up Zuckerberg's net worth and making him the world's second-richest person alive.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 20 Trending AI News And Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) startups have taken the finance world by storm in the past few months. This interest was sparked by the blockbuster launch of ChatGPT by California-based OpenAI in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has raised tens of billions of dollars in new funding and reached a valuation of over $150 billion. OpenAI revealed earlier this week that it had secured more than $6.6 billion in new funding through a financing round led by prominent names including Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures, and Tiger Global, among others.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPerhaps one reason the startup is so popular is that it is projecting more than $3.5 billion in revenue this year and over $11 billion in 2025. AI startups in general have been quicker at making revenues than previous technology booms, according to an analysis of payment information by fintech firm Stripe. The report underlines that top AI groups are reaching millions of dollars in sales within a year. This timeline is far faster in the life cycle of a startup than comparable non-AI tech groups. The report relies on annual revenue data for the 100 highest-grossing privately held AI companies using Stripe, compared with a comparable basket of prominent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) start-ups as of July 2018.\n\nThe report has gained a lot of traction since Stripe customers include OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, GitHub and Midjourney, among others. Stripe claims, per Financial Times, that AI start-ups took a median 11 months to hit $1 million in annual revenue after their first sales on Stripe, compared with 15 months for the previous generation of SaaS companies. AI start-ups that have scaled to more than $30 million in annual revenue achieved the milestone in 20 months — five times faster than past SaaS companies. Emily Sands, the head of information at Stripe, highlights that unlike past generations of software companies, AI companies paid compute costs straight out of the gate, and were under pressure to build monetisation faster.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. Latest reports, published by tech news website Tech Crunch, claim that the company could use the photos and videos that users take on the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses to train its AI. The smart glasses were announced at a Meta event last month. The report further underlined that Emil Vazquez, the policy communications manager at Meta, had said that where multimodal AI was available, currently US and Canada, images and videos shared with Meta AI may be used to improve it per a Privacy Policy.\n\nWells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski recently raised the price target on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock to $652 from $647 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares ahead of its earnings report. The advisory predicted another robust quarter and solid forward quarter guide, but noted it was unlikely to materially alter Wells' above-consensus 2025 EPS estimate of $27-plus. The stock is increasingly viewed as an AI winner, but it is likely range bound until 2025 OpEx/CapEx guide on Q4 2024 EPS call, the advisory added.\n\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks now. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "By Sheila Dang\n\nAUSTIN (Reuters) - Facebook, one of the original social media networks, has become known as the platform of parents and grandparents, while young adults take up photo and video apps like Instagram and TikTok.\n\nMeta, the company that owns Facebook, is setting out to change that.\n\nWhile Facebook was originally centered on helping users stay in touch with family and friends, the future lies in helping people expand their networks and make new connections, which lines up with how younger generations use the service, said Tom Alison, head of Facebook at Meta.\n\n\"We see young adults turn to Facebook when they make a transition in life. When they move to a new city, they're using Marketplace to furnish their apartments. When they become parents, they're joining parenting groups,\" Alison said during an interview in Austin, Texas, ahead of an event on Friday with content creators.\n\nDuring the event, Facebook announced two new tabs called Local and Explore, currently being tested in select cities and markets and which aggregate content from across the platform. The Local tab shows users nearby events, community groups and local items for sale, and the Explore tab recommends content based on a user's interests.\n\nAn increased focus on young adults will be key to bringing in new users as Facebook faces vast competition for their attention. Short-form video app TikTok has 150 million users in the U.S. and is wildly popular among Gen Z, prompting Meta to introduce its copycat product called Reels in 2021.\n\nYoung adults on Facebook spend 60% of their time watching videos and more than half watch Reels daily. The company said it would also roll out an updated video tab in coming weeks that collects short-form, live and longer videos in one place.\n\nFacebook's dating feature, launched in 2019 and which lets users flip through suggested profiles, has seen a 24% year-over-year increase in conversations started among young adults in the U.S. and Canada, the company said.\n\nAt the pop-up event in Austin, a small booklet summed up the platform's positioning for the future: \"Not your mom's (Facebook),\" the title read.\n\n(Reporting by Sheila Dang in Austin; Editing by Tom Hogue)\n\nView comments",

Zuckerberg added $3.43 billion to his fortune in the past day and has grown his wealth by $78.1 billion this year so far.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of Meta are up 69% year-to-date, trading at $585.83 apiece as of Friday morning. The company has a market valuation of $1.48 trillion.\n\nBezos’ net worth was $205 billion as of Friday. The Blue Origin–owner’s wealth fell 1.5% Friday, shaving $2.62 billion from his net worth.\n\nZuckerberg, Bezos, and Elon Musk are currently the only three people in the world to have a net worth of more than $200 billion. Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH (MC) who holds the fourth-place spot on the Bloomberg index, is valued at $193 billion.\n\nDue to differences in calculation and other factors, Zuckerberg remains the fourth-richest person on Forbes’ billionaires list. According to that ranking, he has a net worth of $202.6 billion, behind Bezos, Oracle (ORCL) founder Larry Ellison, who shot to the second-place spot in that ranking with a net worth of $205.7 billion, and Musk.\n\nEllison owns just under 40% of Oracle’s outstanding stock, Forbes said. He is the fifth-richest person on Bloomberg’s list.\n\nMusk is the richest person in the world, according to both Bloomberg and Forbes. Per Bloomberg, the Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO has a net worth of $256 billion (Forbes puts him at $263 billion). Musk is the co-founder of seven companies and has significant stakes in a number of them, including electric vehicle maker Tesla and aerospace company SpaceX.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

It can also use such prompts to generate audio for or edit an existing video, or even use a photo to create a customized video featuring a real person.\n\nMovie Gen is only available for some internal employees and a handful of outside partners, including some filmmakers, though the social media company — which also owns Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger — plans to build the product into its existing apps sometime next year.\n\nExecutives are still discussing how best to implement this integration, but the aim is for Movie Gen to encourage more people to create or edit video posts, said Connor Hayes, a Meta vice president focused on generative AI products. It will be “fun to use, helpful for creators, good for overall engagement in the apps, but we don’t have a concrete product plan of what it will look like at this point,” he said.\n\nThe social networking leader is one of many major tech companies pushing into AI models focused on generating videos, which are more complicated and expensive to build than those that return AI-generated text. Microsoft Corp.-backed OpenAI has its own video generation tool, called Sora, that debuted earlier this year and can create videos up to a minute in length, though that technology isn’t available to the public yet. DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, also has a video generation tool, called Veo, which was unveiled earlier this year.\n\nMeta is waiting to roll out Movie Gen for several reasons, including the technology’s efficiency. It currently takes “tens of minutes” to generate a video based on a text prompt — too long for general consumers, who are likely to use this on their phone, Hayes said.\n\nBut Meta is also “sorting out a bunch of really important problems around safety and responsibility,” Hayes said, including how to handle personalized videos so that a user can’t create an inappropriate or unflattering video featuring another person without their consent. “That’s going to be probably the most important problem to solve before we would make the personalization capability available to folks broadly.”This type of technology has been used in the past to create misleading so-called deepfakes of famous people, including US President Joe Biden and pop star Taylor Swift, though Meta executives have said they’re working on ways to “watermark” these creations so that people can tell they’re AI-generated.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta has made AI advancements a key priority for the entire company, and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly talked about AI as a driver of user and revenue growth. In the short term, Zuckerberg has credited AI for helping improve the company’s content algorithms by showing people more relevant posts and advertisements. Eventually, Zuckerberg has said he believes AI will play an even larger role in powering its apps and other futuristic wearables Meta is producing, like smart glasses.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAdam Neumann’s Latest Project Is a WeWork Competitor How Bogg Bags, the Crocs of Totes, Won Over America’s Moms Rotting Rice in India Fuels Discontent About Modi’s Food Policy Elon Musk’s Role in Reanimating the Far-Right Term ‘Remigration’ The Great €3 Billion Shipping Container Heist\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — The European Union's top court said Friday that social media company Meta can't use public information about a user's sexual orientation obtained outside its platforms for personalized advertising under the bloc's strict data privacy rules.\n\nThe decision from the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg is a victory for Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, who has been a thorn in the side of Big Tech companies over their compliance with 27-nation bloc’s data privacy rules.\n\nThe EU court issued its ruling after Austria's supreme court asked for guidance in Schrems' case on how to apply the privacy rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR.\n\nSchrems had complained that Facebook had processed personal data including information about his sexual orientation to target him with online advertising, even though he had never disclosed on his account that he was gay. The only time he had publicly revealed this fact was during a panel discussion.\n\n“An online social network such as Facebook cannot use all of the personal data obtained for the purposes of targeted advertising, without restriction as to time and without distinction as to type of data,” the court said in a press release summarizing its decision.\n\nEven though Schrems revealed he was gay in the panel discussion, that “does not authorise the operator of an online social network platform to process other data relating to his sexual orientation, obtained, as the case may be, outside that platform, with a view to aggregating and analysing those data, in order to offer him personalised advertising.”\n\nMeta said it was awaiting publication of the court's full judgment and that it “takes privacy very seriously.”\n\n“Everyone using Facebook has access to a wide range of settings and tools that allow people to manage how we use their information,” the company said in a statement.\n\nSchrems' lawyer, Katharina Raabe-Stuppnig, lawyer representing Mr Schrems, welcomed the court's decision.\n\n“Meta has basically been building a huge data pool on users for 20 years now, and it is growing every day. However, EU law requires ‘data minimisation’,\" she said in a statement. “Following this ruling only a small part of Meta’s data pool will be allowed to be used for advertising — even when users consent to ads.”\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta faces new limits on ad-targeting in Europe as nemesis Max Schrems wins again at EU’s highest court",
        "content": "Meta faces yet more restrictions on its core ad business in Europe, following a ruling by the EU’s top court.\n\nIn its Friday ruling, the Court of Justice of the EU confirmed that the principle of “data minimization\"—one of the many rules in the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation—means a social network like Facebook can’t simply use all of a user’s data, forever, for the purpose of targeting ads at them.\n\n\"Meta has basically been building a huge data pool on users for 20 years now, and it is growing every day,” said Katharine Raabe-Stuppnig, the lawyer representing the complainant in the case, Max Schrems.\n\n“Following this ruling only a small part of Meta's data pool will be allowed to be used for advertising—even when users consent to ads. This ruling also applies to any other online advertisement company, that does not have stringent data deletion practices.”\n\nMeta said in a statement that it would have more to share once it has read the court’s full judgement. “Meta takes privacy very seriously and has invested over €5 billion [$5.5 billion] to embed privacy at the heart of all of our products,” said a spokesperson.\n\nThorn in Facebook's side\n\nSchrems, an Austrian activist lawyer who has been a thorn in Facebook’s side ever since he was a law student 13 years ago, has been the catalyst for a series of Court of Justice rulings against the company.\n\nTwo of the rulings sunk entire data-sharing agreements between the EU and U.S.—due to Meta’s inability to stop U.S. intelligence agencies poking around its data.\n\nA separate Schrems complaint last year led to a $1.3 billion GDPR fine against the company and left it perilously close to being unable to send Europeans’ personal data off to its U.S. data centers at all—the belated authorization of a third EU-U.S. data-sharing agreement provided a last-minute reprieve.\n\nIn a case involving German antitrust law rather than Schrems, the Court of Justice last year blew up Meta’s legal justification for targeted advertising, forcing it to rely on users’ consent. Meta then tried to force that consent by telling users they had to either agree to targeted advertising or pay a monthly fee, but the EU’s privacy regulators rejected that approach after Schrems complained.\n\nSchrems told Fortune he was happy with Friday's ruling as, until now, Meta and other online advertisers “simply used all data they could get, without limit as to the type or age of such data.”\n\nThis latest Schrems case revolved around his sexuality. The lawyer disclosed in a panel discussion, which was broadcast online, that he was gay—but he never mentioned that fact on his Facebook profile. Nonetheless, Facebook showed him ads targeting that attribute.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe GDPR classifies personal data about sexuality as being sensitive, meaning it must be more tightly controlled. However, if the data subject makes their own sexuality public, that can effectively remove the “sensitive” classification, making it easier to use the information for things like ad targeting.\n\nApart from what it had to say about data minimization, Friday’s ruling threw the issue of whether or not Schrems had made his sexuality public back to the Austria Supreme Court, which had referred the case. But the Court of Justice also said that, either way, Meta doesn’t get to target ads based on sexuality data it got through other means, such as tracking Schrems’s activities on other websites.\n\nMeta’s spokesperson stressed that the company doesn’t use “special categories” of data, such as sexuality, for ad targeting.\n\n“We also prohibit advertisers from sharing sensitive information in our terms and we filter out any potentially sensitive information that we’re able to detect. Further, we've taken steps to remove any advertiser targeting options based on topics perceived by users to be sensitive,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "What's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy With the Fed Cutting Rates?",
        "content": "Interest rates are at long last coming down as the Federal Reserve announced a significant 0.5% rate cut in September. More reductions in the interest rate are likely on the way.\n\nLower rates are usually viewed as good news for smaller businesses. However, they benefit huge corporations, too, including the market-leading group known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. What's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy with the Fed cutting rates?\n\nHow rate cuts could benefit the Magnificent Seven\n\nLet's first look at how lower interest rates could help the members of the Magnificent Seven. Three ways are the most important, in my view.\n\nFirst (and most obvious), lower interest rates reduce Magnificent Seven companies' borrowing costs. This makes it cheaper to refinance maturing debt. They also enable companies to fund new projects that could lead to future growth.\n\nSecond, lower rates can boost customer spending. This can happen whether the customers are individual consumers or organizations.\n\nThird, lower interest rates can lead to a weakening of the U.S. dollar. This benefits Magnificent Seven companies that export to other countries by making their products more competitive in international markets.\n\nEvaluating the Magnificent Seven\n\nRate cuts should help all of the Magnificent Seven stocks. However, some will benefit more than others.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has the most debt on its books in the group -- $157.8 billion. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) trail behind with debt of $101.3 billion and $97.8 billion, respectively. Lower rates could help these companies the most when it comes to reducing interest expenses when their debt matures (assuming rates are still lower at that point).\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) are in the middle of the pack, with debt totaling nearly $38 billion and $28.7 billion, respectively. Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) debt load is only $12.5 billion, while Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) debt of $10 billion is the lowest of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nI suspect that increases in customer spending fueled by lower interest rates would likely be most pronounced for the companies with the most expensive products. Tesla's electric vehicles can cost in the ballpark of $40,000 at the lowest, with the pricey models costing over $113,000.\n\nCompanies spend significant amounts to buy Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), too. Lower rates could especially help start-ups and smaller businesses afford to expand their artificial intelligence (AI) development efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft operate cloud service platforms that could benefit from increased customer spending, driven by lower rates. All three companies market consumer products that could see sales increase, as well. It's the same story for Apple and, to a lesser extent, Meta.\n\nApple and Tesla would arguably be helped the most by a weaker U.S. dollar. Sales outside the U.S. are greater for both companies than their U.S. sales. However, all of the other Magnificent Seven also have significant international sales.\n\nThe best Magnificent Seven stock to buy with falling rates\n\nI think that Amazon and Tesla will probably be helped the most by the Fed's rate cuts. Which is the better stock to buy? I'd go with Amazon.\n\nTesla is much more expensive than Amazon based on forward earnings multiples and facing increasing competition. Even worse, consumer interest in electric vehicles seems to be waning.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon's AWS cloud platform has a massive AI tailwind at its back. Advertising on Prime Video has become an important new growth driver for the company. Amazon's technology investments should continue to pay off in increased profitability for its e-commerce business. Project Kuiper, a new satellite internet service, is poised to be another new source of growth.\n\nAll of these would be positives for Amazon without lower interest rates. However, lower rates should put an extra bounce in the company's step -- and send its stock higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Chinese smart-glasses maker Even Realities puts displays first in alternative vision to Meta",
        "content": "A week before Meta Platforms unveiled a new live translation feature for its latest Ray-Ban smart glasses, I was having some Sichuan theatre translated live in front of my eyes courtesy of a pair of smart glasses made in Shenzhen.\n\nUnlike the Ray-Ban frames, the Even Realities G1 glasses use micro-LED projectors and a special layer embedded in the lenses to convey information rather than speakers. It is something I have long wanted in a pair of sleek glasses that I would feel comfortable wearing out in public. The hardware delivers on the promise, although software may not be ready for the world to adopt this sci-fi future just yet.\n\nWhen Even Realities offered to send me its debut product to try out, I was most excited to see what kind of progress was being made on smart glasses with displays. I categorise these as \"visual\" smart glasses, as that is how they primarily give feedback, in contrast with \"auditory\" smart glasses like the speaker-equipped Ray-Ban Meta frames, or \"immersive\" smart glasses, like Meta's newly unveiled Orion augmented reality glasses or the glasses from China's Xreal.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe most important thing for a product like this is that they have to feel like regular glasses - i.e. something that people will want to wear every day - a fact not lost on Even Realities co-founder and CEO Will Wang.\n\n\"We know that if we were to build smart glasses, we need to actually start from the eyewear market, because that's the market where everybody is already used to wearing glasses,\" Wang told me at his company's Shenzhen office in July. \"If you want people to wear it all day, it needs to be first a really good pair of glasses.\"\n\nEven Realities sells polarised clip-on sunglasses for an additional US$100. The G1 glasses start at US$600, with prescription lenses costing a US$150 flat fee. Photo: Even Realities alt=Even Realities sells polarised clip-on sunglasses for an additional US$100. The G1 glasses start at US$600, with prescription lenses costing a US$150 flat fee. Photo: Even Realities>\n\nEven Realities is part of a new crop of Chinese companies that see an opportunity to make svelte glasses crammed with tech that consumers will actually want. Smart glasses are having a moment, fuelled in part by the added capabilities of generative artificial intelligence. As happened with smartphones, Chinese companies are quickly iterating to push the product category forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven Realities sees a way to differentiate itself by selling a premium product to overseas markets. The G1 went on sale on August 22 in the US and Europe, where it has international headquarters in Berlin, and the company said sales have exceeded expectations. There are no plans yet to launch the product in China.\n\nThe company was founded in September 2023 by Wang, a former Apple engineer who worked on the Apple Watch, and a team of people who moved over with him from JMGO, a Chinese projector company based in Shenzhen.\n\nDesign and fashion have been central to the company's approach to building smart glasses from the get-go, and it hired German eyewear designer Philipp Haffmans.\n\n\"A lot of companies ... are trying to build a tech product that looks like glasses,\" Wang said. \"But we're trying to actually build a pair of glasses that has tech.\"\n\nSome investors have already bought into Wang's vision. The company said it has raised more than US$10 million, including funding from top venture capital firms in China, but Wang declined to say who.\n\nAs far as the glasses go, the focus on design appears to have paid off. They are comfortable to wear, weigh less than many alternatives, and are stylish enough to be passed off as a normal pair of glasses. The real question for shoppers is whether they want to buy into the single thick-rimmed aesthetic available.\n\nStyle is important, because the G1 glasses are not cheap - even by smart glasses standards. On top of the US$600 base price, prescription lenses are an extra US$150, and the clip-on sunglasses are another US$100.\n\nBy comparison, the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses start at US$300. Speakers, of course, are cheaper than micro-LEDs projectors.\n\nSo does Even Realities' tech justify the price of admission? The most appealing thing about the glasses is that they mostly do what is promised, which is stay out of the user's way until needed.\n\nThe monochrome green display that makes wearers feel like they are in the Matrix is largely unobtrusive. A dashboard with the date, weather and calendar appears when the user looks up, although it is sometimes a bit too sensitive and triggers with minor reclining and upwards glances.\n\nThe live translation of Sichuan theatre worked well during the host's monologues, allowing me to keep my eyes on the stage. Photo: Hawaii Duan alt=The live translation of Sichuan theatre worked well during the host's monologues, allowing me to keep my eyes on the stage. Photo: Hawaii Duan>\n\nSome of the features work surprisingly well in specific contexts. At the Sichuan theatre, the translation handled the host's standard Mandarin well, allowing me to follow the gist of what he was saying. It fell apart during dialogue, though. This feature is best used for one-on-one conversations.\n\nTwo of the other most practical features are navigation and teleprompter. Navigation offers turn-by-turn instructions and teleprompter uses voice recognition to scroll through text as the user reads it aloud.\n\nYet these features are also very limited. Navigation has to be used through the maps service in the Even Realities app and requires a specific destination, making it not so useful on hiking trails, when I most wanted to use it.\n\nThe teleprompter feature is clever, but I am rarely in a situation when I would need it. I am more likely to be moderating panel discussions in front of a live audience rather than presenting from a prepared script.\n\nAs other AI-powered hardware has illustrated, though, the chatbot is mostly a gimmick. In the G1, it had difficulty registering my questions much of the time, which is strange since the translation feature, which also partially relies on OpenAI's GPT models, had no such issues. It is also easier to read the answers to prompts on a smartphone than on a floating display in a bright room or outdoors. This is an area where audio makes more sense.\n\nEven Realities' product is about as good as smart glasses get right now as an everyday wearable. But the smart glasses race is taking off as many people are also trying to be more mindful about their use of technology by limiting screen time.\n\nThat raises the question of whether consumers really want to remove another layer of friction between themselves and the internet. In some cases, that seems to be an obvious benefit: Chinese conversations with the in-laws just got a lot easier. For most of my day, though, the answer is increasingly no.\n\nCompanies need to think about how to address shifting consumer needs. Wang believes his company is on to something and buying into an inevitable future.\n\n\"Smart glasses eventually will need to have the display, because that's the one point that's going to separate smart glasses with any other gadgets out there,\" Wang said. \"We know that the trend is going to be there, but by the time we get there, you need to create a pair of smart glasses ... that people want to wear all day on their face.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

It also raised its adjusted operating income guidance to between $966m and $974m.\n\nMeta Platforms (META)\n\nTech giant Meta has continued to hit fresh highs over the past week, with the shares up to $583 in pre-market trading on Friday morning.\n\nShares have climbed higher following a developer event last week, in which CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled Meta’s newest artificial intelligence (AI) model, Llama 3.2. Meta also revealed its new “Orion” augmented reality glasses, as well as its latest Ray Ban smart glasses and mixed-reality Quest headset.\n\nMeta said back in April that it planned to spend between $35bn and $40bn over the course of 2024.\n\nRead more: Pound, gold and oil prices in focus: commodity and currency check\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance on Thursday, Barton Crockett, Rosenblatt’s senior research analyst, explained why he was bullish on the stock.\n\n\"The devices that they were showing off at their recent Meta Connect [are] more resonant with the consumer than even what Apple is doing right now,\" he said. \"And their Ray-Ban glasses could actually be something of a hit this Christmas.\"\n\nMeta announced earlier this week that it is set to release its third-quarter results on 30 October after market close.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nAnother technology company trending with investors is Amazon, which closed Thursday's session nearly 2% in the red but was up 1% in pre-market trading on Friday.\n\nAmazon said it was planning to increase the number of advertisements across films and television shows on Prime Video in 2025, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday.\n\nKelly Day, vice-president of Prime Video International, told the FT that advertising would “ramp up a little bit more into 2025”.\n\nRead more: How to minimise a capital gains tax impact on your investments\n\nAmazon began rolling out ads on its Prime Video streaming service earlier this year, with Day saying that it had started with a “very light ad load”.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrime Video has more than 200m subscribers globally and Day reportedly said that the \"churn\" of people leaving its Prime service had been \"much less\" than the e-commerce giant anticipated.\n\nYear-to-date Amazon shares are still up nearly 20%.\n\nJD Wetherspoon (JDW.L)\n\nBack in the UK, shares in pub chain JD Wetherspoon were little changed, despite the business reporting that sales had hit $2bn in the 2024 fiscal year ended 28 July.\n\nThat represented nearly 6% growth on 2023, while profits before tax \"after separately disclosed items\" was 33% lower at £60.6m.\n\nWetherspoons also brought back its dividend for the first time since before the pandemic, with the recommended payout coming in at 12p per share.\n\nTim Martin, chairman of JD Wetherspoon, reiterated an estimate that the company \"has potential for about 1,000 pubs in the UK\".\n\nRead more: UK interest rates could fall more rapidly, says Bank of England chief\n\nIn the results, Martin also hit out at a proposal that had been circulating that pubs should sell beer in quantities of two-thirds of a pint, instead of the traditional size, calling it \"slightly daft\".\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: \"Even though some of the metrics have surpassed pre-pandemic levels, overall profitability has been hamstrung by a number of subsequent headwinds in the meantime, such as the previously noted 'ferocious' inflationary pressures, particularly in regard to energy, food and labour, although more recently some of these pressures have started to ease.\"\n\n\"The market consensus of the shares as a strong hold reflects some conviction in Wetherspoon's ability to continue to fight its corner, while also adding some caution into a challenging mix,” he added.\n\nEVgo (EVGO)\n\nShares in US electric vehicle (EV) charging company EVgo surged on Thursday, closing the session up nearly 61%, after the company company received a conditional $1.05bn commitment from the Department of Energy to scale its charging network.\n\nThe company said that access to this low-cost financing would facilitate its building out of around 7,500 additional fast charging stalls across the US. If the financing is finalised, EVgo said it expected to complete the deployment of these new stalls by 2030.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin price slips amid ETF outflows\n\nEVgo estimated this buildout project would create more than 1,000 jobs, more than 700 of which would be contracted roles.\n\n“EVgo shares the Biden-Harris administration’s goal of increasing EV charging access in the communities that need it most,” said Badar Khan, CEO at EVgo.\n\n“This historic investment would meaningfully accelerate our network expansion to provide public charging to EV drivers across the United States,” he added.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Before They Soar as Much as 71% According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "The rise to prominence of artificial intelligence (AI) since early last year has been nothing short of phenomenal. The potential applications for generative AI continue to grow by leaps and bounds, and it has become clear that the companies at the cutting edge of this technology stand to profit from early adoption.\n\nLeading the pack are the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks, which have outpaced the broader market by a wide margin since the advent of AI at the start of last year (in order by returns, as of this writing):\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): Up 700% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): Up 379% Tesla: Up 120% Amazon: Up 109% Alphabet: Up 89% Microsoft: Up 75% Apple: Up 74%\n\nTo put those gains in the context of the overall market, the S&P 500 has increased 49% during that time, so the difference is stark.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that each of these companies is a leader in AI adoption and development. What is surprising is that a growing chorus on Wall Street -- which seldom agrees on anything -- is almost universal in its support of several of these stocks. And despite triple-digit gains, two of them still have a fair degree of upside ahead, according to select Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms: Implied upside 41%\n\nThe first stock with plenty of upside potential is Meta Platforms. The social media specialist has lately turned its gaze on the vast potential of generative AI, but the company has a long history of developing and deploying state-of-the-art algorithms.\n\nMeta has a treasure trove of user data from its multiple social media sites, which supplies the information necessary to develop its own large language models -- which form the foundation of generative AI. While the company doesn't have a cloud infrastructure service of its own to monetize its LLaMA AI, Meta hawks its AI models on the cloud platforms of its rivals -- for a fee.\n\nThe company makes the lion's share of its revenue from the advertising that appears on its social media platforms. To that end, Meta has also developed a suite of tools to help those advertisers succeed, helping secure its share of those ad dollars.\n\nDespite notching stock price gains of 379% since early last year (as of this writing), Wall Street remains firmly behind Meta. Just last week, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett assigned a Street-high price target of $811 and a buy rating on the shares. This represents potential upside of 41% compared to Tuesday's closing price.\n\nCrockett believes that Meta's unrivaled spending on virtual reality, augmented reality, and the Metaverse is a strength rather than a weakness. It gives the company \"an ability to make effective price/performance choices.\" He notes that Meta \"is uniquely delivering category products that could be described as leading in consumer adoption.\" He's also impressed with Meta's latest advances in AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe analyst isn't the only one bullish on Meta. Of the 64 analysts who covered the stock in June, 56 rated it a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling. Furthermore, Meta is selling for just 29 times earnings, a discount to the multiple of 30 for the S&P 500.\n\nMeta boasts more than 3.2 billion users that visit its social media platforms every day, giving the company a steady of ongoing stream of relevant data. It's the world's second-largest digital advertiser, which provides the company with plenty of cash flow to pursue its AI ambitions.\n\nAdd in the opportunity represented by AI, and it's no wonder Wall Street is enamored with Meta.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside 71%\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven stock with a boatload of potential is Nvidia. The chip specialist has been one of the biggest early beneficiaries of the AI revolution as its graphics processing units (GPUs) make the technology possible. Nvidia's processors have long been the gold standard for video games, cloud computing, data centers, and other forms of AI. The dawn of generative AI in early 2023 have resulting in triple-digit gains in its revenue, earnings, and stock price.\n\nIt's easy to understand why. Nvidia is the undisputed leader in the discrete desktop GPU space, controlling 88% of the market, according to data compiled by Jon Peddie Research. The company also continues to dominate the data center GPU market, with a mind-boggling 98% of the market last year, according to semiconductor analyst firm TechInsights. If that weren't enough, Nvidia dominates the market for machine learning -- an earlier branch of AI -- with 95% of that market, according to business analytics company CB Insights. This helps to illustrate that when it comes to the data center and AI market, Nvidia is the undisputed leader.\n\nDespite stock price gains of roughly 700% since the start of last year (as of this writing), Wall Street is still rallying around Nvidia. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann maintains a buy rating and Street-high price target of $200 on the stock. This represents potential upside of 71% compared to Tuesday's closing price.\n\nMosesmann believes the chipmaker's software -- which complements and accelerates its industry-leading processors -- doesn't get enough credit. \"We anticipate this software aspect will significantly increase in the next decade in terms of overall sales mix, with an upward bias to valuation due to sustainability,\" Mosesmann wrote.\n\nThe analyst isn't the only one bullish on Nvidia. Of the 60 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in September, 55 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nWhile some investors might be leery of Nvidia's valuation, that view is myopic. For Nvidia's fiscal 2026, which begins in February, analysts' consensus estimates are calling for earnings per share of $4.02. With a current share price of $117, that works out to roughly 29 times forward earnings, cheaper than the current multiple of 30 for the S&P 500.\n\nGiven the company's industry dominance and cutting edge technology, I think it's clearly a bargain.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) the Best AI Stock to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Ken Fisher’s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 10th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Ken Fisher regularly shares his investing wisdom on his YouTube channel, sharing market insights and lessons he’s learned over the decades. Commenting about the Fed’s rate cut, Fisher recently advised investors not to focus on what the central bank is doing and instead pay attention to long-term investing.\n\n“The fact is, and I’ve said this for a long time, I won’t live forever, but I hope to live a long time and keep saying it: central bankers are crazy. Throughout my life, central banks have operated on flawed ideas and groupthink, which is an inefficient way to manage markets.”\n\nFisher gave an example of how you could end up losing money following the herd mentality when it comes to central bank moves.\n\n“If you had followed the common belief that when the Fed and other central banks hike rates, you should get out of stocks, that would have worked for a couple of months in 2022. By the middle of the summer of 2022, during the height of rate hikes, you would have been on the wrong side of the market. From June 2022 onward, as the Fed hiked rates by 75 basis points nearly every month, the market was just a few months away from rising, leading to the bull market we’re in now, in 2024.\n\nThe basic belief that central bank hikes are bad for stocks was wrong from the start because it was already priced in. As soon as central bank hikes were visible, the market had already accounted for them. We saw a bull market begin in October 2022, which has continued despite repeated rate hikes.”\n\nFor this article, we scanned Ken Fisher’s hedge fund’s Q2 holdings and picked its top AI investments. We have analyzed the AI-related growth catalysts for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Bets Big on AI with Promising Free Cash Flow\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nBillionaire Ken Fisher’s Stake: $3,164,448,477\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 10th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Ken Fisher’s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nGlobal management consulting firm Bain & Company recently released a report on the artificial intelligence industry, highlighting that AI was driving an unprecedented wave of technological change, with the market for AI products and services projected to reach between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Per the research done by Bain, major cloud services providers were at the forefront of AI research and development, pushing the boundaries of larger models, advanced infrastructure, and energy efficiency. These hyperscalers were focusing on the development of larger, more complex models that demanded significant computational power and resources, leading to the need for data centers with energy capacities up to gigawatts, potentially straining energy grids and supply chains.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockand AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nBain underlined that while the big players dominated the high end of the market with expansive models and enormous data centers, innovation was also thriving in smaller models. These smaller, domain-specific models were being deployed at the edge, where they were more cost-effective, energy-efficient, and capable of addressing real-time processing needs, particularly in applications like autonomous driving. The proliferation of models like Llama, Claude, and Gemini illustrated how AI was evolving rapidly beyond just a few proprietary models, with many options now open-source or specialized for particular tasks.\n\nThe research further detailed that the rapid growth in AI workloads, particularly with data-heavy applications, was also reshaping the technology landscape. The need for increased storage, computing power, and memory was driving innovations in data center design, networking, and storage technologies. Per Bain, chip companies and particularly GPU makers were expanding beyond their core graphics processing units to include integrated solutions that improved the efficiency of AI models, with their products now combining compute, memory, and networking capabilities. The competition was also spurring the development of vertically integrated AI solutions, where tech companies designed everything from hardware to software to optimize AI performance.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

(NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. The firm has taken a different approach than other tech giants when it comes to AI, choosing to open source the large language model it has developed, unlike Google and Microsoft. This is largely because the firm plans to use the generative AI potential to enhance the advertisement market. Meta just recently overtook Google in digital ad market share and now plans to beat Amazon in the ad domain as well. Under this plan, the firm is also investing heavily in AI infrastructure build.\n\nRoth MKM analyst Rohit Kulkarni has a Buy rating and $550 price target on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) after attending the Meta Connect conference keynote by CEO Zuckerberg. In a research note following the event, the analyst noted that the key event was marked by Zuckerberg showing off AR prototype glasses after working on them for 10 years, and with 50% of Reality Labs' spend having been earmarked to AR, the next couple of years could see slower growth in incremental spend. The note further added that 2024 could also mark a peak segment operating loss margin year for Reality Labs.\n\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News Investors Probably Missed.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have been looking for smart ways to play the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has swept the global financial markets over the past two years. Most of the attention in this regard has been confined to obvious choices in semiconductors, software, and biotechnology. Even within these sectors, prominent companies and their AI initiatives have dominated headlines. However, there are several hidden gems within these sectors that offer the same bang for the buck, given present macro context, but are not in limelight as such. For example, Bernie Ahkong, an analyst at UBS, recently noted that the first phase of AI was interest towards chipmakers. In the second phase, investors moved towards the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centers. The present tilt towards utility and power firms is quite possibly the third phase of this AI focus.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nA recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "title": "Meta Platforms (META) Is Up 1.07% in One Week: What You Should Know",
        "content": "Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Meta Platforms (META), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Meta Platforms currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if META is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this social media company holds up.\n\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nFor META, shares are up 1.07% over the past week while the Zacks Internet - Software industry is up 0.29% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 12.65% compares favorably with the industry's 0.16% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Meta Platforms have increased 8.77% over the past quarter, and have gained 91.56% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 4.59% and 34.78%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also take note of META's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, META is averaging 12,462,656 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with META.\n\nOver the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost META's consensus estimate, increasing from $21.27 to $21.36 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that META is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Meta Platforms on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News Investors Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nCompanies are investing heavily in AI infrastructure to meet the growing demands of machine learning, data processing, and AI-driven applications. This spending is largely concentrated on building data centers, acquiring specialized hardware, and optimizing cloud infrastructure. According to a report by McKinsey, global AI infrastructure spending could reach up to $500 billion by 2027, highlighting the critical role it plays in the future of AI development. A large part of this investment is focused on AI-specific hardware like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are crucial for training and deploying AI models. NVIDIA, a dominant player in AI chips, has seen demand for its GPUs soar, largely due to their centrality in deep learning tasks. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the firm, has remarked that the AI boom is underpinned by massive infrastructure needs, and the market is just at the beginning of this growth curve.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nData centers are another focal point for AI infrastructure spending. AI workloads are highly demanding, requiring specialized facilities that can support high-density computing environments. Blackstone’s $16 billion acquisition of AirTrunk, a leader in AI-driven data centers, underscores the increasing importance of such infrastructure. The deal will add 800 MW of data center capacity, with projections to grow beyond 1 GW, a testament to the rising demand for infrastructure to support AI-driven applications. Cloud infrastructure is also a major area where companies are pouring resources. Cloud giants are increasing their investments in AI infrastructure. These companies are developing new AI-optimized cloud services to cater to businesses adopting AI. Gartner predicts that by 2026, cloud AI infrastructure spending will surpass $200 billion, as enterprises increasingly shift from on-premise AI deployments to scalable cloud-based solutions.\n\nThomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, recently remarked that AI is unlocking entirely new revenue streams for enterprises, and cloud infrastructure is the backbone enabling this transformation. Beyond just hardware, organizations are also investing in data management platforms and storage solutions to handle the massive amounts of data AI systems require. In fact, estimates suggest that the global AI data infrastructure market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18%, driven by increased data volumes and the need for real-time data processing capabilities. Companies are significantly ramping up their investments in AI infrastructure, focusing on hardware, data centers, and cloud computing. With projections showing continued growth in AI workloads, this spending will only increase in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill released an investor note on the company following the keynote address of Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg at the Meta Connect event, reiterating a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $600. Thill underlined that the keynote had left analysts more bullish on the consumer and enterprise AI opportunities for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Thill added that on the consumer front, there were bullish views on the impressive traction for Meta AI, with about 500 million monthly active users, and saw potential for new image, translation and voice capabilities to boost core engagement. On the enterprise side, per the analyst, Llama was becoming a serious contender and the advisory saw momentum building with the new multimodal capabilities.\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Meta Platforms (META)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 12.7% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $583.04 in the previous session. Meta Platforms has gained 62.9% since the start of the year compared to the 23% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 22.4% return for the Zacks Internet - Software industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on July 31, 2024, Meta Platforms reported EPS of $5.16 versus consensus estimate of $4.7.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $21.36 per share on $161.62 billion in revenues. This represents a 43.64% change in EPS on a 19.8% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $24.10 per share on $184.04 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 12.8% and 13.88%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nMeta Platforms may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nMeta Platforms has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 27X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 30.5X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 29.2X versus its peer group's average of 24.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.42. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Meta Platforms currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Meta Platforms fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Meta Platforms shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.\n\nHow Does META Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of META have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Upland Software, Inc. (UPLD). UPLD has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of F, and a Momentum Score of A.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. Upland Software, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 26.67%, and for the current fiscal year, UPLD is expected to post earnings of $0.73 per share on revenue of $274.83 million.\n\nShares of Upland Software, Inc. have gained 11.9% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 3.22X and a P/CF of 0.32X.\n\nThe Internet - Software industry is in the top 29% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for META and UPLD, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this social media company have returned +12.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Meta Platforms belongs, has gained 5.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.15 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $21.36 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +43.6%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.10 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $40.08 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +17.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $161.62 billion and $184.04 billion estimates indicate +19.8% and +13.9% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $39.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.91%. The EPS surprise was +9.79%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Widely Held Stocks by Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other widely held stocks.\n\nTwo 25 Point Cuts May be the Most Likely Outcome\n\nThe last trading day of September is upon us and so are many questions about the market. On September 30, Dana D’Auria, Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the financial market.\n\nD'Auria regards employment data to be a major concern at the moment. Since inflation rates are subsiding, employment data is something investors should be on the lookout for, along with other data points including GDP and consumer confidence. She suggests that to ensure a soft landing, the Fed must initiate larger rate cuts, and that recessionary conditions are out of the picture.\n\nSeptember is notoriously volatile along with October, and, with elections in another 35 days, the conditions may be slightly different or even more turbulent. According to D'Auria, the 50 basis point cut is a catch-up for July, and expecting a 50 basis point cut in November is borderline questionable.\n\nOverall, she believes that the market has been overshooting and we may have to settle for two 25 basis point cuts before the end of 2024. She reiterates that the job market is crucial and investors must get out of their comfort zone to invest in non-cash opportunities. Investors concerned about low-risk options may consider equities in the defensive sectors that are innately low volatile.\n\nThe Market is Broadening\n\nWall Street is heading to close September and Q3 on a high note and stocks have experienced their best September in over a decade. On September 30, Kevin Gordon, harles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis.\n\nGordon believes that stocks in the utilities and defensive sectors have caught up to tech stocks amid the AI boom, compared to their financials at the end of FY 2023. However, he does acknowledge that sectors like industrials, financials, and materials are performing relatively well, calling it a case of market broadening.\n\nIn terms of market breadth, most sectors are experiencing an upward trajectory. Almost 81% of the S&P 500 members are experiencing an uptrend, despite the quality bias investors may have towards certain stocks. According to Gordon, large-cap quality stocks will continue to perform well despite the volatility and the Fed's decisions. Speaking of smaller-cap stocks, he believes that some stocks may struggle a bit especially when it comes to earnings growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 10 most widely held stocks by hedge funds, we sifted through Insider Monkey's database that tracks over 900 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. We ranked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), commonly referred to as Meta and formerly known as Facebook, is a technology conglomerate behind the leading social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company currently boasts a user base of 3.27 billion daily active users across all its social media platforms.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is making strides in artificial intelligence and augmented reality. During the second quarter, the company launched its AI Studio in the United States, a platform for people to create, share, and discover artificial intelligence models. In addition to that, on September 25, the company launched Orion, its first augmented reality glasses, the first most advanced pair of AR glasses ever made.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has a strong position in the market, making it one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. By 2026, the company expects to own the best recommendation technology on its social media platforms. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is achieving this by expanding its collection of open models and tools for generative artificial intelligence.\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) reported $39.1 billion in revenue, in the second quarter of 2024, up by 22% year-over-year.  The company also generated $10.9 billion in free cash flow supporting its dividend payouts and stock repurchases. With strong expectations ahead of 2024, the company projects revenue to reach $38.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nMar Vista Investment Partners' Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"During the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company’s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street’s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels). The subsequent decline in Meta’s stock price during 2022 reflected these concerns.\n\nSince then, Meta has demonstrably shifted its strategic focus. The company has prioritized operational efficiency, implemented strategies to monetize Reels effectively, and initiated a robust artificial intelligence (AI) development program. We believe the focus on AI represents a more prudent capital allocation strategy compared to the earlier metaverse initiative. Meta AI holds significant potential to unlock substantial monetization opportunities and enhance user engagement, while maintaining tight controls on operating costs…\" (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "content": "Meta has announced the expansion of a scheme that sees banks sharing information with the social media giant to help protect people against fraud.\n\nThe parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp had been working with NatWest and Metro Bank, but said it will now expand the scheme and enrol more banks.\n\nCalled the Fraud Intelligence Reciprocal Exchange (Fire), the programme allows financial institutions to share intelligence with the tech giant directly to help stop scammers.\n\nMeta said that during the pilot, a significant concert ticket scam network attempting to target people in the US and UK was taken down because of data shared between those involved in the scheme, with around 20,000 accounts removed, which were run by scammers across 185 URLs.\n\nThe social media giant said this in turn had also helped it strengthen its fraud detection capabilities.\n\n“This work has already seen us take action against thousands of accounts run by scammers, indicating the importance of banks and platforms working together to tackle this societal issue,” Nathaniel Gleicher, Meta’s global head of counter-fraud said.\n\n“We will only beat these criminals if we work together and share relevant information related to scams. Financial institutions can share unique information with us which we can in turn use to train our systems to take action against more scams globally.”\n\nMark Tierney, chief executive of Stop Scams UK, said: “We’re delighted to see some of our member banks join Meta’s Fire initiative in another positive example of cross-sector collaboration.\n\n“We believe Fire could become a gamechanger for reporting fraudulent content, helping protect consumers and ensuring both banks and Meta gain better visibility of the abuse carried out on their systems by scammers.\n\n“Stop Scams UK passionately believes that collaborative projects such as Fire can lead to wider data sharing and improve reporting which is key to successfully tackling scams.”\n\nRocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at consumer champion Which? said it welcomed the scheme, but that more work still needed to be done in the area.\n\n“While it’s a positive step that Meta is partnering with UK banks to combat scams, much greater collaboration between key businesses and government is needed to put an end to the fraud epidemic,” she said.\n\n“Until now, the government and businesses such as online platforms, banks and telecoms firms have largely operated in silos and do not share the data they have on how these fraudsters operate – making it much harder to stop scams reaching victims in the first place.\n\nStory continues\n\n“To tackle fraud, the Government should lead a more coordinated approach by encouraging sectors to share data and stop scams spreading.\n\n“New duties, equivalent to the obligations being introduced for banks and online platforms, should be placed on telecom providers, online advertising providers and domain registrars to ensure they verify the legitimacy of users.”",

        "content": "By Byron Kaye\n\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Meta said it has taken down some 8,000 so-called \"celeb bait\" scam ads from Facebook and Instagram as part of a new effort with Australian banks to curb the practice.\n\nThe scams use images of famous people, often generated by artificial intelligence, to trick consumers into giving money to non-existent investment schemes.\n\nThe U.S. social media giant said it took down the scam ads after receiving 102 reports since April from the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange, an intelligence-sharing body run by the country's main banks.\n\nSuch scams are a global problem, but Meta is under heightened pressure to tackle the issue in Australia with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government planning to introduce an anti-scam law by the end of the year.\n\nThe bill proposes A$50 million ($34 million) fines for social media, financial and telecommunications companies which fail to meet their obligations to crack down on the practice. A public consultation closes on Oct. 4.\n\nAustralian scam reports jumped by nearly one-fifth in 2023, with losses totalling A$2.7 billion, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.\n\nThe commission accused Meta in a 2022 lawsuit of failing to stop the dissemination of cryptocurrency advertisements that used images of celebrities like Mel Gibson, Russell Crowe and Nicole Kidman. It estimated that 58% of cryptocurrency advertisements on Facebook were possible scams.\n\nMeta is fighting the lawsuit which is yet to go to hearings.\n\nThe company is also defending a separate civil lawsuit in California brought by Australian mining billionaire Andrew Forrest who accuses Meta of enabling the publication of thousands of bogus cryptocurrency advertisements on Facebook displaying his face. Forrest says Australians continue to lose money to the scams that he began warning Meta about in 2019.\n\nDavid Agranovich, Meta's director of threat disruption, told a media briefing that the effort with Australian banks was still in its early stages.\n\n\"What we find promising is that a small amount of high-value signals can help us identify much wider fraud and scam activity,\" he said, referring to indications within ads about potentially inauthentic content.\n\nAsked about Meta's view on Australia's proposed anti-scam code, Agranovich said the company was still working through the draft legislation. \"I expect we'll have more to share specifically on that later,\" he added.\n\nRhonda Luo, head of strategy and engagement at the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange said industry initiatives \"are really important to get ahead of the curve on scams, rather than wait for regulation to come in and have effect\".\n\nStory continues\n\n($1 = 1.4535 Australian dollars)\n\n(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Overview of Recent Transaction by David Abrams (Trades, Portfolio)\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 12 Warning Signs with CWH.\n\nOn September 27, 2024, Abrams Capital Management, led by David Abrams (Trades, Portfolio), executed a significant transaction involving the sale of 2,000,000 shares of Camping World Holdings Inc (NYSE:CWH). This move reduced the firm's holding by 39.15%, leaving Abrams Capital with a total of 3,108,808 shares in the company.

Following this transaction, Camping World Holdings Inc now constitutes 1.51% of Abrams Capitals portfolio, with the firm holding a 6.90% stake in the company.\n\nProfile of David Abrams (Trades, Portfolio) and Abrams Capital Management\n\nDavid Abrams (Trades, Portfolio), the CEO and portfolio manager of Abrams Capital Management, founded the firm in 1999 after a decade of working with Seth Klarman (Trades, Portfolio) at Baupost. Based in Boston, Abrams Capital is known for its opportunistic, value-oriented investment strategy, focusing on long-term investments in a concentrated portfolio of assets.

        "title": "3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Meta Platforms (META)",
        "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this social media company a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 18%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 43.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 27.9%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nRight now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.67, which means that the company gets $0.67 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.57, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Meta Platforms is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 19.8% this year versus the industry average of 7.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Meta Platforms have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.3% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Meta Platforms a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Meta Platforms is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Will Meta Platforms (META) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Meta Platforms (META), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry.\n\nThis social media company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 9.41%.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Meta Platforms came out with earnings of $5.16 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.70 per share, representing a surprise of 9.79%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $4.32 per share and it actually produced earnings of $4.71 per share, delivering a surprise of 9.03%.\n\nFor Meta Platforms, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +2% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.\n\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing.com -- Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) shares jumped at the open on Tuesday after receiving upbeat endorsements from Goldman Sachs and RBC Capital, both of which see significant growth potential for the social media platform.\n\nPinterest shares are currently up more than 1% at around $32.75 a share.\n\nGoldman Sachs added Pinterest to its Americas Conviction List, forecasting robust topline growth and EBITDA margin expansion, while RBC Capital highlighted the company's under-monetized platform and strategic ad partnerships.\n\nGoldman Sachs is particularly optimistic about Pinterest's growth trajectory, predicting mid-to-high teens percentage topline growth and annual EBITDA margin expansion of around 300 basis points over the next five years.\n\n\"PINS is set up well to continue to compound topline growth at a mid-to-high teens percentage pace and drive steady adjusted EBITDA margin expansion,\" Goldman noted, adding that the company is trading at a valuation similar to Meta (NASDAQ:META) while growing cash earnings at a much faster pace.\n\nKey drivers include increased ARPU (average revenue per user), better user engagement, and high incremental margins. Goldman set a 12-month price target of $46 for Pinterest, citing a significant upside potential.\n\nRBC Capital also emphasized Pinterest's growth potential, particularly due to the company's changes, such as the implementation of direct links and a 3rd party partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nThe initiatives are expected to boost ad relevance and conversion rates, improving advertiser returns on ad spend (ROAS).\n\nRBC Capital sees Pinterest as under-monetized but believes the platform has significant potential to accelerate revenue growth without needing to drastically expand its user base. RBC maintained an Outperform rating and set a price target of $48, based on 25.5x expected 2025 EBITDA.\n\nBoth investment banks noted the importance of Pinterest's ad strategy and partnerships, with Goldman highlighting the company's ability to leverage expanded advertising offerings, and RBC underscoring the potential for higher ad load and improved engagement.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPinterest stock jumps on bullish comments from Goldman, RBC\n\nBrokerage Charles Schwab's long-time CEO Bettinger to retire\n\nApple falls as Barclays flags 'weak demand' for iPhone 16; Citi cuts estimates\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Pivotal Research Group initiated coverage of Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with a Buy rating, highlighting the company's strong competitive position and potential for growth in cloud computing and AI.\n\nGoogle, which holds about 90% of the global search market share outside of China, is also recognized for its dominance in video/audio streaming through YouTube and its leading web browser, Chrome.\n\nGoogle's search business was deemed a monopoly in August, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) and a judge are considering remedies that could significantly impact the company's ability to leverage its market position.\n\nDespite this, Pivotal views the current valuation of Google as reflecting conservative post-2027 search revenue declines. Potential regulatory outcomes are not expected to be resolved soon, but Pivotal suggests that a Kamala Harris victory could lead to more favorable settlements for Google.\n\nIn a separate note, Pivotal also initiated coverage of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) with a Buy rating, setting a year-end 2025 target price of $780.\n\nMeta, known for its extensive portfolio of social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram, is praised for its management's ability to innovate and respond to competition.\n\n“Looking forward we see a strong revenue growth outlook from increased usage/new products/better targeting/higher prices boosted by cost efficiencies (enabled by AI) and eventually materially declining Reality Labs losses combined with what appears to be an attractive valuation at 24X ’25 EPS,” Pivotal analysts said in the note.\n\nThe firm also acknowledges risks such as potential regulation and market dominance investigations, as well as the challenges posed by Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in AI.

        "title": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Meta Platforms (META): Should You Buy?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Meta Platforms (META).\n\nMeta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.33, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 46 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.33 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 46 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 40 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87% and 2.2% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for META Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for META\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Meta Platforms here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Meta Platforms, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs META a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.3% over the past month to $21.36.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Meta Platforms. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Meta Platforms may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "If You Invested $1000 in Meta Platforms a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now",
        "content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Meta Platforms (META) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to META for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nMeta Platforms' Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Meta Platforms' main business drivers.\n\nMeta Platforms is the world’s largest social media platform. The company’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta’s family of products used by almost 3.24 billion people on a daily basis as of Mar 31, 2024.\r\n\r\nHeadquartered in Menlo Park, CA, Meta generated revenues worth $134.9 billion in 2023. Advertisement accounted for 97.8% of revenues. Marketers buy ads that can appear on multiple platforms including Meta, Instagram, Messenger and third-party applications and websites.\r\n\r\nMeta, thanks to its huge user base gained a significant market share in the advertising space wherein it faces tough competition from Google, Twitter, Amazon and Snapchat-parent Snap.\r\n\r\nMeta also faces significant competition from the likes of Apple (messaging), YouTube (advertising and video), Bytedance (social media) and Tencent (messaging and social media).\r\n\r\nMeta core app enables people to connect, share, discover and communicate with one other on mobile devices and personal computers. User engagement on core Meta platform is fostered by News Feed that displays an algorithmically-ranked series of stories and advertisements customized for each user.\r\n\r\nInstagram is a community for sharing photos, videos and messages, enabling people to discover interests that they care about. People can express themselves through photos, videos and private messaging via Instagram Feed and Stories.\r\n\r\nMessenger helps people to connect with friends, family, groups and businesses across platforms and devices. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable and secure messaging application, used by people and businesses around the world to communicate in a private way.\r\n\r\nMeta also offers virtual reality (VR) products through its Oculus division.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Meta Platforms a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in October 2014 would be worth $7,242.41, or a 624.24% gain, as of October 1, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 192.17% and the price of gold increased 109.16% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for META.\n\nMeta is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone. It witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\n\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 9.81%, and there have been 3 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Spotify CEO Daniel Ek refuses to play sports with friend Mark Zuckerberg because they’re both too competitive",
        "content": "Spotify CEO Daniel Ek has lent on his friendship with billionaire Mark Zuckerberg from the early days of Spotify and Facebook, taking leadership lessons from the Meta founder as they watched their companies grow into multi-billion-dollar tech giants.\n\nBut over their 16-year friendship, the Spotify co-founder has drawn at least one red line in his relationship with the billionaire: playing sports.\n\nZuckerberg has found a second lease of life in recent years through his newfound affinity for mixed martial arts and surfing, which has helped him update his style in the process.\n\nHowever, Ek has not been keen to make these interests a shared hobby, owing to the pair’s shared love of competition and hatred for losing.\n\n“The rule I have with Mark is I don't try to go into a competition with him because I know it'll end badly for both of us,” Ek told the Acquired podcast.\n\n“As you know Mark likes sports, so one of the things I don't do with Mark is play sports for exactly this reason.\n\n“The last time he sort of tore his ACL with someone rather than giving up, so I feel like it would end pretty badly,” Ek added, referring to an injury Zuckerberg sustained in MMA training last year.\n\n“I like playing when I know I'll win, so I think it's a pretty good thing not to do that.”\n\nEk and Zuckerberg’s friendship\n\nEk said he first met Zuckerberg at a barbecue in 2008 after being introduced by early Facebook and Spotify player Sean Parker, where the pair riffed off ideas to make Spotify more social through Facebook’s feed.\n\nAt the time, Spotify was still operating an invite-only model to build hype around the streaming service’s exclusivity, aping Zuckerberg’s early Facebook model that required specific college email addresses to sign up.\n\nThe pair recently co-authored an open letter calling for more consistent AI regulation in the EU, arguing that failure to do so could cause Europe to fall behind other regions.\n\nThe Spotify co-founder has also learned valuable leadership lessons from the Meta founder over their friendship, saying Zuckerberg was the best learner he had ever seen.\n\n“You can have a conversation with him about a topic, and he may not know very much about it, and then the next time he would know more than I would say most experts about the subject.”\n\nEk has also learned from Zuckerberg's meeting style, saying the Facebook co-founder hosts an average of 15 to 20 people in a meeting.\n\nSwedish CEO Ek takes a more Scandinavian approach to running his company. He has leaned on the Scandinavian leadership Model and says he is probably the least powerful person at Spotify because of how he delegates responsibility.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking last year, Ek said the world had met three Mark Zuckerbergs during their friendship.\n\nFirst was the “Social Network era Mark,” referring to the unfortunate reputation he gained after the release of the Oscar-winning movie starring Jesse Eisenberg.\n\nThen came “Cambridge Analytica Mark” for “Evil Mark” after Facebook shared the data of millions of Americans with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, causing huge ramifications for data privacy.\n\nFinally, Ek says, is “Mark 3.0,” someone who has recaptured his ruthless edge with the help of his burgeoning second life as a fighter and a surfer.\n\n“He’s learned a lot over these past few years and he has a new fire in the belly. He’s realized he needs to act responsibly because he’s got this enormous platform,” Ek told Forbes last year.\n\n“But there’s still some of the old Mark, where he is betting on things even though everyone tells him ‘this is never gonna work.’”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

The stock ended the previous session 2.3% higher at $233 (£175) per share, just below the high of $234.82 it hit in July.\n\nThis took the tech giant's market capitalisation up to $3.5tn.\n\nUS markets more broadly notched fresh records on the final day of the quarter, with the S&P 500 closing 0.4% in the green.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European markets cautious as Israel starts ground invasion in Lebanon\n\nLooking at Apple specifically, Barron's reported that a Morgan Stanley note on Monday referred to stabilising lead times for some iPhone 16 models.\n\nThere had been some concern, following the launch of the new iPhone in September, that early demand for the latest model was lagging 2023 levels.\n\nOther megacap tech companies also ended Monday's session in positive territory, with Google-owner Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) up more than 1% and social media giant Meta Platforms (META) up nearly 1%.\n\nGreggs (GRG.L)\n\nShares in sausage roll-maker Greggs dipped 5% on Tuesday morning, after it reported a slowdown in underlying sales growth in the third quarter.\n\nThe food-on-the-go retailer said like-for-like sales in this latest quarter were up 5%, versus 6.5% year-to-date, and slower than the 7.4% growth it reported in the first half.\n\nHowever, Greggs said that it was \"acknowledging ongoing economic uncertainty, [and] the board expects the full year outcome to be in line with its previous expectations\".\n\nThe British baker also said it expected the overall level of cost inflation for the year to be towards the lower end of the 4% to 5% range that it previously mentioned.\n\nRead more: The top gold funds to invest in as prices soar\n\nIn terms of new products, Greggs said it had launched a pumpkin spiced doughnut as part of its autumn menu.

There is significant growth potential in London and south-east England, and Greggs remains second only to McDonald’s in monthly active app users.\"\n\nDespite Tuesday's fall in share price, Greggs is still up 14% year-to-date.\n\nStellantis (STLAM.MI)\n\nCarmaker Stellantis tumbled in Monday's session, after it cut its outlook for the full-year.\n\nThe company warned adjusted operating income (AOI) margins were now expected to be between 5.5% and 7%, down from the double digits it had previously forecast.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Roughly two-thirds of the reduced AOI margin is driven by corrective actions in North America,\" Stellantis said. \"Other contributors include lower than expected sales performance in the second half of the year across most regions.\"\n\nRead more: What are share buybacks?\n\nThe carmaker also said it now expected to see negative cashflow for the year of between €5bn (£4.2bn) and €10bn.\n\nThe company also reportedly said on Monday that it was recalling 194,000 plug-in hybrid jeeps over fire risk.\n\nStellantis wasn't the only European carmaker to fall in the previous session, as Aston Martin (AML.L) also slumped after warning on profits.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\n\nTechnology company Super Micro Computer underwent a 10-for-1 stock split following the market close on Monday.\n\nStock splits increase the number of shares in circulation, which reduces the share price, broadening accessibility to a wider range of investors.\n\nA number of companies have announced stock splits this year, including chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and retailer Walmart (WMT).\n\nRead more: Funds set to benefit from falling interest rates\n\nShares in Super Micro fell sharply last week after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US Department of Justice is investigating the company over alleged accounting irregularities.\n\nIn August, the company announced that it would be delayed in filing its annual report.

Recent highlights include a strong Q2 revenue of $39.1 billion and significant advancements in AI technology, juxtaposed against rising costs and regulatory hurdles.

NasdaqGS:META Share price vs Value as at Oct 2024\n\nStrengths: Core Advantages Driving Sustained Success For Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms boasts significant user growth, with over 3.2 billion daily active users across its apps, as highlighted by CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The company has also made notable strides in engaging young adults on Facebook, which is crucial for long-term growth. Advances in AI have significantly enhanced the quality of recommendations, driving user engagement. Financially, Meta Platforms reported a strong Q2 revenue of $39.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year, and an operating income of $14.8 billion, representing a 38% operating margin. The company’s solid cash position, with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, further underscores its financial health. Additionally, Meta is currently trading below its estimated fair value of $730.92, making it an attractive investment despite its higher-than-industry-average Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 28.2x.\n\nWeaknesses: Critical Issues Affecting Meta Platforms's Performance and Areas For Growth\n\nMeta Platforms faces several challenges. The cost of revenue increased by 23%, primarily due to higher infrastructure and Reality Labs inventory costs, as noted by CFO Susan Li. Reality Labs, in particular, reported an operating loss of $4.5 billion, highlighting the financial strain of its ambitious projects. Additionally, total expenses for Q2 were $24.2 billion, up 7% compared to the previous year. Meta’s Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 28.2x is considered expensive compared to the US Interactive Media and Services industry average of 25.9x. Moreover, the company's earnings forecast of 11.6% per year is slower than the US market's 15.2% growth rate, indicating potential underperformance relative to broader market expectations.\n\nOpportunities: Potential Strategies for Leveraging Growth and Competitive Advantage\n\nMeta Platforms has several opportunities for growth and innovation. The development of AI technologies is expected to significantly enhance services for advertisers, as emphasized by Mark Zuckerberg. The expansion of Meta AI and the potential for a new major social app could open new revenue streams. Additionally, the future of business messaging, where every business might have an AI agent for customer interaction, presents a substantial market opportunity. The ongoing partnership with EssilorLuxottica to develop multi-generational smart eyewear products, such as Ray-Ban Meta glasses, is another promising avenue. The glasses have already seen high demand in various markets, indicating a successful product expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThreats: Key Risks and Challenges That Could Impact Meta Platforms's Success\n\nMeta Platforms faces several external threats that could impact its growth. Regulatory challenges are a significant concern, with increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in both the EU and the US, as highlighted by CFO Susan Li. The company is also dealing with intense competition in the AI space, which could limit the success of its proprietary technologies like Llama. Market risks are another concern, with expected year-over-year growth to slow in Q3 due to strong growth from China-based advertisers in the previous year. Additionally, the company is involved in multiple legal issues, including a $1.4 billion settlement with the State of Texas over biometric data misuse and a class action lawsuit alleging harm to minors from its social media platforms.\n\nTo gain deeper insights into Meta Platforms's historical performance, explore our detailed analysis of past performance.To dive deeper into how Meta Platforms's valuation metrics are shaping its market position, check out our detailed analysis of Meta Platforms's Valuation.\n\nConclusion\n\nMeta Platforms demonstrates a compelling mix of strengths and opportunities that position it well for sustained success. The company's impressive user growth and enhanced AI-driven engagement underscore its potential for long-term expansion, while its strong financial performance and substantial cash reserves highlight its solid financial health. Facing challenges such as increased costs and regulatory pressures, Meta's strategic focus on AI advancements and innovative product developments, like smart eyewear, offer promising avenues for future growth. Although Meta's Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 28.2x is higher than the industry average of 25.9x, it remains an attractive investment given it is trading below its estimated fair value of $730.92 and is relatively cheaper compared to peers with an average P/E ratio of 34.3x. This blend of solid fundamentals and strategic initiatives suggests a positive outlook for Meta's future performance.\n\nMake It Happen\n\nHold shares in Meta Platforms?

        "content": "OpenAI has launched ChatGPT’s ability to search the web, introducing a potential threat to Google’s (GOOGL) search dominance.\n\nChatGPT search provides links to relevant web sources in its responses, “which you would have previously needed to go to a search engine for,” OpenAI said. With web search on ChatGPT, users can ask questions “in a more natural, conversation way.”\n\nThe feature, which either ChatGPT can “choose” to use based on a query or can be manually chosen by a user, “blends the benefits of a natural language interface with the value of up-to-date sports scores, news, stock quotes, and more,” OpenAI said.\n\nChatGPT “will consider the full context of” its chat with a user to determine if it will search the web for a response, OpenAI said, adding that it has news and data partners to provide the up-to-date information. User chats now have links to articles, blog posts, and other sources so that users can see references for ChatGPT’s responses.\n\nSearchGPT waitlist members as well as ChatGPT Plus and Team users have access to search starting on Thursday. ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu users will get search access over the next weeks, and Free users will get access in the coming months, the company said. The feature will be available on the ChatGPT website, as well as through the desktop and mobile apps.\n\nChatGPT search “is a fine-tuned version” of the company’s GPT-4o model, it said.\n\nIn July, OpenAI said it was testing SearchGPT, a temporary prototype of artificial intelligence-powered search features it planned to integrate with ChatGPT. The prototype was launched to a small group of testers and publishers for feedback. OpenAI has signed a number of licensing deals with news publishers, including the Associated Press and Condé Nast, to train its AI models on news content.\n\n“We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you’re looking for can be faster and easier,” OpenAI said in a blog post at the time.\n\nChatGPT search could have implications for search-engine dominant Google, which has infused AI into its search abilities.\n\nEarlier this week, Google said its AI Overview search feature will now reach over 1 billion users each month after rolling out to more than 100 new countries and territories. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said AI Overview is seeing stronger engagement, and users are asking “longer and more complex questions.” Integrating ads into AI Overview is also driving connections between consumers and businesses, he said.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Google (GOOGL) parent Alphabet saw its share price rise almost 5% during midday trading on Wednesday after delivering earnings that surpassed Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nConsolidated Alphabet revenues grew 15% year over year to $88.3 billion, “reflecting strong momentum across the business,” the company said. Net income increased 34%, and earnings per share, or EPS, increased 37% to $2.12. The company’s cloud division revenues grew 35% to $11.4 billion due to “accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform across AI infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products,” it said.\n\nAlphabet’s shares were up 1.66% at the market close on Tuesday and were up around 6.4% during pre-market trading on Wednesday. The company’s shares are up around 28.5% so far this year.\n\nThe company was expected to report revenues of $86.4 billion and EPS of $1.84 for the third quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS).\n\n“The momentum across the company is extraordinary,” Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said in a statement. “Our commitment to innovation, as well as our long-term focus and investment in AI, are paying off with consumers and partners benefiting from our AI tools.”\n\nIn its cloud unit, Google’s “AI solutions are helping drive deeper product adoption with existing customers,” as well as attracting new customers and larger deals, he said.\n\nOn the company’s earnings call, Pichai said Google engineers are currently using AI to generate more than a quarter of all new code at the company, which they then have to review and accept. Using AI for coding “is boosting productivity and efficiency,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Google’s AI Overview search feature will now reach over 1 billion users each month after rolling out to more than 100 new countries and territories, Pichai said, adding that AI Overview is seeing stronger engagement, and users are asking “longer and more complex questions.” Integrating ads into AI Overview is also driving connections between consumers and businesses, he said.\n\nPichai said Google is “excited” for Nvidia’s (NVDA) new Blackwell AI chips and expects to “be one of the first to provide [them] at scale.”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Google (GOOGL) parent Alphabet is set to report third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, after beating second-quarter earnings expectations on artificial intelligence momentum.\n\nThe tech giant is expected to report revenues of around $86.4 billion for the third quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Google’s U.S. revenues are expected to be $40.6 billion, and its “rest of the world” revenues are expected at $45 billion. The company is expected to report earnings per share, or EPS, of $1.84, according to FactSet.\n\nIn the second quarter, Google reported revenues of nearly $85 billion, outdoing Wall Street’s expectations by around $640 million. Google’s revenue was up 14% year over year, and its Cloud division surpassed $10 billion in quarterly revenues for the first time, Google president Ruth Porat said. Google Cloud also exceeded $1 billion in operating profit for the first time.\n\n“Our strong performance this quarter highlights ongoing strength in Search and momentum in Cloud,” Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said in a statement at the time. “We are innovating at every layer of the AI stack. Our longstanding infrastructure leadership and in-house research teams position us well as technology evolves and as we pursue the many opportunities ahead.”\n\nIn recent months, Google has reportedly made progress on software for AI models that resembles humanlike reasoning abilities. The company has long focused on “reasoning” capabilities in large language models (LLMs), including with its work on chain-of-thought prompting.\n\nWith this technique, which people told Bloomberg Google is using, LLMs can solve multistep problems using a “series of intermediate reasoning steps,” similar to the way a human would. OpenAI unveiled its “reasoning” model series, OpenAI o1, in September.\n\nGoogle is also working on improving its Gemini chatbot’s “reasoning” abilities. In July, Google made its fastest, most cost-efficient model, 1.5 Flash, available in the unpaid version of Gemini.\n\nShares of Google are up around 18% so far this year.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Qualcomm reveals AI smartphone chip as industry leans into AI phones",
        "content": "The smartphone industry is banking on AI to reaccelerate device sales after years of slowing growth. But to do that, it’ll have to give consumers a reason to pony up for new phones more often.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) is aiming for its latest smartphone chips to do just that, adding a number of new on-board AI capabilities it says will allow you to do things like virtually adjust the lighting in your video calls in real-time and allow your device to recognize real-world objects without having to access the web.\n\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite is Qualcomm’s latest top-of-the-line mobile processor and includes improved performance and power efficiency thanks to the company’s use of what it calls Prime Cores, which are designed for high-end applications, and Performance Cores, for more casual tasks.\n\nQualcomm says the chips will make their way into smartphones from companies including Samsung, Xiaomi, ASUS, OnePlus, Honor, Oppo, and more in the coming weeks.\n\nThe chip maker is promising some big performance gains from the Snapdragon 8 Elite, saying its central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), should save 45% and 40% more energy than its predecessor the Snapdragon 8 Gen. 3, which Samsung used in its Galaxy S24 line of smartphones.\n\nBut the chip’s biggest features are its ability to power onboard AI functions. Qualcomm says the chip will allow for things like erasing unwanted objects in videos, rather than just photos, without having to upload your movie to the cloud for processing. Instead, your phone will be able to simply remove that person who walked into the background of your shot. President and CEO of Qualcomm Cristiano Amon delivers his keynote speech at Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 3, 2024. (Photo by I-Hwa CHENG / AFP) (Photo by I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) (I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images)\n\nThe company also says OEM partners can use the NPU to expand photos beyond their borders by, for instance, increasing the background of a shot, and use the camera to interact with the world around you. For instance, you’ll be able to point your phone at an object and ask the onboard voice assistant about objects in your shot, without the need to connect to the web.\n\nQualcomm unveiled its first-generation Snapdragon X Elite in late 2023, and Microsoft (MSFT) eventually chose the processors for its Surface line of laptops and processors, debuting the new PCs in May this year.\n\nOnboard AI is the major common denominator between the two generations of chips. Qualcomm is working to ensure that users don’t need an internet connection to use generative AI apps and services, which could prove to be a major differentiator for new smartphones and PCs versus their predecessors.\n\nBoth the PC and smartphone industries believe AI will be the next big feature to get consumers to upgrade their devices to newer systems in the coming months and years. Still, outfitting devices with the ability to run AI apps isn’t going to get the vast majority of customers interested in spending a few hundred dollars on a new laptop or smartphone. The only thing that will do that are intriguing new apps that take advantage of AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nSure, more intelligent digital assistants are helpful, and improving photo and video capabilities is impressive, but there’s still no single killer app or app category that’s got people talking about wanting an AI device. My own friends and family are certainly interested in the marketing around AI products, but none of them, outside of a few early adopters and people who need the latest and greatest devices, are interested in paying up for AI just yet.\n\nThat said, it’s still early in the consumer AI lifecycle, meaning there’s plenty of time for a slick new app that takes advantage of AI to come along. And when it does, we’ll finally get a sense of the appetite for AI-powered hardware. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.

        "content": "Shaquille O’Neal, the former NBA superstar, has seen his fair share of investments. Still, one of his most notable financial decisions came through babysitting – something he didn't expect to be doing. In an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, O’Neal detailed how this casual encounter led to one of his most lucrative opportunities. However, not all of his investments began as favorably.\n\nDon't Miss\n\nThe global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\nDiscussing his ventures, O’Neal recounted what he considers his “worst investment ever.” He had a chance to partner with Starbucks when its CEO, Howard Schultz, proposed expanding into African American communities. O’Neal explained his initial skepticism: “So, me growing up, I’d never seen Black people drink coffee. So I look to the owner of Starbucks and say, ‘it’s not going to work. Black people don’t drink coffee.’” This decision, he admits, did not age well, humorously noting, “So now, every time I go to Starbucks, I see Black people drinking coffee, I’m like–”\n\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\n\nPassing on Starbucks may have been a huge mistake, but he still got in early on one of the most powerful tech companies ever. While at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles around 1993 or 1994, he babysat a couple of children whose father was in a meeting. After the meeting, the father, impressed with Shaq’s rapport with his children, offered him an investment opportunity in a then-little-known startup named Google. “You’re good with kids. I like you. I’m going to bring you in on this investment,” the father said. He described the future of Google, envisioning a world where “you’re going to be able to type on your phone, search engine, this, do this, boom, boom, boom. You should invest.”\n\nShaq took the advice and the rest is history. “I invested. And then, a couple of years later, I got a really big return,” he shared with DeGeneres.

Highlights included the ongoing secular growth of digital advertising driving Google search (+14%), YouTube’s continued success as a leading content platform (+13%) and the performance of the Cloud business (+29%).

        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) is continuing to find ways to monetize its massive investments in artificial intelligence with an increasing array of software offerings for enterprises and consumers. The company’s latest effort is what it calls autonomous agents and comes as Wall Street prepares to scrutinize tech companies’ AI spending and growth.\n\nDuring its AI Tour event in London on Monday, which included keynotes by CEO Satya Nadella and CMO of Copilot at Work Jared Spataro, Microsoft announced that the new software will be available for public preview next month.\n\nEssentially custom-built AI apps that can handle specific tasks for enterprise workers, autonomous agents are meant to free up employees’ time to handle other projects. Microsoft pointed to companies like McKinsey & Company and the UK-based Pets at Home that have used their own agents to cut down on time-consuming work including data entry and processing client proposals.\n\nUsers can build their own autonomous agents in Copilot Studio using what Microsoft refers to as low-code or no-code instructions. Basically, you give the autonomous agent a purpose, like sorting through incoming email requests for service. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during a showcase event of the company's AI assistant, Copilot, ahead of the annual Build developer conference at Microsoft headquarters, Monday, May 20, 2024, in Redmond, Wash. (AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nFrom there, you tell the agent, in natural language with no coding, what to do with the email, the kind of information it needs to pull out of the message, and what to do if any data is missing or otherwise unavailable. You can then attach different files and documents outlining how to handle customer data and then set the agent to work.\n\nMicrosoft also included the ability for workers to step in and check the agent’s work to ensure its accuracy, as well as deal with any potential hallucinations, or errors introduced by the AI itself.\n\nMicrosoft’s autonomous agents are part of a broader effort to take advantage of, and get a return on, its investments in AI, including its team-up with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said the company spent $19 billion on capital expenditures, including finance leases, the majority of which came from AI and cloud-related needs. In total, Microsoft spent $55.7 billion on capital expenditures through its fiscal 2024. That’s up from $31.9 billion in 2023, and $29.2 billion in 2022.\n\nThe company says 2.1 million users currently engage with Copilot via its Microsoft business applications each month, a number the tech giant is keen on raising. The company is banking heavily on its AI-powered Copilot platform to generate revenue from businesses looking to take advantage of the software to improve overall worker efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q4, Microsoft said its cloud services, which includes its AI platform, brought in $36.8 billion of the company’s $64.7 billion in total revenue, a 21% year-over-year increase.\n\nBut Microsoft is far from the only business software provider looking to cash in on the AI boom. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Salesforce (CRM) are pushing to grab their piece of the AI pie, with Google continuing to plow more features into its Gemini for Google Workspace platform and Salesforce rolling out its own AI offerings and Einstein Copilot.\n\nWith earnings season in full swing and AI top of mind on Wall Street, companies like Microsoft and its rivals will need to show that they’re continuing to sign up more customers for their AI services, or risk investor backlash.

        "title": "Inside Microsoft's AI strategy: Compete with everybody on everything",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES — At a Microsoft (MSFT) event here earlier this month, attendees sipped drinks and sampled hors d’oeuvres as Kendrick Lamar pulsed through the speakers. They meandered between rows of laptops, each demonstrating the latest capabilities of the company’s flagship AI product, Copilot. True to the city’s reputation, many of those present were influencers, filming their interactions with the technology for their followers.\n\nYet even these arbiters of digital trends seemed genuinely intrigued. The artificial intelligence updates on display marked a significant shift from Microsoft’s previous focus on business productivity, with features that appealed to a broader audience — including tech-savvy influencers.\n\nThe tech giant’s latest offerings represent a significant leap forward in personalized AI, integrating voice and vision features that promise to transform how users interact with the technology. Among the additions to Microsoft’s Copilot are a visual recognition tool, chatty conversational abilities, and a virtual news anchor.\n\nMicrosoft isn’t done with Copilot announcements, with even more updates announced at a London event Monday morning. The ambitious moves position Copilot as a direct challenger to AI products made by Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Adobe (ADBE), and even OpenAI, one of the company’s partners and the maker of ChatGPT.\n\nBy combining advanced language processing with visual and auditory capabilities, and envisioning how AI could help people throughout their day, Microsoft is aiming to become the go-to AI platform for both work and personal life.\n\nThe Copilot revamp is the first major initiative led by Mustafa Suleyman since his appointment as CEO of Microsoft AI. Suleyman, a co-founder of DeepMind and the startup Inflection AI, joined Microsoft earlier this year when the tech giant acquired Inflection.\n\n“At Microsoft AI, we are creating an AI companion for everyone,” Suleyman wrote in a blog post.\n\nCarolina Milanesi, the president and principal analyst at Creative Strategies, went to an accompanying Copilot launch event in New York and described it as Suleyman’s coming out party.\n\n“It was the first time Microsoft talked about the consumer,” she said in an interview. Milanesi noted that some of the demos were running on iOS or Android devices, signaling Microsoft’s intent to reach users across all platforms.\n\nMilanesi said it was also the first time she thought that Microsoft could appeal to the non-business side of people’s lives beyond search and gaming. The focus on the updated Copilot app, one of the primary ways to interact with the tech, is an especially important move, given how much time people spend on their phones. By launching it for iOS and Android, Microsoft has beaten both Apple and Samsung to the punch in bringing a comprehensive AI assistant to smartphones.\n\n“Consumers are still not quite sure what the return on investment is,” Milanesi said of using phones with AI capabilities. “Having an app that delivers value to you is going to be easier to see versus when it’s embedded across the device.”\n\nThe strategy gives Microsoft a window of opportunity to establish itself in the mobile AI space before Apple rolls out its Apple Intelligence or Samsung embraces solutions like Google’s Gemini. Whether Copilot will live up to other offerings, Microsoft’s strategy is clear.\n\n“Whatever they sell,” Milanesi said, “generative AI is part of it and will drive a differentiation in what they’re selling.”\n\nAI in everything\n\nNot long after investing a reported $13 billion in OpenAI last year, Microsoft announced AI assistants it calls Copilots, which plug into its biggest software products including Word, Excel and PowerPoint — all powered at least in part by ChatGPT. The Copilots are meant to make work easier by doing things like generating slide decks or creating notes from a Zoom meeting.\n\nBut Microsoft’s latest Copilot update reaches far beyond the workday, challenging a wide array of existing tools. Taking cues from OpenAI’s recent voice innovations in ChatGPT, Microsoft has given its AI assistant a human-like conversational ability. Users can now choose from four distinct voices and engage in natural, flowing dialogues with Copilot. The AI allows for mid-conversation interruptions and follow-up questions, mirroring the back-and-forth of chatting with a real person.\n\nEven Microsoft’s Paint app, once the lowliest of visual editing tools, now comes with generative AI abilities that compete with Adobe’s Firefly. A feature in the app called Image Creator lets users generate images from any text description. Doodlers can sketch out a basic scene and have Paint make it more elaborate and realistic, using a creativity slider to adjust the output.\n\nUpdates to Microsoft’s Edge browser, which has Copilot built-in, can now summarize page contents in Bing searches, a shot across the bow at Google’s rocky foray into AI-infused search.\n\nOther updates also take on Google. Copilot Daily creates audio summaries of the news that rival NotebookLM, a Google AI product that can take text and generate a podcast in minutes.\n\nBut at the heart of Copilot’s overhaul is Microsoft’s ambitious foray into visual AI: Copilot Vision. This feature gives the assistant the ability to comprehend and analyze the content of web pages in real-time, effectively allowing it to “see” alongside the user. By integrating this visual acuity with its enhanced voice capabilities, Copilot can now engage in nuanced, context-aware dialogue about on-screen content — be it text, images, or multimedia. So far, only a select number of paid subscribers have access to this service.\n\nEven with all these announcements, Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, downgraded his rating on Microsoft stock from “Buy” to “Neutral.”\n\n“Our perspective on Microsoft is still very positive,” Luria said in an interview. “They’re doing a lot to provide both enterprise and consumers with AI tools. Our recent downgrade is predicated more on the fact that we think that in many regards, Amazon (AMZN) and Google have caught up, and in some regards they’re even in the lead.”\n\nLuria said that while Microsoft is ahead of the curve for many AI offerings, AI chip development, a very time-consuming process, is a key area where Microsoft lags its rivals. Google started work on its chips over a decade ago, with Amazon following a few years later.\n\n“Microsoft was a little late to the party in realizing that they can’t just depend on Nvidia (NVDA),” Luria said, referring to the AI chipmaking behemoth. “So they’ve only had a couple of years of development into their products.”\n\nD.A. Davidson has found that while Amazon and Google have extensively deployed their own custom chips across their data centers, Microsoft has not achieved the same level of broad deployment.\n\n“They started their chip development later than Amazon and Google,” Luria said. “But apart from that, they’re doing what they need to do.”\n\nThe future of Microsoft AI’s play\n\nMicrosoft rode the wave of AI enthusiasm in 2023, with its stock surging almost 57% last year. But 2024 has proven to be a more challenging landscape for the tech giant. Microsoft stock has risen about 12% so far this year, trailing most of its peers and even the broader S&P 500 index.\n\nWhile Microsoft has not yet disclosed specific revenue figures for generative AI products such as Copilot, the company has provided some insight into AI’s impact on its business. During its last quarterly earnings call in July, Microsoft said its cloud service saw 29% year-over-year revenue growth, with 8 percentage points of that growth attributable to AI services.\n\nIf it becomes a seamless part of people’s lives, Microsoft’s Copilot could unlock new revenue streams and solidify the company’s position in both consumer and enterprise markets. The challenge lies in creating AI tools that are not just innovative, but indispensable to users’ daily lives and work processes.\n\n“Our task is to ensure AI always enriches people’s lives and strengthens our bonds with others, while supporting our uniqueness and endlessly complex humanity,” Suleyman wrote. “This is a new era of technology that doesn’t just ‘solve problems,’ it’s there to support you, teach you and help you.”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI news investors should not miss.\n\nAccording to Ark Invest, an investment manager focused on disruptive technologies, artificial intelligence breakthroughs are expected to increase the share of the global equity market associated with disruptive innovation from 16% to 60% by 2030. With inflation transitioning to deflation in several sectors, the firm believes that five innovation platforms, namely robotics, energy storage, AI, blockchain, and multi-OMIC (biological analysis) sequencing will be profoundly impacting macroeconomic metrics over the next few years.\n\n“Interest rates are likely to surprise on the low side of expectations, broadening the equity rally from a narrow subset of stocks and reinforcing the need for diversified AI investments.” -Catherine Wood, CEO and CIO\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOne of the firm's ETFs with the investment theme of next-generation internet outperformed broad-based global equity indices in the third quarter, benefiting from its holdings in companies involved in innovative technologies. The year-to-date performance of the fund is 16.81%, outperforming its category by 1.59 percentage points year-to-date.\n\nIn light of this trend, joining CNBC’s “The Exchange”, technology reporter Kate Rooney revealed how Wall Street is trying to cash in on the AI craze using AI itself. According to Rooney, the new world of generative AI is starting an “arms race for hedge funds”. Modern versions of AI today are better than human traders in ways more than one. They learn from mistakes and get smarter along the way, and they ultimately require minimal human intervention. Combining this with the rise of OpenAI and Anthropic, these “off-the-shelf” models tend to be cheaper.\n\nMoreover, while human traders may be capable, they often succumb to emotions and tend to make mistakes. This is why Intelligent Alpha CEO Doug Clinton believes that a “lack of emotion” is actually the edge or “superpower” of AI. That said, the program revealed how hedge funds are now looking into AI to “get ahead of the markets”, where their use of AI will ultimately help them improve decision-making in the field. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, which have raised significant capital along the way, ultimately need enterprise clients to scale, and Wall Street is an ideal fit due to its reliance on data and analysis.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntelligent Alpha has launched a first-of-its-kind ETF named after famed stock trader Jesse Livermore. The ETF uses OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini to construct a global equity portfolio. As per Clinton, firms that get on board with AI could gain an edge with a price tag of millions of dollars.\n\n“What it does is it adds some intelligence to indexes, which are just definitionally sort of a set of rules that can’t be smart. And they also take that emotion out of the active side where human beings are still making decisions, but we get caught up. You know, we make mistakes and sometimes those compound. And so I think by fixing those two issues, AI has the potential to really capture a lot of value in terms of assets flowing to these new AI-powered funds.” - Intelligent Alpha CEO\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Innovative Agreement: Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google Invests in Small Modular Reactors to Power AI Initiatives\n\nA doctor in a laboratory, overseeing the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an American multinational technology conglomerate holding company wholly owning the internet giant Google, amongst other businesses.\n\nGoogle’s current lineup of AI products includes consumer-oriented AI products such as Google One AI Premium and Gemini for enhanced productivity, along with Gemini versions tailored for personal and enterprise use. For developers, tools like Gemini models, Google AI Studio, and Vertex AI help facilitate the integration and management of AI capabilities.\n\nOn Monday, October 15, Google stated that it had signed a corporate agreement in what is claimed to be the world’s first for buying power from multiple small modular reactors. This agreement is done to meet the electricity demand for artificial intelligence. The company has agreed to buy around an estimated 500 megawatts of power from six or seven reactors. Alphabet Inc has agreed with Kairos Power, aiming to bring Kairos’ first small modular reactor online by 2030.\n\nAs per Alphabet, a so-called order book framework with Kairos instead of the purchase of individual reactors purchases will help send a demand signal to the market and make a long-term investment to speed the development of SMRs. Mike Laufer, the CEO of Kairos, is confident that this innovative strategy will enhance the likelihood of successful project completion within budget and on schedule.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 3rd on our list of AI news investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Best American Stocks To Buy and Hold in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024.\n\nNeutral Stance Amid Uncertainties\n\nThe tech sector has been showing positive performance amid market concerns, driven by improved earnings estimates and substantial investments in artificial intelligence. Approximately 40% of operating cash flow is currently allocated to AI, raising questions about when these investments will begin to yield returns. The strong profit margins of mega-cap stocks, averaging over 23%, compared to just over 8.5% for other sectors, suggest continued capital inflows into tech companies demonstrating earnings strength. While some consolidation and growth slowdown may occur, there is confidence that investor sentiment will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.\n\nAs sentiments shift regarding major tech stocks, other profitable tech companies are maintaining positive momentum in the market. There was a conversation regarding this, covered a few days back in our article about the 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In, where Jason Snipe, Odyssey Capital Advisors principal, discussed the tech sector’s mega-cap momentum, particularly in light of recent mega-cap stock downgrades and significant investor outflows. Here’s an excerpt from his sentiment:\n\n“…This focus on AI has contributed to some recent downgrades but also suggests continued upside potential for select names within the sector.\n\n…He acknowledged that while there may be some consolidation and a slowdown in growth, he believes that investors’ muscle memory will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.\n\nSnipe’s analysis underscores the complexities facing the tech sector amid market volatility and evolving economic conditions. While challenges persist, particularly with mega-cap stocks experiencing downgrades, there are also significant opportunities driven by innovation and strong profit margins that could support continued growth in this space…”\n\nKatie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on October 17 and highlighted that there’s a likelihood that the markets could move into choppier territory. Katie Stockton characterized her stance as neutral regarding the indices despite the strength of the trend and the participation of most stocks on the upside. She noted that while short-term momentum is currently positive, particularly behind major indices, there are concerns about potential problems if key players like NVIDIA falter. She highlighted that sentiment appears overly bullish or greedy, as evidenced by the Fear and Greed Index reaching an extreme level of 5%. This situation makes it challenging for the market to sustain overbought conditions, which are prevalent across various timeframes.\n\nStory continues\n\nStockton anticipates a pullback or possibly a more significant corrective phase in the fourth quarter for the S&P 500, suggesting that this could mark the beginning of a range-bound environment. She pointed to indicators such as the VIX, which has entered a new higher volatility cycle, and mentioned signs of long-term exhaustion indicated by the DeMark indicators, levels not seen collectively since late 2021. While this does not necessarily signal an impending bear market, it does enhance the likelihood of experiencing a choppier trading environment.\n\nWhen asked about the recent performance of banks and cyclical stocks compared to defensive stocks, Stockton acknowledged that while there has been a positive move from the financial sector contributing to the S&P 500’s recent gains, it is too early to conclude that this represents a breakout in relative strength for financials. She indicated that most metrics suggest financials will likely perform in line with broader market trends rather than leading them. Furthermore, she expressed concern that mega-cap sectors are poised to lose their leadership position, which could pose challenges to overall market performance.\n\nRegarding small-cap stocks, Stockton noted that while the Russell 2000 index made another attempt at an upside move, closing close to 2,300 with a 1.6% increase, long-term trends still indicate underperformance relative to the S&P 500. She pointed out that there has not been a breakout in the Russell 2000, which remains stalled below resistance levels established during summer highs. Consequently, she does not see actionable opportunities in small caps at this time and anticipates neutral trading conditions for this segment.\n\nOn the topic of bonds, Stockton mentioned that Treasury yields have shown some upside momentum but backed off recently. She sees potential entry points in Treasury bond proxies like TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF), suggesting signs of short-term downside exhaustion within a broader long-term uptrend for fixed income. She believes there is an opportunity for investors to enter Treasury bond proxies now, while also expecting yields to stall without significant long-term declines.\n\nHer insights highlight her focus on maintaining balance amid prevailing uncertainties in both equity and bond markets.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo find the best American stocks, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database to find US stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): A Top Pick for Long-Term Growth in 2024\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a technology conglomerate that holds a majority stake in Google, managing its diverse range of businesses, which include Google Search, Google Cloud, YouTube, Waymo, and Verily, with a primary focus on innovation and organizing the world’s information, making it universally accessible and useful.\n\nGoogle Cloud revenue increased by 28.8% in the second quarter of 2024, contributing to a 13.59% overall revenue growth. Google’s ad revenue increased to $48.5 billion in Q2, accounting for almost 60% of the company’s sales for the quarter. Besides Google, YouTube’s ad sales increased to $8.7 billion. Net income was $23.6 billion.\n\nIn October, Google, along with Amazon and Microsoft, is investing in nuclear power to meet the growing energy demands of their data centers, fueled by the expansion of AI services. These tech giants are seeking clean energy alternatives to reduce their carbon footprints and support their sustainability goals. Nuclear power is seen as a promising option due to its reliability and ability to provide large-scale energy production.\n\nThe company’s ambitious future is further strengthened as we see that Bill Ackman, a renowned investor, has invested over 20% of his portfolio in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Wall Street analysts are also bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), predicting a 20% increase in its stock price within the next year.\n\nAI infrastructure and GenAI tools have generated billions in revenue year-to-date, used by over 2 million developers. Google, dominating the search engine market (91.06%), plans to invest $50 billion in AI by 2024. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dominance in search, growing cloud business, and AI investments position it for continued success. Strong financials and positive analyst sentiment make it a promising investment option.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best US Stocks For Foreign Investors Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other US stocks.\n\nOptimism Amid Market Strength\n\nDespite previous recession predictions, the market has shown resilience and continued to rise, largely due to multiple expansions rather than just earnings growth. Current market valuations are trading at approximately 22 times earnings during an easing cycle, raising questions about future earnings growth. There seems to be a disconnect between expectations for significant easing and projected strong earnings growth.\n\nInvestors are encouraged to remain vigilant and consider the evolving economic landscape as they navigate potential market shifts. Earlier in October, Jason Trennert, Strategas Research Partners chairman and CEO, joined CNBC to discuss the latest market trends and the state of the economy, highlighting that the bar is high to get bearish now. We covered his opinion in our article about the 8 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Invest In Now in much more detail. Here's an excerpt from that discussion:\n\n“Despite the challenges of 2022 and early 2023, which made it difficult to envision a market recovery, he noted that the market has defied expectations and continued to rise. Trennert attributed a significant portion of this upward movement to multiple expansions rather than just earnings growth. He marked a pivotal moment in 2023 as the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, which led to increased liquidity in the market and a subsequent rally. He recalled that around eleven months ago, the S&P 500 briefly hit 4,100 when ten-year yields reached 5%, suggesting that market dynamics have shifted considerably since then.\n\n....He expressed skepticism about future earnings growth, as expectations for a 14% increase in S&P earnings next year seem inconsistent with the anticipated six rate cuts from the Fed. He emphasized that if the market is expecting such significant easing while also projecting strong earnings growth, there may be a disconnect.\n\n...Despite these concerns, Trennert acknowledged that it is challenging to adopt a bearish outlook given current market conditions. He noted that ten-year treasury yields above 4.5% typically lead to market indigestion, while yields below this threshold make it hard to remain pessimistic.”\n\nOn October 16, J.J. Kinahan, IG North America CEO, joined CNBC's 'Squawk Box' to discuss the latest market trends, highlighting that he has never seen investors this afraid of a market that's doing so well. J.J. Kinahan noted that the upcoming weeks would be particularly interesting due to the convergence of earnings reports and the impending election, alongside uncertainty surrounding the Fed's next moves. He remarked on the market's resilience, highlighting that there have been 46 new highs for the S&P 500 this year, despite a general sentiment of skepticism among investors. He expressed that it is unusual for a market to perform so well while simultaneously being viewed with caution and fear.\n\nStory continues\n\nKinahan pointed out that many investors are hesitant, particularly those in their mid-30s and younger, who have not experienced a significant downturn in the market. He explained that this demographic often perceives any market decline as temporary, lasting only a few days. He emphasized the importance of taking risks when young and noted that many younger investors are excited about their opportunities in the current market environment. This positive sentiment is particularly significant given their parents' experiences during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.\n\nHe also speculated that part of the reason for the market's strong performance might be attributed to older investors who have been burned in previous downturns and are now waiting for a pullback that has yet to materialize. Kinahan suggested that as these investors gradually capitulate, they may start to invest more actively in the market.\n\nDiscussing interest rates, Kinahan acknowledged that while the Fed is in a massive easing cycle, there seems to be a disconnect with the bond market recently. He mentioned a study indicating that volatility during election years is not significantly greater than in non-election years. Currently, volatility is relatively low, hovering around a historical average of 20, and only recently rising to this level. He explained that typically, volatility tends to increase after elections, when political changes begin to take effect and policies, are implemented. He anticipated that January would bring more clarity regarding how these changes might impact the markets.\n\nKinahan's insights reflect a complex interplay between investor sentiment, market performance, and external economic factors as they navigate through earnings season and an election year. His perspective underscores a cautious optimism about the market's ability to maintain its upward trajectory despite prevailing uncertainties.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo find the best US stocks for foreign investors, we used Insider Monkey's proprietary database to find US stocks that were the most popular among elite and that analysts were bullish on. We then selected the top 8 stocks with the highest average analysts' upside potential. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their average analysts' upside potential, as of October 16.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 23.59%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a multinational technology conglomerate that holds a majority stake in Google. It was formed in 2015 to manage various businesses, including Google Search, Google Cloud, YouTube, Waymo, Verily, and X. It focuses on innovation and organizing the world's information, making it universally accessible and useful.\n\nThe company's Waymo division has 700+ cars operating in San Francisco alone, offering robotaxi services in multiple cities. Despite facing criticism for fires, crashes, and traffic violations, Waymo has achieved 100,000 robotaxi rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. YouTube Ads and Google Cloud are projected to reach a $100 billion revenue run rate by the end of 2024.\n\nGoogle Cloud revenue increased by 28.8% in Q2, surpassing $10 billion and $1 billion in quarterly revenue and operating profit. This contributed to a 13.59% overall revenue growth, totaling $84.74 billion. Net income was $23.6 billion. Google's ad revenue increased from $42.6 billion to $48.5 billion in Q2, accounting for almost 60% of Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Q2 sales. Besides Google, Alphabet owns YouTube, the world's second-largest website. YouTube's ad sales increased to $8.7 billion.\n\nAI infrastructure and GenAI tools have generated billions in revenue year-to-date and are now used by over 2 million developers. Google dominates the search engine market with approximately 91.06% and plans to invest $50 billion in AI initiatives by the end of 2024. AI technologies enhance user engagement and advertising efficiency on platforms like YouTube and search. Despite competition from new chatbots, its technological advantage in search has led to increased market share.\n\nDespite the recent antitrust rulings, the company remains a financial powerhouse. Its strong financial position and positive analyst sentiment make it a promising investment option.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the best US stocks for foreign investors right now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of GOOGL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other profitable stocks.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on October 14, Michael Kantrowitz, Chief Investment Officer at Piper Sandler noted that while the market is expensive, it's not a reason to get bearish and that unless a risk arises, the market will likely stay expensive. Kantrowitz explains that the market's valuation is driven by the pricing out of risks that existed two years ago, such as inflation and higher interest rates. He believes that if these risks were to resurface, it would be a reason to get worried, but currently, that's not the backdrop.\n\nHe also notes that investors should focus on stocks with continued earnings momentum, as these names will likely see the best outperformance and can hold their expensive multiples for longer. Kantrowitz is not too concerned about higher bond yields but notes that they can be a problem at some point. He thinks that yields would need to reach 4.25% to show up in the broader market.\n\nRegarding earnings revisions, Kantrowitz believes that revisions coming down have not overdone it and that it's normal to see estimates from the sell-side start out high and then trickle down throughout the year. He expects to see more downward earnings revisions but notes that large-cap stocks have held up far better in terms of earnings, which is why they continue to outperform.\n\nTom Lee, Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors discussed the markets and his recent observations. Lee believes that the market's resilience is due to the large amount of cash on the sidelines. He thinks that investors have been under-invested in stocks and that the market is becoming less dependent on macro data.\n\nLee pointed out that the market has been able to shrug off negative news and that the recent PPI and CPI reports were not enough to knock the market off track. He believes that the Fed will continue to be dovish, especially since inflation is still tracking towards the 2% target. Lee also thinks that the election, which is becoming less of a coin toss, is also contributing to the market's conviction.\n\nRegarding the impact of the election on the market, Lee believes that markets like visibility, but they also need to like what they see on the other side of the election. He thinks that whether Trump or Harris wins, stocks will do well next year, but there will be differences in sector and asset class performance depending on who wins.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile some may be concerned about the market's expensive valuation, others see it as a sign of strength and resilience, with that in context, let’s take a look at the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 30 largest companies by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to companies with positive TTM net income and 10-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 10-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Alphabet fair value estimate is US$242 Current share price of US$163 suggests Alphabet is potentially 33% undervalued The US$201 analyst price target for GOOGL is 17% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nWhat's The Estimated Valuation?\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$91.9b US$106.2b US$112.7b US$126.8b US$136.8b US$145.4b US$152.8b US$159.4b US$165.5b US$171.1b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x20 Analyst x16 Analyst x5 Analyst x4 Est @ 7.86% Est @ 6.25% Est @ 5.13% Est @ 4.34% Est @ 3.79% Est @ 3.40% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9%  US$86.0k US$93.0k US$92.3k US$97.1k US$98.0k US$97.4k US$95.8k US$93.6k US$90.8k US$87.9k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$932b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$171b× (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.5%) = US$4.0t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.0t÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$2.1t\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.0t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$163, the company appears quite good value at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alphabet as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.066. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Alphabet\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

        "title": "Tesla Stock vs. Alphabet Stock: Wall Street Says Buy One and Sell the Other",
        "content": "Despite soaring interest in artificial intelligence (AI), \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) underperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin during the past year. Specifically, Tesla shares fell 9%, and Alphabet shares advanced 18%, while the S&P 500 soared 36%.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects Tesla to slide lower over the next year, but analysts think Alphabet will produce sizable gains. Here are the specifics from The Wall Street Journal:\n\nAmong the 58 analysts who follow Tesla, the average 12-month price target is $216 per share. That forecast implies 2% downside from its current share price of $221. Among the 68 analysts who follow Alphabet, the average 12-month price target is $203 per share. That forecast implies 24% upside from its current share price of $163.\n\nInvestors should never rely on price targets, but they are a good place to begin researching a company. Here are the important details on Tesla and Alphabet.\n\nTesla: 2% implied downside\n\nTesla has stumbled due to macroeconomic challenges. High interest rates have exacerbated inflationary pressure on consumer wallets, suppressing demand for electric cars. Tesla has cut prices several times to boost demand, but its leading market share fell 3.1 percentage points year to date through August, and the price cuts have weighed heavily on its financial results.\n\nTesla narrowly topped the consensus sales estimate in the second quarter, but its earnings fell short for the fourth consecutive time. Specifically, while revenue increased 2% to $25.5 billion, operating expenses soared 39%, and non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income declined 43% to $0.52 per diluted share. However, there were a few silver linings, including increased production of its 4680 battery cell, something management called a \"major cost reduction milestone.\"\n\nTesla recently hosted a robotaxi event where it unveiled the Cybercab. The self-driving vehicle lacking a steering wheel and pedals will enter production in 2027 and cost less than $30,000. CEO Elon Musk also said Tesla would launch an unsupervised version of its full self-driving (FSD) software in California and Texas next year. But investors are justifiably skeptical, given that the company has overpromised in the past.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects Tesla's earnings to increase by 12% annually over the next three years. That estimate makes the current valuation of 62 times earnings look very expensive. However, Tesla could beat the consensus forecast if its FSD software can truly function without supervision by 2025. That could boost FSD subscription sales and allow a quick launch of robotaxi services.\n\nStory continues\n\nPersonally, I think eager investors can buy a small position in the stock here, provided they know its long-term performance depends greatly on Tesla's ability to transition toward high-margin artificial intelligence revenue (i.e., FSD software and robotaxi services) and away from capital-intensive automobile manufacturing. Having said that, it may be more prudent to wait for additional details concerning unsupervised FSD and the Cybercab.\n\nAlphabet: 24% implied upside\n\nAlphabet is the global leader in digital advertising, with an estimated market share of 27.4% in 2024, according to eMarketer. That dominance stems from its ability to source data and engage consumers with popular internet platforms like Google Search and YouTube. Alphabet has long used AI to inform its search engine and ad tech software, but it has recently added generative AI capabilities to further improve the user experience.\n\nAlphabet also operates the third-largest public cloud in Google Cloud Platform. While its market share trails that of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure by a wide margin, strength in AI infrastructure and large language models helped the company gain a percentage point of market share over the past year. \"Google's Gemini combines a world-class model with enterprise cloud services,\" according to analysts at Forrester Research.\n\nAlphabet reported solid financial results in the second quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 14% to $84.7 billion due to strong momentum in the cloud computing unit and more modest growth in the advertising segment. Meanwhile, GAAP net income increased 31% to $1.89 per diluted share due to continued cost control efforts.\n\nBeyond advertising and cloud computing, Alphabet also has a long-term opportunity with its autonomous driving subsidiary, Waymo. The company provides more than 100,000 rides weekly across Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. It has partnered with Uber to bring autonomous ride-hailing services to Atlanta and Austin in 2025.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America estimate Waymo's revenue could reach $75 million this year, an inconsequential sum compared to Alphabet's total revenue, but the autonomous driving unit should become increasingly significant in the future. The robotaxi market is projected to increase at 67% annually to reach $108 billion by 2031, according to Straits Research.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects Alphabet's earnings to increase by 17% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 23.4 times earnings look reasonable. Those figures give a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of 1.4, which matches the three-year average.

        "title": "2 Stocks That Could Join Nvidia in the $3 Trillion Club",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best stocks to profit off the artificial intelligence (AI) boom over the last two years. Shares of the AI chip leader have surged more than 820% since 2022 and currently have of a market cap of nearly $3.3 trillion -- trailing only Apple's $3.5 trillion.\n\nThe following \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are not far behind and could deliver exceptional returns in the next few years to join Nvidia and Apple in the $3 trillion club.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) shares have delivered life-changing returns to investors over the last few decades and continue to generate market-beating gains. The stock has doubled over the last five years, bringing its total market cap to $2 trillion. Based on the company's opportunities, the shares could climb another 50% in the next few years to reach $3 trillion in total market value.\n\nWhen you deliver billions of orders each year, every last mile of cost adds up. Amazon was able to reduce the cost to serve retail customers in 2023 for the first time since 2018. It continues to find ways to strip costs out of the retail business. The company's operating profit has doubled over the last year, as it shortens and optimizes delivery routes.\n\nReducing costs can benefit Amazon more than simply boosting its short-term profitability. It also can allow Amazon to gain market share in online shopping by lowering prices on select goods. Shortening transportation distances also means customers receive their orders faster, and that can lead to more frequent shopping.\n\nAmazon says it has plenty of opportunities to reduce costs by using automation and robotics and continuing to build its same-day delivery network. The company already controlled 37% of the U.S. e-commerce market in 2023 -- 6 times the share of No. 2 Walmart, according to Statista. Amazon's efforts to improve efficiencies and speed up order delivery show a relentless competitor continuing to look for ways to protect and stretch its lead. This is the kind of business you want protecting and growing your savings for retirement.\n\nAnalysts expect earnings to reach $7.30 per share by 2026, an increase of 52% over 2024 estimates. Amazon investors can expect the stock to climb along with that increase and reach a $3 trillion market cap within two years.\n\n2. Alphabet (formerly Google)\n\nShares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) also doubled in the last five years. The company's market cap is currently hovering around $2 trillion, putting it within striking distance of Nvidia's market value.\n\nWhile Amazon Web Services is the leading cloud service provider for enterprises, many businesses prefer Google Cloud. Google has been steadily gaining share of the cloud market in recent years. New AI services offered in Google Cloud are fueling its momentum.\n\nThe company credited strong demand for AI infrastructure and generative AI services for driving recent growth in the cloud. Google Cloud's revenue grew to more than $10 billion in the second quarter, but equally important, the segment's operating profit nearly tripled to surpass $1.1 billion last quarter. This shows Alphabet is earning a high return on investment on AI tools offered to Google Cloud customers like Vertex and the Gemini AI model.\n\nIt's also impressive that Alphabet can make the necessary investments to drive strong demand for cloud services and AI while producing solid earnings growth. Earnings grew 31% year over year in Q2, and analysts expect Alphabet's earnings to grow 16% over the long term.\n\nBy 2026, the consensus estimate has Alphabet's earnings reaching $10. If Alphabet earns a market average price-to-earnings ratio of around 27, the shares could be worth $270, implying upside of 62%. It could easily hit a $3 trillion market cap in two years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Among the Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other stocks owned by hedge funds.\n\nWall Street stocks surged this month after the Federal Reserve released minutes of its September meeting, which resulted in the first interest rate cuts in over four years. The details disclosed a ‘substantial majority’ of central bankers backing the 0.5 percentage-point cut, raising optimism among investors for further cuts ahead.\n\nThe broader market hit record highs on October 11, driven by several financial stocks reporting stronger-than-expected results during the recently concluded quarter. Another factor encouraging investors has been the downturn in US inflation, which fell to 2.4% in September and is inching toward the Federal Reserve’s goal of a two percent annual rate. This has raised hopes of a quarter-point cut in the central bank’s next meeting in November.\n\nHowever, some analysts warn against diving into stocks after interest rate cuts, citing uncertainty around the upcoming presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider in early September discussed historic patterns in US markets towards the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth.\n\nShe noted how the market performs well between June and August due to thinner volumes when traders are on vacation, while volatility picks up with an uptick in activity after they return to their desks in September. However, during the election year, this volatility peaks around mid-October, instead of September, according to Young Thomas.\n\nFundstrat Global Advisors’ co-founder, Tom Lee, has also cautioned investors against election-related uncertainty. Here is what he stated in an interview with CNBC late last month:\n\nThis Fed cut cycle I think is setting the stage for markets to be really strong over the next one month or next three months. But, what the stocks do between now and let’s say election day, I think is still a lot of uncertainty. And that’s the reason why I’m a little hesitant for investors to dive in.\n\nEarlier that month in the weeks leading to the interest rate cuts, Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, forecasted a 7-10% dip between September and October amid nervousness around the presidential elections. However, Lee urged investors to ‘buy the dip’, indicating that he sees the likely fall as an opportunity to buy stocks while they trade for a lower value.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdam Turnquist from LPL Financial also anticipates seasonal volatility in the weeks ahead but reiterated what Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes. Turnquist advises investors not to readjust their existing portfolios because seasonal volatility has short-term effects and is difficult to forecast.\n\nWith that said, let’s now shift focus to hedge fund sentiment on the stock market and discuss some of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the world’s leading technology companies by revenue and owns several notable platforms such as Google Search, Google Maps, Gmail, YouTube, and more.\n\nOn August 5, the US Department of Justice ruled against Alphabet in an anti-trust lawsuit regarding search dominance, with the judge declaring that the company stifled competition in the online search market to maintain its monopoly. This could lead to the company paying billions of dollars in hefty fines or legal settlements. Then earlier this month, in another case, a district judge ordered Google to overhaul its mobile app business and open the Play Store to rival firms. These verdicts have hurt Alphabet’s reputation and led to a bearish sentiment in some circles.\n\nFinancially, the company continues to remain strong. Driven by solid performances from Google Search and Google Cloud, Alphabet reported robust results in Q2 with revenues totaling $84.7 billion, increasing 14% from last year. Net income for the quarter stood at $23.6 billion, which represented an EPS of $1.89, beating analysts’ expectations of $1.85 per share.\n\nGoogle Services revenue was recorded at $73.9 billion, up from $66.2 billion in 2023. The ‘Google Search & Other’ segment revenue totaled $48.5 billion, while YouTube and Google Network earned $8.7 billion and $7.4 billion in revenues during Q2. Strong results during the quarter have helped Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) garner substantial investor optimism. Here is what The London Company Large Cap Strategy stated about Alphabet in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) – GOOG was a top performer this quarter as it reported strong Search revenue, tighter cost controls, and momentum in Cloud. Both direct and brand Search ads were better than expected and the strength in YouTube monetization continues. Expense controls have translated to 700bps of margin improvement. Management is removing layers to improve efficiency, which should drive margins higher. GOOG also provided details on paths to monetize Al for advertisers. GOOG initiated a dividend during the quarter to return additional cash to shareholders. It has a solid balance sheet, a significant market share, and generates strong returns.\n\nAccording to the Insider Monkey database for Q2 2024, Alphabet is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now, with 216 funds having a stake in the company. Wall Street analysts are also bullish on the stock, with consensus among them on Alphabet’s Buy rating. They also anticipate an upside potential of 20% in the company’s share price.\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The one exception to the stay, however, is that starting November 1, 2024 and continuing until November 1, 2027, Google is prohibited from making deals with carriers or device makers that block preinstallation of competing app stores in exchange for money, revenue share, or perks, the authors note.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. Since Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWall Street continues to gain momentum amid the latest earnings season and analysts are wondering whether we are still up for soft landing. Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz chief economic advisor, talked about the possibility of a soft landing vs no landing during a program on CNBC. When asked what would it take for the market to have a no-landing scenario, the analyst said:\n\n“I think we need the productivity enhancers from A.I., from life sciences to come earlier, we need to continue to have positive shocks to our labor force. And if we get those two things, you can get the bigger but not hotter economy which actually would be perfect for almost everything you can think of, from households to companies to financial markets.”\n\nThe analyst does not rule out the possibility of a recession, however.\n\n“My probability of a soft landing is 55%, and a recession is 30%. A soft landing is the most likely scenario, but it’s not dominant. Why isn’t it dominant? Because we have weakness in the household sector, particularly on the lower-income side, and the Fed has been unpredictable. Just think, Morgan—at the end of July, the Fed didn’t cut rates because everything seemed fine. By the next meeting in mid-September, it cut 50 basis points. And now it’s talking about cautious cuts. So, the Fed needs to be careful.”\n\nFor this article we picked 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Analysts Say Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) Among Top Beneficiaries of AI Data Center Spend\n\nphotostock77 / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 61\n\nCiti Research predicts that capital expenditures for data centers among the leading four cloud companies will surge by 40% year over year, offering a boost to data center interconnect (DCI) providers. The major players in this segment include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Citi anticipates that these firms will ramp up their data center investments by 40% to 50% in 2025.\n\nCiti analysts, led by Atif Malik, noted in an investor report that “we estimate that the AI networking opportunity is expanding beyond the server connection within a data center to AI platforms connecting multiple data centers through DCI.”\n\nCiti named Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) as one of the beneficiaries of this spending.\n\nMalik emphasized the challenges of containing AI model clusters within a single data center as their size approaches 300,000 GPUs by 2025, stating that “containing models in one data center unit will not be sustainable in the long term amid constraints related to power, regulations, among others.” Consequently, hyperscalers are increasingly adopting and planning to expand the use of a multi-data center training approach.\n\nCiti highlighted that Google has utilized this multi-data center strategy for training its Gemini 1 Ultra, and that OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic are also embracing this model. As a result of increased DCI spending, Citi projects that Arista’s revenue could grow by up to 25% year over year in 2025, primarily driven by Ethernet switching in AI networks.\n\nCisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) earlier this year announced a major restructuring plan that includes a 7% reduction in workforce and an estimated $1 billion in pre-tax cost savings. Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)’s legacy hardware businesses have been stagnating, with average revenue growth lingering at just 1.6%. Job cuts and cost savings will allow Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) to allocate capital to high-growth areas like AI and Cloud networking.\n\nThe expected cost savings, which will cut about 2.4% of total operating expenses, could boost Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) operating margins by more than 220 basis points in FY25. Although the company is ramping up its AI efforts, it only expects AI to bring in around $1 billion in revenue next year, less than 2% of the total. So, while AI isn’t likely to be a game-changer for Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) just yet, the focus on growth markets might accelerate overall revenue in the future.\n\nParnassus Value Equity Fund stated the following regarding Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“During the second quarter, the Fund’s overweight position in the Information Technology sector decreased slightly as we sold our position in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) and used most of the proceeds to buy Broadcom, a leading semiconductor company and provider of custom silicon products. Both stocks provide similar exposure to networking technology, but we believe Broadcom offers more upside from AI infrastructure spend and defensiveness due to its software assets.”\n\nOverall, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. While we acknowledge the potential of Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CSCO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Nvidia to win the race to $4 trillion market cap, experts say",
        "content": "Buy the dip.\n\nThat was the mindset around chip stocks this week as investors scooped up beaten-down shares, sending Nvidia to a record high. A strong outlook for Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) was enough to revive Wall Street’s enthusiasm for AI as growing confidence in the AI boom overshadowed chip supplier ASML’s sluggish forecast and reports of export caps of advanced AI chips to some Middle Eastern countries.\n\nNvidia closed the week above $138 per share, bringing its market value to $3.39 trillion. It’s now the world's second-largest company behind Apple. But that might not be for long. Experts I spoke with this past week say there’s growing confidence the chip giant will be the first Big Tech firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation.\n\n“There's no question about it,” Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, told me on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts. “The demand for GPU chips is strong, and you're seeing early adopters starting to get some ROI.”\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang fueled the stock’s rally earlier this month after describing demand for the new Blackwell chips as “insane.”\n\nEven amid the stock’s dramatic outperformance, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Tony Wang told me investors still “continuously underestimate” Nvidia’s growth potential. He sees “exceptional” demand for AI making it “definitely possible” that the chip giant crosses that $4 trillion threshold first.\n\nIn the coming weeks, earnings from fellow Magnificent Seven companies will give investors better insight into Nvidia’s market dominance. Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), which account for more than 40% of the chipmaker’s revenue, have all pledged to continue investing in AI.\n\nLast quarter, spending by Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft totaled more than $40 billion, while Amazon said spending in the second half of the year will likely surpass the $30 billion spent during the first half.\n\nBofA analyst Vivek Arya, who views Nvidia as a “generational opportunity,” cites capital expenditure commentary from top hyperscalers among the reasons that he sees Nvidia \"strengthening its position.\"\n\nArya lifted his price target on the chipmaker to $190 this week, implying a rally of nearly 40% from Friday’s closing price.\n\nArya and his team also cited Taiwan Semiconductor’s robust demand outlook as a positive. TSMC — a top supplier for Nvidia and other giants, including Apple — triggered a sector-wide rally after posting a more than 50% jump in net income for the third quarter and forecasting full-year revenue growth of nearly 30%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSafe to say, Big Tech's third quarter numbers will be a crucial test for Nvidia and key to the stock's momentum in the short term. Any disappointment in AI spending plans could lead to volatility for Nvidia and the broader chips market.\n\nBut if that happens, the sell-off may not last long. Niles Investment Management founder Dan Niles recently told me on Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid podcast he remains bullish on Nvidia’s long-term prospects.\n\n“You've got several more years of AI investment before you hit saturation or a more maturing AI landscape,” Niles said. “You'll see Nvidia's revenues double over the next several years, and I think you'll see the stock double over the next several years.”\n\nNvidia shares have rallied 21% so far this month, bringing its gains to 179% year to date.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google won’t have to immediately revamp its Google Play store policies, after a federal judge in California temporarily paused his order that would have forced the technology giant to overhaul its app marketplace.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says\n\nUS District Judge James Donato on Friday granted the delay, but only until there is a ruling by the federal appeals court in San Francisco on Google’s separate request to put his Oct. 7 order on hold. Donato mandated the changes after a trial of antitrust claims by Epic Games Inc. A jury found Google abused its power in the Android app market.\n\n“We’re pleased with the district court’s decision to temporarily pause the implementation of dangerous remedies demanded by Epic, as the court of appeal considers our request to further pause the remedies while we appeal,” a Google spokesperson said.\n\nWhile granting a short-term delay, Donato denied Google’s request for a long-term stay on his order because he said the company failed to show it was “warranted, especially with respect to likelihood of success on the merits and the public interest.”\n\nEpic Games, in a statement, said Donato’s temporary stay was just a “procedural step” that gives the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals time to rule. “Today the Court made it clear that Google’s appeal is meritless and rejected their request to delay opening up Android devices to competition while the appeal is ongoing,” the gamemaker said.\n\nDonato’s order required Google Play to allow developers to set up app marketplaces and offer consumers billing options other than its own payment system. He set a Nov. 1 deadline to complete the changes — sooner than Google had said was possible.\n\nOn Oct. 11, Google sought a stay on Donato’s remedies. The one recommendation it didn’t object to was for the company to stop using payments, revenue sharing or access to its services to secure prominent placement for Google Play on mobile devices.\n\nThe Google Play business generated $14.66 billion in sales in 2020. Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Mandeep Singh has estimated that in a worst-case scenario, Google Play could face a $1.15 billion drag on Alphabet’s gross profit.\n\nThe case is In Re Google Play Store Antitrust Litigation, 21-md-02981, US District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).\n\nStory continues\n\n(Updates with statement from Epic Games.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAI Detectors Falsely Accuse Students of Cheating—With Big Consequences BYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs A Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work Neuralink Co-Founder’s New Startup Sells a Brain Computer Toolkit How Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge on Friday delayed an order requiring Google to open up its Android app store to more competition until an appeals court decides whether to block the shake-up because of legal questions surrounding a jury's verdict that branded Google as an illegal monopolist.\n\nThe delay granted during a court hearing in San Francisco comes less than two weeks after U.S. District Judge James Donato issued a decision that would have forced Google to make sweeping changes to its Play Store for Android smartphones starting Nov. 1.\n\nThe mandated changes included a provision that would have required Google to make its library of more than 2 million Android apps available to any rivals that wanted access to the inventory and also distribute the alternative options in its own Play Store.\n\nGoogle requested Donato's order be stayed until the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals could examine the handling of a month-long trial that led to the December 2023 verdict, which framed the Play Store as an illegal monopoly that stifles innovation and drives up consumer prices.\n\nIn Friday's hearing, Donato scoffed at the notion that Google could succeed in overturning the trial verdict. “The verdict in this case was amply supported by a mountain of evidence about Google’s anti-competitive conduct,” the judge said.\n\nBut he decided the Ninth Circuit should be given a chance to consider a postponement until a panel of judges can decide can consider Google's appeal of the 2023 trial focused on antitrust claims lodged by video game maker Epic Games.\n\nDonato said he wouldn't be surprised if the Ninth Circuit imposes an even longer delay on his ruling, “but that is for someone else to decide.”\n\nIn a statement, Google said it was pleased Donato hit the pause button while it tries to extend the delay even further. “These remedies threaten Google Play’s ability to provide a safe and secure experience and we look forward to continuing to make our case to protect 100 million U.S. Android users, over 500,000 U.S. developers and thousands of partners who have benefited from our platforms,” Google said.\n\nEpic didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt's unclear how long the Ninth Circuit will take to decide on Google's request for a permanent stay of Donato's ruling while its appeals unfolds — a process that could take more than a year.\n\nIn 2021, the Ninth Circuit delayed a provision of another federal judge's order mandating that Apple allow links to alternative payment systems with apps made for the iPhone as part of another antitrust case brought by Epic.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Apple avoided being labeled an illegal monopolist in a trial involving the iPhone app store, it unsuccessfully fought the provision requiring the company to allow alternative payment links within apps. But delaying that requirement preserved Apple's exclusive control of a payment system that has generated commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on some e-commerce occurring within apps. Apple exhausted its avenue of appeals in the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year.\n\nGoogle also pockets billions of dollars annually from a similar commission system within its Play Store for Android phones — a setup that is allowed to continue as long as Google can prevent Donato's ruling from taking effect.\n\nIn its arguments for delaying Donato's order, Google said it wasn't being given enough time to make the drastic changes it framed as “a Herculean task creating an unacceptable risk of safety and security failures within the Android ecosystem.”\n\nGoogle also argued the shake-up would saddle it with unreasonable costs, a contention Donato also brushed aside during Friday's hearing.\n\n“I don’t want to be glib about it, but the expense that Google might incur appears to be a drop in the bucket compared to the profits it reaps annually from the Play Store,\" Donato said.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google granted request to pause order on Play store overhaul",
        "content": "By Mike Scarcella\n\n(Reuters) - Google said on Friday that a federal judge in California granted its request to pause his order directing the Alphabet unit to overhaul its Android app store Play by Nov. 1 to give consumers more choice over how they download software.\n\nSan Francisco-based U.S. District Judge James Donato made the decision on Friday as part of an antitrust lawsuit against Google brought by \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games. Google argued that Donato's Oct. 7 injunction would harm the company and introduce \"serious safety, security and privacy risks into the Android ecosystem.\"\n\nDonato delayed the injunction to allow the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to consider Google's separate request to pause the judge's order, Google said.\n\n\"We’re pleased with the District Court’s decision to temporarily pause the implementation of dangerous remedies demanded by Epic, as the Court of Appeal considers our request to further pause the remedies while we appeal,\" Google said in a statement.\n\nEpic did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the Epic Games lawsuit, a jury last year found that Google illegally monopolized how consumers download apps on Android devices and how they pay for in-app transactions. The judge, in his order, embraced many of the steps recommended by Epic in light of the jury's decision.\n\nThe order required Google to allow users to download competing third-party Android app platforms or stores in Play and to allow the use of competing in-app payment methods. It also barred Google from making payments to device makers to preinstall its app store and from sharing revenue generated from the Play store with other app distributors.\n\nGoogle has already appealed the jury's antitrust findings to the 9th Circuit.\n\nGoogle has not yet presented its antitrust arguments to the appeals court. It previously has said that it cannot be considered a monopolist because Play and Apple's App Store are direct competitors, and that Donato's injunction would unlawfully force Google to do business with rivals.\n\n(Reporting by Mike Scarcella in Washington; Editing by David Bario, Will Dunham and Chizu Nomiyama)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "One of the largest solar projects in the US opens in Texas, backed by Google",
        "content": "One of the largest solar projects in the U.S. opened in Texas on Friday, backed by what Google said is the largest solar electricity purchase it has ever made.\n\nGoogle executive Ben Sloss said at the ribbon cutting, about two hours south of Dallas, that the corporation has a responsibility to bring renewable, carbon-free electricity online at the same time it opens operations that will use that power. Google expects to spend $16 billion through 2040 globally to purchase clean energy, he said.\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who attended, said the solar project is a posterchild for the administration's efforts to incentivize manufacturers and developers to locate energy projects in the U.S.\n\n“Sometimes when you are in the middle of history, it’s hard to tell, because you are in the middle of it,” she said. “But I'm telling you right now that we are in the middle of history being made.”\n\nSB Energy built three solar farms side by side, the “Orion Solar Belt,\" in Buckholts, Texas. Combined, they will be able to provide 875 megawatts of clean energy. That is nearly the size of a typical nuclear facility. In total, Google has contracted with clean energy developers to bring more than 2,800 megawatts of new wind and solar projects to the state, which it says exceeds the amount of power required for its operations there.\n\nGoogle, Amazon and Microsoft have all recently announced investments in nuclear energy to power data centers, too, as the tech giants seek new sources of carbon-free electricity to meet surging demand from data centers and artificial intelligence. Google has a commitment to get all of its electricity without contributing to climate change, regardless of time of day or whether the sun is up, but neither it nor other large companies are meeting those commitments with the rise of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe International Energy Agency forecasts that data centers’ total electricity consumption could reach more than 1,000 terawatt-hours in 2026, more than doubling from 2022. Estimates suggest one terawatt-hour can power 70,000 homes for a year.\n\nThe demand for power is also growing globally as buildings and vehicles electrify. People used more electricity than ever last year, placing strain on electric grids around the world.\n\nIn August, Google said it planned to invest more than $1 billion in Texas this year to support its cloud and data center infrastructure.\n\nGoogle will use about 85% of the project’s solar power for data centers in Ellis County and for cloud computing in the Dallas region. In Ellis County, Google operates a data center campus in Midlothian and is building out a new campus in Red Oak. The rest of the solar power will go to the state’s electrical grid. Thousands of sheep graze in the area, maintaining the vegetation around the solar arrays.\n\nStory continues\n\n“This project was a spreadsheet and a set of emails that I had been exchanging and a bunch of approvals and so on. And then you come over the rise over there and you see it laid out in front of you and it kind of takes your breath away, right? Because there’s this enormous field of solar arrays,” Sloss said during the ceremony. “And we actually collectively have done this. That is amazing.”\n\nSB Energy said most of the solar farm components are made in the United States, and that's only possible because the climate law formally known as the Inflation Reduction Act spurred clean energy manufacturing. The company expects the projects to be the first to qualify for an extra tax credit the law affords for using domestic content.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

        "title": "Exclusive: Waymo engineering exec discusses self-driving AI models that will power the cars into new cities",
        "content": "When I posted on Instagram in May about my first ride in a self-driving, AI-powered Waymo car in San Francisco—a video of an empty driver’s seat with the steering wheel making a smooth left turn on a busy street—the responses ranged from “Yikes” and “That is CRAZY” to “No no no.”\n\nI'll admit, I was a bit freaked out myself as the Waymo, a standout, white, all-electric Jaguar, outfitted with rotating sensors on the roof, ferried me up and down one of San Francisco’s steepest streets. But I was pleasantly surprised (and relieved) to watch the autonomous driver pause fully yet gently at each and every stop sign along the route. The Waymo was a defensive driver, but not too slow; it steered carefully, but ventured into traffic with conviction. I finally exhaled and relaxed.\n\nWaymo's polite chauffeur seems almost like magic. The ride left me wondering: How exactly did my Waymo manage to do this without crashing? Recently, Waymo gave me a chance to find out as it prepares to expand to Atlanta and Austin, adding to its fleets in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Phoenix.\n\nWaymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet that began as the Google Self-Driving Project in 2009, only started offering rides to the public without human safety drivers within the past few years. In August it announced that it's serving over 100,000 paid rides per week in the handful of U.S. cities it operates in. But as Waymo expands to new cities, it needs to convince tens of thousands of new riders to get over the unsettling feeling of riding in a driverless taxi.\n\nWhile Waymo has been somewhat circumspect about exactly how its self-driving tech works in the past, the company now believes that offering a closer look under the proverbial hood is important for autonomous cars to gain wider acceptance. Srikanth Thirumalai, Waymo’s head of engineering for onboard technology, told Fortune that prioritizing safety in its messaging—rather than focusing on AI—has been crucial for building trust with potential riders. (Naturally, all self-driving vehicle companies must also navigate regulatory scrutiny.)\n\n“We don’t want to take the focus off of what we're actually trying to do here,” Thirumalai told Fortune in his first interview since joining Waymo a year ago after 18 years at Amazon. “We have to lead with ‘hey, we are developing this technology responsibly.'\"\n\nBut helping more people understand how its AI-powered system works, he explained, is the next stage in the company's 15-year effort to build “the world’s most trusted driver.\"\n\n\"Sharing more information about our tech and its safety is essential for building trust with riders and communities in which we operate,\" he said.\n\nStory continues Inside a Waymo autonomous vehicle in San Francisco, on November 17, 2023. (Photo by Jason Henry / AFP) (Photo by JASON HENRY/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBeyond the hype of Generative AI\n\nWhile Waymo has pulled ahead of the self-driving competition for the time being, autonomous cars are still very much a work-in-progress. Rivals from GM, Amazon, and Tesla to software developers like Wayve, are pouring billions of dollars into developing their own systems. And regulators are keeping a close eye on the robo-cars currently roaming the roads in designated areas.\n\nIn February GM's Cruise had its permit yanked by the California DMV last year after an accident in which one of its San Francisco robotaxis struck a pedestrian who had been thrown into its path by another car, dragging the injured woman for 20 feet. The company grounded its fleet across the U.S., and has only recently began testing again in some cities with safety drivers behind the wheel.\n\nWaymo has so far avoided serious incidents, but it has made its share of headlines: In May, an unoccupied Waymo taxi hit a telephone pole in Phoenix, Arizona, leading Waymo to issue a voluntary recall and update the software of its entire fleet of 672 autonomous vehicles. In August, there were reports of Waymos honking at each other in a San Francisco parking lot, disturbing neighbors (Waymo said it was an \"unintended consequence\" of a safety feature meant to avoid low-speed collisions when a car is backing up.) And last week, a Waymo collided with a San Francisco bus right outside of a Y Combinator event, and a video went viral of several tech CEOs attempting to move it (A Waymo representative said that “the bus’s rear door made contact with the side of our vehicle and was unable to close. We dispatched our roadside assistance team to retrieve the vehicle, and before they arrived, bystanders rocked our vehicle free of the door, so the bus could proceed.”)\n\nThirumalai, who focused on AI-powered search and shopping at Amazon before joining Waymo, emphasized his excitement about the challenge of working to power products that function safely and reliably in real-world situations. In fact, it is one of the reasons he joined Waymo. At the same time, he added, it is a humbling way to get beyond the current hype around generative AI.\n\nSelf-driving cars, he explained, present an extreme “long-tail” learning problem–where events that are rare and unexpected are also, collectively, numerous and a top priority to address. These vehicles require AI that “generalizes really well,” he added, so it can handle both relatively common and predictable situations, like stopping at a red light or yielding to pedestrians, but also surprising or unusual scenarios such as a person in a wheelchair crossing the road at night, or a tree toppling down into the road, or even a herd of circus animals escaped from the back of truck (OK, I made that last one up, but that's the point — the AI needs to be ready for anything).\n\nWaymo's dual AI models — on-board and in the cloud\n\nTo tackle both predictable and “long-tail” driving situations, Waymo’s current technology stack in its cars — as well as a next-generation version still being tested and not yet available to riders — begins with dozens of on-board sensors that allow the car to visualize its environment and provide comprehensive data to help its AI system make real-time decisions.\n\nThese sensors include radar, high-definition and other video cameras, and external audio receivers, as well as roof-mounted LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors that generate real-time, 360-degree, 3D views and provide depth perception. The array of sensors give the Waymo Driver system overlapping fields of view so that it can simultaneously observe objects, obstacles, or terrain features up to 300 meters away, from different perspectives (the next generation system will have a range of 500 meters on a clear day, Waymo says).\n\nThe sensors gather data from various scenarios, collected during every trip a Waymo takes. The company also uses synthetic data to train Waymo with simulations of a broader diversity of situations—such as weather conditions—than it might encounter on the roads of Phoenix or San Francisco. SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: The backseat passenger screen is viewed in a Waymo autonomous self-driving Jaguar taxi on March 14, 2024 in Santa Monica, California. Beginning today, Waymo One is offering robotaxi services in a 63-square mile area of greater Los Angeles including Santa Monica, Venice and downtown with over 50,000 people on the wait list. Waymo is owned by Alphabet, Google’s parent company. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nWaymo has developed a large-scale AI model called the Waymo Foundation Model that supports the vehicle's ability to perceive its surroundings, predicts the behavior of others on the road, simulates scenarios and makes driving decisions. This massive model functions similarly to large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, which are trained on vast datasets to learn patterns and make predictions. Just as companies like OpenAI and Google have built newer multimodal models to combine different types of data (such as text as well as images, audio or video), Waymo’s AI integrates sensor data from multiple sources to understand its environment.\n\nThe Waymo Foundation Model is a single, massive-sized model, but when a rider gets into a Waymo, the car works off a smaller, onboard model that is \"distilled\" from the much larger one — because it needs to be compact enough in order to run on the car's power. The big model is used as a \"Teacher\" model to impart its knowledge and power to smaller ‘Student’ models — a process widely used in the field of generative AI. The small models are optimized for speed and efficiency and run in real time on each vehicle—while still retaining the critical decision-making abilities needed to drive the car.\n\nAs a result, perception and behavior tasks, including perceiving objects, predicting the actions of other road users and planning the car's next steps, happen on-board the car in real time. The much larger model can also simulate realistic driving environments to test and validate its decisions virtually before deploying to the Waymo vehicles. The on-board model also means that Waymos are not reliant on a constant wireless internet connection to operate — if the connection temporarily drops, the Waymo doesn't freeze in its tracks.\n\nUltimately, Thirumalai explained, Waymo’s AI system is able to choose the trajectory it believes is the best given the situation. (Waymo would not share specific specs about the models, such as the number of parameters or other details, citing confidentiality.)\n\n\"I've seen the future and would be stupid not to be a part of it\"\n\nWaymo’s AI system is not the only approach companies are using to tackle self-driving. For example, Wayve, a UK-based startup backed by Microsoft and Meta’s chief scientist Yann LeCun, does not use LiDAR (though it uses high-definition cameras), instead relying on the kinds of cameras and ultrasound sensors that already come as standard in many vehicles, and is heavily-focused on developing a single generative AI “world model\" that interprets visual data and makes driving decisions as one integrated system. Tesla’s autopilot system, which is not yet capable of unsupervised self driving, eschews Lidar and relies on sensors and a suite of eight cameras that provide a 360-degree view around the vehicle. As the automaker pushes towards unsupervised self driving, it has begun testing a new AI system based on neural networks.\n\nWayve, however, does not have hundreds of self-driving robotaxis on the road, like Waymo does – instead, it is developing its software products to deploy in vehicles built by major automotive manufacturers. And Tesla's robotaxi reportedly won't be on the road for at least another couple of years. Waymo's approach, on the other hand, “works backwards from the problem we're trying to solve, which is, how do you actually get these cars in the real world?” SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 01: Waymo cars drive down a street on March 01, 2023 in San Francisco, California. Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car division, announced that it has laid off over 135 employees in a second round of layoffs this year. Waymo has cut 8 percent of its workforce this year. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nFor Thirumalai, the opportunity to help Waymo use AI to reach its safety goals was too good to pass up. \"I was happy at Amazon and wasn't really looking for a change,\" he said. \"Waymo came along and I was just floored by the team, their mission, what they've accomplished so far—it was clear to me that with this tailwind of AI, they were really going to to grow and be a huge force of change for the world.\"\n\nWhile I may have had anxious moments going up that steep San Francisco street, Thirumalai had no such concerns. His own first-ever Waymo ride, taken during his interview with Dimitri Dolgov, Waymo’s co-CEO, “blew my mind,\" he said.\n\nThe Waymo, he said, navigated morning traffic downtown San Francisco and made it up Telegraph Hill all the way to Coit Tower overlooking the city and the bay. To be clear, there is no army of human wizards behind the Waymo curtain helping the car go: \"That would be extremely difficult for us to scale, with the millions, millions of miles we drive every, every month,\" he said, though he emphasized human remote operators are available to step in if a Waymo car gets stuck and needs additional context.\n\nAs Thirumalai's Waymo safely navigated narrow streets and anticipated pedestrians and even dealt with double-parked cars, he realized he was experiencing a very special ride. \"I’m like, these people have got us to a point where this is driving just as well, if not better, than a human–and they’re doing all this just as AI is taking off,” he said.\n\nWhen Thirumalai returned from his Waymo ride, he told his wife about his experience. \"I said, my God, I’ve seen the future,\" he recalled. \"And I would be stupid not to be a part of it.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Jefferies analysts upgraded their price target for AppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) from $108 to $175 in a note Friday, citing optimistic trends in mobile gaming ad spending revealed in their latest survey.\n\nThe survey, representing over $1.2 billion in app install spending, reportedly suggests that major players like APP, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are expected to gain market share in 2025, while Unity (U) may lose ground.\n\nIn their note, Jefferies analysts said the initial outlook for 2025 app install spending indicates a significant acceleration to 6.7% growth.\n\nWhile the survey forecasts a modest 2.7% growth for 2024, 2025 is projected to benefit from increased spending on new game launches and successful existing titles.\n\n\"We see this initial view into 2025 as optimistic for the ad networks,\" stated Jefferies. The analysts also highlighted that ad spending is expected to grow by 3.2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nMoreover, Jefferies reported that APP was the largest share gainer in 2024 and is anticipated to continue this momentum into 2025.\n\n\"APP's user quality and ability to scale spend\" were underscored as key advantages.\n\nThe analysts pointed out that the rising cost per install (CPI) on platforms like YouTube and Meta, particularly due to holiday and political spending, could lead to a shift in shares toward mobile-game-specific networks.\n\nDespite pressures on effective cost per thousand impressions (eCPMs), Jefferies forecasts that the overall mobile game ad revenue will experience growth in 2025.\n\n\"Our survey suggests that APP should be able to sustain 20-30% Software Platform revenue growth for at least the next two years,\" the note added.\n\nWith this outlook, Jefferies sees a potential bull case price target of $246 for APP, driven by incremental ad budgets from e-commerce.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJefferies lifts AppLovin stock target after positive AdTech survey\n\nMorocco stocks lower at close of trade; Moroccan All Shares down 0.32%\n\nActivist Jana owns Lamb Weston stake, pushing for possible sale\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s reveal of its much-hyped self-driving car last week left investors underwhelmed and sent shares plunging. The disappointment also left the Street questioning the shares’ premium valuation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Inside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says\n\nThe so-called robotaxi is a dazzling promise that has been crucial to keeping Tesla’s stock at lofty heights. It’s also a key part of Elon Musk’s vision for the artificial-intelligence driven future of his company. But with numerous questions remaining about technical details of the vehicles and when they will be available, the shares — trading at 75 times forward earnings — are looking expensive to some.\n\n“This is still a carrot on a string,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “How many new investors will be willing to buy this expensive stock when the core auto business is slow and the company did not show how it will bring the rapid growth in the future?”\n\nTesla investors have a lot riding on the success of autonomous vehicles. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimates that Tesla’s core electric-vehicle business is likely worth less than $200 billion, suggesting its market capitalization reflects a value of about $600 billion for other endeavors, such as the robotaxi and the Optimus humanoid robot.\n\nThe shares were down 7.5% since the splashy October 10 event through Thursday’s close, but that’s barely dented the premium. The stock was trading nearly unchanged at 10:00 a.m. in New York on Friday. Tesla is by far the most expensive stock in the Magnificent 7, and dwarfs the mid-single-digit multiples of traditional carmakers like General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. It’s also much pricier than the Nasdaq 100’s multiple of 26 times forward earnings.\n\n“What worries me the most about Tesla’s valuation is how do you grow into a 75-times price-to-earnings multiple,” said Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “The only way you can is if you have a world-changing technology, which they once did, but the current valuation requires a similarly major leap forward.”\n\nLast week’s glitzy event failed to inspire confidence that such a major leap is coming anytime soon. In the meantime, slowing demand for electric vehicles around the world and rising competition are hitting its sales and profits.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Tesla’s robotaxi event was long on vision, and short on immediate deliverables or incremental revenue drivers,” Bernstein’s Sacconaghi wrote in a note. The company showed prototypes of a two-door sedan called the Cybercab, a concept van and an updated version of Optimus, but lacked key details that investors had wanted to see. Those included how Tesla will move from selling advanced driver-assistance features to fully autonomous vehicles, its path to regulatory approval, and evidence that it is comfortably ahead of rivals like Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo.\n\nThere were other kinks, too. The robotaxi will “probably” go into production only in 2026. Bloomberg reported earlier this week humans remotely controlled some capabilities of the robots at the event. And on Friday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it will assess whether Tesla’s partial-automation system marketed as Full Self-Driving is defective.\n\nSacconaghi noted that Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors when it comes to self-driving technology, and expressed concern that even if it becomes the first to achieve full self-driving, rivals will likely follow soon.\n\n“We do not believe the event provided sufficient detail to assuage our concerns, and believe the same is likely true for many investors,” he wrote.\n\nTo be sure, there are some that are still willing to give Tesla the benefit of the doubt.\n\n“First and foremost, Tesla is a Musk company,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research. “As long as Musk is alive and generating ideas and having success in other businesses, people will say if this guy can have a rocket return to a pinpoint, of course he can solve self-driving.”\n\nStill, after a 70% rally ahead of the robotaxi event, things are looking challenging for Tesla shares.\n\nThe next catalyst to watch is third-quarter results, due next week, when analysts expect the company to report a 10% decline in profits from year-ago levels.\n\n“In the near-term, what would worry us will be any substantial weakness in car sales, which is still the bread and butter for Tesla,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nNvidia Corp. shares are roaring back after the chipmaker’s chief executive officer Jensen Huang successfully calmed investor concerns about product delays and its long-term growth prospects. The company’s market capitalization of around $3.36 trillion is inching closer to Apple Inc.’s roughly $3.53 trillion as the battle for the world’s most valuable company heats up again.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nNetflix Inc. added more than 5 million customers in the third quarter and eclipsed Wall Street’s expectations on every major financial metric despite a new programming slate constrained by last year’s strikes in Hollywood. Sales of Apple Inc.’s newest iPhones in China are up 20% in their first three weeks compared with 2023’s model, a positive sign for a device that struggled this year to gain traction in the world’s largest smartphone market. Alphabet Inc.’s Google is moving the team behind its Gemini AI assistant app to its DeepMind research lab, continuing a plan to consolidate the company’s various groups working on artificial intelligence. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. shares hit a record high after the chipmaker topped quarterly estimates and raised its target for 2024 revenue growth, allaying concerns about global chip demand and the sustainability of an AI hardware boom.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Adds current stock move in fifth paragraph, probe news in ninth.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nBYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs Neuralink Co-Founder’s New Startup Sells a Brain Computer Toolkit A Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work How Spindrift Broke Through the Cluttered Seltzer Craze How Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Good Stocks To Buy Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other good stocks to buy right now.\n\nStocks to Perform Well in 2025\n\nOn October 14, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss the latest market trends and share his expectations.\n\nIn a previous interview, Lee hinted that a period of market volatility is expected, as 2024 heads for a soft landing. However, in this interview, Lee revealed that he had underestimated the market and that it had been extremely resilient and confident, contrary to what he believed earlier. He adds that this indicates the decreasing importance of macroeconomic data to investors.\n\nLee also adds that for the past two years, investors have been expecting a recession and have held back. Henceforth, with all this cash on the sidelines, investors have been more than willing to invest. October so far has been a great month for the market, despite CPI data being higher than expectations.\n\nLee emphasizes the need for the Fed to be more supportive as concerns over the job market rise and the upcoming election draws closer. He suggests that despite the election results he expects stocks to perform well in 2025.\n\nThe Fed Should Go Slower, Strategist Says\n\nThe market rose to an all-time intraday earlier today and the Fed governor stressed the need for caution amid decreasing interest rates. On October 15, Warren Pies, from 3Fourteen, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss his market thesis for the rest of the year.\n\nPies suggests that rates are the biggest risk to the market at the moment, especially if drastic measures are introduced. He further adds that if the Fed decides to bring the rate down to 3% immediately, the long-term market outlook could be extremely volatile.\n\nHe explained that the concern is more about the rate of change and not the absolute level the Fed is trying to achieve. Pies adds that the market still has a lot of room to run before another drastic cut is implemented. He emphasized that the Fed must operate at a pace the market can digest. He also suggested that the market has started to reaccelerate, hinting that a soft landing is more likely.\n\nNow that we have studied the market outlook up until the end of 2024, let's take a look at some of the good stocks to buy right now.\n\nOur methodology\n\nWe used a consensus-based approach and sifted through financial media reports to first compile a list of good stocks to buy right now. We then shortlisted and ranked these stocks by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world. It owns a range of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Wyamo.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported solid earnings in the second quarter of 2024. Its CEO, Sundar Pichai suggests that its performance was largely driven by its growing momentum in search and clod. The company logged nearly $85 billion in revenue, of which search and cloud exceeded $10 billion for the first time in quarterly revenue. The company highlights that it is investing to innovate every layer of the AI stack.\n\nOn the technology hardware front, its processing units currently account for almost 20% of the market, however, its advancements promise higher market shares in the future. In addition to that, its six-generation chips are 67% more energy efficient compared to the previous generation of processors and its new set of chips will be made available to Google Cloud users by the end of 2024.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) logged revenue worth $85 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, driven by the growing momentum in cloud and search. The technology giant is well-positioned to benefit from the next wave of artificial intelligence and innovation, making it a solid investment. Overall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as of Q2 2024, according to the Insider Monkey database.\n\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter“\n\n\"Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\"\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 2nd among the 10 good stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Tesla’s self-driving cars investigated over safety in fog and bright sunlight",
        "content": "Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, claims his self-driving cars will be safer than a human driver - Leon Neal/Reuters\n\nUS authorities are investigating millions of Tesla vehicles after reports that the company’s cars crashed in the fog or bright sunlight while they were in self-driving mode.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was examining whether the software used by 2.4m Tesla cars failed to respond properly in conditions where there was poor visibility.\n\nThe watchdog said it had identified four crashes where Tesla cars were driving using full self-driving (FSD) technology on roads with fog, sun-glare or dust.\n\nIn one incident, the Tesla killed a pedestrian and in another, a person was injured. The investigation applies to Tesla Model S cars built after 2016 as well as its Model 3, Model Y and Cybertruck. Tesla’s Cybertruck is among its models under investigation by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration - Agustin Marcarian/Reuters\n\nTesla’s electric cars are designed to allow self-driving on most US roads, with built-in cameras and autonomous driving software. The driver is supposed to be ready to take back control of the vehicle at all times. The technology is not available on UK roads.\n\nUnlike rival self-driving carmakers, Tesla’s vehicles do not rely on expensive laser systems – known as Lidar – or radar signals to map the world around them. Instead, it uses cameras to build up a picture of its surroundings.\n\nExperts have questioned whether Tesla’s approach of using cameras and AI software alone can be as accurate.\n\nThe regulator said it would be investigating “the ability of FSD’s engineering controls to detect and respond appropriately to reduced roadway visibility conditions”.\n\nTesla’s owner manuals warn that its self-driving software can suffer in areas of low visibility. The documents warn: “Low visibility, such as low light or poor weather conditions (rain, snow, direct sun, fog, etc) can significantly degrade performance.”\n\nIn April, the US highways regulator warned that a “critical safety gap” in Tesla’s Autopilot, its driver-assistance system, contributed to 467 crashes. The watchdog said the cars failed to do enough to ensure the drivers paid attention to the road ahead. It added there was a “mismatch” between drivers’ expectations of the systems capabilities and how the autonomous driving technology worked in practice.\n\nTesla was forced into a software update on millions of its vehicles. However, the regulator questioned whether the changes were enough.\n\nThe investigation comes as Elon Musk, the chief executive, bets that Tesla’s autonomous vehicle software can fuel its future growth amid a global slowdown in demand for electric vehicles.\n\nLast week, Tesla showed off a new robotaxi design: a self-driving vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals that Mr Musk hopes will go into mass production from 2026. Along with the two-door vehicle, Tesla also revealed a larger robovan, intended to carry up to 20 passengers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMr Musk has previously said that the “value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy”.\n\nRival companies including Waymo, which is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, have already deployed robo-taxi fleets on US roads. These vehicles rely on lasers and radar, as well as on-board cameras, while driving, although even these vehicles have faced questions over their sometimes erratic performance and have been accused of causing traffic jams.\n\nMr Musk has claimed that Tesla’s technology will make the cars safer than a human driver.\n\nTesla was contacted for comment.",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this company have returned +0.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share, indicating a change of +18.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.64 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.7%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $72.79 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $292.23 billion and $325.87 billion estimates indicate +13.9% and +11.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet.

        "title": "Amazon and Alphabet: Pivotal Chooses the Best ‘Magnificent 7’ Stocks to Buy",
        "content": "The NASDAQ index has risen 24% year-to-date and is hovering near record highs following a summer lull. Once again, the rally has been powered largely by the ‘Magnificent 7’ – a select group of mega-cap tech stocks that have soared to stratospheric valuations in recent years.\n\nThis group includes the six largest stocks trading on Wall Street – Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta – as well as Elon Musk’s Tesla. Together, these companies have been leaders in innovation, especially of the AI tech that is so rapidly changing the tech world.\n\nPivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak has been closely examining the ‘Magnificent 7’ and is now offering fresh recommendations on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Let’s take a closer look at what makes these two stand out and why they are receiving Wlodarczak’s endorsement.\n\nAmazon\n\nWe’ll start with Amazon, the global leader in online retail. This company is a proven survivor, an original ‘dot.com’ that survived the tech bubble of the late 90s–early 2000s and has grown to become one of the world’s largest publicly traded firms. While the company started out as an online bookseller, today e-shoppers can find virtually anything on Amazon – and the company will guarantee delivery almost anywhere in the world.\n\nAmazon backs up its huge inventory, covering everything from books and toys to pharmaceuticals, clothing, and phone cases, with a network of high-tech warehouses and logistics facilities. The company’s warehouses use AI and robotic tech, backed up by a human workforce, to pack and ship anything to anywhere.\n\nThis combination of huge inventory and fast delivery has made Amazon the world leader in e-commerce – and allowed the company to build up an enormous market cap of nearly $2 trillion, making Amazon the world’s fifth-largest public company. Amazon has used its deep pockets to expand its customer base by expanding its product and service offerings.\n\nOn the product side, Amazon has recently been pushing its ‘digital pharmacy’ business, allowing customers to fill prescriptions online, with fully accredited pharmacists. Earlier this month, the company announced that it will be opening 20 new pharmacies, doubling the number of cities with same-day delivery service available.\n\nOn the service side, the company’s cloud computing platform, AWS, has become increasingly popular. AWS, which is a direct competitor to Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure, has become an important revenue driver for Amazon – and accounted for $26.3 billion of the company’s $148 billion topline in Q2 of this year (the last quarter reported). That makes AWS responsible for almost 18% of the total revenue in a quarter that saw 10% year-over-year revenue growth. Amazon has been consistently reporting year-over-year quarterly revenue growth in the low double digits recently and is expected to do so again in the upcoming Q3 report. The top line for the third quarter is expected to exceed $157 billion, which would translate to another 10% year-over-year gain.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor analyst Wlodarczak, Amazon presents a solid tale of strength and growth. He writes of the company, “Amazon has a deep moat around their core businesses driven by their unmatched scale and has what appears to be the largest organic revenue growth opportunity of any mega cap tech company (other than arguably NVDA (N/R)) driven primarily by their AWS cloud segment (which we expect to grow from 17% of revenue to ~35% in 5 years), extension of their e-commerce/fulfillment arms into new segments/internationally, continued rapid growth in their advertising business and proven ability to develop new successful products/revenue streams.”\n\nLooking ahead, Wlodarczak goes on to explain why investors should continue to buy in on AMZN: “This is all enhanced by what we believe is the highest potential of their peers to materially boost operating margins driven by scale, leveraging robotics/AI and benefits from an increasing % of revenue from high margin cloud computing/advertising combined with what appears to be an attractive valuation.”\n\nAs expected, after comments like these, Wlodarczak rates Amazon stock as a Buy. His price target, set at $260, points toward a one-year upside potential of 39%. (To watch Wlodarczak’s track record, click here)\n\nThis major retailer/tech firm has picked up plenty of attention from Wall Street, and mostly all positive. The Strong Buy consensus is based on a lopsided Buy/Hold split of 45 to 2 among the analyst reviews, and the $224.38 average price target implies a 20% upside from the current trading price of $186.89. (See Amazon stock forecast)\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe second Mag 7 stock we’ll look at is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and the market’s fourth-largest public company, with a market cap of just over $2 trillion. Alphabet, which also owns YouTube and has been developing an ever-growing presence in the AI field, has built its success on its absolute dominance of the global internet search segment – and the advantages that brings in the field of digital advertising. Remember that Google and YouTube are the world’s leaders in online search and online video search, respectively.\n\nIn the last few years, the AI boom has begun to shift the tech landscape in ways that are still not fully clear. Alphabet has been moving to adopt the new technology, seeing it as a multiplier for online search, and as a powerful tool in online and cloud-based applications. The company is using AI tech in its multimodal large language models, which improve both Google’s online translation apps and its search engine functionality. These improvements in generating search results and translation matrixes are a direct response to increased competition from Microsoft’s Bing as well as ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms.\n\nOn the practical side, Alphabet has released its Gemini platform, its most up-to-date offering in AI. Gemini is based on a core of large language models, designed from the start to understand natural language content – in text, audio, images, video, and even in code. The platform uses AI to provide the maximum flexibility for the end user’s application, and Alphabet is working to integrate it into all of its products. That includes the Android operating system, which will make Gemini’s AI available on smartphones – and all of their apps. For Alphabet, the key challenge presented by AI will be maintaining market share in online search as the digital world switches its base to generative AI tools and apps.\n\nFor now, Alphabet is generating solid revenue and income numbers. The company brought in $84.7 billion in 2Q24, a total that was up nearly 14% from the prior-year quarter and was more than $445 million over the forecast. Alphabet’s bottom line of $1.89 per share was 5 cents over expectations. Analysts are expecting to see revenues of $86.23 billion when the company reports earnings for Q3 later this month.\n\nTurning again to Pivotal’s Wlodarczak, we find the analyst taking an upbeat view of Alphabet’s stock, its position and prospects. He says, “If the status quo holds, GOOG appears to be in a very strong competitive position with a deep moat around their dominant core search business model (~90% market share ex China) and an obvious path to leverage 90%+ (ex China) global device presence (which we believe will dominate consumer AI assistant use), a strong AI platform and financial might to increase financial incentives to handset manufacturers for default AI placement. GOOG also holds a strong #3 position in cloud computing, which we believe has dramatic growth potential…”\n\nLooking ahead, Wlodarczak adds, “This position is enhanced by the fact that GOOG appears to have the ability, leveraging their AI investment, to significantly reduce their cost structure (mainly through a material reduction in their ~180K employees) offset partially by the aforementioned potentially higher TAC to extend their search handset dominance to AI (if they are not prohibited in doing so by regulators/courts), which should help drive strong financial growth and help them generate a reasonable AI ROIC even if the development of AI revenue generating applications takes longer than expected.”\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the Pivotal analyst rates GOOGL shares as a Buy, while his price target, $215, suggests an upside of 30% on the one-year horizon.\n\nFor the Street generally, this is another stock with a Strong Buy consensus. The 39 recent reviews include 30 Buys to 9 Holds. Shares are priced at $165.16 and have an average target price of $201.57, implying a gain of 22% by this time next year.

        "title": "Billionaire Seth Klarman Sold 64% of Baupost's Stake in Alphabet and Is Piling Into This Historically Cheap and Under-the-Radar Drugmaker",
        "content": "Earnings season has officially kicked off for Wall Street. Over a roughly six-week stretch, a majority of S&P 500 companies will report their operating results from the latest quarter and offer insight on the health of the U.S. economy and consumer.\n\nBut earnings season is far from the only important data dump investors are privy to each quarter.\n\nOn Aug. 14, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management were required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This invaluable filing allows investors to see what Wall Street's smartest money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter.\n\nTo be transparent, 13Fs aren't perfect. They can be 45 days old, when filed, which means they're presenting stale information for active hedge funds. Nevertheless, 13Fs provide insight into which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends are piquing the interest of Wall Street's most-prominent asset managers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe June-ended quarter was a particularly active period for billionaire Seth Klarman, the CEO and portfolio manager of Baupost Group. The value-focused Klarman, who's modeled his investment philosophy after Benjamin Graham, is overseeing $3.6 billion of invested assets spread across close to two dozen holdings.\n\nPerhaps the most noteworthy move made by Klarman in the second quarter was to meaningfully pare down the cheapest of all \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). At the same time, Klarman willingly piled into an off-the-radar, but historically inexpensive, drug stock.\n\nKlarman's Baupost jettisoned a significant portion of its stake in Alphabet\n\nBaupost first initiated a position in Alphabet's Class C shares (GOOG) during the first quarter of 2020 (i.e., during the COVID-19 crash). As of March 31, Klarman's fund held north of 2.9 million shares. But over the course of three months, ended June 30, Baupost's investment leaders, including Klarman, sent 1,888,064 shares of Alphabet to the chopping block, representing a 64% reduction.\n\nWhile profit-taking is a viable reason for Seth Klarman and his team to reduce their fund's stake in Google, YouTube, and Waymo parent Alphabet by nearly two-thirds, I believe there may four other possible explanations.\n\nTo start with, Klarman and his crew might be concerned about the stock market being historically pricey. The S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly referred to as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE ratio), hit its highest level of the year earlier this week (37.70), and has more than doubled its average reading of 17.16, dating back to January 1871. Even though Alphabet's forward P/E ratio is a reasonably low 19, the company's shares would undoubtedly be weighed down if the broad-market indexes were to roll over.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's valuation might be another tipping point for Baupost's chief. Despite Alphabet's stock trading below its average forward P/E multiple over the last five years, it's pricier than its average book value over the last five years, and is no longer the screaming bargain it's been relative to its cash flow. Klarman tends to focus heavily on these traditional fundamental measures of value.\n\nA third possibility behind this aggressive selling activity in Alphabet's Class C stock is the potential for the U.S. to fall into a recession. The first notable decline in M2 money supply since the Great Depression, along with the longest yield-curve inversion in history, suggest the U.S. economy can stumble in the coming quarters. With Alphabet generating 76% of its net sales from advertising during the June-ended quarter, it would be susceptible to weakness if economic growth were to slow or shift into reverse.\n\nLastly, Baupost Group's smartest investment minds may have foreseen legal troubles to come for Alphabet. Specifically, the U.S. Justice Department may seek a breakup of Alphabet due to its utter dominance of internet search. Uncertainty tends to be the enemy of investors.\n\nFor what it's worth, I believe this is a decision Klarman will eventually regret. But with the stock market historically pricey and Klarman being an ardent value investor, this selling activity does makes sense. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nKlarman is scooping up shares of a jaw-droppingly cheap pharma stock\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Klarman and his team added to nine of Baupost Group's existing positions during the second quarter. Arguably none of these purchases stands out more than drug developer Jazz Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: JAZZ).\n\nDuring the June-ended quarter, Klarman oversaw the addition of 440,552 shares of Jazz, which increased his fund's stake in the company by 53% to 1,274,248 shares. As of the midpoint of 2024, Jazz Pharmaceuticals was Baupost's ninth-largest holding, worth $136 million.\n\nJazz's oxybate franchise, which is comprised of Xyrem and Xywav (two therapies focused on treating sleep disorders), are what make the company tick. Xyrem was Jazz's blockbuster narcolepsy treatment, while Xywav is its next-generation sleep-disorder therapy. Xywav contains 92% less sodium than Xyrem, which makes it an ideal sleep-disorder therapy for people with cardiovascular concerns. Based on revenue through the first-half of 2024, Jazz's oxybate franchise is pacing $1.6 billion in sales for the current year.\n\nJazz is also looking for its cannabidiol (CBD)-based therapy, Epidiolex (known as Epidyolex overseas), to eventually reach blockbuster status. Epidiolex was the crown jewel of the $7.2 billion GW Pharmaceuticals acquisition by Jazz in May 2021. It treats rare forms of epilepsy and has limited competition, which has paved a path to steady double-digit sales growth. Epidiolex looks to be on track to generate close to $900 million in full-year revenue in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Jazz's oncology segment topped $1 billion in annual sales for the first time in 2023. Much of this growth was fueled by injectable therapy Rylaze, which is a treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma. Improved cancer-screening diagnostics and substantive pricing power should lift oncology segment sales to at least $1.1 billion this year.\n\nDespite steady long-term growth from all three facets of the company's drug portfolio, there's concern that Avadel Pharmaceuticals may eat into Jazz's dominance of the sleep disorder space. Avadel commercially launched Lumryz in the U.S. five months ago, which is a therapy that directly competes with Jazz's oxybate franchise in select indications.\n\nHowever, a strong argument can be made that these competitive concerns are fully baked in. Shares of Jazz are valued at a little over 5 times Wall Street's consensus earnings per share (EPS) forecast for 2025. This represents a 32% discount to the company's average forward P/E over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nWhat's more, Jazz Pharmaceuticals has a robust pipeline that currently features more than 30 clinical trials. While there are a handful of label expansion opportunities for Epidiolex, the company's future revolves around its oncology pipeline, which is targeting small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia, among other indications. Just a few wins among these 30-plus trials can be huge for Jazz.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The next winner of the AI boom is also one of its biggest problems",
        "content": "Earlier this year, Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) released separate reports showing that neither company is on track to meet its climate goals by the end of the decade. They both blamed the same culprit: data centers.\n\nDespite the environmental toll, experts say data and other artificial intelligence infrastructure will be the winners of AI’s next phase as companies seek to power their growing AI offerings.\n\nWhile AI chips developed by companies such as Nvidia and AMD are crucial to the current phase of AI development, the broader data center industry is “very well positioned” to be at the center of the next phase of AI expansion, Tejas Dessai, director of research at Global X, told Quartz.\n\n“Where I think you have the highest probability of naming winners is in the picks and shovels category — who’s building the infrastructure that’s going to power all this,” Rowan Trollope, chief executive of data platform Redis, told Quartz. “No matter who, what app, or what model wins, we sit in the middle and we make them all better.”\n\nData is a ‘winning category’\n\nAs companies deploy more AI clusters, there could be “an uptake in memory solutions, in storage solutions, in networking solutions,” Dessai said, followed by companies specialized in comprehensive data center solutions.\n\n“Currently, the principle that many of these companies are operating with is: The more the number of chips that we can put together in terms of training these models, the smarter and smarter the outcome is that we can get out of these models,” Dessai said in a separate interview with Quartz.\n\nBut he says there are still “a lot of physical constraints” such as GPU clusters, which run on hundreds of thousands of chips. And data centers can take years to come online, meaning there is still some “running behind” when it comes to having enough capacity for AI workloads.\n\n“We’re still very early in that cycle and you see companies like OpenAI trying to get access to data center capacity from anywhere and everywhere that they can find it,” Dessai said.\n\nSarah Friar, chief technology officer at OpenAI, reportedly told the startup’s shareholders that its partner and investor, Microsoft, was too slow at supplying it with enough computing power. After the company completed its $6.6 billion funding round, the startup’s leaders told some employees that it would start leaning less on Microsoft for data centers and AI chips, according to The Information, which cited unnamed people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn the short to medium term, Dessai said he sees data centers remaining attractive to companies as construction increases and vacancy rates reach “an all-time low.”\n\n“Companies are really wanting to buy pretty much any capacity that they can find their hands on,” Dessai said.\n\n“Data is the big winning category,” Trollope said. “We don’t know who in the data category is going to win, but I think the incumbents have a really good shot.”\n\nThe demise of climate goals\n\nMicrosoft, which set a goal in 2020 to be “carbon negative” by the end of the decade, said in May that its carbon emissions are almost 31% higher than when it set the commitment. The increase was mostly due to building data centers, it said, as well as hardware like semiconductors and servers.\n\nMeanwhile, Google said in July that its carbon emissions have risen by 48% since 2019, and were up 13% year-over-year in 2023 — mostly because of data center energy consumption. The tech giant set a goal in 2021 to reach net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030.\n\nBy the end of the decade, data centers could consume up to 9% of electricity in the U.S. — more than double what is being used now, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.\n\nTech giants are eyeing nuclear power as a solution\n\nIn April, Ami Badani, chief marketing officer of British chip designer Arm, said data centers powering AI chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT account for 2% of global electricity consumption. One query on ChatGPT needs almost 10 times as much electricity as a Google search, according to a study by Goldman Sachs (GS). That level of energy demand, Badani said, could eventually slow down AI progress.\n\nTech giants are seemingly taking note of this obstacle. In July, the Wall Street Journal reported that a third of the U.S.’s nuclear power plants were discussing deals with tech companies to supply electricity for data centers.\n\n“We have to make up for this energy deficit in one way or another,” Dessai said. “We can’t burn more coal, we can’t use more fossil fuels. So naturally nuclear energy becomes the answer to it.”\n\nAs big tech seems to be moving toward nuclear energy, “we’ll continue to see more deals in that direction,” he said.\n\nEarlier this week, Google announced that it was signing “the world’s first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy” from Small Modular Reactors, or SMRs, developed by California-based Kairos Power.\n\nGoogle said it expects to bring Kairos Power’s first SMR online by the end of the decade, and others are planned through 2035. Through the deal, 500 megawatts (MW) of 24/7 carbon-free power will be available to U.S. electricity grids.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) also signed agreements this week “to support the development of nuclear energy projects,” including by building “several” SMRs which have “a smaller physical footprint, allowing them to be built closer to the grid,” the company said. Compared to traditional reactors, the smaller SMRs can come online faster due to lower construction time, according to Amazon.\n\nIn September, Constellation Energy (CEG), which owns most of the country’s power plants, announced a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft.

        "title": "Meet the Unstoppable Growth Stock That Could Join Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft in the $3 Trillion Club by 2028.",
        "content": "It was a mere 20 years ago that industrial and energy titans General Electric and ExxonMobil were the world's most valuable companies when measured by market cap, with values of $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively. Now, just two decades later, technology interests lead the field.\n\nHeading up the list are some of the world's most familiar technology names. Apple tops the charts at $3.5 trillion (as of this writing). Nvidia and Microsoft are trailing close behind, with market caps of $3.2 trillion and $3.1 trillion, respectively.\n\nWith a market cap of just $2 trillion, it might seem a bit early to suggest that Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has the makings for membership in the $3 trillion club. However, the stock has gained 88% since early last year and 172% over the past five years, and there's every reason to believe its ascent will continue.\n\nA combination of an improving economy, Alphabet's market strength, and gains in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) could provide the boost the company needs to join this exclusive society. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nImproving performance\n\nThe widespread challenges of the past few years have been glaringly obvious, marked by macroeconomic headwinds and the worst inflation rates since the early 1980s. These conditions weighed heavily on each of Alphabet's major business segments and the stock plunged as much as 44% in response.\n\nHowever, there's been a marked improvement in recent months. In September, the Federal Reserve Bank cut interest rates for the first time since March 2020, and consumer confidence jumped to its highest level in months.\n\nThe economic rebound has had a dramatic effect on Alphabet's results. In the second quarter, revenue of $84.7 billion climbed 14% year over year, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.89 jumped 31%.\n\nEach of the company's major operating segments did their part to boost the results. The rebound in advertising, which has suffered the most in recent years, had the most profound impact. Google advertising, which provides the bulk of Alphabet's revenue, climbed 11% year over year, while Google Cloud -- the company's fastest-growing segment -- jumped 29%.\n\nAn industry leader -- in more ways than one\n\nGoogle has long been the undisputed leader in search, recently capturing 90% of the search market, according to internet statistics aggregator StatCounter. The company has worked to consistently improve its search acumen and the underlying algorithms, becoming something of an AI subject matter expert along the way.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's also the undisputed leader in digital advertising, fueled primarily by Google Search and YouTube but also by its suite of products that count billions of users each. In 2023, Google captured an estimated 39% of worldwide digital advertising revenue, according to data compiled by Statista. For context, its closest competitor -- Meta Platforms -- garnered just 18%. This dominance is expected to continue.\n\nAlphabet is also a strong contender in the realm of cloud computing. Google Cloud is part of the \"Big Three\" as the third-largest provider of cloud infrastructure services. The company controlled roughly 10% of the market in the second quarter, according to data supplied by Canalys. It was also the fastest-growing, with year-over-year revenue growth of 30%.\n\nHelping fuel demand for Google Cloud is the company's generative AI offerings. Alphabet has been using AI for years to inform its search results, and the company has refocused that expertise to fuel a suite of AI-powered models led by Gemini, one of the leading foundational AI models in the world. This is attracting new users to Google Cloud.\n\nUncertainty weighs on the stock\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't address the elephant in the room. The antitrust case against Alphabet is one step closer to completion. The court found that Google had violated antitrust law, and the U.S. Justice Department is mulling recommendations regarding the appropriate remedies, though the judge will have the final say. One of the potential outcomes is a breakup of the company, which is something that hasn't happened in decades. There are other less severe proposals, like sharing Google's search code with rivals, blocking other providers from paying Google to be its default search engine and more.\n\nA final decision won't be reached for at least a year, and if Alphabet appeals (it says it will), the case could go on for several more. Wall Street hates uncertainty, so this has been an overhang for Alphabet stock in recent months.\n\nAll that aside, even if Alphabet were to be broken up -- and I don't believe it will -- that could unlock additional value, enriching shareholders along the way. So, the current concerns are merely noise, in my opinion.\n\nThe path to $3 trillion\n\nAlphabet currently boasts a market cap of roughly $2 trillion, which means it will take stock price gains of about 47% to drive its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Alphabet is expected to generate revenue of $347.4 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 6. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Alphabet would have to grow its revenue to roughly $510 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.\n\nWall Street is currently forecasting revenue growth for Alphabet of about 11% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as early as 2028. It's worth noting that Alphabet has grown its annual revenue by 368% over the past decade, so Wall Street could be lowballing its forecast.\n\nFurthermore, Alphabet is currently selling for roughly 24 times earnings, a significant discount compared to the multiple of 30 for the S&P 500. The aforementioned uncertainty is providing a very attractive entry point for savvy investors who plan to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Waymo Co-founder Says Tesla Has An Advantage In Race To Autonomous Driving: 'I'd Rather Be In Tesla's Shoes Than In Waymo's Shoes'\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Waymo’s co-founder Anthony Levandowski is more optimistic about Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) self-driving vision over Waymo’s given the EV giant’s wealth of data.\n\nWhat Happened: “There’s millions of Teslas out there that are constantly alerting, feeding back their data to Tesla to make the product better, and that’s ultimately what’s really going to be the differentiator here — that you have the richest, most consistent data to continuously improve over time,” Levandowski said in an interview with Business Insider.\n\n“I’d rather be in Tesla’s shoes than in Waymo’s shoes.”\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nThe global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\n\nTesla uses camera footage from its existing fleet of vehicles to train its software aimed at enabling autonomous driving. Tesla’s fleet is significantly large and operates across the country as compared to Waymo which is only operating vehicles in a select few cities within the U.S. such as Phoenix and San Francisco.\n\nTesla, therefore, likely has much more data than Waymo across scenarios of driving to train its tech, the Waymo co-founder opined.\n\nSee Also: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\n\nWhy It Matters: Tesla unveiled its dedicated robotaxi offerings last week at an event in Los Angeles. The company unveiled two products – a two-seater Cybercab and a 20-seater Robovan with no steering wheels or pedals. The Cybercab, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said, will enter production “before 2027.”\n\nWaymo, meanwhile, already operates robotaxis in select cities. The company deploys its sensor suite on vehicles manufactured by other automakers, such as Jaguar vehicles, for use as robotaxis, which by itself is a cost-extensive process.\n\n“You probably need to buy a car company to be able to produce the cars that you want,” Levandowski reportedly said regarding Waymo. He left Waymo in 2016 after co-founding it in 2009.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga’s Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.\n\nRead More:\n\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends Groundbreaking trading app with a ‘Buy-Now-Pay-Later' feature for stocks tackles the $644 billion margin lending market – here’s how to get equity in it with just $100\n\nStory continues\n\nPhotos courtesy: Tesla and Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google is moving the team behind its Gemini AI assistant app to its DeepMind research lab, continuing a plan to consolidate the company’s various groups working on artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nInside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says How Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes\n\nThe search giant is simplifying its structure to “keep increasing the pace of progress” of AI development, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said in a blog post on Thursday. He also announced that Prabhakar Raghavan, the most senior leader of Google’s search and ads units, is leaving the role after four years helming the company’s flagship businesses. Raghavan will step into a new role as Google’s chief technologist, Pichai said.\n\nNick Fox, a veteran Google executive who acted as a search deputy under Raghavan, will step into the role leading the company’s search, ads, maps and shopping services.\n\nLong the dominant search engine globally, Google has battled the perception for the last two years that it’s lagged behind the likes of Microsoft, OpenAI and other startups in rolling out new generative AI tools and services. Yet, as it works to stay competitive with new entrants upending search, it must also take care not to cannibalize its core profit machine. In his announcement, Pichai framed the reorganization as a way to streamline the company’s progress in artificial intelligence.\n\nOver the last six months, Google has been consolidating its AI-focused teams, seeking to improve the Gemini models to challenge the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic. In April, the firm moved its models, research and responsible AI teams to the DeepMind division. Soon after, it merged DeepMind with Google Brain, a rival research unit within the company.\n\nDeepMind was founded in London in 2010 as an academic-style research lab, then acquired by Google in 2014. Executives say the lab has recently shifted away from its original mission and become more product-driven.\n\nBoth inside and outside Google, “so many of the leading research labs are actually product companies at this point,” said Eli Collins, DeepMind’s vice president of product, in an interview with Bloomberg News last month. He said DeepMind has had to “pick up the pace” to keep up with the rate of AI innovation.\n\nGoogle has also been challenged by mounting antitrust scrutiny from federal officials. In August, Google lost a trial over claims by the US Justice Department that the company illegally monopolizes online search and advertising markets. In September, a trial covering the company’s alleged dominance over the technology used to buy and sell online ads concluded, with closing arguments scheduled for November. A decision in that case is expected by the end of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\n(Updates with additional context starting in the third paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nBYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs Neuralink Co-Founder’s New Startup Sells a Brain Computer Toolkit A Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work How Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium How Spindrift Broke Through the Cluttered Seltzer Craze\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tech firms remove social media accounts of a Russian drone factory after an AP investigation",
        "content": "Google, Meta and TikTok have removed social media accounts belonging to an industrial plant in Russia's Tatarstan region aimed at recruiting young foreign women to make drones for Moscow's war in Ukraine.\n\nPosts on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok were taken down following an investigation by The Associated Press published Oct. 10 that detailed working conditions in the drone factory in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, which is under U.S. and British sanctions.\n\nVideos and other posts on the social media platforms promised the young women, who are largely from Africa, a free plane ticket to Russia and a salary of more than $500 a month following their recruitment via the program called “Alabuga Start.”\n\nBut instead of a work-study program in areas like hospitality and catering, some of them said they learned only arriving in the Tatarstan region that they would be toiling in a factory to make weapons of war, assembling thousands of Iranian-designed attack drones to be launched into Ukraine.\n\nIn interviews with AP, some of the women who worked in the complex complained of long hours under constant surveillance, of broken promises about wages and areas of study, and of working with caustic chemicals that left their skin pockmarked and itching. AP did not identify them by name or nationality out of concern for their safety.\n\nThe tech companies also removed accounts for Alabuga Polytechnic, a vocational boarding school for Russians aged 16-18 and Central Asians aged 18-22 that bills its graduates as experts in drone production.\n\nThe accounts collectively had at least 158,344 followers while one page on TikTok had more than a million likes.\n\nIn a statement, YouTube said its parent company Google is committed to sanctions and trade compliance and \"after review and consistent with our policies, we terminated channels associated with Alabuga Special Economic Zone.”\n\nMeta said it removed accounts on Facebook and Instagram that “violate our policies.” The company said it was committed to complying with sanctions laws and said it recognized that human exploitation is a serious problem which required a multifaceted approach, including at Meta.\n\nIt said it had teams dedicated to anti-trafficking efforts and aimed to remove those seeking to abuse its platforms.\n\nTikTok said it removed videos and accounts which violated its community guidelines, which state it does not allow content that is used for the recruitment of victims, coordination of their transport, and their exploitation using force, fraud, coercion, or deception.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe women aged 18-22 were recruited to fill an urgent labor shortage in wartime Russia. They are from places like Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, as well as the South Asian country of Sri Lanka. The drive also is expanding to elsewhere in Asia as well as Latin America.\n\nAccounts affiliated to Alabuga with tens of thousands of followers are still accessible on Telegram, which did not reply to a request for comment. The plant's management also did not respond to AP.\n\nThe Alabuga Start recruiting drive used a robust social media campaign of slickly edited videos with upbeat music that show African women smiling while cleaning floors, wearing hard hats while directing cranes, and donning protective equipment to apply paint or chemicals.\n\nVideos also showed them enjoying Tatarstan's cultural sites or playing sports. None of the videos made it clear the women would be working in a drone manufacturing complex.\n\nOnline, Alabuga promoted visits to the industrial area by foreign dignitaries, including some from Brazil, Sri Lanka and Burkina Faso.\n\nIn a since-deleted Instagram post, a Turkish diplomat who visited the plant had compared Alabuga Polytechnic to colleges in Turkey and pronounced it “much more developed and high-tech.\"\n\nAccording to Russian investigative outlets Protokol and Razvorot, some pupils at Alabuga Polytechnic are as young as 15 and have complained of poor working conditions.\n\nVideos previously on the platforms showed the vocational school students in team-building exercises such as “military-patriotic” paintball matches and recreating historic Soviet battles while wearing camouflage.\n\nLast month, Alabuga Start said on Telegram its \"audience has grown significantly!”\n\nThat could be due to its hiring of influencers, who promoted the site on TikTok and Instagram as an easy way for young women to make money after leaving school.\n\nTikTok removed two videos promoting Alabuga after publication of the AP investigation.\n\nExperts told AP that about 90% of the women recruited via the Alabuga Start program work in drone manufacturing.\n\n___\n\nFind more AP coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AAPL, MSFT, or GOOGL: Which Tech Company is the Better Buy this Earnings Season?",
        "content": "As earnings season approaches for big technology companies, I will compare Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) using the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool to determine which stock is the best buy. While I hold a neutral outlook on Apple and a bullish outlook on both Microsoft and Alphabet, a closer analysis suggests that Microsoft may be the best choice heading into earnings.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nI hold a neutral stance on Apple ahead of its earnings report on Oct. 31. My skepticism is due to what I view as overly optimistic revisions from Wall Street analysts, with 21 out of 25 raising earnings per share (EPS) estimates and 21 out of 24 boosting revenue projections over the past three months. The consensus expects EPS of $1.55 (up 6% year-over-year) and revenues of $94.23 billion (up 5.3%).\n\nWhile the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, both capable of running artificial intelligence (AI), are key to Apple’s growth, initial sales of 37 million units fell 12.7% below the iPhone 15’s launch figures. The full potential of these devices, however, may not be realized until more AI features become available, delaying any AI-driven super cycle.\n\nApple’s performance in China will also be important this earnings season. Over the last nine months, Apple’s sales in China have dropped by 9.6%, with a 6.5% decline in Fiscal Q3 compared to last year, reflecting a downward trend. While there was an expectation of demand recovery in Fiscal Q4 due to the iPhone 16 launch, the full impact is likely to materialize over the coming year when AI-driven updates become available.\n\nAdditionally, Apple’s Services segment should continue to post record revenues, benefiting from Apple’s ecosystem of 2.2 billion active iOS devices.\n\nIs Apple Stock a Buy, Hold or Sell?\n\nI rate Apple as a Hold ahead of its earnings, though I expect near-term growth to sustain the stock’s momentum, which is trading near all-time highs. Despite this, I see few catalysts that will enable the company to surpass the upwardly revised expectations.\n\nMoreover, Apple’s options chains reflects some volatility, with an expected price swing ahead of earnings of 4.7% in either direction based on an at-the-money $230 strike price for options expiring on Nov. 1. The chart below illustrates the options chain.\n\nAt TipRanks, Apple’s Wall Street consensus is a Moderate Buy, with 23 out of 34 analysts recommending investors Buy the stock. The average price target is $248.90, suggesting potential upside of 7.99%.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nI am bullish on Microsoft leading into earnings scheduled for Oct. 30. Despite beating expectations across the board with its previous financial results, that print did not positively impact MSFT stock. And, analysts have revised their projections downward for the upcoming Fiscal Q1 2025 earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the past three months, 15 of 21 analysts have lowered their EPS estimates, and all 26 have revised revenue projections for Fiscal Q1. Current expectations are for EPS of $3.10 (a 3.7% year-over-year increase) and revenues of $64.54 billion (up 14.2%).\n\nLast quarter, a major concern that hurt Microsoft was the announcement of increased infrastructure spending to meet growing demand. This spending is expected to pressure margins in the current Fiscal year. Additionally, the performance of the Intelligent Cloud segment, led by Azure, showed some moderation, with Azure growing by 22% year-over-year in the previous quarter. These revised estimates present a more tempered view, giving Microsoft an opportunity to meet or exceed expectations with its upcoming results.\n\nIs MSFT Stock a Buy?\n\nI rate Microsoft a Buy ahead of its earnings, believing that with lower expectations and more patient investors, the company’s strong cloud performance and sustained gross margins near 70% should be better appreciated. This could help the stock return to its all-time high of $468 per share reached in July of this year.\n\nHowever, the options chain below indicates significant volatility, with an expected price swing of 5.9% ahead of earnings, based on the at-the-money straddle for options expiring on Nov. 1, at a strike price of $412.50.\n\nAt TipRanks, Microsoft has a Strong Buy rating from Wall Street, with 26 of 29 analysts rating it a Buy and an average price target of $503.13, suggesting potential upside of 21.84%.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL)\n\nI have a positive outlook for Alphabet ahead of its Q3 earnings report on Oct. 29, as Wall Street expectations seem balanced and the company may exceed conservative guidance. Analysts have made 17 upward and 18 downward EPS revisions, along with 16 upward and 13 downward revenue revisions in the past three months. The target to beat is an EPS of $1.84 (up 19% year-over-year) and revenues of $86.23 billion (up 12.4% year-over-year).\n\nWhile Alphabet’s Q2 results beat expectations, YouTube’s ad revenue of $8.66 billion fell short of the $8.93 billion consensus, contributing to the mixed revisions. Management also cautioned that operating margins could be impacted by increased depreciation, higher infrastructure costs, and the pull-forward of hardware launches.\n\nDespite concerns about losing market share in Search due to rising AI competition, Google Search showed steady growth in this year’s second quarter, with double-digit growth expected to continue. Any potential weaknesses in YouTube or Search can be offset by Google Cloud, which experienced a 29% revenue increase in Q2, marking its sixth consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nIs GOOGL A Buy, Hold or Sell?\n\nI rate Alphabet as a Buy ahead of its earnings, as the stock has fallen nearly 13% since its Q2 report, which I believe to be somewhat of an overreaction. Alphabet appears well-positioned to deliver strong performance for the third quarter, supported by a more balanced market outlook.\n\nCompared to Apple and Microsoft, Alphabet’s options chains below shows the lowest volatility ahead of earnings. The expected price swing is 2.8% in either direction, based on the at-the-money straddle for options expiring on Nov. 1, calculated using a $165 strike price.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, Alphabet is rated a Strong Buy, with 39 analysts recommending Buy and nine recommending Hold. The average price target is $200.92, indicating potential upside of 21.48%.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile analysts are revising estimates upward for Apple, making it harder to beat expectations in a transitional quarter, softer expectations for Microsoft and Alphabet create a better outlook for earnings beats. Though I consider both MSFT and GOOGL to be Buys, I believe Microsoft is the stronger choice as its stock likely has more room to run and it could easily beat modest earnings expectations.\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclaimer\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon, Google Join Nuclear Power Push, Triggering Market Surge",
        "content": "The Uranium stocks have popped as significant tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN, Financial), Microsoft (MSFT, Financial), and Alphabet (GOOGL, Financial) deepen their nuclear power bets. It started with Microsoft's power purchase agreement made last month that will revamp the Three Mile Island Nuclear Station for AI's burgeoning growth.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.\n\nThis week, we saw the spectrum shifting a gear higher as a giant such as Amazon revealed partnerships with Energy Northwest, Dominion Energy, and X-energy to pursue Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), which have thus brightened up investor confidence in the sector. On the same day, Google's parent company Alphabet was revealed to be investing $10 million in Kairos Power to develop the initial 500MW of advanced small modular reactor facilities, all in a sign of a sector switching to more compact and environmentally friendly power generation technology.\n\nThe market confronting them responded sharply and violently. New interesting information about uranium mining and nuclear energy Company Cameco (CCJ, Financial) rocketed 8.2%, Denison Mines (DNN, Financial) and Clean Energy Fuels (CLNE, Financial) went 14.7 % per share higher and 17% higher, respectively. NuScale Power (SMR, Financial, which was revealed earlier had a large stake in the SMR market, rocketed up by a magnificent 31.6% and reached its highest point ever.\n\nThe enthusiasm for nuclear power is underpinned by the IAEA's latest forecasts on nuclear capability, which indicate a probability of a 2.5-fold increase in capacity by 2050. This projection is in line with the rising global push to escalate nuclear deployment as part of the plan to realize net-zero carbon emissions.\n\nClosely following this, tech giants set the pace, investing in nuclear power. They did not merely ignite the upturn of relevant stocks, but they also indicated nuclear energy as a crucial factor that could shape the future energy scenario, generating a cleaner and more sustainable energy mix.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google and Apple's exclusive search engine deal could be on the DOJ's chopping block, analysts say",
        "content": "The Department of Justice could block Google (GOOGL) from being the default search engine on Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone as part of its antitrust victory against the tech giant.\n\nIn August, a federal judge ruled that Google monopolized the online search engine market. Analysts at Jefferies (JEF) said a “very likely” outcome could be that the Justice Department will opt to ban Google from paying Apple to be the exclusive search engine on the popular smartphone.\n\nThat could pose a major blow to Apple’s revenues. According to the analysts’ estimates, revenue from this deal is around $25 billion for the year, or about 6.3% of Apple’s revenue and a whopping 20% of its pretax profit.\n\nThis ban could take place over the course of several years and may not altogether prevent Google from having any revenue-sharing agreement with Apple. Instead, it would block the two tech giants from having an exclusive deal that would shut out other search engines.\n\nApple stock was flat as of Thursday morning, trading at $231.96 per share. The tech giant has a market capitalization of $3.52 trillion — the largest in the world.\n\nFederal judge Amit Mehta said in his decision that Google’s exclusive agreements with companies like Apple allowed it to hike prices for advertisers without any blowback.\n\nTo address Google’s monopoly in the search engine market, the Justice Department said in a court filing earlier this month that it’s looking for remedies that would prevent and restrain any present and future maintenance of its dominance.\n\nThis would include “behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features” — which could also mean breaking up the company.\n\nWhile the ruling and subsequent DOJ proposals have knock-on effects on the iPhone maker, Apple stock was largely unharmed by the ruling. Jefferies noted that the sales performance of the recently released iPhone 16 and rollout of its artificial intelligence features, Apple Intelligence, are more important short-term drivers.\n\nThe analysts said they are worried that market expectations for next year’s iPhone, the iPhone 17, are too high and that AI hardware tech on smartphones may have to wait until the iPhone 18 in 2026 to be fully developed.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon Earnings Preview: The Weakest of the Magnificent 7?",
        "content": "Of all the Magnificent 7 stocks, Amazon (AMZN) has been the most challenging for investors to own over the last several years. While all the other companies in the group excluding Tesla are trading significantly higher than their 2021 highs, Amazon languishes. Amazon’s stock price is at the same price as it was in July 2021. May this lack of progress in the stock price be an opportunity for discerning investors?\n\nAmazon's stock has moved sideways over the past three years, allowing its valuation to become increasingly attractive as the company’s earnings have continued to grow. This period of stagnation in share price, combined with steady profit and sales growth, appears to have positioned the stock at a more appealing level for investors.\n\nToday, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting flat earnings revisions. However, with its historically cheap valuation and strong growth forecasts, it may be an attractive addition to investors’ portfolios. Amazon reports earnings Thursday, October 24. This analysis will examine the upcoming earnings expectations for Amazon's e-commerce and cloud computing segments, as well as the potential impact of artificial intelligence on the business, to assess whether the stock presents a worthwhile investment opportunity. We will also compare Amazon to two other Magnificent 7 members – Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon Earnings Projections\n\nDespite the less than encouraging stock price action, Amazon has continuously posted strong earnings over the past year. During the last four quarterly earnings meetings, Amazon has beaten analysts’ expectations every time with an average beat of 31.13%. Although the Zacks earnings ESP is not projecting an earnings beat this quarter, earnings are projected to grow nicely nonetheless, and sales are expected to progress nicely as well.\n\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, continues to dominate the highly competitive cloud services market, and last quarter reported a $100 billion annual revenue run rate. Most notably, web services revenue growth has been reaccelerating and shows continued expansion in margins. Artificial intelligence is and will continue to be a major catalyst for AWS, as its intense demand for computing power should power more growth in the years ahead.\n\nRegarding the retail business, analysts are expecting close to double digit year over year growth although there are still some concerns. Expanding internationally offers growth opportunities for Amazon but also brings challenges, including the negative impact of currency fluctuations on e-commerce results, especially with the strong dollar putting pressure on profitability. Additionally, competition is intensifying as traditional retailers like Walmart and Target enhance their e-commerce capabilities, while regional rivals such as MercadoLibre, Flipkart, and Alibaba pose significant threats in key international markets.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nComparing AMZN to AAPL and MSFT Stocks\n\nAmazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are all major players in the cloud computing space, with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, respectively. While AWS leads the market share, both Azure and Google Cloud have been rapidly expanding their capabilities, with Alphabet leveraging its AI expertise and Microsoft integrating cloud services with its software ecosystem.\n\nIn terms of valuation, Alphabet appears attractively priced at 21.6x forward earnings, which is below its five-year median of 23.8x. Microsoft, on the other hand, trades at a higher valuation of 32x forward earnings, above its five-year median of 22.3x. Meanwhile, Amazon is trading at 38.5x forward earnings, significantly lower than its five-year median of 70.1x, suggesting potential value as the stock has lagged despite continued growth in earnings and cloud revenues. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShould Investors Buy Amazon Shares?\n\nAmazon's stock has been challenging for investors over the past several years, especially compared to other \"Magnificent 7\" stocks. While companies like Alphabet and Microsoft have climbed well beyond their 2021 highs, Amazon's stock price is still languishing around the same level as it was in mid-2021. This lack of progress could be an opportunity for patient investors who see potential in the company's evolving business and improving valuation.\n\nDespite stagnant stock performance, Amazon's valuation has become more attractive as earnings and revenues have continued to grow. AMZN has also spawned multibillion dollar new businesses like Advertising, Alexa and Prime video which continue to grow nicely and give another reason to never count this technology juggernaut out of the race.\n\nAs Amazon heads into its earnings report on October 24, key segments to watch include e-commerce, where nearly double-digit growth is expected, and Amazon Web Services, which continues to lead the cloud computing market. And while of course risks remain, Amazon's steady business growth, attractive valuation, and leading cloud position make it worth considering for investors willing to look beyond short-term challenges.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing.com -- Wedbush analysts upgraded Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) from Neutral to Outperform on Thursday, raising the price target from $80 to $85.\n\nThe analysts cite growing confidence in Zoom's enterprise business, stabilizing churn, and new opportunities in the contact center segment as key reasons for the optimistic outlook.\n\n\"We are upgrading our rating...as the company expects to see a re-acceleration in growth across enterprise customers while seeing its churn stabilize,\" Wedbush wrote.\n\nWedbush notes that Zoom's core products are now unified via its communications platform, Zoom One, which integrates meetings, phone, chat, and more.\n\nWedbush believes the company's broad product portfolio enables \"strong upsell and cross-sell opportunities,\" with customers increasingly subscribing to multiple products.\n\nNotably, Wedbush says 13% of enterprise customers now use three or more Zoom products, contributing 66% of the company's total annual recurring revenue (ARR).\n\nThe firm highlights promising growth in Zoom's expansion into the contact center segment. While the contact center product (CCaaS) is on a slower growth path compared to the earlier success of Zoom Phone, Wedbush believes it will still hit a $400 million run rate within four years.\n\nZoom Phone \"took ~4.5 years from launch to reach ~10% of revenues, but this might take slightly longer with ZM representing a much larger revenue base while expecting solid upside as it tracks closely with Zoom Phone, making it likely to reach ~$400 million run rate in ~4 years after launch\" noted Wedbush.\n\nWedbush also said Zoom's churn rate has improved to 2.9% after stricter payment enforcement. The stability is expected to drive enterprise revenue growth throughout the second half of 2025 and accelerate into fiscal 2026.\n\n\"Churn decreased...bringing more stability to its net retention rate,\" the firm states.\n\nDespite growing competition from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Workspace, and other UCaaS providers, Wedbush sees Zoom well-positioned to address a $235 billion addressable market by 2028.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWedbush lifts Zoom Video, sees re-acceleration in growth\n\nMorocco stocks higher at close of trade; Moroccan All Shares up 2.10%\n\nEarnings call: nokia reports mixed q3 results, maintains 2024 outlook\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Flying from point A to point B can take a bite out of your wallet, sometimes a big one. Google, for years, has let you compare prices via its Google Flights tool, but now the site is taking things a step further.\n\nGoogle Flights has added a “Cheapest” tab, letting would-be travelers find the rock-bottom fare to their preferred destination. Saving cash sometimes comes at a cost, though. To get the cheapest flight, you’ll have to be willing to brave a red-eye travel schedule, change planes and sometimes even change carriers mid-flight.\n\nThe tab is visible to mobile users of the tool. Once you search for a flight, you’ll be given the “best” options, based on price and convenience, per usual. But to the right is the “cheapest” tab, which will focus solely on price.\n\n“Sometimes, there might be cheaper options available for those of you who are willing to give up some convenience for the best deal,” Google said in a blog post. “For example, there could be a third-party booking site offering a lower price than the airline itself. Or you might be able to save by flying back to a different airport that’s in the same city you departed from — like flying out of New York’s LaGuardia and returning to JFK.”\n\nThe tab will roll out globally over the next two weeks.\n\nEven Google admits some of the low-cost itineraries can be “creative,” but if you’re flying on a budget, those inconveniences might be worth it to you.\n\nCheap flights are increasingly hard to come by. Over the past year, the consumer price index for airlines tickets has jumped 25%, the largest increase since the Federal Reserve of St. Louis began tracking prices in 1989.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "First US auction of nature-based carbon credits scheduled for early 2025",
        "content": "The American Forest Foundation (AFF) recently announced that the nonprofit will hold the US's first nature-based carbon credit auction early next year.\n\nIn February 2025, buyers will be able to bid on premium carbon credits from four projects under the Family Forest Carbon Program, an initiative that connects landowners with technical and financial resources to more sustainably manage private forest lands.\n\n\"We are trying to address several pain points that exist in the current voluntary market for buyers of carbon credits, but also for landowners who are seeking to participate in the market,\" Nate Truitt, executive vice president of climate funding at the American Forest Foundation, told Yahoo Finance. \"And we're also seeking to close what is a really substantial financing gap for natural climate solutions, a gap that we're going to have to close globally if we're going to stay on a 1.5- or even a two-degree scenario.\"\n\nPrice volatility, market inefficiency, and a credibility crisis in the voluntary carbon market — along with the AI boom and other factors — have contributed to the recent trend of companies pulling back from their net-zero pledges. Corporations such as Shell (SHEL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Crocs (CROX) have missed, delayed, or weakened their sustainability targets in recent years.\n\nTruitt expects interest in the auction from companies in sectors, such as consumer goods that produce high emissions or are relatively less active in carbon markets but have decarbonization strategies in place. He also anticipates some interest from universities.\n\nAmong companies purchasing carbon credits, Microsoft dominates after setting an ambitious goal in 2020 to become carbon-negative within a decade. Other Big Tech firms such as Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) are consistent buyers. However, Truitt doesn't expect Big Tech companies to ultimately participate in this auction as they already employ large procurement teams.\n\nTruitt instead sees the auction as attracting \"the next wave of carbon credit buyers,\" comprised of actors that currently must navigate confusing spot markets, sift through individual carbon credit offerings, or sign on to long-term purchase agreements in a largely unregulated market.\n\n“It's our hope that by lowering these transaction costs and the friction of this, ... we can get some of those buyers to come to the table,” Truitt said.\n\nAFF is auctioning carbon credits for two types of projects. The first aims to improve forest management and carbon sequestration on 90,000 acres of land from Maine to Alabama held by 700 family landowners enrolled in the project. The second and newer project pays cattle ranchers and pasture owners in Georgia to plant trees on 1,500 acres of land.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother feature of AFF's auction will be an advance funding mechanism. In addition to bidding on the number and price of carbon credits to be delivered at a later date, companies will determine a percentage they are willing to pay for up-front in exchange for a discount.\n\nBuyers have spent roughly $3 billion on durable carbon removal credits since October 2019, according to reporting platform CDR.fyi; however, the market could grow more rapidly with better access to low-cost financing.\n\nTruitt underscored that many projects are ready to get off the ground. But because these projects involve more risk — natural disasters and changing rules around offsets add to uncertainty — they often have a difficult time securing lending.\n\nIf successful, AFF hopes their auction design can be used by other carbon market participants and remove barriers to these transactions.\n\n\"We're not solving climate change, but we're trying to develop a tool that will enable the voluntary carbon market to scale quicker and to produce higher quality carbon credits that can be trusted by buyers, investors, and the general public,\" Truitt said.

(Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images) (Finnbarr Webster via Getty Images)\n\nPreserving 'a messy forest'\n\nTim Stout is one landowner participating in the project. Stout and his family own a 175-acre former dairy farm in Vermont that was passed down from his great-grandfather.\n\nHe and his brother have managed the heavily forested property for the past 40 years, and after evaluating different carbon projects, their family enrolled in the Family Forest Carbon Program.\n\nThe financial benefits are \"fairly modest,\" Stout said. \"I mean, over 20 years, it's a healthy amount,\" he clarified, \"but I think for ... the program to really take off, the price of carbon credits has to go way up.\"\n\nAFF said it uses Verra's verified carbon standard and its own internal methodology developed with the Nature Conservancy to vet the quality of the credits.

(Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images) (ROBYN BECK via Getty Images)\n\n\"A messy forest is better than a clean forest because … all the downed trees, all the branches, all the leaf litter is storing carbon,\" Stout explained about how these plans have changed the way he and his family manage their land. \"We're moving more and more to kind of a messy forest.\"\n\nAt the same time, the cost of managing land has \"gone up significantly,\" Stout said.\n\nExtreme weather attributed to climate change has exacerbated costs. Heavy rainfall and flooding in Vermont, which experienced a 1-in-1,000-year rain event this summer, eroded the foundation of Stout's barn, incurring a large expense, he said. And strong winds toppled 200-year-old maple trees onto roadways, which needed to be removed.

(Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images) (Robert Nickelsberg via Getty Images)\n\nFunding from the auction will go toward expenses related to managing the forest and creating long-term land use plans that are developed by landowners, state foresters, and consulting AFF foresters. These plans and smart forestry techniques help forest owners like Stout increase the amount of carbon their forests can sequester.\n\nStout, who now sits on AFF's board, said he was motivated to sign a contract with the Family Forest Carbon Program by his concerns over climate change. He also feels a strong calling to preserve the woodland for future generations and educate other small landowners about sustainable forestry.\n\n\"I would love to have my four-year-old grandson and two-year-old granddaughter be able to visit that [land] when they're my age and have a healthy, robust, resilient forest that's still playing a role in mitigating climate change,\" he said.\n\n—\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. Since Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)  ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWall Street continues to gain momentum amid the latest earnings season and analysts are wondering whether we are still up for soft landing. Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz chief economic advisor, talked about the possibility of a soft landing vs no landing during a program on CNBC. When asked what would it take for the market to have a no-landing scenario, the analyst said:\n\n“I think we need the productivity enhancers from A.I., from life sciences to come earlier, we need to continue to have positive shocks to our labor force. And if we get those two things, you can get the bigger but not hotter economy which actually would be perfect for almost everything you can think of, from households to companies to financial markets.”\n\nThe analyst does not rule out the possibility of a recession, however.\n\n“My probability of a soft landing is 55%, and a recession is 30%. A soft landing is the most likely scenario, but it’s not dominant. Why isn’t it dominant? Because we have weakness in the household sector, particularly on the lower-income side, and the Fed has been unpredictable. Just think, Morgan—at the end of July, the Fed didn’t cut rates because everything seemed fine. By the next meeting in mid-September, it cut 50 basis points. And now it’s talking about cautious cuts. So, the Fed needs to be careful.”\n\nFor this article we picked 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). This Analyst Predicted AI Will Crush Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Search Business — Was He Right?\n\nPhoto by Firmbee.com on Unsplash\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nIn April 2023, Malcolm Ethridge, CIC Wealth executive vice president, on CNBC talked about the threats to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) search business and the defensive posture of Sundar Pichai when it comes to AI.\n\n“I feel like Google (Alphabet) will be continuously distracted and continuously trying to catch up in this AI arms race. If Google were to lean too far into the generative AI search trend, it would cannibalize too much of their business, as search is their only real revenue source. Even the products they have developed are built around getting users to the search bar quicker than on their competitors’ devices.\n\nThat is worrisome because if they were to make a real pivot toward incorporating a chat box feature with a singular answer to your search query, it would be the equivalent of Facebook going fully mobile back in 2014 when many were criticizing Mark Zuckerberg, saying he was crazy. I don’t think Google and Alphabet have the time to pull that off and be able to say, “We told you so, and we told you we had something in the works.”\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far the analyst’s concerns have proved wrong. Why?\n\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels.  With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market. According to StatCounter report, Bing search engine’s market share only increased from 3.03% in August 2023 to 3.91% in August 2024. This shows MSFT has not been able to make any notable dent in Google’s market share.\n\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet’s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts’ forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)  is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\n\nOakmark Select Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was the top detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-based communication services company’s stock price fell after a U.S. District Court ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by maintaining a monopoly in general search engine services via exclusive distribution agreements. We think this case is unlikely to hurt Alphabet’s valuation over the long term as regulations previously en[1]acted in the European Union to address similar issues did not materially erode the company’s market share. We continue to believe that Alphabet is an attractive investment.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nIf the summer was about the ROI on AI, or really, the absence of it, how much patience does Wall Street have for tech’s fall earnings?\n\nJudging by the surge in chip stocks, investors waiting for details about where all that infrastructure money is going and when new revenue will be coming will have to wait a while longer. An appreciating asset is its own defense.\n\nAs analysts press tech executives for clearer timelines around the supposed AI transformation, chip names continue to climb. Nvidia is once again threatening Apple as the market’s most valuable company. Semiconductor names are amassing gains, reversing a downfall from August. That reflects the intense demand for AI processing and infrastructure and a disregard for short-term worries over ballooning capex. Chasing the dream is expensive.\n\nAnd once again investors are wondering where the limit is — if it exists.\n\nThird quarter reports are primed to test those boundaries with even more money at stake. The longer the capex hose stays open and the more vehemently executives fuse their identities with the AI wave, the harder it will be to turn back. Megacap tech companies are expected to dedicate $215 billion to AI capital expenditures this year, and according to Goldman Sachs, another $250 billion in 2025.\n\nA slowdown in investment isn’t here yet. But we’ll be looking for clues on how long AI growth will last until company whims, preferences, and future spending start to reveal themselves on spreadsheets. It’s only a matter of time before the imagined productivity gains and “innovative AI use cases” come due.\n\nThe tight, symbiotic ecosystem of selling AI hardware suggests that as soon as Big Tech eases spending or pivots elsewhere, previously robust fundamentals might be destabilized.\n\nThe tech giants largely disappointed Wall Street last quarter. Only Meta came out with a clear victory. While reactions to earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) highlighted how heavy AI investment can become a liability, Zuckerberg showed that Wall Street doesn’t mind swelling capex, as long as every other part of the business is exceeding expectations. That’s a high bar to clear. And it will only get harder as the spending side of the ledger gets bigger without surefire revenue to offset it.\n\nSeeing past risk is a virtue at the top of the corporate ladder. So is suppressing bubble chatter. If the upward trajectory of chip stocks is a bellwether then the tech giants will continue to double down on their mega disbursements. That’s what we would expect from tenacious leadership. Even if everyone else is anxious for answers.\n\nStory continues\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.\n\nRising Market Volatility\n\nVolatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market.\n\nA report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds and David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy.\n\nWhile expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells.\n\nThe economist maintains we are marching on ice that’s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September.\n\n“It’s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,” he said. “That’s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.”\n\n“But there’s been some cracks in the business cycle,” he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at “super high” levels.\n\nA slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election.\n\nWhile the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Historically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,” Cohen said.\n\nAlthough there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows.\n\nAI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta’s share price surge due to strong sales growth.\n\nAnalysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst’s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 216\n\nAnalyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 26%\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s wide range of internet-related services and goods allows it to maintain its dominance in the digital market. One of the main factors contributing to Alphabet’s success has been the incorporation of AI throughout its product line.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) technologies are improving user engagement and advertising efficiency, from YouTube content recommendations to search algorithms. Despite competition from new chatbot technologies, Alphabet has maintained its market leadership in search thanks to this technological advantage, with reports showing an increase in market share.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s 2024 second-quarter results were outstanding, exceeding revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts. AI-driven advancements that improved ad performance and marketer return on ad spend (ROAS) drove the company’s core search business to show strong growth. Due to the increased demand for AI-related services, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) also demonstrated accelerated growth, surpassing the expansion of the entire cloud segment.\n\nWith a substantial revenue of $328.28 billion over the past 12 months, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has demonstrated an impressive 13.38% growth in revenue. The analyst’s assessment that search growth projections may have been underestimated is supported by this growth trajectory.\n\nBecause it is expanding, the digital advertising market is a desirable area to invest in. Digital advertising spending is anticipated to rise by 12% annually in 2024 and maintain double-digit growth through at least 2026.\n\nConsequently, Google’s ad revenue increased from $42.6 billion in 2023 to $48.5 billion in the second quarter. Almost 60% of Alphabet’s $84.7 billion in Q2 sales came from this. Alphabet gets its ad revenue from sources other than Google. YouTube, the world’s second-largest website after Google, is also owned by the conglomerate. In Q2, YouTube’s ad sales brought in $8.7 billion for Alphabet, up from $7.7 billion the year before.\n\nThe robust revenue and earnings growth due to AI integration to enhance advertising is one reason the company is rated as a buy with an average price target of $206.60, implying a 26.87% change from the last price of $162.84.\n\nOverall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). According to the Insider Monkey database, Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder, with a position of $8.86 billion.\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 7th on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Justice Department will ‘very likely’ kill Google’s billion-dollar deal to be the default search engine on iPhones, Jefferies predicts",
        "content": "Analysts at Jeffries say it's \"very likely\" the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) will ban Google's longtime search deal on iPhones, a decision Jeffries predicts could plummet Apple's stocks by as much as 11%.\n\nGoogle has been at the center of the biggest antitrust trial in decades, as the DOJ questions practices that have kept the search engine front-and-center on smartphones and web browsers. Google has paid billions to Apple and others annually to have a prominent spot on devices up until now, but Jeffries analysts on Wednesday predicted the DOJ would ban those deals in the future as it tries to break up any search monopoly. Jeffries estimates the $25 billion deal makes up 20% of Apple's pretax profit, or about 6.3% of total revenue, representing an 8-11% hit on share prices.\n\nThese deals have taken place since 2002 when Google first paid Apple a cut of its search advertising revenue to make Google the default search platform. According to The Financial Times, that gave Google access to Apple's user base, with more than half of all search queries in the U.S. today currently flowing through Apple devices.\n\nDuring the trial, DOJ lawyers argued that Google's practice of paying billions to secure its position on platforms like Apple blocks competitors and prevents innovation. Google has repeatedly countered that its dominance stems from consumer preference and users can easily switch to other search engines if they wish. However, DOJ prosecutors contend that the sheer scale of these payments reveals the lengths Google goes to maintain its monopoly.\n\nEven if the DOJ does end these deals, the effects may take time to materialize. Jefferies estimates it could take three to eight years for a final outcome in court, with the possibility of long appeals. Jeffries also called its own estimates \"pessimistic,\" noting they are part of a model in which there is zero offset in revenue by Apple. If the case is indeed tied up for years, as Jeffries predicts, Apple has plenty of time to course-correct and make up for any potential lost revenue. Jeffries also added the impact could be contained to the U.S. only, depending on the reaction from Europe to any DOJ decision.\n\nRepresentatives from Jeffries, Apple, and Google did not immediately reply to Fortune's request for comment.\n\nIn the meantime, Apple's stock price has remained relatively resilient, bolstered by investor optimism about upcoming products like the iPhone 17 as well as new AI-powered technologies.\n\nStill, should the DOJ block the Google-Apple deal, it will mark a significant shift for both companies and could force Apple to explore its own search engine or deeper AI integrations—a path that carries its own risks. For Google, the stakes are equally high, if not higher. This case could fundamentally disrupt the company’s ability to use financial agreements to dominate the search-engine market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe outcome of the case would also trigger ripple effects across the broader tech landscape, potentially opening doors for competitors such as Microsoft. As regulators across the globe keep a close eye on this case, it’s clear that both Google and Apple stand at the crossroads of a legal decision that could reshape their futures.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia is set to dominate another Big Tech earnings season",
        "content": "We’re rolling into what is expected to be another wild tech earnings season, and you can bet AI is going to be front and center. And if there’s one company that everyone is watching, it’s Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nShares of the chip giant are up more than 16% in the last month, and the stock is currently on pace to unseat Apple as the largest publicly traded company by market capitalization.\n\nThe jump comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for the company’s upcoming Blackwell chip is “insane” during an interview with CNBC on Oct. 3. Since then, shares of Nvidia have climbed roughly 18%, topping out at $130. But reports that the Biden administration will establish a cap on the number of AI chips that can be shipped to certain countries put the rally on hold Tuesday before recovering some ground Wednesday.\n\nNvidia’s incredible stock performance and meteoric rise in data center sales over the last year have put the company in a difficult position for its upcoming earnings announcement, which it has yet to officially schedule. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during his keynote address at Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif. on March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn the company’s fiscal Q3 2024, overall revenue soared 206% to $18.1 billion, while data center revenue rose a whopping 279% to $14.5 billion. And while Nvidia isn’t staring down a decline in revenue, its growth will likely slow versus the same period last year, which could spook investors.\n\nDon’t believe me? Just take a look at what happened after the company announced its Q2 earnings back in August. While the company beat on revenue and earnings per share, with data center revenue increasing 154% year over year to $26.3 billion, Nvidia shares still fell more than 6% immediately following the announcement. It took more than a month for the company’s stock price to recover.\n\nThe AI trade hasn’t raised all ships, either. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) jumped 59% year to date, outpacing the broader S&P 500 (GSPC), which rose 21%. Qualcomm (QCOM) climbed 19% and AMD (AMD) added just 6% to its stock price. Intel (INTC), meanwhile, fell a stunning 55%.\n\nBroadcom benefits from its involvement in AI infrastructure, connecting servers and the like, while Qualcomm is seen as a potential beneficiary of on-device AI growth via AI smartphones and AI PCs. AMD is facing off against Nvidia and serves as an alternative on both price and availability.\n\nThen there’s Intel, which is struggling amid its enormous turnaround effort that includes building out its third-party chip fabrication capabilities as well as trying to catch Nvidia and AMD in the AI processor space.\n\nBut Nvidia is still the hands-down star of the show this earnings season. Investors will be looking for signs of continued AI spending from hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN), which make up a huge portion of AI sales, to get a sense of how well Nvidia chips are selling.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey’ll also look at how other chip companies perform this quarter ahead of Nvidia’s announcement, which tends to be far later in the earnings cycle than its contemporaries.\n\nWall Street will similarly be on the lookout for information about Nvidia’s Blackwell rollout and whether the company is facing any supply constraints as it did with its Hopper chips. Either way, it’s going to be a wild few weeks. Buckle up. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. (yahoofinance)\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): ‘The Stock’s A Comeback Kid And I Am So Glad We Own Some For The Charitable Trust’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on the Magnificent Seven Stocks Plus Netflix.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other magnificent stocks in Jim Cramer's list.\n\nOn Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the ongoing success of major technology stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven. He noted that these companies are proving their resilience in the market, no matter the circumstances, likening their performance to having a unique \"Poltergeist 2 magic.\"\n\nCramer pointed out that this latest rally for the Magnificent Seven differs from previous ones, as it is not merely a zero-sum game where gains for one group come at the expense of another. Instead, other sectors are also thriving, likely due to the influx of capital into the market.\n\n“Unlike previous Mag 7 rallies, this one’s definitely not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can roar, too, in this market, perhaps because there’s just a lot of money going around.”\n\nHe noted that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts mean that cash is losing value, creating an environment ripe for growth. He mentioned that the staying power of the Magnificent Seven is truly unbelievable.\n\n“We know these stocks will once again be hit by endless worries, giving you more opportunities to buy and more weakness before they snap right back and start climbing all over again.”\n\nCramer highlighted that this week marks the beginning of a crucial four-week earnings season, emphasizing that these quarterly reports hold significant weight for investors and the broader stock market. He acknowledged the current climate of anxiety, especially following the market's impressive rally. He added:\n\n“Why stress about how quickly the Fed will cut rates, Oh? God, I'm sick of that. What matters is they're giving vast swaths of the economy a big boost and I doubt they'll stop anytime soon.”\n\nCramer also observed that investors often gravitate toward underdogs in the market, suggesting that banks could be the next promising sector. In addition to banks, Cramer also mentioned the potential in pharmaceutical stocks, suggesting that investors might want to consider major players in that sector as well.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of stocks that were discussed by Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nTalking about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in light of his “own it, not trade it” philosophy, Cramer said:\n\n“Now I don't feel the same way, candidly, about Alphabet and in part, that's because the government has made it much harder to own it, with this antitrust lawsuit that's aimed for a breakup, something I'm very much opposed to. I'm also concerned about Alphabet's ability to keep putting up strong earnings. Company now has a less defensible position because it's become more of a media business and that's a very competitive space… So, the stock’s a comeback kid and I am so glad we own some for the Charitable Trust.”\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) serves as the holding company formed from Google's restructuring in 2015, with Google itself primarily recognized as a leading search engine. As a dominant player in the digital advertising sector, the company benefits significantly from its successful Google Search platform, which contributed over half of the company's $84.7 billion in revenue during the second quarter. Google Cloud also reported great performance, achieving a 29% increase in year-over-year revenue growth in the same quarter.\n\nHowever, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is facing significant legal challenges. The U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company in 2020, accusing it of engaging in monopolistic practices, including paying $26.3 billion in 2021 to companies to secure Google as the default search engine. Recently, there have been indications from the Justice Department suggesting a breakup of Google to address its perceived monopoly in search.\n\nThe Justice Department's proposed remedies could drastically alter how users will access information online, potentially reducing Google's revenues and allowing competitors to gain a foothold in the market. Additionally, these measures aim to prevent Google from extending its dominance into the growing field of artificial intelligence. There is also speculation that the Justice Department might seek to terminate Google's payments that facilitate its default status on new devices.\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on Jim Cramer's list of magnificent stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Apple Faces Potential Google Income Loss Amid Antitrust Action, Says Jefferies",
        "content": "CUPERTINO, Calif., Oct. 16, 2024 Investment resarch firm Jefferies believes that if the Department of Justice's antitrust action against Google (GOOG, Financial) turns out to be successful, Apple (AAPL, Financial) could lose to one-third of its income from the search behemoth. Targeting Google's partnerships with smartphone manufacturers including Apple, the lawsuit is likely to have major financial reprecussions should the case result in changes in revenue-sharing rules. According to Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, the legal procedure could potentially take up to three to eight years to clear out, with Apple losing one-third of its U.S. Google income. Lee highlighted that, while the potential income loss remains alarming, and in the near-term sales of the iPhone 16 and the introduction of Apple Intelligence have become critical. With around half of Apple's yearly profits coming from the iPhone, it is still the biggest revenue source for the business. Despite the antitrust concerns, Apple's core products are likely to be at the top of the priority list for investors at this point.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon is joining Google and Microsoft in going big on nuclear power",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is joining its artificial intelligence competitors in the race for nuclear energy.\n\nThe tech giant has signed three agreements “to support the development of nuclear energy projects,” it said Wednesday. The agreements include building “several” small modular reactors (SMRs). These “advanced” nuclear reactors have “a smaller physical footprint, allowing them to be built closer to the grid,” Amazon said. And compared with traditional reactors, SMRs can be put online faster because construction takes less time.\n\n“Nuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040,” Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, said in a statement.\n\nGarman said the investment in nuclear energy is “an important area of investment for Amazon,” because it is “both carbon-free and able to scale.”\n\nAmazon’s agreement with Washington-based Energy Northwest will produce four advanced SMRs that will be built, owned, and operated by the utilities consortium. The tech giant is also investing in SMR reactors and fuel developer X-energy, it said. X-energy’s design for advanced nuclear reactors will be used for Amazon’s project with Energy Northwest.\n\nUnder Amazon’s agreement with Virginia-based Dominion Energy (D), the companies will develop an SMR near the utility company’s North Anna Nuclear Generating Station.\n\nAI ambitions are hindering sustainability goals\n\nWhile the AI boom has boosted revenues for major tech companies, the technology’s massive demand for energy is hindering climate change efforts.\n\nOne query on ChatGPT needs almost 10 times as much electricity as a Google (GOOGL) search, according to a study by Goldman Sachs (GS). In April, Ami Badani, chief marketing officer of British chip designer Arm (ARM), said data centers powering AI chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT account for 2% of global electricity consumption. That demand, Badani said, could eventually slow down AI progress.\n\nIn July, Google said its carbon emissions have risen by 48% since 2019, mostly due to energy consumption by data centers and supply chain emissions. The company’s carbon emissions were up 13% year over year in 2023, according to its 2024 Environmental Report.\n\nIn the report, Google said it was “no longer maintaining operational carbon neutrality” and would turn to other “carbon solutions and partnerships” to reach its 2021 goal of reaching net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030.\n\nIn 2020, Microsoft (MSFT) set a similar goal to be “carbon negative” by the end of the decade. But in May, the company said its carbon emissions were almost 31% higher than in 2020, according to its 2024 Environmental Sustainability Report. That jump was mostly due to building data centers for AI, Microsoft said, as well as due to AI hardware such as semiconductors and servers.\n\n“Our challenges are in part unique to our position as a leading cloud supplier that is expanding its datacenters,” Microsoft said in a statement. “But, even more, we reflect the challenges the world must overcome to develop and use greener concrete, steel, fuels, and chips.”\n\nData centers, which are in demand as companies continue developing larger, more powerful models, could consume up to 9% of electricity in the U.S. by 2030 — more than double what is being used now, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.\n\nBig Tech is hungry for nuclear energy\n\nTech giants are taking notice of their growing carbon footprints.\n\nIn July, the Wall Street Journal (NWS) reported that a third of the U.S.’s nuclear power plants were discussing deals with tech companies to supply electricity for data centers.\n\nAmong them was Amazon, which was reportedly closing in on a deal to use electricity from Constellation Energy (CEG) — the owner of most of the country’s power plants.\n\nIn Amazon’s announcement Wednesday, it said it had made an agreement with Talen Energy “to co-locate a data center facility next to” the company’s Pennsylvania-based nuclear facility.\n\nEarlier this week, Google announced it had signed “the world’s first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy” from SMRs developed by California-based Kairos Power.\n\nGoogle said it expects to bring Kairos Power’s first SMR online by the end of the decade. Other reactors will be deployed through 2035. Through the deal, 500 megawatts (MW) of 24/7 carbon-free power will be available to U.S. electricity grids.\n\nIn September, Microsoft and Constellation announced a 20-year power purchase agreement that would restart the Unit 1 reactor on Three Mile Island — close to the site of one of the worst nuclear power plant accidents ever in the U.S. Through the deal, which will launch the Crane Clean Energy Center (CCEC), Microsoft will purchase energy from the Unit 1 reactor as part of its sustainability goal.\n\nThe CCEC, which is expected to come online by 2028, will add more than 800 MW of carbon-free electricity to the power grid, a study by the Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council found.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon, Google tap into nuclear power to fuel data centers and AI push",
        "content": "Amazon on Wednesday announced plans to invest in nuclear power production to fuel its data centers with clean energy, a key part of the e-commerce giant's push to expand AI-powered services.\n\n\"Nuclear energy is safe, reliable, and can help meet the energy needs of our customers for decades to come,\" said Kevin Miller, Amazon Web Services' vice president of global data centers in a statement. The company has a goal to achieve net-zero carbon — where the amount of greenhouse gases produced equals the amount removed from the atmosphere — across its operations by 2040.\n\nAmazon is the latest tech giant to turn to nuclear power as a source of clean energy as the demand for more power in data centers grows. Earlier this week, Google announced its partnership with California-based Kairos Power, in which Google plans to buy power produced from small nuclear reactors built by Kairos. The first reactor is scheduled to be running by 2030.\n\nAnd last month Microsoft announced an agreement with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, in which the facility would be brought back online to produce energy for Microsoft.\n\nAmazon is partnering with Dominion Energy Virginia, Energy Northwest and Talen Energy to explore new efforts to advance nuclear energy, including the development of smaller and faster nuclear reactors. The company is also investing in Maryland-based X-Energy Reactor Company, which announced on Wednesday it's raised $500 million in financing.\n\nRobert Blue, chair, president and chief executive of Dominion Energy, called the partnership an \"important step forward\" that would fuel the development of \"carbon-free power generation in Virginia,\" according to a news release from the company.\n\nThe partnerships come as tech companies face more demands for electricity because of the race to build more AI services that can generate text, images and other content. Tech giants, which already invest in solar and wind technologies, are searching for new sources of clean energy amid growing pressure to limit the greenhouse gas emissions they produce as they expand their AI products. These gasses trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to rising temperatures.\n\nA query on OpenAI's ChatGPT, on average, requires nearly 10 times as much electricity to process as a Google search, according to Goldman Sachs. Analysts for the firm estimate that the power needed to run data centers, where large-scale computing operations are done to support a variety of tech services, will grow 160% by 2030.\n\nTotal electricity consumption of data centers could reach more than 1,000 terawatt-hours in 2026, more than doubling the usage in 2022, according to estimates from the International Energy Agency.\n\nAmazon's announcement drew praise from lawmakers and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm as the United States pursues a goal of being completely dependent on clean electricity by 2035.\n\nIn July, Amazon said it hit its goal of powering its global operations, including its data centers, with 100% renewable energy in 2023, seven years ahead of its target of 2030.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Cameco, Denison Mines, and Energy Fuels Stocks All Popped on Wednesday",
        "content": "Uranium mining stocks surged higher on Wednesday, with industry bellwether Cameco(NYSE: CCJ) rising 8.2% through 2:11 p.m. ET, Denison Mines(NYSEMKT: DNN) doing even better with a 14.7% gain, and smaller Energy Fuels(NYSEMKT: UUUU) performing best of all -- up 17%.\n\nInvestors are betting on a resurgence in demand for nuclear energy, and their optimism is not without reason as tech giants like Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) are placing multibillion-dollar bets on the sector.\n\nWhat's going on with nuclear power?\n\nLast month, Microsoft ignited the rally in nuclear stocks when it signed a power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy(NASDAQ: CEG) under which the latter will reopen Unit 1 of its Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. Microsoft needs extra power to run the servers at its Azure business unit, and thinks nuclear might be the best way to produce that power in a carbon-free way.\n\nMomentum in the sector picked up this week with announcements from first Alphabet and then Amazon that they, too, are looking to nuclear energy to power their data centers.\n\nAlphabet's Google business is partnering with privately held Kairos Power to open a series of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Totaling only 500 megawatts (MW) in power production capacity, the Google news is only half as big as Microsoft's. (Full-scale nuclear power plants generally generate power in the gigawatt range). But that's not why the Google news is significant. It's backing an entirely new kind of nuclear power plants -- SMRs, which are expected to be both cheaper and faster to build than traditional plants.\n\nIn theory, that could drive demand for nuclear energy -- and for uranium to fuel it -- faster than simply building more gigawatt-scale power plants would do. It's this prospect that lies behind the strong interest in uranium producer stocks Wednesday.\n\nEnthusiasm only grew greater Wednesday morning when Amazon announced plans to partner with Energy Northwest, Dominion Energy(NYSE: D), and privately held X-energy to build four SMRs in the state of Washington and at least one in Virginia. Combined, these projects promise to bring at least 620 megawatts of nuclear power online -- and potentially more than 1 gigawatt, equivalent to a full-scale nuclear power plant.\n\nShould you buy uranium stocks now?\n\nBut should you be buying uranium stocks in the middle of a uranium stock-buying frenzy? While I'm bullish on the prospects for the nuclear power industry in general and am finding validation for that bullishness in all this recent news, I still think the answer to this question is ... maybe, but tread carefully and watch the valuations.\n\nWith a market cap of less than $2 billion even after this latest share price surge, Denison Mines is arguably the cheapest of these three stocks, trading at \"only\" 47 times trailing earnings. Denison also has no debt on its balance sheet, and $93 million in cash -- which is good news, because it will need it. It's currently burning cash at the rate of $28 million a year, and isn't expected to turn free cash flow positive until 2028, according to the analysts who follow it.\n\nCameco is a horse of a different color. Valued at more than $24 billion currently, it is easily the most valuable stock in this sector. On the other hand, it trades at a staggering 129 times trailing earnings. Cameco is both profitable and free cash flow positive, and analysts expect its profits to roughly triple over the next five years. Still, with a valuation that's 27.5 times its forecast earnings in 2028, it's hard to call the stock cheap.\n\nAnd Energy Fuels? With a $1.3 billion market cap, Energy Fuels is only a little less expensive than Denison. Analysts hope Energy Fuels turns profitable next year, and begins generating free cash flow in 2027. It's unprofitable today, however, and in its 25-year history, it hasn't ever generated positive free cash flow.\n\nWhile Energy Fuels stock looks speculative to me, it possesses cash reserves that should be sufficient to last until its free cash flow turns positive. In a momentum-driven market where none of these stocks looks cheap by the traditional valuation metrics of price to earnings, or price to free cash flow, tiny Energy Fuels might turn out to be the best performer of all.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "content": "Amazon said Wednesday it has signed three agreements to develop nuclear power projects, making the e-commerce giant the latest Big Tech firm to announce nuclear deals in recent weeks amid a surge in demand for energy to power artificial intelligence.\n\nThe company inked deals with public utility conglomerate Energy Northwest and developer X-Energy to build several small modular reactors (SMRs) in the region, and made an agreement with Dominion Energy in Virginia to explore the development of another SMR to boost power in that area.\n\n\"Nuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040,\" Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman said in a statement announcing the deals. Amazon is the second major U.S. tech firm to announce investments in nuclear power this week.\n\n\"One of the fastest ways to address climate change is by transitioning our society to carbon-free energy sources, and nuclear energy is both carbon-free and able to scale—which is why it’s an important area of investment for Amazon,\" Garman continued. \"Our agreements will encourage the construction of new nuclear technologies that will generate energy for decades to come.\"\n\nClean Tech, Ai Boom Straining Us Energy Supply\n\nAmazon is the second major U.S. tech firm to announce investments in nuclear power this week, after Google on Monday said it signed a deal with Kairos Power to bring Kairos' first small modular reactor online by 2030, followed by additional deployments through 2035.\n\nRead On The Fox Business App Google on Monday announced its own agreement investing in the development of nuclear power.\n\n\"We feel like nuclear can play an important role in helping to meet our demand... cleanly in a way that's more around the clock,\" Michael Terrell, senior director for energy and climate at Google, told reporters on a call.\n\nTechnology firms have signed several recent agreements with nuclear power companies this year as artificial intelligence boosts power demand for the first time in decades.\n\nNuclear Energy Is The Answer To Powering Ai Data Centers: Kyle Wool\n\nIn March, Amazon purchased a nuclear-powered datacenter from Talen Energy. Last month, Microsoft and Constellation Energy signed a power deal to help resurrect a unit of the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, the site of the worst U.S. nuclear accident in 1979. Microsoft announced last month it signed a deal to reopen the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania.\n\nU.S. data center power use is expected to roughly triple between 2023 and 2030 and will require about 47 gigawatts of new generation capacity, according to Goldman Sachs estimates, which assumed natural gas, wind and solar power would fill the gap.\n\nStory continues\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Amazon signs nuclear power deals, following Google, Microsoft\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. and billionaire financier Ken Griffin are among the backers anchoring a $500 million investment in small nuclear reactors, a burgeoning technology that has been heralded as the next era for atomic energy.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nInside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City How Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure Mexico Seeks to Halve Permitting Time to Attract More Factories What It Takes to Make City Solutions Go Viral\n\nThe Seattle-based company has signed agreements to develop the new breed of reactors — dubbed small modular reactors, or SMRs — in both Washington and Virginia, investing in in X-Energy, a privately-held advanced nuclear reactor developer.\n\nThe financing will help pay for the development of more than 5 gigawatts of new power projects coming online across the US by 2039, X-Energy said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nAmazon’s announcement comes as technology companies are searching for new energy supplies to power massive data centers needed to run artificial intelligence systems. Alphabet Inc.’s Google announced Monday it was backing the nuclear power, and signed an agreement with Kairos Power to construct a series of SMRs that use molten-salt cooling technology.\n\n“Nuclear energy is both carbon-free and able to scale, which is why it’s an important area of investment for Amazon,” Matt Garman, chief executive officer of Amazon Web Services, said in a statement. “Our agreements will encourage the construction of new nuclear technologies that will generate energy for decades to come.”\n\nData center expansion and other factors, are expected to drive electricity demand up by 15% to 20% over the next decade, according to the Energy Department. Data centers could consume as much as 9% of US electricity generation annually by 2030, up from 4% of total load in 2023, according to a report in May by the nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute.\n\nAmazon, which is poised to discuss the investment Wednesday morning at its offices in Crystal City, Virginia, has also signed agreements with Washington-based utility Energy Northwest and Virginia’s Dominion Energy, Inc. to develop SMR projects. Amazon said the reactors, which will be constructed, owned and operated by Energy Northwest, were expected to generate roughly 320 megawatts, with the option to expand to 960 megawatts total. In Virginia, Amazon said it had signed an agreement with Dominion to explore the development of an SMR project at the utility’s existing North Anna nuclear power station that could bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the region.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnlike traditional nuclear reactors, which average roughly 1,000 megawatts in size, SMRs can be built at factories, delivered by truck or train, and then assembled on-site, saving time and money. Utilities can install just one or bundle several together, expanding the potential market by including countries that don’t need a big conventional nuclear plant.\n\nStill, the technology hasn’t yet been deployed at scale, commercially.\n\nAnd SMR’s have their critics, including those who say the economics of nuclear power is flawed no matter what the size of the reactors. NuScale Power Corp. announced in November it was canceling plans to build a series of SMRs in Utah amid surging costs.\n\nMeanwhile, surging demand for power is prompting utilities to build more natural gas-fired plants, undermining lofty environmental goals for both the industry and tech firms.\n\n“Artificial intelligence may be new, but claims that the next revolutionary nuclear technology will solve our energy problems have been around since we first split the atom,” Johanna Neumann, an official with Environment America, said in a statement. “It’s time for Big Tech to recommit to solutions that work and pose less risk to our environment and health, including making data centers as energy efficient as possible and committing them to be powered by new renewable energy sources.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man How Starbucks’ Colorful, Sugary Drinks Turned Kids Into Customers for Life The World’s Central Banks Aren’t Following the Fed’s Lead Anymore A Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work When a Miracle Cure Is Left on the Shelf\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) the Best Internet Content Stock to Buy?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Internet Content Stocks to Buy. In this article, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks among the best internet content stocks.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, The global digital content creation market value stood at $25.6 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% from 2023 to 2030. In 2023, North America dominated the digital content market. The primary drivers are the increasing use of social media and the digital change occurring across different industries. According to a study by Kepios, 62.3% of individuals in the entire globe use social media. As of April 2024, the average daily usage is 2 hours and 23 minutes per this study. Kepios analysis reveals that the number of people using social media grew meaningfully during the first three months of 2024, and annual growth rates are still significantly more than 5%.\n\nContent creation is also being transformed by artificial intelligence. According to Custom Market Insights, the global market for AI-powered content creation was valued at $2.3 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.7% to reach USD 7.9 billion by 2033. Moreover, AI programs like GPT-4 are being used to generate graphics, music, and text. Gartner projects that 30% of all digital content will be artificial intelligence generated by 2025. This facilitates hyperpersonalization, which allows material to be personalized to specific consumers while also streamlining the content creation process.\n\nSecondly, the popularity of short-form video material is skyrocketing, emerging as a major trend in the content production industry. Platforms like Instagram Reels and TikTok have paved the way for this movement. In 2024, 85% of marketers anticipate short-form videos to be the most successful type of social media content, according to a HubSpot survey. The snackable aspect of this format makes it ideal for grabbing the attention spans of increasingly transient internet consumers.\n\nThirdly, digital content is projected to become more interactive in the future. Advancements in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are opening up greater opportunities for immersive experiences. The AR and VR market is expected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2030, according to a PwC report.\n\nIf we take a broader view, according to the PWC’s Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2024-2028, there are a number of significant growth prospects in the industry, which is expected to reach US$3.4 trillion by 2028. Notwithstanding persistent upheavals and the necessity of reinventing company models, the industry presents substantial income opportunities. Growth is anticipated to be driven by advertising, with spending forecast to reach US $1 trillion by 2026 because of connected TV and internet advertisements. Due to market saturation, streaming services are being forced to investigate ad-supported business models and creative content. Revenues from gaming are predicted to surpass $300 billion by 2028, particularly in Asia Pacific. The industry is still thriving. Companies navigating shifting market dynamics will find more opportunities in high-growth regions and market categories.\n\nStory continues\n\nMethodology:\n\nWe sifted through holdings of Internet Content ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 Internet Content stocks. Then we selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among institutional investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), a holding company, owns all of Google, the biggest online company. Slightly less than 90% of the overall revenue generated by the California-based company is derived from the sales of adverts on Google services. Google services also include online advertisements and sales from Google’s platforms (Play Store sales and in-app purchases), devices (Chromebooks, Pixel smartphones, and smart home products like Chromecast), and subscription services (YouTube TV, YouTube Music, among others). Google Cloud, the company’s cloud computing platform, generates about 10% of Alphabet’s revenue. The remaining amount is derived from the company’s investments in cutting-edge technologies, such as Waymo, Google Fiber, and internet and health access.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is viewed by analysts as a group of exceptional enterprises. It has become a dominant force in the technology industry, generating tens of billions of dollars in free cash flow annually, with offers ranging from self-driving vehicles and cloud computing to advertising. Despite antitrust concerns surrounding Alphabet’s main search business, investors remain confident in the company’s overall strength and believe it will maintain its leadership position in multiple industries, including search, artificial intelligence, video, and cloud computing.\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon, Texas Instruments and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Media and technology company Alphabet also continued delivering strong results in its search, YouTube advertising, YouTube subscription and cloud businesses. Shares rose amid an environment that continues favoring mega-cap technology companies.”\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of the best internet content stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) the Best High Growth NASDAQ Stock That is Profitable in 2024?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 10 High Growth NASDAQ Stocks That Are Profitable in 2024. In this article, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks among the high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable.\n\nWill the Bull Market Continue as We Enter the Earnings Season?\n\nMalcolm Ethridge, Capital Area Planning Group managing partner, joined CNBC to talk about where the market could go and his sentiment regarding the AI and overall tech sector. While many analysts believe that it will be the small caps that will lead the growth with interest rates easing and the economy slowing down. We recently covered the 8 Most Undervalued Penny Stocks To Buy According To Analysts, where we talked about how Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors likes the small cap in the current market environment. Here’s a piece from the article:\n\n“To talk about what the stock market looks like today and in the near future. Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors joined CNBC in a recent interview. He has been one of the strong proponents and supporters of small-cap stocks. Lee says that we are in a volatile environment currently, due to a few reasons, one being the elections in less than 30 days, the second being the Middle Eastern crisis which is scaring investors, and lastly the port strike that has the potential to cripple the economy. However, he still expressed his optimism that the year-end has a lot of tailwinds and investors shouldn’t be afraid to buy the dip. Moreover, Lee also highlighted that these current events are all short-term headwinds in a buying cycle and are expected to die down quickly.\n\nLee thinks that bottoms are tough and processed, and small caps are in the process of what could be a multi-year bottom. Therefore the conviction is that some people might want to buy the big names on NASDAQ and the AI market, however, with small caps trading at lower multiples of P/E less than 10, the risk and reward lie in small caps. Lee further mentioned that interest rate cuts and better earnings growth make the path for small-cap growth more visible.\n\nTom Lee has also reaffirmed his belief that the S&P 500 could close above 5,700 by year-end, supported by strong economic fundamentals and a dovish Federal Reserve beginning to cut interest rates. He noted that significant cash reserves are available for investment, which could drive stock prices higher in the next three to twelve months.”\n\nEthridge thinks otherwise, he believes that mega-cap stocks will continue to lead market growth, although not at the same pace as in recent years but still at a steady pace. He attributes this to the ongoing influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on various sectors, including real estate and manufacturing, which are becoming increasingly vital due to rising demands on infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, while explaining why the mega caps will lead the growth, Ethridge pointed out that for the big tech stocks, Fed rate cuts were not necessary as they had significant cash on their balance sheets to reinvest into newer AI ventures. We have already seen Magnificent Seven invest heavily in AI despite the high rate of borrowing thereby leading the bull market in difficult times.\n\nThe rate cuts have now made it easy for other companies that didn’t have enough cash to borrow and invest in technology. However, he also pointed out that the pace of rate cuts might slow down moving forward, thereby making it hard for small caps to keep up the technology investment race. Ethridge suggests that investors may need to adjust their expectations regarding future Federal Reserve rate cuts.\n\nMoreover, we are also entering earnings season, will the earnings derail the momentum or continue to boost the market? Drew Pettit, Citi Research Director of US Equity Strategy joined CNBC in another interview. He thinks that we are in for a decent quarter, although we are in an expensive market.\n\nWhile talking about how various sectors will perform, Pettit mentioned that software has the highest bar within tech, meaning its growth expectations are high, yet many software companies are not monetizing effectively. This creates volatility in stock performance. As earnings reports come in, Pettit suggests investors should focus on consumer behavior and credit conditions, particularly in the banking sector, which is expected to perform well this quarter. He also encouraged investors to look beyond the recent quarter earnings into 2025 and 2026, while choosing companies to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo curate the list of 10 high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable in 2024 we used the Finviz stock screener, Seeking Alpha, and Yahoo Finance as our sources. Using the stock screener, we got an initial list of major NASDAQ stocks sorted by their market capitalization. Next, we sourced the 5-year net income growth and revenue growth rates for these stocks from Seeking Alpha and the GAAP trailing twelve-month net income from Yahoo Finance. We only selected stocks that had 5-year net income and revenue growth of more than 15%. Lastly, we ranked the stocks by the number of hedge fund holders in Q2 2024 from Insider Monkey’s database. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\n5-Year Net Income Growth: 20.33%\n\n5-Year Revenue Growth: 17.23%\n\nTTM Net Income: $87.66 Billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks 3rd on our list of high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable in 2024. It is one of the Magnificent Seven technology companies known for its subsidiary Google.\n\nThe company has significant development in artificial intelligence, Google Cloud, and is known for its other products as well including YouTube, Gmail, and Android Operating systems among others. Investors are on the lookout for its autonomous driving venture, Waymo.\n\nWhile Tesla gets the majority coverage when it comes to self-driving car ambition, however, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with its Waymo venture has quietly made significant progress. Last week the company announced a significant robotaxi deal with Hyundai, a South Korean automaker. With this multi-year strategic partnership, Hyundai will use the autonomous driving technology of Waymo in 5 of its SUVs for the next 5 years.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) plans to launch its robotaxis for test drives by the end of 2025 and is expected to deploy a large fleet on public roads in the following years. It won’t be wrong to say that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is leading the robotaxi race as a fleet of around 700 self-driving cars are already operating in major states of the United States including Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The company is testing its services in Texas as well.\n\nIf we talk about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as a whole, the company has been generating significant revenues on the back of its search and cloud segments. The revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was up 14% year-over-year to reach $85 billion. Moreover, the company has generated more than $87 Billion in net income on a trailing twelve-month basis.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 3rd on our list of the high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a promising AI stock that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks. Since Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 3th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer during his October 14 program on CNBC looked excited as he celebrated the rebound of major tech stocks, saying these companies are showing their “staying power” despite the odds.\n\n“We’re back. That’s right. Whatever you want to call them, these big tech plays are demonstrating their staying power no matter what happens.”\n\nCramer said that the latest earnings season would be critical for the overall market and investor portfolios. He also pointed out the broadening of the rally, saying other groups besides the tech industry are also rebounding.\n\n“This rally is not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can work, too, in this market. There’s a lot of money going around, and we know there’s a lot of money coming into the market. The Fed is cutting rates, and friendly cash won’t be worth as much as it was. But the staying power of the Magnificent 7 is truly unbelievable.”\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 important stocks he’s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nTalking about the US government’s efforts to break up Google, Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC said:\n\n“Google Search is the most incredible bargain in the world the same goes for YouTube by the way.”\n\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels.  With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market. According to StatCounter report, Bing search engine’s market share only increased from 3.03% in August 2023 to 3.91% in August 2024. This shows MSFT has not been able to make any notable dent in Google’s market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet’s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts’ forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)  is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\n\nOakmark Select Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was the top detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-based communication services company’s stock price fell after a U.S. District Court ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by maintaining a monopoly in general search engine services via exclusive distribution agreements. We think this case is unlikely to hurt Alphabet’s valuation over the long term as regulations previously en[1]acted in the European Union to address similar issues did not materially erode the company’s market share. We continue to believe that Alphabet is an attractive investment.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 3th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Amazon, Google make dueling nuclear investments to power data centers with clean energy",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) on Wednesday said that it was investing in small nuclear reactors, coming just two days after a similar announcement by Google (GOOG), as both tech giants seek new sources of carbon-free electricity to meet surging demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe plans come as the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant said last month it plans to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft can buy the power to supply its data centers. All three companies have been investing in solar and wind technologies, which make electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions. Now they say they need to go further in the search for clean electricity to meet both demand and their own commitments to cut emissions.\n\nNuclear energy is a climate solution in that its reactors don’t emit the planet-warming greenhouse gases that come from power plants that burn fossil fuels, such as oil, coal and gas. The demand for power is surging globally as buildings and vehicles electrify. People used more electricity than ever last year, placing strain on electric grids around the world. Much of the demand also comes from data centers and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe International Energy Agency forecasts that data centers’ total electricity consumption could reach more than 1,000 terawatt hours in 2026, more than doubling from 2022. Estimates suggest one terawatt hour can power 70,000 homes for a year.\n\n“AI is driving a significant increase in the amount of data centers and power that are required on the grid,” Kevin Miller, Amazon Web Services’ vice president of global data centers, told The Associated Press, adding: “We view advanced new nuclear capacity as really key and essential.\"\n\nThe United States is pursuing small modular reactors, a type of nuclear reactor that can generate up to roughly one-third the amount of power of a traditional reactor. Developers say small reactors will be built faster and at a lower cost than large power reactors, scaling to fit needs of a particular location. They aim to start spinning up electricity in the early 2030s, if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gives permission to build and operate their designs and the technology succeeds.\n\nIf new, clean power isn’t added as data centers are developed, the U.S. runs the risk of “browning the grid,” or including more power that isn't made from clean sources, said Kathryn Huff, a former U.S. assistant secretary for nuclear energy who is now an associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe reactors are currently under development, with none currently providing power to the electric grid in the U.S. Big investors can help change that, and these announcements could be the “inflection point” that makes scaling up this technology truly possible, Huff said.\n\nJacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, echoed that, saying the industry needs customers who value the reliability and carbon-free attributes of nuclear and are willing to pay a premium for it at first, until a number of the next-generation reactors are deployed and the cost comes down.\n\nOn Monday, Google said it was signing a contract to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors that Kairos Power, a nuclear technology company, plans to develop.\n\nThe news highlights “the technologies that we’re going to need to achieve round the clock clean energy, not only for Google but for the world,” Michael Terrell, Google's senior director of energy and climate, told the AP.\n\nWith Kairos, Google said it expects to bring the first small modular reactor online by 2030, with more to come through 2035. The deal is projected to bring 500 megawatts of power to the grid. For context, Google consumed more than 24 terawatt hours of electricity last year, according to the company's annual environmental report. One terawatt is equal to 1,000,000 megawatts.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon's announcements Wednesday included working with utility Dominion Energy to explore putting a small modular reactor near its existing North Anna nuclear power station in Virginia. It's investing in reactor developer X-energy for its early development work, and collaborating with regional utility Energy Northwest in central Washington to put four of the X-energy reactors there.\n\nCombined, the three announcements could account for more than 5,000 megawatts of power by the late 2030s with the possibility of more. All of that is still likely only a small fraction of the company’s total energy consumption, a figure that Amazon does not report publicly.\n\nNew reactor designs pair well with industrial applications because they can be built on a small footprint and generate reliable power, with some able to provide high-temperature heat too, at the site, said Doug True, chief nuclear officer at the industry trade association, Nuclear Energy Institute.\n\n“It seems like a really good fit to support those facilities, and for a lot of different applications depending upon the amount of power that’s needed by the customer,” he said.\n\nBoth Amazon and Google have committed to using renewable energy to address climate change. By 2030, Google has pledged to meet net-zero emissions, and run carbon-free energy every hour of every day on every grid where it operates. It says it has already matched 100% of its global electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases on an annual basis. However, the company has fallen short on decreasing its emissions.\n\nAmazon has said it would match all of its global electricity consumption with 100% renewable energy by 2030, and recently announced it met that goal early in 2023. Though the company has matched its consumption as far as purchases of an equivalent amount of renewable energy, that does not necessarily mean it is using that to power its operations.\n\nAmazon saw its electricity emissions drop 11%, but direct emissions — known as Scope 1 — increased 7%, according to its 2023 sustainability report. The company is also targeting net zero-carbon by 2040.\n\n___\n\nRead more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

        "title": "Over 20% of Billionaire Bill Ackman's Portfolio Is Invested in This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock -- and Wall Street Thinks It Will Soar More Than 20%",
        "content": "Some investors firmly believe in building highly diversified portfolios. Not Bill Ackman. His Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund owns stakes in only nine companies. However, this approach has worked out pretty well for Ackman through the years: His net worth totals $9.1 billion.\n\nOver 20% of Ackman's portfolio is invested in one artificial intelligence (AI) stock. And Wall Street thinks the stock will soar over 20% within the next 12 months.\n\nAckman's top AI stock\n\nWhat is Ackman's favorite AI stock these days? It's Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). His Pershing Square hedge fund owns class A and class C shares of the tech giant worth roughly $2.1 billion as of June 30, 2024.\n\nAckman initiated a position in Alphabet in the first quarter of 2023. OpenAI had launched ChatGPT to rousing success only a few months earlier. Alphabet's subsequent introduction of its generative AI app Bard didn't go very well.\n\nWith Alphabet's share price sinking on the bumbling Bard launch, Ackman began aggressively buying the stock. He noted in a CNBC interview later in 2023 that Alphabet was integrating AI throughout its products and designing its own AI chips. The billionaire investor also thought the company had a competitive advantage with its access to data to use in training AI models.\n\nSure, Ackman reduced Pershing Square's stake in Alphabet in the second quarter of 2024 somewhat. It's still the hedge fund's largest position, though, with the class A and class C shares combined. Alphabet has also been a huge winner for Ackman.\n\nAnalysts' bullish views on Alphabet\n\nWall Street believes Alphabet can continue its winning ways. The average 12-month price target for the stock is $200.67. That reflects an upside potential of 21.6%. The most pessimistic analyst surveyed by LSEG thinks that Alphabet's shares will rise over the next 12 months.\n\nThirteen of the 43 analysts surveyed by LSEG in October rate Alphabet as a \"strong buy.\" Another 256 recommend the stock as a \"buy.\" The remaining five analysts view Alphabet as a \"hold.\" None think investors should sell the stock.\n\nBMO Capital's recent reiteration of an \"outperform\" rating (the equivalent of a \"buy\" recommendation) for Alphabet highlights why many on Wall Street like the stock. The firm wrote to investors that AI, especially generative AI, should provide a significant growth opportunity for the company's Google Cloud unit.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Google Cloud revenue soared 29% to $10.3 billion. Its operating income nearly tripled year over year to $1.17 billion. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in the Q2 earnings call that his company's generative AI solutions \"have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Wall Street right about Alphabet?\n\nAlphabet faces some challenges. The company has wrangled with regulators multiple times through the years. It's now doing so again with a federal judge ruling that Google unfairly stifled competition in the search engine business. Google also is embroiled in another antitrust lawsuit alleging illegal monopolization of the digital advertising industry.\n\nSome concerns remain that generative AI could eventually be a Google killer. Research firm eMarketer predicts Google's search ad market share in the U.S. will fall below 50% for the first time in a decade due to increased competition from TikTok and AI start-ups such as Perplexity.\n\nDespite these issues, I won't be surprised if Wall Street is right that Alphabet stock can rise another 20% or more over the next 12 months. I wouldn't write off Alphabet's long-term prospects, either. As Ackman told CNBC last year, \"[Alphabet] will be a dominant player in AI for the very, very long term.\" He hasn't amassed a multibillion-dollar fortune by being wrong about his big bets.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Trump Defends Tariff Plan While Pressing for More Fed Influence",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Former US President Donald Trump said his policies would inspire growth despite adding to the debt as he sought to assuage business leaders who worry his economic plans will fuel inflation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure Inside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working What It Takes to Make City Solutions Go Viral\n\n“We’re all about growth,” Trump told Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait on Tuesday in an interview at the Economic Club of Chicago. “We’re going to bring companies back to our country.”\n\nTrump defended his proposals to dramatically increase tariffs on foreign goods, saying the proposals were for the “protection of the companies that we have here and the new companies that will move in.”\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee disputed the notion his tariffs would impact Americans whose jobs depend on trade, saying the losses would be offset by new domestic manufacturing jobs.\n\n“It’s going to have a massive effect, positive effect,” Trump said of his proposed tariffs in response to Micklethwait’s saying the duties would have a negative effect on the economy. “The higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States, and build a factory in the United States so it doesn’t have to pay the tariff.”\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee’s comments come exactly three weeks before Election Day in what polls forecast to be a razor-thin contest with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. Surveys show the US economy is the paramount issue for voters.\n\nTrump in his third run for the White House has been bolstered by broad discontent among business executives and voters at large over President Joe Biden’s record. Anxiety over high prices and jobs have left the American public preferring the Republican candidate’s approach to that of Harris, polls suggest.\n\nThe former president has vowed to carry out an aggressive campaign of deregulation, renew expiring tax cuts, lower the corporate tax rate to 15% from 21%, and offer fresh tax reductions and benefits to bolster domestic manufacturing — policies cheered by prominent Wall Street and corporate leaders.\n\nTrump’s tax proposals, as well as dueling tax cuts and benefits pitched by Harris, though, come with stark price tags — in the trillions — and threaten to worsen a US federal deficit that’s already historically large. Some investors are betting Trump’s policies will leave the US saddled with more debt and higher inflation and interest rates. America’s annual deficit is already close to $2 trillion.\n\nStory continues\n\nDefending Tariffs\n\nTrump’s economic plan is heavy on tariffs, which he aims to impose on both US allies and adversaries, including a 60% levy on imports from China and 10% duties on the rest of the world. Trump has also insisted new tariffs will help fund his tax cuts, but economists say they are unlikely to create the revenue he needs. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates the tariffs could raise over $200 billion a year. The US took in an estimated $4.9 trillion in revenue in fiscal 2024.\n\nThe former president’s tariff agenda threatens to also reduce or redirect trade flows, further impacting revenue. Many economists have warned tariffs would hit US households with what is effectively a tax increase, likely sending inflation higher and raising pressure on the US Federal Reserve over interest rates.\n\nTrump also reiterated his pledge to block the sale of US Steel Corp. to Nippon Steel Corp., if the $14.1 billion transaction was concluded by the time he entered office.\n\n“I think it sets a horrible tone,” he said of the possible sale, saying that steel was a critical national security interest.\n\n“There are certain companies you have to have,” Trump said.\n\nBoth Biden and Harris have said they oppose the sale of US Steel to Nippon Steel, an election flashpoint, particularly in swing-state Pennsylvania, where both the American company and the United Steelworkers union — which also opposes the deal — are based.\n\nFederal Reserve\n\nTrump sidestepped a question about whether he would seek to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, but said he thinks it is fair game for a president to tell the head of the central bank how he thinks interest rates should change.\n\n“I think that if you’re a very good president with good sense, you should be able to at least talk to him,” Trump said, adding that he did not believe a president should be able to mandate change.\n\nTrump also mocked the job of running the Fed.\n\n“I think it’s the greatest job in government,” Trump said. “You show up to the office once a month and you say, ‘let’s say flip a coin’ and everybody talks about you like you’re a God.”\n\nThe Republican nominee has repeatedly criticized the US central bank and its chair, saying they initially “missed” inflation and that their half-point cut in September was a political move aimed at bolstering Harris ahead of the election.\n\nThe former president has said he would not reappoint Powell, whose term as chair ends in 2026. Giving presidents more sway over monetary policy would challenge longstanding policy that allows the Fed to set interest rates independent of political considerations.\n\nGoogle Breakup\n\nTrump wouldn’t say if he believed the Justice Department should seek the forced breakup of Google, saying that while he believed something should be done to make the search engine “more fair” lit may not require Alphabet Inc. to spin off its parts.\n\n“What you can do without breaking it up is make sure that it’s more fair. They do treat me very badly,” Trump said.\n\nThe DOJ is weighing whether to break up Google as a remedy after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market.\n\nTrump has increasingly clashed with Google, highlighting a more strident approach to Big Tech companies from conservatives.\n\nIn August, Trump called for his supporters to stop using the Google search engine, referring to claims from billionaire backer Elon Musk and others that it was interfering with efforts to find information about the former president.\n\nMigrant Workers\n\nImmigration, however, is an issue in which Trump’s approach could provide new challenges for business, exacerbating a shortage of labor and causing disruptions to the economy. Some business leaders have voiced concern that Trump’s planned clampdown on migrants would shrink the pool of available labor, making it more difficult to hire workers.\n\n“I want a lot of people to come into our country but I want them to come in legally,” Trump said.\n\nThe former president is vowing to finish building the wall on the southwestern border, reinstate a ban on people from predominantly Muslim countries and carry out mass deportations of undocumented migrants if he is returned to the White House.\n\nHe has drawn criticism over his language and for spreading unfounded claims, including that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio were eating dogs and cats and that Aurora, Colorado, has been overrun by Venezuelan gangs that are terrorizing local residents. Officials in those towns have sought to debunk Trump’s assertions.\n\nTrump-Putin Relationship\n\nTrump declined to say if he had spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin since leaving office in 2021, responding to a question about claims laid out in a new book by journalist Bob Woodward.\n\n“Well, I don’t comment on that, but I will tell you that if I did, it’s a smart thing,” Trump said. “If I’m friendly with people, if I have a relationship with people, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. “\n\nWoodward’s book cites an unnamed aide to the former president indicating that he spoke to Putin as many as seven times since leaving office. The Trump campaign has called Woodward’s claim “made-up stories.”\n\nTrump defended their relationship, saying their positive ties were a boon to the US and that he had cultivated connections with the Russian leader even though he had sanctioned the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Europe.\n\nTight Race\n\nTrump and Harris have been ramping up their economic messaging, in particular in the battleground states likely to determine November’s election.\n\nTrump, asked what states he would be watching on election night, suggested Pennsylvania or Michigan — two of the three states that comprise the Democratic Blue Wall crucial to Harris’ proposects — could ultimately prove decisive.\n\n“Based on the votes that are coming in so far, we’re doing very well,” Trump said, pointing to early voting data.\n\nHarris’ entry into the race saw her erase much of the lead Trump held when Biden was atop the Democratic ticket, thanks to a surge in party enthusiasm. But despite a fundraising advantage for Harris that has allowed her to flood the airwaves with advertising and her strong debate performance against Trump, polls show the race tightening again in the final stretch.\n\nThe 2024 race has seen Trump solidify his hold on the Republican party, easily vanquishing his primary opponents despite a slew of legal obstacles that include him being the first former US president convicted of a felony.\n\nWith his base assured, Trump has sought to bolster his electoral appeal, reaching out to core Democratic constituencies such as Black voters and Hispanics — as well as working-class voters and suburban women — uneasy about economic mobility.\n\n(Updates with additional Trump remarks, context throughout)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man How Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium How Airbnb Hosts and Frustrated Neighbors Can Find Common Ground When a Miracle Cure Is Left on the Shelf China Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tesla Fails To Justify The Robotaxi Hype With Concrete Figures",
        "content": "Tesla Fails To Justify The Robotaxi Hype With Concrete Figures\n\nLast week, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi, the star of its next chapter. The Cybercab was revealed at the massive Warner Bros Studios in Burbank, California, known as Hollywood. Like the Cybertruck, Tesla’s robotaxi has a futuristic design, but the “We, Robot” event failed to impress. After the event, Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s net worth went down by $15 billion as he holds about 13% of the company’s shares, but he remains the world’s richest person.\n\nMore Information About The Cybercab\n\nWith production scheduled for some time before 2027, Musk also revealed that the Cybercab, which would compete with rivals including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Waymo, would cost less than $30,000, which is about the same price as its cheaper Model 3 and Model Y.  Moreover, the Cybercab has no plug as it would use inductive charging, one for which Tesla does not currently have infrastructure for, raising many concerns about the cost of making this driverless dream actually happen.\n\nHowever, Musk remains optimistic despite skepticism.\n\nAfter a decade of failing to meet his own deadlines, Musk’s prediction that production of the Cybercab would begin some time \"before 2027” is seen as questionable. Paul Miller from Research Forrester believes it will be extremely difficult for Tesla to offer a new vehicle at that price within that timeframe, which means Tesla would be making a loss on every vehicle.\n\nThe glitzy showcase failed to shake off the feeling that Tesla is losing the race.\n\nThursday was supposed to be the unveiling of Tesla’s new chapter, providing a glimpse of its future built on Musk’s latest driverless dreams. But with Musk’s, history of falling short on promises and Tesla’s past of safety issues, there are many concerns around the Cybercab. Adding to the fact that Alphabet is already operating with Waymo, along with other Chinese firms, Tesla is still far from disrupting the landscape. Many have faltered with automated driving technology when it came to figuring out a profitable business model. For example, it took Google quite some time to scale Waymo. On Thursday, humanoid Optimus robots served drinks and the world got a glimpse of Tesla’s robotaxi fleet, “Cybercab” and “Robovan”, with disappointment in the air. While reasons varied, from not-so-thrilling joyrides in the new vehicles to not-so-self-functioning self-functioning robots and so-on, Tesla failed to impress as it goes up against not only Google and its Waymo, but General Motors (NYSE: GM) and its Cruise autonomous ride-hailing service, as well as Zoox, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN)’s self-driving subsidiary. All in all, the market was probably mostly disappointed because they the dazzling event failed not provide any concrete numbers.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Startup that wants to be the eBay for AI data taps Google vets and a top IP lawyer for key roles",
        "content": "If data is the new oil, a London-based startup is vying to become the equivalent of the New York Mercantile Exchange—a marketplace where AI companies looking for data to train their AI models can strike deals with publishers and other businesses that have data to sell.\n\nThe startup, called Human Native AI, has recently hired a number of prominent former Google executives with experience in striking content licensing deals and partnership as well as top legal eagles experienced in intellectual property and copyright issues.\n\nTo date, companies building the large language models (LLMs) that have powered the generative AI revolution have mostly harvested data, for free, by scraping the public internet, often with little regard for copyright.\n\nBut there are signs this era is rapidly drawing to a close. In the U.S., a number of lawsuits against AI companies for allegedly violating copyright law when training AI models on material taken from the internet without permission are making their way through the courts. While it is possible judges will rule that such activity can be considered “fair use,” companies creating AI models would rather not risk being tied up in court for years.\n\nIn Europe, the new EU AI Act mandates that companies disclose if they trained AI models on copyrighted material, potentially opening companies up to legal action there too.\n\nAI companies have already been striking deals with major publishers and news organizations to license data for both training and to make sure their models have access to up-to-date, accurate information. OpenAI signed a three-year licensing deal with publisher Axel Springer, which owns Business Insider, Politico, and a number of German news organizations, reportedly worth \"tens of millions of dollars.\" It has also signed deals with the Financial Times, The Atlantic, and Time magazine. Google has similar deals with many publishers. Fortune has a licensing agreement with generative AI startup Perplexity.\n\nStartups may have trouble securing business insurance if their data gathering practices potentially expose them to legal risk, providing another incentive for many of these companies to license the data they need.\n\nScraping data is also becoming more difficult from a technical standpoint as many businesses have begun using technical means to try to prevent bots from scraping their data. Some artists have also begun applying special digital masks to images they post online that can corrupt AI models trained from this data without permission.\n\nIn addition, the largest large language models (LLMs)—the type of AI that powers OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude—have already ingested the entire internet’s worth of publicly available data. Meanwhile, training effective smaller AI models, especially those designed for special purposes, such as helping lawyers draft specific types of contracts, scientists design new drugs, or engineers create blueprints, requires curated datasets of high-quality information pertaining to that task. Very little of this kind of specialized data is available on the public internet, so it can only be obtained through licensing arrangements.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s why James Smith, a veteran Google and Google DeepMind engineer and product manager, decided to cofound Human Native with Jack Galilee, a software engineer who worked on machine learning systems at medical technology company Grail. “We were wondering why there was not an easy way for companies to acquire the data they needed to train AI models,” Smith, now Human Native’s CEO, said.\n\nEven when AI companies wanted to source data ethically and legally, it was often difficult, he said, for them to find out who held what data, and then figure out who at that company to speak to in order to strike a licensing deal. The time currently required to negotiate such deals could also be an impediment for fast-moving AI model developers—with some taking the view that if they took the time to do the right thing, they risked falling behind rivals commercially, he said.\n\nHuman Native intends to be a digital marketplace that will enable those who need data for AI systems to easily connect with those who have it and to strike a deal using relatively standardized legal contracts. In June, it raised a $3.6 million seed round led by London-based venture capital firms LocalGlobe and Mercuri to begin to make good on that vision. It also counts among its advisors entrepreneur, AI developer, and musician Ed Newton-Rex, who headed the audio team at genAI company Stability AI, but has since emerged as a prominent critic of AI companies' disregard for copyright.\n\nThe startup is among just a handful of companies offering data brokering services. And even Human Native is only in the early stages of setting up its market, with a beta version of the platform currently available to select customers. Human Native plans to make money in several ways, including taking a commission on the transactions it brokers, as well as offering tools to help customers clean up datasets and implement data governance policies. The company has not disclosed if it is currently making any revenue from its nascent platform.\n\nOthers already offering data for sale to AI companies include Nomad Data and data analytics platform Snowflake. But Human Native may soon face more competition. For instance, Matthew Prince, the founder and CEO of the computing company Cloudflare, has talked about creating a similar marketplace for AI data.\n\nTo work, Human Native needs to build a critical mass of buyers and sellers on its platform, and create those standardized contract terms. Which is where the startup’s recent hiring of some well-pedigreed experts from the worlds of digital partnerships and IP law comes in.\n\nThe hires include Madhav Chinnappa, who spent a decade working for the rights and development department at the BBC and then spent 13 years at Google running the search giant’s partnerships with news organizations, who is now Human Native’s vice president of partnerships; Tim Palmer, a veteran of Disney and Google, where he also spent 13 years, mostly working on product partnerships, who is now advising on partnerships and business development for Human Native; and Matt Hervey, a former partner at the international law firm Growling WLG who co-chaired the AI subcommittee of the American Intellectual Property Law Association and edited a new book on the legal issues surrounding AI. Hervey is now Human Native’s head of legal and policy.\n\nBoth Palmer and Chinnappa were let go from Google during its large round of lay-offs in the summer of 2024, highlighting the extent to which that tech giant’s belt tightening has resulted in the loss of experienced employees who are now helping to grow a new generation of startups.\n\n“Human Native is focused on what is maybe the most interesting problem in tech right now,” Palmer told me, explaining why he was interested in helping the nascent data marketplace. He said that while lawsuits represented one attempt to establish rules for how AI companies can use data, commercial licensing represented a more productive approach.\n\nPalmer said his experience at Google acquiring content means he has “a good idea of what is out there and who has what content and who are the professional licensors and a good sense of what is acceptable and what is not” as far as licensing terms.\n\nChinnappa said he sees Human Native as helping to level the playing field, especially for smaller publishers’ and rights holders, who he says might otherwise get frozen out of any deal with AI companies.\n\n“I helped write the playbook for this when I was at Google, and what you do [if you are Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, or one of the other big AI model companies] is you do a minimum number of big deals with big media companies,” he said.\n\nHuman Native may be able to help smaller publishers find ways to monetize their data by helping to pool data from multiple publishers into packages that will be large enough, or tailored enough, to interest AI model makers, he said.\n\nHervey said that Human Native could play a major role in helping to establish norms and standardized contracts for data licensing for AI. “The broader piece here is not about the law but market practice and the amazing opportunity we have to influence market practice,” he said.\n\nPalmer said it would take time for Human Native to be able to create a technology platform that makes purchasing data for AI models truly seamless. “It is not eBay yet,” he said. “It’s not a zero human touch proposition.”\n\nFor now, while Human Native’s own staff is working to source datasets for AI companies, realizing that it needs a critical mass of both buyers and sellers on its platform for it to function. And, once it has facilitated a match between a data seller and an AI model company, the startup’s staff is also having to do a lot of work with both to help them strike a deal.\n\nHervey said that some of the commercial terms will always be bespoke, and that Human Native wants to be able to support bespoke licensing arrangements, as well as working to try to standardize licensing terms.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "OpenAI’s lead over other AI companies has largely vanished, ‘State of AI’ report finds",
        "content": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI. In this edition…AI's fast-falling cost…Google goes nuclear…LLMs may be dumber than you think…and a filmmaker burned by genAI backlash.\n\nEvery year for the past seven, Nathan Benaich, the founder and solo general partner at the early-stage AI investment firm Air Street Capital, has produced a magisterial “State of AI” report. Benaich and his collaborators marshal an impressive array of data to provide a great snapshot of the technology’s evolving capabilities, the landscape of companies developing it, a survey of how AI is being deployed, and a critical examination of the challenges still facing the field.\n\nOpenAI's lead mostly vanishes\n\nOne of the big takeaways from this year’s report, which was published late last week, is that OpenAI’s lead over other AI labs has largely eroded. Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google’s Gemini 1.5, X’s Grok 2, and even Meta’s open-source Llama 3.1 405 B model have equaled, or narrowly surpassed on some benchmarks, OpenAI’s GPT-4o.\n\nBut, on the other hand, OpenAI still retains an edge for the moment on reasoning tasks with the release of its o1 “Strawberry” model—which Air Street’s report rightly characterized as a weird mix of incredibly strong logical abilities for some tasks, and surprisingly weak ones for others. (For more on the fragility of o1’s reasoning abilities, see the “Research” section below.)\n\nInference costs fall rapidly\n\nAnother big takeaway, Benaich told me, is the extent to which the cost of using a trained AI model—an activity known as \"inference\"—is falling rapidly. There are several reasons for this. One is linked to that first big takeaway: With models less differentiated from one another on capabilities and performance, companies are forced to compete on price.\n\nAnother reason is that engineers for companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic—and their hyperscaler partners Microsoft and AWS, respectively—are discovering ways to optimize how the largest models run on big GPU clusters. The cost of outputs from OpenAI’s GPT-4o today is 100-times less per token (which is about equivalent to 1.5 words) than it was for GPT-4 when that model debuted in March 2023. Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro now costs 76% less per output token than it did when that model was launched in February 2024.\n\nAI researchers have also become good at creating small AI models that can equal the performance of larger LLMs on dialogue, summarization, or even coding, while being much cheaper to run. Taken together, these two trends mean that the economics of implementing AI-based solutions are starting to look much more attractive than they did a year ago. This may ultimately help businesses find the return on investment from generative AI that they have complained has been elusive so far.\n\nStory continues\n\nRobotics makes a come back\n\nAnother key trend Benaich picks up on is how robotics is coming back into vogue, with robotics companies marrying LLMs and new “world models” to existing tech to make significant progress in making robots more capable and easier (as well as cheaper) to deploy and customize.\n\nBenaich’s State of AI report always ends with some bold predictions for the year ahead (and Benaich grades himself each year on how he’s done.) Among the things he got right last year: that a Hollywood production would make use of genAI models for visual effects and that there would be limited progress on international AI governance efforts. Among those he got wrong: that a company would spend more than $1 billion training a single LLM.\n\nThis year, among the report's predictions, are that an open source alternative to OpenAI’s o1 will surpass it across a range of benchmarks and that a $10 billion investment from a sovereign state into a U.S. AI company will cause the U.S. government to institute a national security review. We’ll check back next year to see how Benaich did.\n\nFortune Brainstorm AI takes the pulse of a fast-changing industry\n\nThe State of AI report is not the only way to find a fantastic overview of what’s happening in AI. Another great place to gain a vantage point on AI’s rapidly evolving landscape and find out how AI is impacting business is Fortune’s upcoming Brainstorm AI conference in San Francisco. This must-attend annual event is coming up on December 9 and 10, held at the St. Regis Hotel.\n\nThis year’s conference will include conversations with, among many others: Amazon’s head scientist for artificial general intelligence, Rohit Prasad, who will update us on how the Everything Store is trying to ensure it doesn’t get left behind in the race to build superpowerful—and super useful—AI; Liz Reid, Google’s vice president of search, who will discuss the future of Google’s signature product in an AI world; Christopher Young, Microsoft’s executive vice president of business development, strategy, and ventures, who will discuss how the tech giant is trying to see around corners to what is coming next for AI; Daniela Braga, the founder and CEO of Defined.ai who will tell us what it really takes to build AI models that work for customers; and Colin Kaepernick, former Super Bowl quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers and current founder and CEO of Lumi, a company that builds AI-powered tools for content creators, who will speak about his own transformation from professional athlete to entrepreneur, and what AI may mean for influencers, brands, and beyond.\n\nI’ll be there, of course, helping to cochair the discussion with a gaggle of ultra-talented colleagues. I hope you will all consider joining me! And I’m very excited to be able to offer Eye on AI readers a special discounted rate—20% off the regular price of attendance!

        "content": "Google Parent Alphabet Should Trade At A Premium Versus Peers: Analyst\n\nBofA Securities analyst Justin Post maintained a Buy rating on Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) with a price target of $206.\n\nThe analyst writes that Google patent Alphabet is well positioned long term with leading AI technology to apply to search, YouTube, and Cloud businesses.\n\nAs per Post, Alphabet should also benefit from increasing mobile usage, video usage, Google Play activity, and connected device activity (including autos).\n\nAlso Read: What’s Going On With Oklo Stock Tuesday?\n\nThe analyst writes that Alphabet should trade at a premium to a media peer group, given technology leadership, high margins, and strong cash flow generation for buybacks.\n\nThe price target reflects 22 times 2025 core Google GAAP EPS plus cash per share. Alphabet has traded at an average multiple of 22 times GAAP P/E over the last ten years, and Post noted that his multiple is reasonable compared to history, given expectations for double-digit revenue growth, Cloud margin expansion, and the opportunity to capitalize on strong AI assets.\n\nPost noted a higher probability of new disclosures with a new CFO, but more likely on the December call.\n\nThe third-quarter potential positives included Search strength suggesting AI drives higher monetization, positive commentary on Al overviews driving higher usage or new advertising opportunities, YouTube benefit from political spending and brand stabilization, and Cloud strength from strong AI demand and capacity constraints at competitors.\n\nThere is potential for the company to “surprise” with further self-help cost-cutting actions after limited layoffs in 2024.\n\nMoreover, with an attractive core valuation despite big AI assets, he noted that many concerns are already priced “in” the stock. While the analyst doesn’t anticipate significant multiple expansion given regulatory overhangs, he noted that the stock can appreciate with earnings growth.\n\nAlphabet is scheduled to report third-quarter results on October 29 after market close. Post expects revenue of $72.7 billion versus the Street consensus of $72.8 billion and EPS of $1.86 against the Street consensus of $1.85.\n\nThe analyst projects third-quarter revenues of $49.4 billion for Search (slightly above Street at $49.1 billion). For YouTube, he projected revenue of $8.82 billion and for Cloud at $10.9 billion, both in line with Street.\n\nPrice Action: GOOGL stock is up 0.64% at $166.01 at last check Tuesday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nSam Altman’s Oklo Jumps On Google Nuclear Deal: What’s Going On?\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for GOOGL\n\nDate Firm Action From To Feb 2022 MKM Partners Maintains Buy Feb 2022 Mizuho Maintains Buy Feb 2022 Piper Sandler Maintains Overweight\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for GOOGL\n\nStory continues\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google redesigned its shopping website to better match consumers with merchant storefronts, seeking to distinguish the platform from e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Inside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City\n\nThe updated shopping experience largely revolves around scrollable feeds akin to a social media app. A new home page will display a personalized feed of products, reviews and auto-playing video shorts from Google’s YouTube. A Deals page will host a similar curated feed of discounted items.\n\nOn Google Search, shopping-related queries will return artificial intelligence-generated blurbs explaining important factors to consider for specific merchandise, like the type of material of a jacket meant for a wet climate. The features will initially be available in the US.\n\nThe redesign is the company’s latest move to keep users on Google’s platform longer when researching anything from recipes to flights, rather than immediately diverting them to external websites. In May, the company introduced AI Overviews, which summarize the contents of search results, a feature some critics argue could reduce clicks through to websites that earn ad revenue from visits.\n\nUnlike the digital marketplaces of fellow technology giants Amazon and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Google Shopping doesn’t sell or ship products; it just shows customers where they can buy items.\n\n“We see ourselves playing a different role” than Amazon, Maria Renz, Google vice president and general manager of commerce, said in an interview prior to the announcement. “Google has always been about promoting a healthy ecosystem.”\n\nShoppers can fully research a potential purchase without ever leaving Google’s variety of websites — from viewing suggested items on Google Shopping to watching product review videos on YouTube to locating brick-and-mortar sellers on Google Maps.\n\nBut the company’s suite of heavily integrated products could be at risk. After a landmark antitrust ruling found Google illegally monopolized the search market, the US Justice Department is considering calling for a breakup that could spin off major parts of the company’s portfolio, including the Chrome internet browser and the Android operating system.\n\nGoogle hasn’t considered directly challenging e-commerce storefronts by handling payment and shipping within Google Shopping, executives said.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Since we don’t have inventory, we don’t take payment, we don’t ship anything — we’re also not trying to maximize profit on a per product basis,” Sean Scott, vice president and general manager of consumer shopping at Google, said in an interview. Scott calls that a “unique advantage.”\n\nRegarding the ability to check out and pay on Google Shopping, “I would never say never,” Scott said. “We’re just trying to help connect consumers with merchants.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man How Airbnb Hosts and Frustrated Neighbors Can Find Common Ground How Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium China Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space Inside the Companies That Set Sports Gambling Odds\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Google is adding nuclear plants to its seemingly ever-growing portfolio. The company has partnered with Kairos Power to back the construction of seven small nuclear reactors in the U.S. It’s the first agreement of its kind.\n\nThe first plant is expected to come online by 2030, the company announced in a blog post. Other reactors will be deployed by 2035. All totaled, the deal will funnel 500 megawatts of power to the company’s AI technologies—enough to power a midsize city.\n\n“Nuclear solutions offer a clean, round-the-clock power source that can help us reliably meet electricity demands with carbon-free energy every hour of every day,” Google wrote in the blog post. “Advancing these power sources in close partnership with supportive local communities will rapidly drive the decarbonization of electricity grids around the world.”\n\nThe smaller reactors created by Kairos, a nuclear-energy startup, are different from the towers most people think of when they conjure up an image of a nuclear reactor. The company uses a molten salt cooling system (much like the one that will be used for the on-site reactor being built on the campus of Abilene Christian University), which operates at a lower pressure. The company broke ground on a demonstration reactor, which will be unpowered, earlier this year in Tennessee.\n\nGoogle did not unveil the cost of the partnership. The project site (or sites) have not yet been determined.\n\nGoogle’s announcement comes weeks after Microsoftannounced a partnership with Constellation Energy that will see the undamaged reactor at Three Mile Island, the site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history, resume operations to power Microsoft’s AI data centers.\n\nExperts have warned data centers could become a big strain on the U.S. power grid, with the nine-year projected growth forecast for North America essentially doubling from where it stood a year ago. Last year, the five-year forecast from Grid Strategies projected growth of 2.6%. That number has since nearly doubled to 4.7%—and planners expect peak demand to grow by 38 gigawatts. In real-world terms, that’s sufficient to power 12.7 million homes.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is giving its Google Shopping page an AI upgrade. The shopping site will now include AI-powered summaries powered by the company's Gemini AI model that offer tips on how to shop for the best option for the product you’re shopping for. It will also get new personalized results and personalized deals pages.\n\nGoogle says the AI summaries will appear in a new module near the top of the screen just below the sponsored products list and provide information like what kind of features to look for when shopping for products and why.\n\nIf shopping for a kettle for making matcha tea, for example, the AI summaries box will tell you that you should look for kettles with a gooseneck spout for controlled pouring and precise temperature controls. Below that, you’ll see a number of recommendations for products that include bits of information from those AI summaries.\n\nIn the tea kettle example, Google Shopping highlighted things like \"gooseneck\" and \"temperature control\" found in the recommended products' descriptions, making it easier to understand why Google suggested those options. Google Shopping is getting an AI upgrade. (Google) (Google)\n\nIn another example, of a person searching for the best men’s winter jacket for the Pacific Northwest, the AI recommendation feature explained that coats that offer both warmth and water resistance are best for the region’s famously rainy weather.\n\nGoogle says users shop more than 1 billion times per day using Google, making this a massive opportunity for Google to prove that its AI upgrades are worthwhile for everyday users.\n\nIn addition to the AI recommendations, Google says it’s adding a personalized shopping feed to the Google Shopping homepage based on products that users have previously shown an interest in. Google says personalized recommendations can also be turned off via Google Shopping's settings menu.\n\nThe Deals page, meanwhile, will include personalized deals for products and goods.\n\nIn addition to Google Shopping, Google has added its Gemini models to its main Google Search product via its AI Overviews feature, as well as a number of its Android apps for smartphones. But it hasn’t been easy going for the company. In May, Google faced considerable backlash, and plenty of mockery, when users found that AI Overviews told them they could eat rocks and put glue on their pizzas. Google Shopping is also getting a personalized page for products you might be interested in. (Google) (Google)\n\nGoogle responded by scaling back its rollout to address the issues and ensure the feature doesn’t surface unreliable information.\n\nGoogle’s updates come as the company seeks to monetize its vast investments in generative AI technologies. In the second quarter, Google’s parent company Alphabet reported spending $2.2 billion building AI models across its DeepMind and Google Research organizations. That's up from $1.1 billion in Q2 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle isn’t the only company pouring money into generative AI. Microsoft (MSFT) has famously spent billions to team up with OpenAI, while Amazon (AMZN) is investing heavily in Anthropic. Meta is also dumping money into its AI programs, building out its own Llama family of AI models.\n\nThe Big Tech firms are racing to be the first to reach general artificial intelligence, or artificial intelligence that can rival or outperform your average person. But it will take years and billions of dollars more before they get there, if they ever do. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.

        "content": "google\n\nGoogle has struck a deal to buy the world’s first private mini-nuclear reactors, as technology companies race to secure power for their data centres.\n\nThe US search engine giant has ordered a fleet of small modular reactors (SMRs) from California’s Kairos Power, with each mini-nuke capable of generating 500 megawatts (MW) of low-carbon electricity.\n\nCalifornia-based Kairos said its first commercial reactor will come online by 2030, with additional reactors operational by 2035.\n\nGoogle’s decision to embrace nuclear comes as the expansion of AI increases the tech sector’s energy requirements.\n\nMichael Terrell, senior director for energy and climate at Google, said: “The grid needs new electricity sources to support AI technologies that are powering major scientific advances, improving services for businesses and customers, and driving national competitiveness and economic growth.\n\n“This agreement helps accelerate a new technology to meet energy needs cleanly and reliably, and unlock the full potential of AI for everyone.”\n\nHe added: “Nuclear solutions offer a clean, round-the-clock power source that can help us reliably meet electricity demands with carbon-free energy every hour of every day.”\n\nThis latest acquisition comes after Microsoft agreed last month to buy at least 20 years of energy generated by a power plant in Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe plant, which is home to the worst nuclear accident in America’s history, will be reopened in 2028 as part of the deal. Microsoft will buy decades of power from a nuclear site on Three Mile Island to meet the huge energy needs of AI - JIM LO SCALZO/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nThis followed an agreement struck by Amazon in March to buy a 960MW nuclear-powered data centre from Talen Energy, also in Pennsylvania, for $650m (£498m).\n\nSMRs are viewed as a promising solution for decarbonising heavy industrial operations while providing a stable power source. The reactors are factory-made and assembled on-site.\n\nIn the UK, Rolls-Royce is among the companies seeking to expand in the SMR space by developing a design it hopes to sell globally.\n\nHowever, its mini nuclear reactor business posted a £78m loss last week while awaiting the outcome of a delayed UK tender competition.\n\nEach of Rolls’s mini nuclear reactors is eventually expected to sell for between £2bn and £3bn.",

        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) closed the most recent trading day at $166.39, moving +1.14% from the previous trading session. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.77%.

        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) closed the latest trading day at $164.95, indicating a +1.05% change from the previous session's end. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.77%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.47%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.87%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the internet search leader had gained 3.67% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 6.36% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.87% in that time.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Alphabet in its upcoming release. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $1.83, marking a 18.06% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $72.77 billion, reflecting a 13.61% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $7.64 per share and a revenue of $292.3 billion, indicating changes of +31.72% and +13.95%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Alphabet. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.07% higher. Alphabet presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, Alphabet is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 21.37. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 36.79, so one might conclude that Alphabet is trading at a discount comparatively.\n\nWe can also see that GOOGL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.22. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As the market closed yesterday, the Internet - Services industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.3.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 101, placing it within the top 41% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups.

        "content": "Robotaxis are among the most interesting and transformative technological innovations we are currently witnessing. They are already on the roads, and several firms are competing for dominance, though Google parent Alphabet’s GOOG Waymo is currently far ahead of the competition.\n\nTesla's Cybercab: Sleek Design, Missing Details\n\nLast week, Elon Musk unveiled Tesla’s TSLA Robotaxi, which is expected to cost less than $30,000 and begin production \"probably\" in 2026. However, few details have been provided about the business model, and the service still seems to be a long way off.\n\nThe ultimate goal for Robotaxi companies is to achieve Level 5 autonomy, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)—where vehicles can operate anywhere, anytime, without human input.\n\nCurrently, Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is at Level 2, or Partial Automation, which always requires active driver supervision. In contrast, Waymo operates at Level 4, or High Automation, but only in specific areas.\n\nAlphabet’s Waymo Surges Ahead\n\nWaymo, which began as Google’s self-driving car project 15 years ago, has been operating a Robotaxi service in Phoenix since 2018 and has expanded to San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nIt currently provides more than 100,000 paid Robotaxi rides per week, double the number announced in May. Google recently announced plans to invest an additional $5 billion into Waymo.\n\nWaymo vs. Tesla: Autonomy Comparison\n\nWaymo uses multiple sensor modalities, including lidar, radar, and cameras. According to some autonomy experts, lidar sensors can directly capture accurate 3D depth measurements, while Tesla's cameras provide only 2D information.\n\nWaymo also uses high-definition (HD) maps for localization, whereas Tesla does not, aiming instead for a more generalized solution that would allow its robotaxis to drive anywhere.\n\nOther Players to Watch\n\nUber UBER emerged as a big winner after Tesla’s Robotaxi event. The company, with 156 million monthly active platform customers, per WSJ, has partnered with several Robotaxi operators.\n\nZoox, which was acquired by Amazon AMZN four years back, plans to launch a Robotaxi service in Las Vegas later this year.\n\nAI giant NVIDIA NVDA provides an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles and is also creating digital twins of cities and simulated driving environments to train cars to handle unexpected and potentially dangerous situations.\n\nTo learn more, please watch the short video above.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia and other chip stocks surge with no sign of AI spending slowdown — for now",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NVDA) record close on Monday comes as AI hardware stocks continue a recent tear fueled by investor enthusiasm over surging artificial intelligence demand.\n\nNvidia shares are up 8% from last week, pushing the chipmaker closer to unseating Apple (AAPL) as Wall Street's most valuable company. The stock's rally follows recent comments from CEO Jensen Huang and the chipmaker's partners touting an intense need for its AI chips.\n\nOther AI chip and hardware stocks Arm (ARM), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Astera Labs (ALAB) and Micron (MU) have risen, too, as the companies have given separate indications of strong demand for their products thanks to the AI boom. TSMC (TSM) stock also closed at a record high Monday.\n\nAll in all, the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) is up 4.7% over the past five days, outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which rose 3% over the same time frame.\n\nThe upward trajectory of AI chip stocks is a positive sign for AI hardware spending that assuages Wall Street’s concerns of a near-term slowdown on investment.\n\n\"While Phase 2 stocks [i.e. AI-infrastructure related stocks such as Arm, TSMC, and SMCI] appear modestly expensive relative to history, it is possible that the demand for AI leads the mega-cap tech stocks to spend even more on AI-related capex than investors and analysts currently expect,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in their report on Oct. 10.\n\nGoogle (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) have all indicated that they will continue to spend large sums on AI infrastructure through next year, to the benefit of AI hardware companies, led by Nvidia. As a whole, mega-cap tech stocks are set to spend $215 billion on AI capital expenditures in 2024 and $250 billion in 2025, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nOpenAI’s recent $6.6 billion funding round is also expected to put cash in the hands of hardware companies — namely Nvidia — as it continues evolving its AI models. People visit the booth for Nvidia during the Apsara Conference 2024 of Alibaba Cloud in China in Sept. 2024. (Photo credit should read LONG WEI / Feature China/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (Feature China via Getty Images)\n\nJPMorgan (JPM) analyst Harlan Sur sees revenues for the semiconductor industry growing 6% to 8% in 2024. “We remain positive on semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks,” he said in a recent note to investors, “as we believe stocks should continue to move higher in anticipation of better supply/demand in 2H24/25 and stable/rising earnings power trends in CY24/25.”\n\nA slowdown in investment will eventually come, though. The question is when.\n\nWhereas AI software is typically offered on a subscription basis, hardware is a one-time sale. Analysts have warned that AI chip stocks are in a bubble that will eventually burst once Big Tech’s massive spending on AI infrastructure eases.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, tech giants' most recent earnings reports put on display a widening gap between their hefty spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure and their return on investment — and tested Wall Street’s thinning patience. The stocks of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon all fell late this summer following their quarterly financial reports, which showed billions in AI spending.\n\n“We continue to believe that spending on data center infrastructure will be strong this year and possibly into next year,” DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an email, “but that there is an eventual peak of capex spending by the hyperscalers, as early as next [calendar] year.”\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "NEW YORK, Oct. 14, 2024 Investment firm Baird believes Google's (GOOG, Financial) operating income and earnings per share (EPS) estimates will likely be at risk due to rising capital expenditures (capex) for data center and infrastructure expansion. Analyst Colin Sebastian cautioned that these operational expenses are likely to weigh down the company's Q4 results, which are set to be reported later in the month.\n\nHowever, Google's shares rose 1.2% in midday trading Monday despite the relatively concerning comments from Baird. Sebastian noted that the ramp-up in capex for infrastructure could potentially lead to lower-than-expected GAAP operating margins for Q4 and 2025. He warned of a potential \"sell-side reset\" in consensus forecasts leading to Q4. Additionally, analysts expect Alphabet, Google's parent company, to post earnings of $1.84 per share on $86.23 billion in revenue when it reports its operating results later this year.\n\nOn a more positive note, though, Sebastian acknowledged that revenue gains from AI and generative AI products and services could offset those cost pressures. Baird maintains an Outperform rating on Alphabet with a $200 price target, signaling sustained confidence in the tech giant's growth prospects.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "DOJ Targets Google for Antitrust Violations, Proposes Breakup of Search Giant",
        "content": "The Department of Justice said last week that it plans to require Alphabet's (GOOGL, Financial) Google unit to divest a portion of its businesses as part of a broader, unprecedented lawsuit that targets alleged illegal behavior in the online search market. This was reportedly done after a federal judge in August determined that Google has indeed been forming an illegal monopoly over 90% of internet searches.\n\nThe DOJ's move could have wide-ranging implications for how Americans search and cripple Google by cutting off its most significant revenue stream in the US, which may help its competitors to power. In response to allegations of monopoly, the Justice Department could ask for a court injunction ordering Google to sell off its Chrome browser and Android operating system as well as strike financial agreements by which Google pays device-level licenses so that it won't be installed on newly made equipment. It would also force Google to let rivals access search data.\n\nGoogle's AI advancements are facing more scrutiny and could be subject to stricter regulations limiting the company from restricting rivals' access to crucial content. The DOJ also wants to give websites the ability to block Google from using their content for training AI models, which it posits would ultimately create a fairer competitive landscape.\n\nIn response, Google slammed the DOJ's overarching approach in a blog post and cautioned of possible unintended consequences for consumers, businesses, and American competitiveness. It underscored its heavy payments, in particular the $26.3 billion it paid last year to Apple (AAPL, Financial) and others who could make them the preferred search engine, a key component for continuing to dominate. Monosoff said that this strategy works in their favor as people are not all aware of other good options out there or because newcomers appear like set-up competitors. The developing legal challenge highlights a pivotal moment for tech industry regulation and competition.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Timothy Gardner\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google said on Monday it signed the world's first corporate agreement to buy power from multiple small modular reactors as the technology company looks to meet electricity demand from artificial intelligence.\n\nThe agreement with Kairos Power aims to bring Kairos' first small modular reactor online by 2030, followed by additional deployments through 2035.\n\nThe companies did not reveal financial details of the agreement or where in the U.S. the plants would be built. Google said it has agreed to buy 500 megawatts of power from six to seven reactors, which is smaller than the output of today's nuclear reactors.\n\n\"We feel like nuclear can play an important role in helping to meet our demand ... cleanly in a way that's more around the clock,\" Michael Terrell, senior director for energy and climate at Google, told reporters on a call.\n\nTechnology firms have signed several recent agreements with nuclear power companies this year as artificial intelligence boosts power demand for the first time in decades.\n\nIn March, Amazon.com purchased a nuclear-powered datacenter from Talen Energy. Last month, Microsoft and Constellation Energy signed a power deal to help resurrect a unit of the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, the site of the worst U.S. nuclear accident in 1979.\n\nU.S. data center power use is expected to roughly triple between 2023 and 2030 and will require about 47 gigawatts of new generation capacity, according to Goldman Sachs estimates, which assumed natural gas, wind and solar power would fill the gap.\n\nThe Google deal will depend on Kairos getting full permitting from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and local agencies.\n\nKairos late last year got a construction permit from the NRC to build a demonstration reactor in Tennessee. But Kairos needs design and construction permits from the NRC for the reactors in the deal announced on Monday.\n\nSmall modular reactors are intended to be smaller than today's reactors with components built in a factory, instead of onsite, to help cut construction costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nCritics say SMRs will be expensive because they may not be able to achieve the economy of scale of larger plants. In addition, they will likely produce long-lasting nuclear waste for which the country does not yet have a final repository.\n\nGoogle said by committing to a so-called order book framework with Kairos, instead of buying one reactor at a time, it is sending a demand signal to the market and making a long-term investment to speed development of SMRs.\n\n\"We're confident that this novel approach is going to improve the prospects of our projects being delivered on cost and on schedule,\" said Mike Laufer, CEO and co-founder of Kairos.\n\n(Reporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by Bill Berkrot)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google is investing in the development of the next generation of nuclear power, backing a company that’s building small modular reactors and agreeing to purchase energy once the sites start supplying US grids.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure How Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts\n\nGoogle signed an agreement with Kairos Power to construct a series of so-called SMRs that use molten-salt cooling technology. The move is part of an effort to bring online new carbon-free electricity as the company builds out data centers in the next decade, said Michael Terrell, senior director of energy and climate at Google. Power supplies are expected to start between 2030 and 2035.\n\nThe deal, which will back 500 megawatts of power, includes Kairos’s 50-megawatt demonstration Hermes project in Tennessee, followed by commercial scale reactors sized at 75 megawatts, the companies said.\n\nBig technology companies are racing to line up power supplies for the massive data centers needed to run artificial intelligence systems. Surging demand for power is prompting utilities to build more natural gas-fired plants, undermining lofty environmental goals for both the industry and tech firms. It’s also driving up interest in nuclear plants that deliver clean energy at all hours.\n\n“We are looking for net new clean power,” Terrell said. “We are not looking to repurpose existing clean power.”\n\nTerrell described the Kairos agreement as the first of its kind, which includes power offtake on multiple SMRs, in an effort to kick start the development of the technology.He spoke during a virtual media roundtable on Monday.\n\nBoth Google and Kairos Power declined to comment on any financial terms or the structure of the deal.\n\nThe companies are still determining whether any projects will host two or more reactors.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man How Airbnb Hosts and Frustrated Neighbors Can Find Common Ground China Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space Inside the Companies That Set Sports Gambling Odds Jamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary: The Idea That Never Fades\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other Most Promising Growth Stock According to Hedge Funds.\n\nBull Market and Investor Sentiment\n\nInvestors had been anxiously anticipating the start of a bull market, which the S&P 500 confirmed earlier this year. The bull run has seen the market continue to rise to new record highs, supporting revenue and earnings growth across the board.\n\nFast forward, the upward momentum appears to have peaked, with market indices at record highs. While it was highly expected that stocks would explode on the Federal Reserve offering support to a struggling economy with interest rate cuts, that has not been the case.\n\nREAD ALSO: David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy and 7 Best Nanotech Penny Stocks to Buy.\n\nIt’s become increasingly clear that investors have become more sensitive to growth scares as the global economy faces many issues. Top on the list is the rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that threaten to disrupt supply chain networks. Energy prices rising owing to the escalation of a full-blown war could trigger higher inflation, something that is unsettling the markets.\n\nAnalysts at UBS are already warning investors that they should get overweight on defensive names as global growth slows at the back of deteriorating fundamentals. While UBS doesn’t anticipate a severe downturn, the bank is cautious, advising its clients to focus on important sectors like utilities and pharmaceuticals, which always outperform in a downturn.\n\nWhile investors are increasingly rotating into defensive plays amid concerns about geopolitical tensions and the slowing global economy, Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s Andrew Slimmon recommends against this strategy.\n\n“Now is the time to just be cautious. Don’t chase the defensives that are working because I think when we get to the fourth quarter, that won’t work,” the portfolio manager told CNBC’s “The Exchange.\n\n“While our expectation is for October to remain choppy, we don’t view the overall market action to be bearish and encourage investors to maintain perspective on the longer-term trends,” Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, wrote to clients.\n\nThe sentiments echo the need to focus on high-growth companies. Investors who diversify their portfolio into high-growth companies eventually earn great returns regardless of how much a stock rises or falls in the short term.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts project that S&P 500 stocks will grow at a median annual EPS rate of 8.5% over the next five years. On the other hand, the best growth stocks are well poised to outperform this benchmark by a factor of two to three or more.\n\nFor starters, companies exposed to artificial intelligence spectacles or those leveraging technology continue to deliver record earnings and revenue growth, thus dominating most hedge fund portfolios. Additionally, the most promising growth stocks, according to hedge funds, are those whose core business would be positively impacted by improving consumer purchasing power. As the Fed steers the economy into a soft landing, consumer purchasing is expected to improve, benefiting consumer cyclical stocks. Moreover, the rate cuts will likely benefit growth and tech stocks as well.\n\nMarket fluctuations are inevitable, but the secret to a growth stock’s success lies in the robustness of its core operations. Regardless of whether a stock is rising or falling in the short term, if you consistently invest in a competitively solid business, you’ll eventually reap substantial rewards.\n\nPhoto by Kai Wenzel on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the most promising growth stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to find 30 popular growth stocks. Then we selected the 10 that were the most widely held by hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), a global tech titan, has made a name for itself on a search that continues to power its lucrative advertising business. While the company controls a 90% market share in search, it remains well-positioned to generate significant value as the digital advertising industry grows by more than 15%  through the rest of the decade.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) owns the largest video platform, YouTube, the top streaming service in daily TV viewership. As more families opt to cancel their conventional cable plans in favor of the more affordable and more accessible nature of streaming services, YouTube is expected to attract more viewers. This, in turn, will result in increased advertising income for the company.\n\nThe ad sales from YouTube brought in $8.7 billion for Alphabet in the second quarter, showing a growth from the $7.7 billion seen in the year before and affirming why it is one of the most promising growth stocks according to hedge funds.\n\nOn the other hand, Google Cloud ranks as the third most popular cloud service globally, just after Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Google Cloud reported a 29% increase in revenue from the previous year in the second quarter. Moreover, it achieved $1.2 billion in operating income, achieving a profit margin of 11%.\n\nThe operating margin for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has consistently been outstanding, averaging a remarkable 26.6%. Its substantial earnings allowed Alphabet to produce an impressive $13.5 billion free cash flow (FCF) during the second quarter. The firm is utilizing this FCF to fund its artificial intelligence technology and benefit its investors by buying back shares and distributing a $0.20 dividend. Analysts on Wall Street maintain a buy rating on Alphabet with an average price target of $206.60, implying 26.77% upside potential.\n\nAs per the Insider Monkey database, 216 hedge fund portfolios held Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) at the end of the second quarter, which was 222 in the previous quarter.\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Goldman Sachs has adjusted its ratings on several digital advertising companies ahead of the Q3 2024 earnings season.\n\nIn a recent note, the firm highlights that Q3 digital ad trends remained robust, with notable strength in areas like digital video and retail media networks. However, challenges such as tougher year-over-year (YoY) comparisons and evolving ad pricing dynamics are influencing performance across the sector.\n\n“Certain platforms/channels are beginning to face tougher YoY comps in terms of ad impression growth, particularly in short-form video,” Goldman analysts said.\n\nMeanwhile, ad pricing trends remain strong overall, especially for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Analysts believe this could boost ad revenue growth momentum for the social media giant in the second half of 2024. However, they also note growing interest among advertisers “in widening out their budget allocation to mid-sized and emerging platforms in search of relatively more attractive Return On Advertising Spend (ROAS).”\n\nAs for the rating changes, Goldman upgraded Ibotta to Buy from Neutral, citing an “attractive risk/reward as we view current valuation levels as under-appreciating IBTA’s forward growth opportunity around scaling 3P redemptions partnerships.”\n\nOn the other hand, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) was downgraded from Buy to Neutral amid expectations that continued headwinds within its core RR&O segment will continue to outweigh growth within its Services unit.\n\nGoldman Sachs reiterated a Buy rating on key industry players such as Meta, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), DoubleVerify (NYSE:DV), Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA), and Mediaalpha Inc (NYSE:MAX), with Meta and Alphabet being viewed as particularly strong due to their AI integration efforts.\n\nFor Meta, the Wall Street firm raised its price target to $636 from $555, expecting continued topline growth driven by AI-related opportunities and the ramp-up of Reels monetization.\n\nMeanwhile, Pinterest is also projected to see strong returns, with its price target set at $46, backed by the platform’s expanding global user base and the continued adoption of AI in its ad products.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoldman Sachs adjusts ratings on digital advertisers ahead of earnings\n\nDenmark's Lundbeck bets on epilepsy drug in $2.6 billion Longboard deal\n\nS&P 500 hits record high on chip stocks; corporate results, key data in focus\n\nView comments",

Soros currently has a net worth of $7.2 billion, as of October 4, according to Forbes. The legendary billionaire investor managed client money between 1969 and 2011. Soros made a fortune after shorting the British pound in 1992, making $1 billion. He has donated over $32 billion to his philanthropic organization, Open Society, of which almost $15 billion has been distributed. You can also read our piece on the best growth stocks to buy according to George Soros.\n\nSoros is the author of multiple books including the very popular The Alchemy of Finance, Soros on Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve, and The New Paradigm for Financial Markets: The Credit Crisis of 2008 and What it Means. He last wrote a book in 2019 named In Defense of Open Society. The book is a collection of Soros’ writings on various topics including artificial intelligence, machine learning, political philanthropy, and financial markets.\n\nSoros’ View on Artificial Intelligence\n\nAccording to Soros, AI poses a threat to democracies especially with its extensive surveillance capabilities. He suggests that to distinguish between right and wrong humans must strike a balance between understanding reality and assessing how to change the world in our favor. Artificial intelligence destroys the very essence of reality, creating a disbalance. Soros emphasizes the need for AI to be regulated but for these regulations to work, societies from across the globe must work together. He also added that in an ideal world, standard regulations may have been possible but our countries our run on two distinct ideologies, the open and closed society. Here is what Soros stated:\n\n“AI destroyed this simple schema because it has absolutely nothing to do with reality. AI creates its own reality and when that artificial reality fails to correspond to the real world –which happens quite often — it is discarded as hallucination. This made me almost instinctively opposed to AI and I wholeheartedly agree with the experts who argue that it needs to be regulated. But AI regulations have to be globally enforceable, because the incentive to cheat is too great; those who evade the regulations gain an unfair advantage.”\n\nAdding to this, he suggests that while AI may make closed societies more powerful it may pose a threat to open societies. In addition to that, Soros suggested that repressive regimes like China and Russia are benefitting from the incidence of AI and thus are able to garner greater control over less powerful nations. His primary concern around AI and technology is surveillance and the misuse of data. Soros said the following about the future of AI:\n\nStory continues\n\n“AI is developing incredibly fast, and it is impossible for ordinary human intelligence to fully understand it. Nobody can predict where it will take us. But we can be sure of one thing: AI helps closed societies and poses a mortal threat to open societies. That’s because AI is particularly good at producing instruments of control that help closed societies to surveil their subjects.”\n\nA Deep Understanding of Soros’s Investment Philosophy\n\nSoros founded the Soros Fund Management LLC, a private investment management firm in 1970. He is known for his contrarian investing philosophy and has made fortunes for himself and investors through his strategies. His hedge fund is based on the idea of making elaborate one-way bets on currency movements, commodity prices, stocks, bonds, and any assets driven by macroeconomic conditions.\n\nSoros is known to have let macroeconomic conditions shape his investment decisions. This is a crucial aspect of his trading strategy referred to as reflexivity. This strategy defies standard economic conditions and emphasizes that market participants have the power to influence market fundamentals, and consequently the financial market. In light of his contrarian investment philosophy, Soros said the following in his book, Staying Ahead of the Curve:\n\n“The prevailing wisdom is that markets are always right. I take the opposition position. I assume that markets are always wrong. Even if my assumption is occasionally wrong, I use it as a working hypothesis. It does not follow that one should always go against the prevailing trend. On the contrary, most of the time the trend prevails; only occasionally are the errors corrected. It is only on those occasions that one should go against the trend. This line of reasoning leads me to look for the flaw in every investment thesis. … I am ahead of the curve. I watch out for telltale signs that a trend may be exhausted. Then I disengage from the herd and look for a different investment thesis. Or, if I think the trend has been carried to excess, I may probe going against it. Most of the time we are punished if we go against the trend. Only at an inflection point are we rewarded.”\n\nNow that we have studied one of Soros’s most important investment philosophies, let’s take a look at the top 10 holdings of George Soros.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through Soros Fund Management’s Q2 2024 13F filings and picked the fund’s top 10 picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the fund’s stakes in them. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Alphabet Inc. (GOOG): A Top Holding in George Soros’s Portfolio-\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nSoros Fund Management’s Stake Value: $166.66 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the biggest holdings of George Soros. The company owns a range of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Wyamo.\n\nThe company is relentlessly working to improve the Gemini experience and is also actively involved in developing AI hardware, having launched its NVIDIA chip rival in May.\n\nWhile Google’s tensor processing units (TPU) only account for almost 20% of the market, its advancements promise higher market shares in the future. In addition to that, its six-generation chips are 67% more energy efficient compared to the previous generation of processors. The new chip will be made available to Google Cloud users by the end of 2024.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) logged revenue worth $85 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, driven by the growing momentum in cloud and search. Additionally, over 60% of generative AI startups and 90% of generative AI unicorns are customers of the Google Cloud. One can infer that the technology giant is well-positioned to exploit the next wave of artificial intelligence and innovation, making it a solid investment.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on GOOGL and their 12-month median price target of $205 points to a 26% upside from current levels. Overall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Of those, Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $8.86 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter“\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall, GOOG ranks 2nd on our list of George Soros Net Worth and Top 10 Holdings in 2024. Overall, GOOG ranks first among the top 10 holdings of George Soros. While we acknowledge the potential of healthcare companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "My 4 Best Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Although the market is still hitting record highs, many stocks are still good buys. The key isn't to look at where the market is now; it's to look at where some stocks may be heading if they can keep up their growth trajectory.\n\nIf these four can maintain their general direction, they'll continue rising faster than the market, which makes them excellent buys now.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nRegardless of where you look in the tech sector, you'll find that highly sophisticated chips are within every device. It doesn't matter if a GPU is being used for training artificial intelligence (AI) models or the latest smartphone, they all have cutting-edge chips. There's a good shot that these chips are manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), known commonly as TSMC, as it works with nearly all of the biggest tech players to produce their chips.\n\nThis positions TSMC nicely in today's tech-heavy environment. In fact, management believes it will grow revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 15% and 20% over the next \"several years.\" That's market-beating growth, making it a company that every investor should consider owning.\n\nTaiwan Semi is the most expensive stock by far in this group, trading at 28 times forward earnings. TSM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nHowever, with its long-term execution, market-beating growth, and industry-leading position, it has earned that premium. I think Taiwan Semi is a great buy here and will be a successful investment over the next few years.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is likely better known as Google's parent company. Its dominance in the search market has resulted in a massive revenue stream, although it is a mature business and isn't growing nearly as fast as some of its peers.\n\nHowever, Alphabet is also heavily invested in the generative AI tech race and has plenty of financial resources to make one of the best offerings in this space. Still, even with all of this upside from two industries that are slated to boom over the next decade, Alphabet's stock only trades for 21.2 times forward earnings. The most common index that Alphabet is compared to is the S&P 500, which trades for 23.5 times forward earnings.\n\nThat's a healthy discount to the market, even though Alphabet has consistently grown its earnings above 30% year over year for the past year. Alphabet stock has a strong value in a market full of expensive stocks, making it a great place to put cash.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is similar to Alphabet, as most of its revenue comes from its social media platforms, like Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. This produces unbelievable cash flows, as its \"Family of Apps\" segment delivered an operating margin of 50% in Q2.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt uses a lot of that money on AI research and developing mixed-reality products, like its new Orion glasses, which are still in the works. While many investors wish it wasn't burning cash on this pursuit, Meta is still a great business, even with its Reality Labs division being a drag on margins. Plus, if Meta develops a must-have technology in this space, it will have a new revenue stream.\n\nMeta trades for 27.6 times earnings, but it has experienced incredible growth (revenue rose 22% year over year, and earnings per share rose 73% in Q2), allowing it to earn that premium price tag.\n\n4. PayPal\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) has been in a turnaround scenario for a few years now. However, CEO Alex Chriss, who was brought on board in August 2023, has been doing a phenomenal job. Although revenue isn't growing at breakneck speed anymore (it was up 8% in Q2), Chriss has directed a lot of PayPal's cash flows to repurchase shares and launch new products.\n\nIt took a while for investors to catch on, but the stock seems to be making a pivot, as it has risen around 40% since July. The stock still only trades for 18.5 times forward earnings, so it's still a good buy at these prices.\n\nHowever, if management continues innovating and repurchasing shares, forward earnings projections may increase, making the stock look even cheaper. This is just the beginning of PayPal's turnaround, and it's a great stock to get in on now.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "content": "Consumer Internet Stocks Q2 Highlights: Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nAs the Q2 earnings season comes to a close, it’s time to take stock of this quarter’s best and worst performers in the consumer internet industry, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and its peers.\n\nThe ways people shop, transport, communicate, learn and play are undergoing a tremendous, technology-enabled change. Consumer internet companies are playing a key role in lives being transformed, simplified and made more accessible.\n\nThe 49 consumer internet stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2.5% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line.\n\nThe Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\n\nLuckily, consumer internet stocks have performed well with share prices up 10.8% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nStarted by Stanford students Larry Page and Sergey Brin in a Menlo Park garage, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the parent company of the eponymous Google Search engine, Google Cloud Platform, and YouTube.\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $84.74 billion, up 13.6% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations, but overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company: Revenue slightly beat expectations despite a miss in the YouTube segment revenue. In addition, operating income and EPS beat by more convincing amounts.

The business had an incredible quarter with optimistic revenue guidance for the next quarter and exceptional revenue growth.

It was a disappointing quarter as it posted a decline in its users and a miss of analysts’ user estimates.\n\nSkillz delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group.

        "content": "Prime minister Keir Starmer is set to promise to remove barriers and red tape for those wishing to invest in the UK, as the government’s inaugural International Investment Summit begins in London.\n\nPre-released remarks show he is expected to say the government will do everything it can to \"galvanise growth\". That includes \"getting rid of regulation that needlessly holds back investment.”\n\nHe will pledge to “upgrade the regulatory regime to make it fit for the modern age, making Britain fit to harness all opportunities.”\n\n“We’ve got to look at regulation where it is needlessly holding back the investment, to take our country forward,\" he will add. “We will rip out the bureaucracy that blocks investment and we will make sure that every regulator in this country take growth as seriously as this room does.”\n\nCEOs and investors from across the globe will meet with ministers, first ministers, and local leaders at the Guildhall in the City of London. Companies such as Google parent Alphabet (GOOG), BlackRock (BLK) and Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) are set to be in attendance.\n\nIt comes at a time when businesses and industry are awaiting more detail on a host of economic policy. The Autumn budget, slated for the end of October will give more clarity on this, as Labour attempts to meet an ambitious growth target of 2.5% for annual GDP.\n\nREAD MORE: What UK wealth managers and investment platforms want to see in the budget\n\n“We are focusing on investment because the mission of growth, in this country especially, demands it,\" Starmer will say. \"Private sector investment is the way we rebuild our country and pay our way in the world. This is a great moment to back Britain. This is great moment to back England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.”\n\nPart of the regulatory shakeup will involve asking the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to look at how it fosters innovation. The government will also review the focus of other major regulators, according to a government release.\n\nConfirmed speakers include Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Alphabet; David A Ricks, chair and CEO of Eli Lilly (LLY); Alex Kendall, CEO of Wayve; and Pushmeet Kohli, vice president of Research at Google DeepMind.\n\nReports from Sky News claim private-sector investments worth more than £50bn are set to be announced.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Google Search Volumes in Bitcoin Wanes as Memecoins Steal Spotlight in 2024\n\nGoogle search volumes for \"Bitcoin\" have just reached a one-year low while interest in memecoins continues to soar. This new-found investor interest is taking shape as the new form of the digital asset market, raising eyebrows across the financial sector.\n\nDuring the week of Oct. 12, global searches for \"Bitcoin\" reached an ultra-low 33 out of 100 on Google's scale. Meanwhile, the search volume for \"memecoins\" was 77 out of 100. Memecoins have not regained their previous high of 100 at the end of October 2023, but most industry analysts believe that memecoins will relive those former glory days.\n\nThe memecoin phenomenon is sweeping through the crypto world, with popular creations currently happening on the Solana network. An astonishing 491,000 new tokens have been created on Solana since Sept. 12 this year, according to Step Finance. Solana Floor reported that almost 20,000 new tokens launched in one 24-hour period on Oct. 9, the majority of which were memecoins.\n\nNews sites focused on Solana reported that memecoins on the network collectively had a market capitalization of over $10 billion, with a total 24-hour trading volume of around $2.3 billion as of Oct. 12.\n\nPlatforms like Pump.fun have catalyzed Solana by making user-friendly interfaces with low transaction fees and fast access to liquidity via decentralized exchanges such as Raydium. This has democratized token creation to the extent that virtually anyone can create and issue new digital assets.\n\nSolana is not alone in memecoin trends. In August 2024, Tron founder Justin Sun announced the launch of a similar platform on the Tron network called SunPump. According to data from Dune, 90,000 memecoins have been created on SunPump since its creation.\n\nHowever, investor Mark Cuban recently warned that every meme coin is a rug pull in the works, cautioning people against trading these highly speculative assets.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Hedge Funds Are Bullish On This Profitable Blue Chip Stock Right Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Invest In.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other profitable blue chip stocks.\n\nThe September inflation report came in hotter than expected and showed that it remains sticky. Headline inflation rose by 2.4%, slightly above the anticipated 2.3%, and down from 2.5% in August. Month-over-month, CPI increased by 0.2%, exceeding the forecast of 0.1%.\n\nCore inflation, excluding food and energy, also came in higher than expected at 3.3%, compared to the anticipated 3.2%, marking a slight increase from August. On a monthly basis, core CPI rose by 0.3%, which matched August’s figures but was above expectations of 0.2%.\n\nFollowing the report, the market is expecting a 25 basis points rate cut to no rate cuts in the upcoming Fed meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, 79.9% of interest rate traders expect the rate cuts to be at 450-475 bps at the coming Fed meeting while 20.1% expect the rate cut to stay the same. At the beginning of the month, 32.1% expected a 50 bps rate cut, while 67.9% anticipated a 25 bps cut.\n\nUnderstanding Inflation Trends and Federal Reserve Strategy\n\nDespite the sticky inflation, IBM's vice chair, Gary Cohn believes that the Fed will cut rates by 100 bps this year. In an interview at CNBC's ‘Money Movers',he suggested that the U.S. is experiencing what a soft landing looks like, with inflation decreasing but not steadily. He indicated that reaching the Fed's 2% target will be challenging, as inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around this level.\n\nCohn noted that for the first time in nearly two decades, the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate, employment, and price stability, after focusing primarily on one at a time. He believes the Fed is making the right decisions and is currently in a delicate position as it missed meeting opportunities this year.\n\nCohn expects that the Fed will implement a total of 100 basis points in rate cuts this year, likely consisting of 25 basis point reductions over the next couple of months. When asked about inflation targets, he expressed a preference for slightly exceeding the target inflation rate, suggesting that a rate of around 2.2% would be more acceptable in a growing economy than undershooting the target.\n\nCohn also highlighted concerns about geopolitical risks and said that global tensions could lead to inflationary pressures by disrupting supply chains and increasing shipping costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we use stock screeners to identify nearly 30 stocks above $100 billion market cap and $10 billion TTM net income. Next, we narrowed our list to 8 stocks that had a 5-year net income compound annual growth rate of above 10% and were most widely held by institutional investors. The most profitable blue chip stocks are listed in ascending order of the hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of 912 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nMarket Cap: $2 Trillion\n\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 20.33%\n\nTTM Net Income: $87.657 billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nOne of the most profitable blue chip stocks, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another contender for the most profitable blue chip stocks and is another company on our list that is a part of the tech Big Five. The company’s infrastructure includes a diverse range of subsidiaries, with Google remaining its largest and most well-known entity, which oversees services like Android, YouTube, and Google Search.\n\nOther subsidiaries focus on multiple sectors, including health, venture capital, and autonomous driving. The company’s mission is to organize global information and make it accessible, with Google Search, YouTube, Google Assistant, and Google Cloud as key tools for users and businesses.\n\nAI is also a big part of the company and has been integrated into its products for over a decade and powers features like Google Translate and Google Photos. Its latest AI model, Gemini, introduced in 2023, further advances its capabilities across several data types.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is experiencing a pebble in its shoe as it is facing intensified antitrust scrutiny in the U.S. The Justice Department is considering forcing it to spin off certain services to address monopolistic practices in online searches.\n\nHowever, Mizuho Securities analyst James Lee has still reaffirmed a Buy rating on the company’s stock due to its strong fundamentals and a positive outlook despite regulatory hurdles.\n\nTipRanks reported that Lee's analysis considers the Department of Justice's proposed changes to Google’s search operations, which include banning certain exclusive agreements and mandating the sharing of search and AI-related data. He believes these adjustments may have some structural implications but will not significantly weaken Google's market position.\n\nHe believes that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) can effectively manage these regulatory challenges. Additionally, the proposed remedies regarding search result displays and advertising are expected to have minimal effects on the company’s overall operations.\n\nPatient Capital Management stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the most profitable blue chip stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Is A Goldman Sachs Phase 2 AI Stock For The Next AI Wave",
        "content": "We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks. In this piece, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks among the list of Goldman Sachs' Phase 2 AI stocks.\n\nWhile consumer technology stocks had soared in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, back then, their share price gains were due to. the growing demand for technology products and services due to lock downs. Now, big technology stocks have persisted in their strong performance despite high interest rates since they have been judged by the market as the top innovators and performers in the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nSince AI is somewhat of a ubiquitous technology, its impact is on several industries. So far, we’ve seen most of the stock market returns related to AI directly tied to just one stock. This stock continued to be the fifth most trending AI stocks as recently as in mid October and its share price returns are nothing short of unbelievable. From its bottom in October 2022 when the split adjusted share price was a mere $11.23, the shares have gained a stunning 1,100%. In other words, if you had invested just $100 back then in the shares and then held onto them for dear life, your investment would be worth $1,200 today.\n\nThis is the magic of AI, a technology that has caught Wall Street and retail investors alike by storm. However, AI’s impact, and its enablement, aren’t limited to the GPU designer we’ve mentioned above. While GPUs are the ‘oil’ for this technology, a wide variety of other components from data center infrastructure, networking equipment, connectivity, and energy all will have to play their part if OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s plans of initially building as many as 7 AI data centers across the US, with each data center guzzling an unbelievable 5 Gigawatts of electricity, are to come to fruition.\n\nThis then makes us ask, what are such stocks that might enable 35 Gigawatts of AI data centers across the US? After all, in order to meet the world’s demand for AI chips, Altman believes that an unfathomable $7 trillion will need to be spent for building 36 chip manufacturing fabs and additional AI data centers. This money has to be spent somewhere, and therein lies the answer to our question. Things get clearer when we look at a detailed research report from investment bank Goldman Sachs. This report segregated the AI sector into four categories.\n\nThe first category only included Wall Street’s AI darling, the second was made of AI capacity providers like server companies, other semiconductor firms, and utilities, the third included firms that sell AI products and software, and the fourth category firms were those that will benefit from AI adoption. In its report, the investment bank shared that year to date in July, the first category had returned 139%. As of mid October, this category has gained 179% on the stock market, so safe to say returns have accelerated despite some turbulence in between. By July, the second group of firms was also doing well. Its returns ranged between ~-8% to ~50%, with the average stock having delivered 22%.\n\nZooming into these firms, the utility sector is one which had particularly impressed the bank. It shared that utilities were the best performing sector in the flagship S&P index between March and May courtesy of their 16% returns. Their three month returns ranked in the 98th percentile since 2022 and were the third highest after 2003 and 2020 rallies. This outperformance is unsurprising given the strong investments in data centers that have taken the US by storm this year.\n\nThese investments have led to estimates suggesting that America’s data center hub, Northern Virginia, will require 11,000 megawatts of electricity by 2035 – demand which has already spurred $5.2 billion in investments for transmission lines and coal fired power plants. Estimates from Boston Consulting Group believe that by 2030, AI will account for 16% of America’s energy consumption and touch 130 gigawatts. For a detailed look at the link between electricity use and data centers, you should read 15 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Jefferies, Citi and Wall Street Analysts.\n\nThe bustling optimism surrounding AI is also reflected in revenue estimates. Goldman’s September 2024 research shows that 2025 revenue estimates of semiconductor firms, software enablers, and hardware firms except semiconductors are roughly 2.3x, 2.05x, and 1.8x over 2019 levels, respectively. Similarly, non semiconductor hardware companies have seen their revenue forecasts for Q4 2025 jump to $450 billion for a $380 billion gain over Q1 2024’s $70 billion. Makes us wonder whether it’s this group of companies that might see a stock mirror the 1,100% returns of Wall Street’s AI darling.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs’ best phase 2 AI stocks, we ranked the 20 stocks with the highest year to date returns and some other big tech and data center names that have announced multi billion dollars in capital expenditure by their year to date performance.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nYear To Date Share Price Gain: 17.88%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the mega cap technology company that earns most of its revenue through its search engine, Google Search. Its dominance in the global search industry, which sees it operate across all ends from serving as a marketplace for ads to running the ads on its platforms, has enabled Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) to build a fortress balance sheet. Its cash and equivalents sit at $111 billion which enables the firm to play a leading role in the cloud computing industry. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a diversified AI company, since not only does it offer AI products and services along with the Gemini APU, but it also offers tensor processing unit (TPU) chips to others to run their AI workloads. One of its biggest TPU customers is Apple, and its AI platform means that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is both an AI enabler and an AI beneficiary.\n\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter.

        "title": "Google's new antitrust defense is AI",
        "content": "For more than a year, company executives threw around the words artificial intelligence to signal that they too were on the cutting edge. Feeding the investor frenzy for lower costs, boosted productivity, and smarter products, \"AI\" became an earnings call mantra. On Wednesday, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) showed another way companies can wield AI and the excitement around it: as an antitrust defense.\n\nIn a blog post responding to the Justice Department's proposal to potentially break up Google, the company pointed to the blossoming market for AI and the evolution of search as reasons why the government's case is so misguided.\n\nThe Justice Department in a court filing earlier this week outlined potential remedies to reinvigorate competition in the search engine market. Google will have a chance to formally respond, but in the blog post, the company said the government seems to be pursuing a sweeping agenda that threatens to harm consumers and American competitiveness.\n\n\"The DOJ’s outline also comes at a time when competition in how people find information is blooming, with all sorts of new entrants emerging and new technologies like AI transforming the industry,\" wrote Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs.\n\nIn Google's view, the government's heavy-handed approach to transforming the search market ignores the nascent developments in AI, the fresh competition in the space, and new modes of seeking information online, like AI-powered answer engines.\n\nThe energy around AI and the potential disruption of how users interact with search is, competitively speaking, a negative for Google, said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. But in another way, as a defense against antitrust charges, it’s a positive.\n\n\"That’s an argument against monopoly that bodes well for Google,\" he said. The US Justice Department said in a new court filing that it may recommend a break up of Google as an antidote to unhealthy competition in the search engine market (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nOthers are more skeptical of the AI defense.\n\n\"The DOJ has specifically noted that this evolution in technology is precisely why they are intervening at this point in time,\" said Gil Luria, an analyst at DA Davidson. \"They want to make sure that Google is not able to convert the monopoly it currently has in Search into a monopoly in AI Enhanced Search.\"\n\nGoogle's enormous investment in AI-powered search tools also carries risks for the company. At a fundamental level, the AI transition marks an overhaul of Google’s core search product. And since many people experience the internet through Google, powered by its advertising empire — analysts have questioned whether Google might be endangering its search business to prop up a new, untested AI-driven regime.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The shift to AI Enhanced Search is a tricky one for Google to begin with because it changes the monetization model Google has successfully refined over the last 20 years,\" said Luria.\n\nInstead of displaying ads and sponsored links with every search, Google will have to experiment with different types of advertising when it offers generative AI answers to their queries, he said. \"While it is in a position to monetize those ads as well, it may take it years to achieve the same level of monetization [it] enjoys in traditional Search.\"\n\nThe company likely anticipates these risks, and some contend that a new paradigm could complement or even supplant the old search-based ad model.\n\n\"I'm not of the belief that the dollars within search are going to disappear,\" said Charlie Miner, an analyst at Third Bridge. \"We don't fully know how they are going to approach the monetization of search.\" Advertisers, for instance, might pay a higher premium to place their products inside of AI queries.\n\nOf course, pointing to the advancements of AI and the potential for new markets isn't a proven defense against accusations of abusing market power. In fact, Google and the other major cloud providers, who are also among the top players in the AI market, have already attracted regulatory scrutiny concerning their AI deals and partnerships.\n\nEarlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation targeting Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google's investments in AI startups. The inquiry focuses on three multibillion dollar deals: Microsoft's partnership with the maker of ChatGPT, OpenAI, as well as Amazon and Google's relationships with the AI startup Anthropic.\n\nThe FTC said it is seeking information related to competition for AI inputs and resources and the strategic rationale for the deals.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nAs the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHoward Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. Bank of America recently maintained a Buy rating with a $206 price target on the stock. In a research note, the investment firm detailed that a recent DOJ court filing was weighing on the stock but claimed that the initial proposed set of remedies regarding the Google breakup were generally in line with investor expectations. The advisory, which anticipates more twists and turns in the case ahead, also saw positives, including its belief that Google was well-positioned in the search market, Google's counter proposals in December were likely provide a more positive potential outcome, and limited layoffs so far compared to peers gave the company's new CFO a positive cost basis set up to drive EPS growth.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 6th on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "What's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy if Trump Wins in November?",
        "content": "Only once in U.S. history has a former president who lost reelection after his first term managed to become president again. The last time it happened was in 1892 when Grover Cleveland became the first -- and, so far, only -- president elected for two non-consecutive terms.\n\nBut Cleveland might soon have company. Former President Donald Trump is running neck-and-neck with Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race. If elected, his policies could impact the businesses of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" companies: Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). What's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump wins in November? Former President Donald Trump. Image source: Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead.\n\nTrump's proposals that could impact the Magnificent Seven\n\nThree major Trump proposals could impact the Magnificent Seven the most. The GOP presidential nominee's proposed corporate tax cuts arguably belong at the top of the list.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump signed legislation that overhauled the federal corporate tax rate structure. Previously, large corporations paid federal taxes of 15% to 35%. After the Trump tax cuts, these businesses paid a flat tax of 21%. The former president wants to slash this rate to 15% if he's elected again.\n\nAnother key part of Trump's economic policy for a potential second term is the implementation of across-the-board tariffs. He promises to impose tariffs of up to 20% on all imported products. Trump, who has referred to himself as \"Tariff Man,\" wants to impose tariffs of 60% on goods imported from China. He has also threatened to enact tariffs of 100% on products made in Mexico.\n\nWhen Trump was president before, he was a fan of deregulation. Reducing federal regulations is likely to be a major focus again if he returns to the White House. Trump wants to eliminate 10 existing regulations for every new regulation. One promise that's especially relevant to the Magnificent Seven is his pledge to repeal an executive order signed by President Biden that regulates artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nHow the Magnificent Seven could be affected\n\nPaying less in federal taxes should be good for all the Magnificent Seven. However, the impact of Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts perhaps won't be as great as it might seem. As the following table shows, none of these giant companies pay the 21% federal tax rate in place now.\n\nCompany Effective Tax Rate in the Last Fiscal Year Alphabet 13.9% Amazon 9.7% Apple 14.7% Meta Platforms 17.6% Microsoft 18.0% Nvidia 12.0% Tesla (50% Tax Benefit)\n\nData sources: Company 10-K filings. *Tesla received more tax benefits than it paid in taxes in 2023.\n\nSteeper tariffs could especially impact the Magnificent Seven companies that rely on imported products and components. Although the companies would probably pass the increased costs along to consumers, the higher prices could negatively impact sales.\n\nApple would likely be the hardest hit by tariffs because of its global supply chain. All the others could also feel some effects of higher tariffs. The Magnificent Seven members that generate more revenue from services, particularly Alphabet and Meta, would probably be the least impacted by Trump's proposed tariffs.\n\nWhat about Trump's deregulation focus? I think the major cloud service providers -- Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- could be helped by reduced AI regulations. So would Nvidia and, perhaps to a lesser extent, Meta and Tesla.\n\nHowever, Trump has specifically criticized Alphabet, telling Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo in a recent interview, \"Google has been very bad. They've been very irresponsible. And I have a feeling that Google's going to be close to shut down, because I don't think Congress is going to take it.\" The former president has also called Meta's Facebook \"a true enemy of the people\" in a social media post.\n\nAnd while Tesla CEO Elon Musk supports Trump for president, Trump's proposed policies could hurt Tesla. The GOP presidential nominee has railed against federal incentives for electric vehicles in the past. On the other hand, he told an audience at one of his rallies, \"I'm for electric cars. I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\"\n\nThe best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump wins\n\nSo, what's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump wins in November? I think it's a close contest between Microsoft and Nvidia.\n\nMicrosoft might be helped more by Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts because it pays the highest effective tax rate of the Magnificent Seven companies. Both Microsoft and Nvidia could be hurt to some extent by the former president's tariffs but helped by his regulatory stance. Neither has been singled out for attacks by Trump as Alphabet and Meta have nor have the industries in which they operate been the target of his ire like Tesla.\n\nI believe Nvidia has stronger growth prospects than Microsoft, though. If I had to pick just one Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump returns to the White House, I would buy Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai said he is proud of the overwhelming rate that applicants who are offered jobs accept them and explained what kind of talent the tech giant needs.\n\nIn an interview with David Rubenstein on Bloomberg TV that aired Thursday, Pichai said the rate is close to 90%. When asked what Google looks for in entry-level new hires, he said it depends on the type of role.\n\n\"If you're in engineering, we're looking for really good programmers, people who understand computer science well and can be dynamically willing to learn and grow, apply themselves into new situations and do well,\" Pichai said. \"But we are really looking for superstar software engineers.\"\n\nGoogle, like the rest of the tech sector, went on a hiring spree in the aftermath of the pandemic, but then laid off staff earlier this year as companies shifted from focusing on growth to cutting costs.\n\nThat's led to grumbling among some Googlers, who have also noted a pullback in workplace perks, culminating in a an all-hands meeting in May as employees sounded off on lower morale and complained they’re not enjoying their fair share of the company's success.\n\nDespite the earlier cuts, the AI race continues to fuel growth. As OpenAI, Meta, Amazon, and Google ramp up their artificial intelligence efforts, they are spending billions of dollars on chips and other hardware while also snapping up top talent.\n\nIn fact, Google is even using AI in its hiring. The company’s cloud computing division has been using AI since last fall to improve its candidate matching and onboarding processes. The company has created its own AI product, Gemini for Google Workspace, which it says has become intertwined with most stages of talent acquisition.\n\nTracey Arnish, head of HR for Google Cloud, told Fortune in July that the team first started using AI to parse through the millions of workers who have applied to roles within the past few years.\n\nAnd when the hiring committee comes together to assess a group of applicants, Google Gemini is deployed to collect all relevant internal feedback on the individuals.\n\nMeanwhile, Pichai still believes in free food, despite the cost it requires.\n\n\"People value in-person collaboration,\" he told Rubenstein earlier in the interview. \"I can recall several times when I was working at Google early on being in cafes, meeting someone else, talking, getting excited about something. So it sparks creativity, creates community. And I think the benefit that comes out of it far dwarfs the cost associated with it.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Mike Scarcella\n\n(Reuters) - Google has asked a California federal judge to pause his sweeping court order requiring it to open up its app store Play to greater competition.\n\nIn a court filing on Friday night, Google said U.S. District Judge James Donato’s injunction order, which goes into effect on Nov. 1, would harm the company and introduce \"serious safety, security, and privacy risks into the Android ecosystem.\"\n\nThe tech giant, a unit of Alphabet, asked Donato to stay the order while it pursues an appeal.\n\nThe judge issued the injunction on Oct. 7 in a case brought by “Fortnite” maker Epic Games, which persuaded a federal jury last year that Google was illegally monopolizing how consumers download apps on Android devices and how they pay for in-app transactions.\n\nThe judge's order said Google must allow users to download competing third-party Android app platforms or stores and can no longer prohibit the use of competing in-app payment methods. It also bars Google from making payments to device makers to preinstall its app store and from sharing revenue generated from the Play store with other app distributors.\n\nIf Donato denies Google's bid to put the injunction on hold, the company can ask the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to do so while it appeals the jury's underlying antitrust verdict.\n\nGoogle filed its notice of appeal to the 9th Circuit on Thursday. The appeals court ultimately would be expected to weigh and rule on Google's challenge to Donato's order.\n\n(Reporting by Mike Scarcella; Editing by William Maclean and Frances Kerry)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nTwo years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAmid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

The investment firm detailed in a research note that the Department of Justice's remedies framework in the Google search commercial agreements trial were mostly in-line with expectations. However, per the advisory, the DOJ's final proposed remedies were not due until November 20, and as a result, the initial framework was somewhat broad and unspecific in terms of exact remedies. JPMorgan added that while there were not any major surprises, the preliminary framework carried headline risk and suggested structural changes or separation proposals were possible for Alphabet. However, the advisory did not believe the high-level framework changed much for the shares in the near-term.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 6th among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Surprise! These 3 High-Growth Artificial Intelligence (AI) Players Are Looking More and More Like Value Stocks",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks offer investors great potential for gains thanks to the promise of the technology to revolutionize many areas -- from making companies more efficient to developing the next game-changing medicine, AI could make a huge mark on history. That's why many AI stocks have roared higher, boasting lofty valuations, and many investors had the feeling that if they wanted to score an AI win, they would have to pay a high price.\n\nBut I have a surprise for you: Some very promising AI players actually are looking more and more like value stocks, as their valuations have reached bargain levels, considering their track records and future potential. They may not exactly have crossed the line into value-stock territory, but they're close enough to prompt growth and value investors to take notice. Let's check out three AI stocks that look dirt cheap right now and might offer you an excellent buying opportunity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer's (NASDAQ: SMCI) earnings and stock soared earlier this year as customers flocked to the company for its AI data center equipment -- products such as workstations and servers. In fact, Supermicro's quarterly revenue, climbing into the billions, even surpassed its annual revenue as recently as in 2021.\n\nEarnings remain strong, and the company even offered investors fantastic news this past week when it said it's been shipping 100,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI on a quarterly basis. The company works with top chip designers like Nvidia to integrate their chips into its equipment.\n\nBut recent headwinds have stopped the stock in its tracks. These include a report from a firm shorting the stock, alleging troubles at Supermicro, and a Wall Street Journal report of a possible Justice Department probe. At the same time, Supermicro has delayed its annual 10-K report. All of these elements have weighed on investor confidence.\n\nI don't recommend Supermicro right now for cautious investors until these uncertainties are resolved, but aggressive investors may consider a small position in this top AI player, as it's trading for a bargain-basement price, at only 14x forward earnings estimates.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), trading for 21x forward earnings estimates, is the cheapest of the high-growth tech stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Yet, the company has a track record and future prospects that are just as exciting as those of these peers.\n\nYou probably know Alphabet best thanks to Google Search, the world's most popular search engine, and advertising on Google generates the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue. But the company also has another very promising business that's reached big milestones recently thanks to the company's investment in AI. I'm talking about Google Cloud.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe cloud business reported a double-digit gain in revenue and a triple-digit increase in operating income in the recent quarter, and these metrics also reached important milestones. Google Cloud revenue advanced beyond $10 billion for the first time, and the business' operating income rose past $1 billion. The company says its AI infrastructure and solutions for cloud customers have brought in billions of dollars in revenue this year -- and more than 2 million developers are using these tools.\n\nAlphabet is offering customers AI solutions for all of their needs, and also has applied AI to its Google Search business -- so Alphabet could become an AI powerhouse over the long run.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is another Magnificent Seven player trading for a very reasonable price, at 27x forward earnings estimates. The company is a leader in the world of social media, as it owns Facebook, Messenger, Threads, WhatsApp, and Instagram -- and its investment in AI could reinforce its position here.\n\nMeta pledged to make AI its biggest investment theme of this year, aiming to have on board the equivalent of 600,000 graphics processing units of compute by year end. The tech giant is working to develop AIs that all of its users could apply to their needs -- from leisure to business. This should prompt us to spend more time on Meta's apps, and in turn, advertisers may increase their already hefty advertising presence there in order to reach us.\n\nAdvertising represents most of Meta's billion-dollar revenue today, so investing in an area that could secure advertising spending is wise. On top of this, Meta is going all-in on AI, so other products or services may be on the horizon. At today's price, Meta is a great addition to the portfolios of investors with a focus on both growth and value.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Trump’s new campaign pledge on autonomous EVs is good for Musk and Waymo, bad for China",
        "content": "On the same day as Tesla's Cybercab launch, former President Donald Trump said on the campaign trail that he would ban Chinese-made autonomous vehicles if reelected to the White House this November.\n\n\"I will continue my first-term efforts to protect America from the threat of Chinese automobiles. I will stop Chinese and other countries producing automobiles and autonomous vehicles,\" Trump said at a Detroit Economic Club campaign event. He also promised to make car loans fully tax deductible and touted his plan to give small businesses bigger tax deductions.\n\n\"Does anybody like an autonomous vehicle, you know what that is right?\" Trump asked the crowd. \"When you see a car driving along. Some people do, I don't know, a little concerning to me, but the autonomous vehicles - we're going to stop from operating on American roads.\"\n\nThere are currently multiple Chinese tech companies and startups testing fleets of self-driving cars in major cities across China, including in Wuhan and Beijing. And some already have commercial operations, with Guangzhou-based WeRide serving customers. Another startup, Pony.ai, is also permitted to operate robo-taxis in major cities.\n\nU.S. competition is catching up, with Alphabet and Uber's Waymo driverless cars recently expanding to new cities. According to a recent report, Waymo recently hit more than 100,000 weekly paid rides in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, where its app is available for customers to book their own travel.\n\nTrump's campaign pledge would help those U.S.-based tech companies as well as billionaire supporter Elon Musk, who unveiled the long-awaited Tesla robo-taxi and robo-van on Thursday. The new vehicles, expected to hit the road in 2026, are electric and fully automated with no steering wheel or pedals.\n\nMusk has been a fervent supporter of Trump, even flirting with a potential role in his administration if he wins. The X owner appeared at a Trump campaign event earlier this week, during which he called himself \"Dark MAGA.\"\n\nChina's autonomous vehicle advancements have also caught the eye of the Biden administration and Trump's Democratic rival Vice President Kamala Harris. They have proposed banning Chinese-made hardware and software in connected vehicles due to national security concerns over the technology used in these cars. If implemented, the new rule would deprive Chinese autonomous vehicle makers of the relatively lax regulations they have enjoyed in the U.S. so far.\n\nChinese companies have quietly tested autonomous vehicles in the U.S. for years, and since 2017, these vehicles have driven more than 1.8 million miles in California alone, Fortune previously reported.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

(NASDAQ:GOOG) with a Sector Outperform rating (Buy) and a price target of $212.\n\nThe analyst says that Google is poised to benefit from AI investments, with monetizable corporate products in its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and enhanced ad revenue opportunities through Search and YouTube.\n\nNotably, Google is primed to lead the AI wave, leveraging its unmatched data and computing power, adds the analyst.\n\nThe analyst writes that while ChatGPT grabbed attention, Google has been advancing AI for decades. Tools like Gemini and Bard are just the latest user-friendly interfaces for its long-standing expertise.\n\nMoreover, Schindler says that Google is the least sensitive to macroeconomic factors among the Big 3, as most of its revenue comes from Search, which correlates with global online transactions—a resilient and expanding market.\n\nThe analyst writes that antitrust actions in the U.S. have limited Google’s stock performance this year compared to its Big 3 Internet peers, but they see a positive outlook for the company ahead.\n\nRead: Google Cries Foul As DOJ Moves To Break Up Search Giant, Calls Recommendations ‘Radical’ As Antitrust Ruling Aims To Limit Its Search Market Monopoly\n\nGoogle was cautious in reducing excess expenses from pandemic-era over-hiring, indicating it has more room to trim costs, adds the analyst.\n\nSchindler says that they will be watching for any shifts in spending with the new CFO.\n\nPrice Action: GOOG shares are up 0.96% at $164.75 at the last check Friday.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nRead Next:\n\nHumanoid Robots May Be Biggest Product Ever, Sell The News On Tesla’s We, Robot And AMD’s AI Event\n\nLatest Ratings for GOOGL\n\nDate Firm Action From To Feb 2022 MKM Partners Maintains Buy Feb 2022 Mizuho Maintains Buy Feb 2022 Piper Sandler Maintains Overweight\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for GOOGL\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nWith a net worth of over $14 billion, Ray Dalio is one of the most respected investors on Wall Street. He founded Bridgewater Associates in 1975, which has grown to become the world's largest hedge fund, with roughly $97.2 billion in net assets under management.\n\nNotably, Bridgewater Associates is the fourth most profitable hedge fund in terms of absolute dollar returns as the fund's net gains amounted to approximately $55.8 billion between 1975 and 2023.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\nDalio thinks the U.S. economy is \"in a relatively good balance\" right now and doesn't foresee multiple rate cuts. This sharply contrasts with market expectations, which signal at least two more rate cuts in 2024 alone.\n\nNot On Any Preset Course: Powell\n\nWall Street rejoiced at the September rate cut by 50 basis points, with investors speculating about the magnitude of the next rate cut. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has hinted that future rate cuts might be smaller as the central bank cautiously navigates avoiding a recession while bringing down inflation.\n\n\"Looking forward, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, policy will move over time toward a more neutral stance. But we are not on any preset course,\" he said. \"The risks are two-sided and we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.\"\n\nAs the risks associated with rate cuts are two-sided, Powell acknowledged, \"This [FOMC] is not a committee that feels like it's in a hurry to cut rates quickly.\"\n\nDalio's Outlook On The Bond Market\n\nDalio believes the bond market is in a precarious position and Treasury bonds, particularly, have not been great investments recently.\n\n\"Treasury bonds have not been a great investment,\" Dalio said at the Greenwich Economic Forum. \"We have an interest rate risk in that bond market.\"\n\nWith institutional investors and central banks holding substantial Treasuries, Dalio thinks the market may be overweighted in these securities.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the erratic fluctuations in Treasury yields this year are a major deterrent as the two-year Treasury yield has swung between 3.5% and 5%, reflecting a market on edge.\n\nTrending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nBridgewater Associates' Top Holdings\n\nDalio retired as co-CIO in 2022 and gave up control of Bridgewater Associates. However, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, he still owns a 49.9% stake in the company.\n\nThe hedge fund has diversified its holdings across multiple sectors as evidenced by its second-quarter 13F filing.\n\nAlphabet\n\nBridgewater Associates owns 4.54 million shares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), making it its third-largest holding – accounting for 4.32% of the total portfolio. The Magnificent Seven stock has been an investor favorite for a long time.\n\nWhile the recent probe by the Department of Justice to break up Google's dominance in the search engine industry has shocked many, industry experts have not reacted sharply to the news.\n\n\"We don't believe there are any major surprises,\" stated Doug Anmuth, an analyst at J.P. Morgan. \"We don't believe the high-level framework changes much for Google shares near term.\"\n\nIn the wake of the DOJ's court filing, Google wrote in a blog post that the “DOJ's radical and sweeping proposals risk hurting consumers, businesses and developers.\"\n\nAnalysts are mostly bullish on GOOGL stock, with a price target of $201.64. This indicates a potential upside of nearly 25%.\n\nProcter & Gamble\n\nProcter & Gamble Co. (NYSE:PG) stock is Bridgewater's fifth-largest holding, accounting for 3.1% of the total portfolio. As of June 30, 2024, the hedge fund's stake in Procter & Gamble was valued at $592.90 million.\n\nThe consumer goods giant's stable dividend makes it a staple investment for defensive plays. The company has increased dividend payouts for 68 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King. Proctor & Gamble pays $4.03 in dividends annually, yielding 2.39% on the current price.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg? Speak to a financial advisor today.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Scotiabank initiated coverage on three major tech giants—Alphabet (Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms—assigning Sector Outperform (Buy) ratings to Google and Amazon, while rating Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as Sector Perform (Neutral).\n\nThe analysts, in a note Friday, highlighted key differences in their growth trajectories and long-term competitive positions, helping to explain their ratings.\n\nThey explained that one of the primary distinctions between these companies is the predictability of future consumer usage.\n\n\"In the cases of Amazon and Google, we have a high level of confidence that consumers will use their services more in the future,\" said Scotiabank, while Meta’s future usage is less predictable.\n\nAccording to the bank, hours in a day are the \"ultimate limited resource,\" and while Amazon and Google help consumers save time, Meta’s business model relies on keeping users engaged for longer periods.\n\n\"Amazon and Google give you time, Meta sells your time,\" they stated. Amazon and Google make money by quickly directing users off their platforms—through paid search ads for Google and completed transactions for Amazon—while Meta earns by increasing user engagement, similar to traditional media models.\n\nScotiabank is also optimistic about the company’s potential in artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon and Google are expected to capitalize the most on AI investments, with their cloud services playing a pivotal role in monetizing corporate AI applications.\n\nIn contrast, Scotiabank sees Meta’s AI efforts as more focused on improving ad targeting and consumer engagement, which they describe as \"incremental rather than revolutionary.\"\n\nOverall, while Scotiabank sees strong potential for Amazon and Google in AI-driven growth, they are less certain about Meta’s long-term competitive edge in the evolving tech landscape\n\nRelated Articles\n\nScotiabank Starts big tech coverage: Amazon and Google Outperform, Meta Neutral\n\nNippon Steel to sell Calvert JV to ArcelorMittal if U.S. Steel deal completed\n\nStrong bank earnings push S&P 500, Dow to record highs\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google Used Influence, Ultimatum to Cut California News Deal",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google was negotiating to spend $110 million to support California’s struggling journalism industry, but the search giant had a demand: taxpayers would need to contribute tens of millions of dollars as well.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Chicago Marathon to Honor Kenyan Who Died After His World Record\n\nState Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, the Oakland Democrat discussing a deal with Google, called California Governor Gavin Newsom’s office to secure his support for $70 million from taxpayers, even as the state faced a challenging budget deficit. The pact that Google, the governor and Wicks settled on in late August was a handshake agreement, according to Wicks’ staff. Weeks later, while there is now a written framework for the deal, some of the key provisions have yet to be worked out.\n\n“This framework represents the most impactful deal we could reach amid the current political reality,” Wicks said in a statement. “And it is just the beginning — I view it as the floor, not the ceiling, and am hopeful about our efforts to support California journalists.”\n\nWhile the main outline of the deal has been known since shortly after Wicks and Google announced it in August, what hasn’t previously been reported is the company’s willingness to walk away from an agreement unless the state contributed money. Google insisted on taxpayer funding to set a precedent that it could use in talks with other states seeking similar deals. Also, the University of California at Berkeley’s surprise at being named a potential administrator of a new journalism fund that would be created by the pact and the discussions with the University of Southern California to take on that role also haven’t previously been reported.\n\nThe agreement fell far short of aggressive legislation proposed by Wicks and another lawmaker who sought to charge Alphabet Inc.’s Google hundreds of millions of dollars every year to support the news industry in California. After private negotiations that excluded some of the state’s largest media companies, the deal helped Google avoid a costly outcome that would have provided a template for lawmakers around the country considering what Silicon Valley owes media companies — especially as progress in artificial intelligence may cost more media jobs, according to almost a dozen people familiar with the talks who asked not to be named because of the nature of the discussions.\n\nWicks, Google and the governor have touted the deal, but many in California’s journalism industry criticized the state for failing to extract more money from the tech giant, squandering a chance to keep local news thriving. Others say the influx of cash is the best journalists could have hoped for in a fight with one of the world’s five most-valuable companies, which had signaled its willingness to cut off local news access to 40 million Californians.\n\n“I don’t believe the tech companies owe us something because they came up with better technology that killed newspaper advertising,” said Neil Chase, chief executive officer of California news nonprofit CalMatters. “We wish this had gotten us more money, but why would you turn down the money it did get? That’s going to help me pay my reporters next year.”\n\nThe US newspaper industry has been in decline for decades as its traditional advertising deserted to digital sites. At the same time, Google and Facebook were among the internet companies that pulled in news stories for free for users and sold advertising around those stories. In the face of dwindling revenue, more than 2,900 newspapers — almost all local weeklies — have closed since 2005, according to a report from Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism.\n\nLawmakers and philanthropic organizations have pushed to find ways to support local journalism, arguing it’s vital for an informed citizenry in a thriving democracy. But parties are deeply divided about the best path forward. And in the case of Google, newsrooms have struggled to negotiate with a company that is at once an antagonist and a benefactor — it provides grants and trainings to publications across the state.\n\nClosed Negotiations\n\nIn California, two bills moved forward in the legislature that took aim at Google and other tech companies to generate money to sustain journalism in the state.\n\nState Senator Steve Glazer proposed a “link tax” on Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Google parent Alphabet for collecting data on users. The money would be funneled into $500 million worth of tax credits to be distributed to news outlets employing journalists in California.\n\nWicks drafted a bill that would have charged companies like Google and Meta for using and selling advertising alongside news produced in California, which has 580 local news outlets, the most of any state, according to data from Medill’s Local News Initiative.\n\nCalifornia news outlets would have received the profits from the fees mandated by the bill, with a requirement that at least 70% of the funds be spent on paying journalists and newsroom support staff. Wicks’ proposal was the first state-level attempt to force Big Tech to fund the news industry, borrowing from similar agreements in Canada and Australia.\n\nGoogle fought back. In April, the company announced it was limiting search results from California news sites and said it would halt planned investments in news “until there’s clarity on California’s regulatory environment.”\n\nGoogle’s move to limit news access surprised and angered Newsom, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. But the governor, who faced a multibillion-dollar budget deficit, wasn’t eager to support either bill in the legislature, the person said.\n\nNewsom viewed Glazer’s bill as a tax increase and had indicated throughout the year that he was against tax-raising measures. And, for about a year, Newsom’s office had told Wicks that there would be no state money in a Google-journalism deal.\n\n“Our interest was how much the taxpayer and the state would have a buy-in and making sure that publishers around the state weren’t cut off entirely from any news site, including Google News,” said Bob Salladay, an adviser to Newsom.\n\nAs a result of the agreement, “we have a balance that provides nearly a quarter billion dollars to help the industry — more than any other state has provided and we hope it works to restore and revive journalism in California,” Salladay said.\n\nTech’s Influence\n\nGoogle framed the deal as a model of public-private partnership.\n\n“This agreement builds on our existing support for the local news ecosystem in our home state with additional investments,” the company said in a statement.\n\nTech giants have notched a series of wins in California, where many executives enjoy close relations with the governor. Newsom has been criticized for backing Silicon Valley when last month he vetoed an AI safety bill that would have made companies legally liable for harms resulting from their models.\n\nWithout stronger backing from Newsom, Wicks struck out on her own and narrowed negotiations to Google and a select few after California’s legislature returned from summer recess on Aug. 5, according to Wicks’ office. The deal was finalized in roughly two weeks before being announced Aug. 21.\n\n“The path forward for the bills — both their passage in the legislature and potential for a signature by the governor — was uncertain,” Wicks’ office said in a statement. “This uncomfortable reality is why we decided to come to the table to negotiate with Google.”\n\nWicks relied in the talks on Bob Hertzberg, a former speaker of the California state assembly. Jaffer Zaidi, Google global vice president of news partnerships, who is normally based in New York, decamped to Sacramento for two to three weeks as the deal came together, according to another person familiar with the matter.\n\n“As far as I know, the only people at the table were her office and the Google folks,” Chase said.\n\nThe governor, initially worried any taxpayer money would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, agreed to the lower number of $70 million, with $30 million distributed in the first year and $10 million in the following four years, according to a draft of the agreement reviewed by Bloomberg. The California legislature must still approve the state’s contribution, which is expected to be considered early next year. Google will contribute $110 million for the news industry over the five years and another $12.5 million for AI research, according to the draft.\n\nGoogle declined to specify the amount for AI research, saying “we’ve committed to further investments that will go toward AI initiatives and priorities in the state.”\n\nThe company’s message to the industry was that if the deal collapsed, newsrooms would get nothing, said one journalism leader, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid jeopardizing professional relationships. Google was very persuasive in its viewpoint, the journalist said.\n\nGoogle insisted on taxpayer money as part of the deal with California to help set a precedent for potential talks about payments to the news industry in other states, according to the people familiar with the talks. The company believes the inclusion of public funds will discourage other states from following California’s lead, one of the people said.\n\nBut California’s annual contribution also may be subject to the budget process in the legislature, putting those funds at risk each year, according to one of the people.\n\nIn a statement, Google said the company was “clear in our public statements and conversations with the government that a healthy news industry in California requires support from both the California government and a broad base of private companies.”\n\nTies to Google\n\nDespite the impact these negotiations could have on the California news industry, few news publishers, unions or interest groups were clued in. Some of those in the loop had ties to Google.\n\nLion Publishers, a trade association of mostly hyper-local digital news startups, found out about the agreement less than a week before it became public knowledge, according to one of the people. The group had connected with Wicks’ team before — her legislative director and Google’s Zaidi attended a Lion happy hour in Oakland in the spring.\n\nGoogle is also a major backer of Lion, which has 15% of its 600 members based in California. The company sponsors a conference once a year and contributes to an annual grant program that gives as much as $20,000 each to Lion newsrooms.\n\nChase of CalMatters, who is also a Lion board member, said he brought up the possibility of his group hosting the AI research accelerator that is proposed as part of the deal, though he said a journalism school with deep ties to engineering and tech also would be a good option. The Emerson Collective, the investment company founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, was considered as a potential host for the accelerator, according to Wicks’ office. The venue is still being determined.\n\nGoogle, which is locked in a race for dominance in AI with Microsoft Corp. and the startup OpenAI, has a keen interest in pushing its AI tools to as many companies as possible.\n\n“It seems as though Google is using this as an opportunity to advance their own interest in AI,” said Ted Glasser, a professor emeritus of communications at Stanford University. “I didn’t see journalists asking for this, and that’s the problem with doing this behind closed doors.”\n\nThe announcement from Wicks and Google about the deal labeled UC-Berkeley as the administrator of the new journalism fund. While the school had been approached during the negotiations, it had never accepted the role and was surprised when it was named in the agreement, according to people familiar with the matter. The University of Southern California may be swapped in for UC Berkeley, the people said.\n\nSpokespeople for UC Berkeley and USC said they have been contacted about the proposal, stressing that a final decision has not yet been made. Wicks’ office said talks with both schools are ongoing.\n\nDanielle Coffey, CEO of the News/Media Alliance trade group, which includes the state’s largest newspaper, the Los Angeles Times, said Google’s contribution doesn’t reflect its market value as a tech giant. The company gained the upper hand through negotiating a deal, rather than being subject to legislation, she said.\n\nFor the state’s local news industry, the deal was a missed opportunity to secure a pillar of support for a precarious future, Glasser said. The relationship among tech companies and news outlets has gained even greater importance as AI tools provide information directly and eliminate the need for a user to visit the websites of publishers whose content often powers the AI responses in the first place.\n\nAmid a wave of dealmaking between media companies and AI startups, including a tie-up in early October announced by OpenAI and Hearst Corp., Google has been a notable holdout. With the exception of a reported $60 million deal with Reddit Inc., Google has signaled to publishers behind closed doors that it isn’t interested in negotiating, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nWhen it comes to securing financial support for California news outlets, “there seems to be this sense that well, something is better than nothing. I’m not sure that’s true,” Glasser said of the Wicks-Google agreement. “I think this needs to be done legislatively in order to instill a sense of public purpose and public interest. I think Google’s self interest is not enough to sustain this project.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes) Why Is It So Hard for Clothing Resale Platforms to Make Money?

        "title": "Facing skepticism, Elon Musk unveils prototype for driverless robotaxi",
        "content": "Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk presented a lofty vision for the future Thursday night, unveiling prototypes of a self-driving taxi and van that he said would revolutionize travel and claiming the electric car company would put fully autonomous vehicles on the road by next year.\n\nAt an event on the Warner Bros. Studios lot in Burbank, Musk rolled out examples of what he dubbed the Cybercab. The futuristic, metallic silver vehicles lacked steering wheels, pedals and rearview mirrors. Invited guests took short rides around the studio's closed roads.\n\nA lot is riding on the Cybercab for Musk, who has been selling unfulfilled promises of autonomous vehicles for years. Although Tesla’s sales of its signature electric cars stumbled early in 2024, the company has an $800-billion market capitalization built largely on the expectation that it will be able to overtake competitors to dominate the burgeoning robotaxi market. Whether Tesla is anywhere close to completing its push to develop the technology needed to do so, however, remains an open question.\n\nOn Friday, investors signaled they were skeptical of Musk's latest claims. At 10:55 a.m Pacific time, shares of Tesla stock were trading at about $219.50, down 8% on the day.\n\n“Investors have clearly been very excited about this for many years even though Tesla hasn't delivered on it,” said Sam Abuelsamid, a transportation analyst at Guidehouse Insights.\n\n“Tesla’s valuation is much higher relative to their revenues and their profits and that is almost entirely based on the presumption that they will suddenly start generating mountains of new profits,” he said.\n\nRead more:Statewide EV sales growth sees a drop. Tesla, once a California darling, hit hard\n\nMusk also unveiled the Robovan on Thursday night, a self-driving vehicle that can transport goods or up to 20 people. And he topped off his highly produced event with a demonstration of a humanoid robot named Optimus, several of which performed dance moves for the crowd or served drinks.\n\nThe event, which the company called \"We, Robot,\" made clear that Musk has ambitions for the future that go beyond transportation. Speaking to the invite-only crowd and those watching online, he conjured up a world where every family has an Optimus robot capable of doing the grocery shopping, babysitting and watering the plants. The automated labor, he said, would make goods and services less expensive and more accessible.\n\n“It will be an age of abundance, the likes of which almost no one has envisioned,” Musk told the crowd.\n\nWhile some viewed the event as a proof of concept for Musk’s robotaxi, others were far more skeptical, saying it was all show and no substance.\n\n“Having a prototype vehicle says nothing about whether a company has developed the hardware and software necessary to safely operate that vehicle without a human driver,” said Bryant Walker Smith, an associate professor of law at the University of South Carolina who specializes in emerging transportation technology.\n\nTesting the Cybercab on closed roads is one thing, while being able to produce one that is able to safely navigate real roads is something altogether different, Smith said.\n\nMusk said the Cybercab would be in production no later than 2027 and would be available for purchase for about $30,000. He did not specify whether the Cybercab would rely on Tesla’s so-called Full Self-Driving technology, or FSD, which is already deployed in many Teslas on the road but is not capable of operating without a driver present.\n\n“When we think about transport today, there’s a lot of pain that we think is normal, like having to drive around L.A. in three hours of traffic,” Musk said Thursday. “With autonomy, you get your time back,” he said.\n\nIt was a familiar promise from Musk, who has claimed repeatedly since 2014 that Tesla was nearly ready to launch fully-autonomous vehicles.\n\nMusk has come under criticism for his claims about the capabilities of FSD, which the company has been selling to customers for thousands of dollars since 2020. The tech is currently dubbed FSD Supervised because it requires an alert, human driver to be behind the wheel during operation.\n\nRead more:Tesla posts quarterly increase in deliveries, but shares slump with investors wanting more\n\n“The Model S and Model X at this point can drive autonomously with greater safety than a person, right now,” Musk said in 2016, according to a clip that some say has been altered. Tesla’s self-driving feature cannot be used without someone in the driver’s seat and has been linked to several accidents, including fatal crashes.\n\nIn May, a Tesla in FSD mode nearly hit a moving train after failing to detect the locomotive. The driver hit the brakes himself and accepted responsibility for the accident, but told NBC News he believes FSD is a defective product.\n\n“Tesla has said that a human driver needs to be more attentive, not less attentive, when using this feature,” Smith said of FSD. “Yet it is the very system that the Tesla CEO has for many years indicated would be imminently capable of automated driving.”\n\nIn addition to the robotaxi unveiled Thursday night, Musk spoke of his vision for an ad hoc taxi service, in which owners of Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD would be able to deploy them to pick up paying customers.\n\nMusk said FSD capable of this unsupervised driving would be available to owners of Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Texas and California by next year.\n\n“I think this is a historical event, the most important that Tesla has done in the last decade,” said Dan Ives, an equity analyst at Wedbush Securities. “Many of the skeptics never thought Tesla was going to get electric vehicles on the road,” he said.\n\nTesla’s robotaxi business could create $10 billion to $15 billion in annual revenue for the company, Ives projected.\n\nTesla’s share price has risen nearly 40% over the last six months amid anticipation that the company would soon create a fleet of robotaxis and develop artificial intelligence that would enable fully autonomous driving.\n\nWaymo, the autonomous taxi service owned by Alphabet Inc., already has self-driving cars on the road in Los Angeles and San Francisco. In both cities, Waymo vehicles are completing trips for real customers without a driver present.\n\nEven without drivers, autonomous taxis require expensive maintenance such as charging, cleaning and insurance, which eat into profits.\n\n“No one has really yet figured out a business model for robotaxis,” Abuelsamid said.\n\nWaymo cars use laser-based sensors known as Lidar to perceive the surrounding environment and make autonomous driving possible. Musk has dismissed Lidar as unnecessary and too expensive, but has so far been unable to achieve autonomous driving with alternate technology that relies instead on cameras to take in a vehicle's surroundings.\n\n“Elon Musk has been quite clear that he doesn't believe that radar and Lidar are needed and that they can do it with cameras alone,” Abuelsamid said. “So far to date, no one has actually demonstrated that that is a sufficiently safe and viable solution.”\n\nDespite optimistic investors and rising share prices in recent months, Tesla’s sales have slumped with the company on track to record its first annual vehicle sales decline. The company delivered 462,890 vehicles in the third quarter, missing some analysts' estimates but marking the first quarterly increase in sales this year. Tesla also slashed roughly 10% of its global workforce in April.\n\nIncreased competition in the electric vehicle space has squeezed Tesla’s sales even as the company attempts to appeal to more customers with price cuts and offers of free charging. Startup electric vehicle makers such as Rivian are offering customers other products, while traditional auto manufacturers such as Hyundai and Ford have also released lines of electric options.\n\nAlthough consumers have options, concerns over driving range and charging time have contributed to faltering sales of electric vehicles in California. Electric vehicle sales are down in the state after years of growth, a trend that has hit Tesla particularly hard.\n\nMusk has set expectations high for his company, and with the Cybercab is trying to shed a reputation that he makes empty promises. Abuelsamid is doubtful that Tesla will actually deliver on the technology showcased Thursday night in the near future, he said.\n\n“It's Tesla, it's Elon Musk, it's obviously going to be a hype fest,” he said.\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Analyst Sees 26% Upside to Alphabet (GOOG) After New AI Agents Launch",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nVenu Krishna, Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that he is not revising his S&P 500 year-end projection of 5,600 because he believes stock valuations are “full.”\n\n“If you see what’s happening, numbers (earnings)  have been cut sharply going into the end. What is still anchoring the market is big tech, even though their earnings themselves are kind of decelerating. Then seasonality comes into play. October is the weakest month, and you don’t want to get ahead of that.”\n\nAsked whether he does not believe the market really broadened out, Krishna said while there were some signs of market broadening, the “anchor” of the rally remains big tech, which according to him, are just six stocks.\n\nMoving beyond the earnings and valuations debate, another factor still impacting investor sentiment is the Federal Reserve’s next moves.\n\nTalking about the latest Fed minutes released October 9,  Wolfe Research’s Stephanie Roth said on CNBC that a “substantial” majority of Fed officials wanted a 50-basis-point rate cut. However, she said in the next meeting, a 50bps rate cut is “off the table.”\n\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news. With each stock we mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) Cloud Showcases AI Agent Use Cases, Driving Growth\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nGoogle Cloud (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) outlined a variety of artificial intelligence agent use cases during its Google Gemini at Work event on Tuesday.\n\n“We come away from the keynote with increased conviction in the strength of Google’s enterprise generative AI offerings and their emerging contribution to Google Cloud growth,” said Wedbush analysts, led by Scott Devitt, in an investor note. “Google is actively working with enterprise customers to develop AI agents across a variety of use cases.”\n\nSome of the enterprises highlighted include Snap (SNAP), Volkswagen (OTCPK: VWAGY), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Best Buy (BBY). The six primary uses of AI agents employed by enterprises include customer agents, employee agents, code agents, data agents, security agents, and creative agents.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle reported that over 2 million developers are building with Google’s GenAI solutions, and it has seen 36x growth in Gemini API usage on Vertex AI since the beginning of the year. “Google is well positioned to drive adoption of generative AI tools given its AI-optimized compute infrastructure supported by custom silicon, and unmatched breadth of data to develop and train AI models across text, images, and video,” Devitt noted.\n\nWedbush maintains its Outperform rating on Google with a 12-month price target of $205, about 26% higher than the current stock price.\n\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels.  With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market. According to StatCounter report, Bing search engine’s market share only increased from 3.03% in August 2023 to 3.91% in August 2024. This shows MSFT has not been able to make any notable dent in Google’s market share.\n\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet’s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts’ forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)  is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon, Texas Instruments and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Media and technology company Alphabet also continued delivering strong results in its search, YouTube advertising, YouTube subscription and cloud businesses. Shares rose amid an environment that continues favoring mega-cap technology companies.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +4.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 9.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.64 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.7%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.1% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $72.77 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.6%. The $296.54 billion and $330.45 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15.6% and +11.4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "AI 'Godfather' Yoshua Bengio: We're 'creating monsters more powerful than us'",
        "content": "Whether you think artificial intelligence will save the world or end it — there’s no question we’re in a moment of great enthusiasm. AI, as we know, may not have existed without Yoshua Bengio.\n\nCalled the “Godfather of Artificial Intelligence,\" Bengio, 60, is a Canadian computer scientist who has devoted his research to neural networks and deep learning algorithms. His pioneering work has led the way for the AI models we use today — such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude.\n\n\"Intelligence gives power and whoever controls that power — if it's human level or above — is going to be very, very powerful,\" Bengio said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. \"Technology in general, is used by people who want more power: economic dominance, military dominance, political dominance. So before we create technology that could concentrate power in dangerous ways — we need to be very careful.\"\n\nIn 2018, Bengio and two colleagues — former Google (GOOG) VP Geoffrey Hinton (winner of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics), and Meta (META)’s chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun — won the Turing Award (known as the Noble Prize of computing). In 2022, Bengio was the most cited computer scientist in the world. And Time magazine has named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nDespite helping to invent the technology, Bengio has now become a voice of caution in the AI world. That caution comes as investors continue to show a great deal of enthusiasm on the space — bidding up shares of AI plays to fresh records this year.\n\nAI chip darling Nvidia's (NVDA) stock is up 162% year to date, for example, compared to the S&P 500's 21% gain.\n\nThe company is now valued at a staggering $3.25 trillion according to Yahoo Finance data, trailing Apple (AAPL) slightly for the title of most valuable company in the world.\n\nI interviewed Bengio on the possible threats of AI and which tech companies are getting it right.\n\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhy should we be concerned about human-level intelligence?\n\n\"If this falls in the wrong hands, whatever that means, that could be very dangerous. These tools could help terrorists pretty soon, and they could help state actors that wish to destroy our democracies. And then there is the issue that many scientists have been pointing out, which is the way that we're training them now — we don't see clearly how we could avoid these systems becoming autonomous and have their own preservation goals, and we could lose control of these systems. So we're on a path to maybe creating monsters that could be more powerful than us.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOpenAI, Meta, Google, Amazon — Which big AI player is getting it right?\n\n\"Morally, I would say the company that's behaving the best is Anthropic [major investors include Amazon and Google]. But I think they all have biases because of the economic structure in which their survival depends on being among the leading companies, and ideally being the first to arrive at AGI. And that means a race — an arms race between corporations, where the public safety is likely to be the losing objective.\n\nAnthropic is giving a lot of signs that they care a lot about avoiding catastrophic outcomes. They were the first to propose a safety policy where there's a commitment that if the AI ends up having capabilities that could be dangerous, then they would stop that effort. They are also the only ones along with Elon Musk who've been supporting SB 1047. In other words, saying 'yes, with some improvements we agree that having more transparency of the safety procedures and results and liability if we cause major harm'.\n\nThought on the huge run up on AI stocks, like Nvidia?\n\n\"What I think is very certain is the long term trajectory. So if you're in it for the long term, it's a fairly safe bet, except if we don't manage to protect the public... [Then] the reaction could be such that everything could crash right? Either because there's a backlash from societies against AI in general or because really catastrophic things happen and our economic structure crumbles.\n\nEither way, it would be bad for investors. So I think investors, if they were smart, would understand that we need to move cautiously and avoid the kind of mistakes and catastrophes that could harm our future collectively.\"\n\nThought on the AI chips race?\n\n\"I think the chips clearly are becoming an important piece of the puzzle, and of course, it's a bottleneck. It's very likely that the need for humongous amounts of computation is not going to disappear with the kinds of events, the scientific advances I can envision in the coming years, and so it's going to be a strategic value to have high end AI chips capabilities — and all the steps in the supply chain will matter. There are very few companies able to do it right now, so I expect to see a lot more investments going on and hopefully a bit of a diversification.\"\n\nWhat do you think about Salesforce introducing 1 billion autonomous agents by 2026?\n\n\"Autonomy is one of the goals for these companies, and it's a good reason for it economically, commercially, this is going to be a huge breakthrough in terms of the number of applications that this opens up. Think about all the personal assistant applications. It requires a lot more autonomy than what current state of the art systems can provide. So it's understandable they would aim for something like this. The fact that Salesforce (CRM) is thinking they can reach it in two years, for me, is concerning. We need to have guardrails, both in terms of governments and technologically, before that happens.\"\n\nGovernor Newsom vetoed California's SB 1047 — Was that a mistake?\n\n\"He didn't give reasons that made sense to me, like wanting to regulate not only the big systems but all the small ones... There's a possibility that things can move quickly — we talked about a few years. And maybe even if it's a small possibility, like 10% [chance of disaster] we need to be ready. We need to have regulation. We need to have companies already going through the moves of documenting what they're doing in a way that's going to be consistent across the industry.\n\nThe other thing is the companies were worried about lawsuits. I talked to a lot of these companies, but there's already tort law, so there could be lawsuits anytime, if they create harm. And what the bill was doing about liability is reducing the scope of lawsuits... There were 10 conditions, you need to have all of these conditions for the law to support the lawsuit. So I think it was actually helping. But there's an ideological resistance against any involvement — anything that's not the status quo, any more involvement of the state into the affairs of these AI labs.\"\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Here’s Why Alphabet (GOOG) Fell in Q3",
        "content": "Oakmark Funds, advised by Harris Associates, released its “Oakmark Select Fund” third quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The fund returned 8.07% in the third quarter compared to a 5.89% return for the S&P 500 Index. The fund returned 11.76% since its inception compared to the index’s return of 9.82% over the same period. The largest contributing sectors were real estate and financials while the energy sector was the only detractor from performance. In addition, you can check the fund’s top 5 holdings to determine its best picks for 2024.\n\nOakmark Select Fund highlighted stocks like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, offers various platforms and services operating through Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments. The one-month return of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was 3.04%, and its shares gained 17.75% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On October 9, 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock closed at $163.18 per share with a market capitalization of $2.001 trillion.\n\nOakmark Select Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was the top detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-based communication services company’s stock price fell after a U.S. District Court ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by maintaining a monopoly in general search engine services via exclusive distribution agreements. We think this case is unlikely to hurt Alphabet’s valuation over the long term as regulations previously en[1]acted in the European Union to address similar issues did not materially erode the company’s market share. We continue to believe that Alphabet is an attractive investment.\"\n\nPhoto by Firmbee.com on Unsplash\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in 7th position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 165 hedge fund portfolios held Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) at the end of the second quarter which was 165 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc.

        "title": "Why Amazon’s Zoox is taking a different approach to autonomous taxis",
        "content": "While Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk teased details about its robotaxi, called the Cybercab, Amazon’s (AMZN) self-driving subsidiary Zoox has embarked on its own dramatic departure from transportation as we know it.\n\nThe difference is clear from aesthetics alone. Zoox's robot taxi has no steering wheel, no driver’s seat, and no pedals. The four seats face inward, as the toaster-like cabin operates bidirectionally, meaning it can drive both ways.\n\n“It’s a vehicle specifically made for people and not for drivers,” said co-founder and chief technical officer Jesse Levinson. “We realized if there isn't a human driver, you can completely change [the riding experience].”\n\nZoox touts its vehicles as purpose-built, designed specifically for autonomy. Levinson hopes that approach helps propel Zoox to the front of the pack as the company prepares to launch commercial driverless taxi rides in Las Vegas next year. Zoox, a self-driving vehicle owned by Amazon, is seen at the company's factory in Fremont, California, U.S. July 19, 2022. REUTERS/Carlos Barria (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nZoox's entry into the nascent market would pit it against Google’s (GOOG) Waymo, the market leader in robotaxis so far, and Tesla (TSLA), which offered more hints this week about the evolution of its full self-driving technology.\n\nOn Thursday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled the Cybercab prototype at the company's \"We, Robot\" event, saying that the EV maker plans to sell the robotaxi for $30,000 and start production before 2027, though Musk's timelines have been delayed before. It also revealed a Robovan concept capable of transporting 20 people.\n\nBefore the event, Levinson was quick to point out that the technology Zoox uses is entirely different from that of Tesla. Unlike the Amazon-owned firm, which uses a network of sensors, cameras, and mics, Tesla relies on a camera-based vision system, which is seen as more affordable. Musk has also pushed for the cars to be able to operate in any environment, unlike Google's Waymo, which digitally maps the routes it operates in with a human behind the wheel first before the autonomous cars are deployed. Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk rides in Tesla's robotaxi at an unveiling event in Los Angeles, California, on Oct. 10, 2024. Tesla/Handout via REUTERS (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nMore consequentially, according to Levinson, Tesla’s autopilot currently uses a driver assistance system, which requires drivers to retake control of the car at any time. That’s fundamentally different from the autonomy-first approach that Zoox is taking, he said.\n\n“It might sound like that's a small difference, but it's actually a giant difference because it means that no matter what's happening in your environment, and it means no matter what's going wrong with your sensors or if they're covered up or if they're occluded, or even if they fail, you still have to be able to keep driving safely,” he said. “Teslas and passenger cars today, they're just not designed that way. And so it's a really, a very different hardware and software product entirely.”\n\nStory continues\n\nZoox's robotaxi model\n\nAutonomous cars remain an intriguing ambition for tech companies, despite delays in the wider rollout of driverless taxi services. Consulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimates the global robotaxi market could generate as much as $1.3 trillion in revenue by 2030.\n\nBut implementation has been fragmented, with commercial operations limited to a handful of cities. Companies that have successfully made it to market have opted to retrofit cars intended for drivers to achieve full autonomy.\n\nZoox’s approach pivots away from that model. The company has specifically relied on a sensor suite that includes lidar, radar, and cameras to navigate a limited stretch of roads. The vehicles, built in-house, include a sound bar surrounding the cabin, with mics built into the interior and exterior of the vehicle, in part to enhance the detection of emergency vehicle sirens.\n\nWhile Zoox assembles vehicles at its own manufacturing facility in California, the company purchases large modules from suppliers to control overall costs tied to automotive manufacturing, according to the firm. Zoox, a self-driving vehicle owned by Amazon, is displayed during a media tour at the company's factory in Fremont, Calif., on July 19, 2022. REUTERS/Carlos Barria (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nLevinson said vehicles are equipped with redundancies for critical components to ensure safety. There are two braking systems, two steering racks, two batteries, two motors, and four sensor pods in each corner.\n\n\"If any one of those components has a hardware or software failure, not only is it still safe, but we can actually keep driving and take the customer to their destination,\" Levinson said. \"Just like if there's a component failure on an airplane, you still land the plane, you don't drop out of the sky.\"\n\nThose redundancies are coupled with human technicians, who monitor the vehicles for safety. While the cars operate fully autonomously, technicians step in on rare occasions to guide the vehicle when it encounters unfamiliar situations, like construction zones, according to Levinson.\n\n\"The vehicles are only getting help from humans only 1% of the time,\" Levinson said. \"As it gets more sophisticated, the amount of time they’re asking for help goes down and down and down and down. We don’t think it ever truly gets to zero, but it doesn’t have to get to zero. It just has to go down to something that’s very small.\"\n\nFor now, Levinson said he’s confident that Zoox is on the right track for the future. It is on target to expand beyond its 5-mile test loop in Las Vegas, with commercial service set to launch in 2025.\n\n“In the long term, more and more companies will converge on something like this,” he said, pointing to his vehicle, “where you've really imagined the experience without needing all the legacy of a car.”\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) may be the world's largest company, with a $3.4 trillion market cap, but that doesn't mean it will retain that place forever. Some cracks in Apple's armor could make it vulnerable, allowing other companies to pass Apple in market cap.\n\nHere are three stocks that could be worth more than Apple five years from now.\n\nWhat's wrong with Apple?\n\nApple isn't the company it used to be. It used to be at the forefront of innovation and consistently released game-changing products. It hasn't done that for some time, and even the latest iPhone (iPhone 16) seems to be struggling despite its much-hyped Apple Intelligence features.\n\nAll of this adds up to a business that hasn't grown its sales since 2022. AAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nDespite that, Apple's stock fetches a premium valuation, trading for 30.5 times forward earnings.\n\nThat's a premium price tag for a company that hasn't grown at all, leaving it susceptible to other stocks surpassing it. If it doesn't show growth soon, the premium will not be maintained.\n\nPlenty of other stocks could surpass Apple if this happens, and all of them are likely better investments right now.\n\nNvidia and Alphabet are within striking distance\n\nFive years from now, the three companies that I think can pass Apple are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). These three are obvious choices, as they round out the rest of the top four largest companies in the world.\n\nUnderstanding why these three could surpass Apple is key, as they all have different reasons.\n\nStarting with the second-largest company, Nvidia, it is nipping at Apple's heels. It's only 5% away from dethroning Apple, and with the massive demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used for artificial intelligence (AI) model creation, it's nearly a surefire bet to be larger than Apple.\n\nDespite its incredible growth this year, Wall Street still expects 42% revenue growth for fiscal year 2026 (ending January 2026). That far exceeds anything Apple will put up, but Nvidia trades for 47 times forward earnings -- a far greater price tag than investors are paying for Apple.\n\nIt will take some time for this premium to come down, but I think it's possible over the course of five years.\n\nMicrosoft is next in line, only 11% away from the top spot. Microsoft has been a stalwart, growing revenue by more than 15% over the past year. It also rides on the back of AI, with its cloud computing division, Azure, leading the way for the company. It trades for 31.5 times forward earnings, nearly identical to Apple's price tag.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Microsoft actually has the growth to support this valuation. So, as the market comes to its senses with Apple stock, don't be surprised to see Microsoft pass Apple in market cap.\n\nWhile Nvidia and Microsoft could easily surpass Apple in the next few years, Alphabet's chances are slightly lower.\n\nAlphabet needs help from a valuation standpoint to pass Apple\n\nAlphabet's case rests on its premium increase and Apple's decrease. Alphabet's revenue growth has been in the low teens for the past year, which places it far above Apple.\n\nHowever, Alphabet doesn't fetch the premium Apple does and trades for 21.5 times forward earnings. That's cheaper than the S&P 500, which trades at 23.5 times forward earnings. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIf Alphabet were to fetch the same premium as Apple (30.5 times forward earnings), it would have 42% upside. That would give it a $2.88 trillion market cap, only 19% away from Apple. If Alphabet continues its pattern of growth and Apple continues its pattern of stagnation, that would be an easy gap to close over five years, allowing Alphabet to surpass Apple.\n\nAdditionally, Apple's premium could decrease to the market average, which would provide a similar effect to Alphabet's rise.\n\nI think there is a strong chance Apple is worth less than these three if it doesn't start growing sales soon. If it launches a new product that's a hit, then these projections likely won't hold true.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has asked Alphabet's Google and Apple to block Chinese fast fashion e-commerce firm Temu in their application stores in the country so it cannot be downloaded, a minister said on Friday.\n\nThe move was intended to pre-emptively protect the country's small and medium-sized businesses against cheap products being offered by PDD Holdings' Temu, communications minister Budi Arie Setiadi told Reuters, even though authorities have not found any transactions yet by its residents on the platform.\n\nTemu's rapid growth has triggered scrutiny over its low-cost business model of sending parcels to customers from China by several countries.\n\nTemu's business model, which connects consumers directly with factories in China in order to significantly reduce prices, is \"unhealthy competition,\" Budi said.\n\n\"We're not here to protect e-commerce, but we protect small and medium enterprises. There are millions we must protect,\" the minister said.\n\nJakarta will also block any investment by Temu in local e-commerce if it makes such a move, Budi said, adding he has not heard of any such plan.\n\nBudi also said the government plans to request a similar block for Chinese shopping service Shein.\n\nTemu, Shein, Apple and Google did not respond to requests to comment. Temu can still be downloaded in app stores in Indonesia.\n\nIndonesia forced China's ByteDance social media platform TikTok to close its e-commerce service in the country last year to protect local merchants and users' data.\n\nMonths later, TikTok agreed to buy a majority stake in Indonesian tech conglomerate GoTo's e-commerce unit in order to stay in Southeast Asia's biggest e-commerce market.\n\nOn Tuesday, Indonesian homegrown e-commerce Bukalapak.com denied reports about an acquisition plan by Temu.\n\nIndonesia's e-commerce industry is set to expand to about $160 billion by 2030 from $62 billion in 2023, according to a report by Google, Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings and consultancy Bain & Co.\n\n(Reporting by Ananda Teresia; Editing by Kim Coghill)",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI News You Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\n\nThe AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification.\n\nAnother notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "title": "AI is having its Nobel moment. Do scientists need the tech industry to sustain it?",
        "content": "Hours after the artificial intelligence pioneer Geoffrey Hinton won a Nobel Prize in physics, he drove a rented car to Google's California headquarters to celebrate.\n\nHinton doesn't work at Google anymore. Nor did the longtime professor at the University of Toronto do his pioneering research at the tech giant.\n\nBut his impromptu party reflected AI's moment as a commercial blockbuster that has also reached the pinnacles of scientific recognition.\n\nThat was Tuesday. Then, early Wednesday, two employees of Google's AI division won a Nobel Prize in chemistry for using AI to predict and design novel proteins.\n\n“This is really a testament to the power of computer science and artificial intelligence,” said Jeanette Wing, a professor of computer science at Columbia University.\n\nAsked about the historic back-to-back science awards for AI work in an email Wednesday, Hinton said only: “Neural networks are the future.”\n\nIt didn't always seem that way for researchers who decades ago experimented with interconnected computer nodes inspired by neurons in the human brain. Hinton shares this year's physics Nobel with another scientist, John Hopfield, for helping develop those building blocks of machine learning.\n\nNeural network advances came from “basic, curiosity-driven research,” Hinton said at a press conference after his win. “Not out of throwing money at applied problems, but actually letting scientists follow their curiosity to try and understand things.”\n\nSuch work started well before Google existed. But a bountiful tech industry has now made it easier for AI scientists to pursue their ideas even as it has challenged them with new ethical questions about the societal impacts of their work.\n\nOne reason why the current wave of AI research is so closely tied to the tech industry is that only a handful of corporations have the resources to build the most powerful AI systems.\n\n“These discoveries and this capability could not happen without humongous computational power and humongous amounts of digital data,” Wing said. “There are very few companies — tech companies — that have that kind of computational power. Google is one. Microsoft is another.”\n\nThe chemistry Nobel Prize awarded Wednesday went to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper of Google’s London-based DeepMind laboratory along with researcher David Baker at the University of Washington for work that could help discover new medicines.\n\nHassabis, the CEO and co-founder of DeepMind, which Google acquired in 2014, said Wednesday his dream was to model his research laboratory on the “incredible storied history” of Bell Labs. Started in 1925, the New Jersey-based industrial lab was the workplace of multiple Nobel-winning scientists over several decades who helped develop modern computing and telecommunications.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I wanted to recreate a modern day industrial research lab that really did cutting-edge research,” Hassabis said. “But of course, that needs a lot of patience and a lot of support. We’ve had that from Google and it’s been amazing.”\n\nHinton joined Google late in his career and quit last year so he could talk more freely about his concerns about AI’s dangers, particularly what happens if humans lose control of machines that become smarter than us. But he stops short of criticizing his former employer.\n\nHinton, 76, said he was staying in a cheap hotel in Palo Alto, California when the Nobel committee woke him up with a phone call early Tuesday morning, leading him to cancel a medical appointment scheduled for later that day.\n\nBy the time the sleep-deprived scientist reached the Google campus in nearby Mountain View, he “seemed pretty lively and not very tired at all” as colleagues popped bottles of champagne, said computer scientist Richard Zemel, a former doctoral student of Hinton’s who joined him at the Google party Tuesday.\n\n“Obviously there are these big companies now that are trying to cash in on all the commercial success and that is exciting,” said Zemel, now a Columbia professor.\n\nBut Zemel said what’s more important to Hinton and his closest colleagues has been what the Nobel recognition means to the fundamental research they spent decades trying to advance.\n\nGuests included Google executives and another former Hinton student, Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder and former chief scientist and board member at ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Sutskever helped lead a group of board members who briefly ousted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last year in turmoil that has symbolized the industry's conflicts.\n\nAn hour before the party, Hinton used his Nobel bully pulpit to throw shade at OpenAI during opening remarks at a virtual press conference organized by the University of Toronto in which he thanked former mentors and students.\n\n“I’m particularly proud of the fact that one of my students fired Sam Altman,” Hinton said.\n\nAsked to elaborate, Hinton said OpenAI started with a primary objective to develop better-than-human artificial general intelligence “and ensure that it was safe.”\n\n\"And over time, it turned out that Sam Altman was much less concerned with safety than with profits. And I think that’s unfortunate,” Hinton said.\n\nIn response, OpenAI said in a statement that it is “proud of delivering the most capable and safest AI systems” and that they “safely serve hundreds of millions of people each week.”\n\nConflicts are likely to persist in a field where building even a relatively modest AI system requires resources “well beyond those of your typical research university,” said Michael Kearns, a professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nBut Kearns, who sits on the committee that picks the winners of computer science's top prize — the Turing Award — said this week marks a “great victory for interdisciplinary research” that was decades in the making.\n\nHinton is only the second person to win both a Nobel and Turing. The first, Turing-winning political scientist Herbert Simon, started working on what he called “computer simulation of human cognition” in the 1950s and won the Nobel economics prize in 1978 for his study of organizational decision-making.\n\nWing, who met Simon in her early career, said scientists are still just at the tip of finding ways to apply computing's most powerful capabilities to other fields.\n\n“We’re just at the beginning in terms of scientific discovery using AI,” she said.\n\n——\n\nAP Business Writer Kelvin Chan contributed to this report.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tesla’s (TSLA) Robotaxi Launch Comes with Opportunities and Risks",
        "content": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), the leading EV maker in the United States, is scheduled to debut its highly anticipated robotaxi on October 10 at a special event named We, Robot at Warner Bros. (WBD) Studios in California. The launch of Cybercab, the robotaxi, will present Tesla with new opportunities and risks as the company gears up to navigate stiff competition from the likes of Waymo and increased regulatory scrutiny for its full self-driving technology. Despite short-term risks, I am bullish on Tesla as I believe the company’s technological investments will pave the way for robust long-term earnings growth.\n\nWe, Robot Is More than Just Robotaxis\n\nTesla’s robotaxi, Cybercab, is likely to be a two-seater compact vehicle with a stainless steel finish. The company is expected to introduce a prototype for the Cybercab tomorrow. Tesla is also expected to announce the timing of production and the planned number of vehicles for the next couple of years, giving investors an idea about the investments required to mass produce Cybercabs to pursue a future as a robotaxi company.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, Tesla is likely to announce a dual approach to monetize autonomous ridesharing by unveiling a supervised autonomous ridesharing service alongside the highly anticipated fully autonomous ridesharing platform. In addition, according to Deepwater Asset Management, the event would not be all about robotaxis. The investment management company co-founded by Gene Munster believes Tesla will preview its low-cost EV during this event. Deepwater predicts this low-cost model to be named Model 2 and start at a price of $25,000.\n\nThis would be a major development for Tesla as the company has been under pressure in global markets due to its inability to compete with low-cost EVs launched by Chinese automakers. In fact, BYD Company Limited (BYDDF) surpassed Tesla last year to become the best-selling EV brand in the world. Deepwater also expects Tesla to introduce a Cybervan, a fully autonomous passenger van capable of transporting 8-10 people.\n\nTesla Will Benefit from Autonomous Ridesharing Growth\n\nOne of the key factors behind my bullish stance on Tesla is the company’s potential to emerge as a leader in the global autonomous ridesharing market, which is expected to grow exponentially in the next decade. According to Global Market Insights, this industry was valued at just $910 million in 2023 but is projected to grow at a stellar annual rate of 64% through 2032, lifting the market value to almost $66 billion.\n\nThe growing regulatory support around the world and technological advancements will play key roles in this expected growth. The rapid urbanization in populous regions calls for efficient transportation solutions, and autonomous ridesharing has been identified as one possible solution to address this demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne major advantage Tesla has over its peers is its access to real-world self-driving data. According to Ark Invest’s estimates, Tesla customers drive approximately 5 million miles per day in FSD mode compared to just 70,000 miles for Waymo. This access to real-world data should enable Tesla to scale faster by investing in technological upgrades, potentially helping the company capture a meaningful share of the autonomous ridesharing market.\n\nCommercialization of Robotaxis Will Face Challenges\n\nAlthough I am bullish on Tesla’s robotaxi prospects, the company is likely to face a few challenges as it attempts to commercialize the Cybercab. One major challenge is the stiff competition in the industry. Google-owned Waymo has already made its presence felt in a few U.S. cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Austin. Last month, Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana announced on LinkedIn that Waymo had surpassed 100,000 paid trips per week, which highlights the traction that the autonomous ridehailing platform has gained in the recent past.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL), Waymo’s parent, recently announced a $5 billion investment in the self-driving car business, which is an indication that big tech giants are gearing up to aggressively invest in autonomous driving, threatening Tesla’s path to commercialization. In addition to Waymo, Tesla faces competition from several other self-driving startups, such as Cruise, owned by General Motors (GM), and Zoox, acquired by Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN). In global markets, the biggest competition stems from Chinese Internet giant Baidu (BIDU), which has made stellar progress with its self-driving unit, Apollo Go.\n\nAnother challenge that Tesla would face is continued pressure on operating margins as the company will be forced to invest aggressively to upgrade manufacturing plants to support mass production of robotaxis. Potential factory downtime required to upgrade facilities may exacerbate this challenge. Still, I believe Tesla’s vertically integrated business model, which allows the company to manage costs efficiently while investing in self-driving technology, will help the company offer autonomous rides at a more affordable cost than many of its competitors in the long run, paving the way for competitive advantages.\n\nIs Tesla a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?\n\nTesla seems well-positioned to benefit from the launch of robotaxis in the long term despite facing several challenges on the path toward commercialization. However, RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan believes it’s too early to be excited about the robotaxi launch, given that this is a very long-term play. However, he believes the robotaxi business unit will account for half of Tesla’s valuation in the long term, which reveals his positive long-term stance on this business unit.\n\nCFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson also believes the short-term optimism on robotaxis may be displaced since a true driverless taxi is many years away. In a note yesterday, the analyst claimed that Tesla still has a long way to go to achieve Level 4 autonomy.\n\nOverall, based on the ratings of 35 Wall Street analysts, the average Tesla price target is $207.83, which implies downside of 15% from the current market price.\n\nWhile I acknowledge some of the short-term challenges limiting Tesla’s growth, I believe the company will continue to grow at a stellar pace in the next decade, aided by its strong market position in the North American EV sector, the expected success of its energy storage business, and the diversification into robotaxis.\n\nTakeaway\n\nTesla is expected to introduce its robotaxi prototype on October 10, marking the most important product unveil since the Model 3 launch, according to CEO Elon Musk. The company may face several commercialization challenges for the robotaxi, but the long-term outlook is promising. Tesla seems well-positioned to enjoy durable competitive advantages in the EV space and the autonomous ridesharing market, which should pave the way for robust earnings growth.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Martin Coulter\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - The man charged with overseeing Google’s operations in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia has stepped down after a decade in post.\n\nMatt Brittin first joined the tech giant as head of UK and Ireland operations in 2007, before rising through the ranks to become vice president of northern and central Europe, and then EMEA president in 2014.\n\nPrior to his time at Google, Brittin spent several years working as a consultant for McKinsey & Co, as well as a stint as commercial director Trinity Mirror, later rebranded as Reach PLC.\n\nIn a post announcing his departure on social media platform LinkedIn, Brittin praised colleagues whose AI advances this week won the Nobel prize for chemistry, and shared advice one of Google’s co-founders gave him when he arrived at the company.\n\n“When I joined Google in January 2007, Larry Page advised me to ‘put the best people you can on important work, and get out of the way.’ It’s been the privilege of my life to try to honour this - working with brilliant teams to help build tech that makes the world better,” he wrote.\n\nBrittin said he would continue running Google’s EMEA operations until a successor had been chosen.\n\n(Reporting by Martin Coulter; Editing by David Gregorio)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Alphyn Capital Management, an investment management firm, released its third-quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The Master Account of the fund returned 8.9% net in the third quarter compared to 5.9% for the S&P500 Index. As of September 30, 2024, the top ten holdings accounted for approximately 71% of the portfolio, and approximately 9% of the portfolio was held in cash. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nAlphyn Capital Management highlighted stocks like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, offers various platforms and services operating through Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments. The one-month return of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was 4.83%, and its shares gained 16.23% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On October 9, 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock closed at $163.06 per share with a market capitalization of $1.999 trillion.\n\nAlphyn Capital Management stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) solid quarterly performance, with revenue growth of 14% and improved margins improving from 29% to 32%, has been overshadowed by ongoing investor concerns regarding future capital expenditures for AI and antitrust risks.\n\nIn August, a federal judge ruled that Google illegally monopolized the search and advertising markets in the United States by using exclusive agreements with browser developers, smartphone makers, and wireless carriers. A second trial is scheduled for 2025 to determine enforcement remedies, with a final decision not likely before 2026, given the strong likelihood of Alphabet appealing any decision. Potential remedies may include making search engine data available to competitors and ending agreements to secure its search engine as a default on mobile devices. For example, Alphabet currently pays $20 billion annually for Google to be the default search engine on Apple products. Although regulatory challenges are never positive, Google’s strong brand and consumer preference have limited the impact of previous restrictions. In Europe, Russia, and Turkey, Google search market share declined by only 2%, 7%, and 12%, respectively, when regulators limited its use as the default option.\n\nAnother trial focuses on Alphabet’s Ad Tech platform, where the DOJ alleges that the company has monopolized the digital advertising market. Closing arguments are expected in the coming weeks, and a ruling against Alphabet could undermine Google’s dominance in the online advertising ecosystem. Additionally, after the end of the quarter, Alphabet was ordered to open its Android operating system to rivals, allowing them to establish their own app marketplaces and payment systems to compete with Google Play Store. This followed a loss to Epic Games, the developer behind Fortnite, in a December ruling last year. I will continue to monitor these developments and respond accordingly.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in 7th position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 165 hedge fund portfolios held Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) at the end of the second quarter which was 165 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc.

        "title": "AMD's AI product event likely to be 'a fade-the-news event' says analyst",
        "content": "Investing.com -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is set to host its \"Advancing AI\" event this week, where analysts expect to hear about new product announcements that could lift sales and drive the chipmaker’s stock price.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts at Lynx Equity Strategies believe this will be “a fade-the-news event.”\n\n“AMD stock has had a modest run-up over the past week on investor expectations for clarity on MI325X and its follow-ons. We think investors are likely to be disappointed,” they emphasized.\n\nLynx’s team is skeptical about AMD's ability to close the gap with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), noting that the latter continues to dominate the market. Despite AMD’s ambitious claims at the MI300X launch nearly a year ago, it has made minimal progress in challenging NVIDIA’s stronghold.\n\n\"We do not expect MI325X to change the narrative meaningfully,\" the analysts state, suggesting that AMD is likely to “remain a distant second” to its rival.\n\nWhile AMD is expected to highlight developments in data center CPUs and AI PCs, Lynx believes investor attention will remain firmly on the MI-series. The analysts warn that unless AMD can demonstrate a clear driver for market share gains, the stock could potentially retest its yearly lows.\n\nAfter AMD’s Computex presentation a few months ago, there was some optimism around the company’s next-gen data center GPUs, especially given the higher HBM density on AMD's MI325X—288GB compared to NVIDIA's 141GB on the H200.\n\nHowever, Lynx notes that customer traction has been weak in the months since. Although AMD management may boast superior benchmark results compared to NVIDIA’s Hopper series, the firm’s analysts remain unconvinced, noting that \"while running real workloads in the field, we think MI300X continues to trail NVDA’s H100.\"\n\n“We do not expect MI325X to change the narrative meaningfully. Superior HBM density is merely one of the factors at work; the software stack, backplane networking and power consumption matter just as much,” analysts continued.\n\nThey believe AMD has high hopes for the MI325X and is expanding its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity in anticipation of future demand. Notably, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s strong guidance for its ethernet connectivity business at GPU-based AI data centers next year could indicate growing demand from AMD AI servers. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also appears to be a key customer, though Lynx remains uncertain about “who the needle-movers are.”\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which endorsed AMD’s launch of MI300X last year, may have seen its commitment to AMD diminish recently.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We believe META may have firmed up its plans for internally developed silicon as a future alternative to NVDA. And Amazon/AWS too, we doubt if AMD is seen as a viable alternative to NVDA,” Lynx explains.\n\nThe firm also mentions Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) as a potential customer, along with interest from enterprises, but it cautions that the MI-series, along with its software stack, may not be the plug-and-play solution AMD has marketed it as.\n\n“Outside of MSFT we do not believe end customers are likely to spend resources to help bridge the gap as it is unclear what would be the payoff,” said the analysts.\n\n“We expect the stock to trade down after the event today and likely to revisit the lows of the year.”\n\nAs for potential surprises at the event, Lynx suggests that while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) might be announced as new customers, this would likely be limited to externally facing cloud instances.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAMD's AI product event likely to be 'a fade-the-news event' says analyst\n\nUS futures extend losses after higher-than-expected inflation data\n\nUBS downgrades Nutrien to 'neutral' on weak Ag outlook, lowers PT to $51\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Could Be Worth Watching",
        "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$191 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$149. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Alphabet's current trading price of US$162 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Alphabet’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nIs Alphabet Still Cheap?\n\nGood news, investors! Alphabet is still a bargain right now. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $242.70, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Alphabet’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat does the future of Alphabet look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Alphabet's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 47%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since GOOGL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GOOGL for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy GOOGL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Alphabet from their most recent forecasts.

        "title": "Tesla gambles on ‘black box’ AI tech for robotaxis",
        "content": "By Norihiko Shirouzu and Chris Kirkham\n\n(Reuters) - Tesla aims to stun investors Thursday night with its long-awaited “robotaxi unveil,\" a potential milestone after a decade of Elon Musk’s unfulfilled promises to deliver self-driving vehicles.\n\nThe automaker is widely expected to showcase a prototype called the \"Cybercab\" rather than a road-ready driverless taxi.\n\nConvincing regulators and passengers of the vehicle’s safety could prove much harder and take much longer — while its main competitors, such as Alphabet’s Waymo, expand robotaxi fleets they're already operating in select cities today.\n\nTesla has to date pursued a different technological path than all of its major self-driving rivals - one with potentially higher rewards but also higher risks to both its business and its passengers, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen executives, consultants and academics specializing in self-driving technology and three former Tesla autonomous-vehicle engineers.\n\nTesla's strategy relies solely on a combination of “computer vision,” which aims to use cameras the way humans use eyes, with an artificial-intelligence technology called end-to-end machine learning that instantly translates the images into driving decisions.\n\nThat technology already underpins its \"Full Self-Driving\" driver-assistance feature that, despite its name, can't be operated safely without a human driver. Musk has said Tesla is using the same approach to develop fully autonomous robotaxis.\n\nTesla’s competitors - including Waymo, Amazon’s Zoox, General Motors’ Cruise and a host of Chinese firms - use the same technology but typically layer on redundant systems and sensors such as radar, lidar and sophisticated mapping to ensure safety and win regulatory approval for their driverless vehicles.\n\nTesla's strategy is simpler, and much cheaper, but has two critical weaknesses, industry executives, autonomous-vehicle experts and one of the Tesla engineers told Reuters. Without the layered technologies used by its peers, Tesla's system struggles more with so-called \"edge cases\" — rare driving scenarios that self-driving systems and their human engineers struggle to anticipate.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe other major challenge: The end-to-end AI technology is a “black box,” the Tesla engineer said, making it “nearly impossible” to “see what went wrong when it misbehaves and causes an accident.” The inability to precisely identify such failures, he said, makes it difficult to safeguard against them.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment on its technology.\n\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang used the same “black box” description in an interview to describe the weaknesses of end-to-end technology, without specifically addressing Tesla's system. End-to-end artificial intelligence involves training a computer to make decisions directly from raw data, with no intermediate steps requiring additional engineering or programming.\n\nNvidia, the world’s leading producer of AI-computing chips, also uses end-to-end technology in autonomous-driving systems it's developing and plans to sell to automakers. But Nvidia, Huang told Reuters, combines that approach with more conventional computing systems and additional sensors such as radar and lidar.\n\nThe end-to-end technology usually — but not always — makes the best driving decisions, said Huang, which is why Nvidia takes a more conservative approach. “We have to build the future step-by-step,” he said. “We cannot go directly to the future. It's too unsafe.”\n\nROBOTAXI PIVOT\n\nTesla's ability to deliver robotaxis has taken on heightened importance this year as its sales and profits have declined amid softening electric-vehicle demand globally and fierce competition from rising Chinese EV makers.\n\nIf Tesla can overcome the technical challenges of its autonomous strategy, the payoff could be enormous. While competitors like Waymo already have robotaxis on the road, they're operating far more expensive vehicles in relatively small, comprehensively mapped zones.\n\nTesla aims to sell affordable robotaxis that can drive themselves anywhere.\n\nMusk has a long history of bold promises about self-driving cars. In 2016, he predicted drivers would be able to summon their vehicles from across the country within two years. In 2019, Musk predicted Tesla would produce operational robotaxis by 2020.\n\nThe announcement of this week's robotaxi reveal came on April 5, the day Reuters exclusively reported that Tesla had abandoned plans to build a $25,000 electric vehicle for the masses known informally as the Model 2, initially sending Tesla shares down. Musk responded by posting later that day on his X social-media platform: “Robotaxi unveil on 8/8,” sparking intense investor speculation. Tesla later delayed the event until this week.\n\nThat April day marked a fundamental shift in Musk’s stated priorities.

        "title": "Tesla gambles on ‘black box’ AI tech for robotaxis",
        "content": "By Norihiko Shirouzu and Chris Kirkham\n\n(Reuters) - Tesla aims to stun investors Thursday night with its long-awaited “robotaxi unveil,\" a potential milestone after a decade of Elon Musk’s unfulfilled promises to deliver self-driving vehicles.\n\nThe automaker is widely expected to showcase a prototype called the \"Cybercab\" rather than a road-ready driverless taxi.\n\nConvincing regulators and passengers of the vehicle’s safety could prove much harder and take much longer — while its main competitors, such as Alphabet’s Waymo, expand robotaxi fleets they're already operating in select cities today.\n\nTesla has to date pursued a different technological path than all of its major self-driving rivals - one with potentially higher rewards but also higher risks to both its business and its passengers, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen executives, consultants and academics specializing in self-driving technology and three former Tesla autonomous-vehicle engineers.\n\nTesla's strategy relies solely on a combination of “computer vision,” which aims to use cameras the way humans use eyes, with an artificial-intelligence technology called end-to-end machine learning that instantly translates the images into driving decisions.\n\nThat technology already underpins its \"Full Self-Driving\" driver-assistance feature that, despite its name, can't be operated safely without a human driver. Musk has said Tesla is using the same approach to develop fully autonomous robotaxis.\n\nTesla’s competitors - including Waymo, Amazon’s Zoox, General Motors’ Cruise and a host of Chinese firms - use the same technology but typically layer on redundant systems and sensors such as radar, lidar and sophisticated mapping to ensure safety and win regulatory approval for their driverless vehicles.\n\nTesla's strategy is simpler, and much cheaper, but has two critical weaknesses, industry executives, autonomous-vehicle experts and one of the Tesla engineers told Reuters. Without the layered technologies used by its peers, Tesla's system struggles more with so-called \"edge cases\" — rare driving scenarios that self-driving systems and their human engineers struggle to anticipate.\n\nThe other major challenge: The end-to-end AI technology is a “black box,” the Tesla engineer said, making it “nearly impossible” to “see what went wrong when it misbehaves and causes an accident.” The inability to precisely identify such failures, he said, makes it difficult to safeguard against them.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment on its technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang used the same “black box” description in an interview to describe the weaknesses of end-to-end technology, without specifically addressing Tesla's system. End-to-end artificial intelligence involves training a computer to make decisions directly from raw data, with no intermediate steps requiring additional engineering or programming.\n\nNvidia, the world’s leading producer of AI-computing chips, also uses end-to-end technology in autonomous-driving systems it's developing and plans to sell to automakers. But Nvidia, Huang told Reuters, combines that approach with more conventional computing systems and additional sensors such as radar and lidar.\n\nThe end-to-end technology usually — but not always — makes the best driving decisions, said Huang, which is why Nvidia takes a more conservative approach. “We have to build the future step-by-step,” he said. “We cannot go directly to the future. It's too unsafe.”\n\nROBOTAXI PIVOT\n\nTesla's ability to deliver robotaxis has taken on heightened importance this year as its sales and profits have declined amid softening electric-vehicle demand globally and fierce competition from rising Chinese EV makers.\n\nIf Tesla can overcome the technical challenges of its autonomous strategy, the payoff could be enormous. While competitors like Waymo already have robotaxis on the road, they're operating far more expensive vehicles in relatively small, comprehensively mapped zones.\n\nTesla aims to sell affordable robotaxis that can drive themselves anywhere.\n\nMusk has a long history of bold promises about self-driving cars. In 2016, he predicted drivers would be able to summon their vehicles from across the country within two years. In 2019, Musk predicted Tesla would produce operational robotaxis by 2020.\n\nThe announcement of this week's robotaxi reveal came on April 5, the day Reuters exclusively reported that Tesla had abandoned plans to build a $25,000 electric vehicle for the masses known informally as the Model 2, initially sending Tesla shares down. Musk responded by posting later that day on his X social-media platform: “Robotaxi unveil on 8/8,” sparking intense investor speculation. Tesla later delayed the event until this week.\n\nThat April day marked a fundamental shift in Musk’s stated priorities. He had previously promised to make Tesla a Toyota-sized EV giant, an expectation that underpinned Tesla’s soaring stock price, making it the world’s most valuable automaker. Now he vowed to dominate self-driving tech.\n\nAbrupt cost-cutting measures followed, including mass layoffs, as Musk diverted investment away from EV-manufacturing priorities such as battery development, gigacasting, and expansion of the automaker’s Supercharger network.\n\nThe retreat from mass-market EVs only intensified investor pressure on Tesla’s autonomous-vehicle development. Musk leaned into the scrutiny, saying in April that anyone doubting Tesla will “solve autonomy” shouldn’t invest in the company.\n\nNicholas Mersch, portfolio manager at Purpose Investments, a Tesla investor, said Musk \"has a lot of convincing to do.\"\n\nStill, Mersch called Musk's autonomy strategy a \"really bold bet\" with a potentially immense payoff, even if it takes Tesla substantially more time to crack the code. \"You have to keep the big picture in mind, in terms of how much iterative innovation is happening\" at Tesla, he said. \"I wouldn't discount them.\"\n\nDATA DRIVEN\n\nFor now, unlike its robotaxi competitors, Tesla only offers semi-autonomous solutions in its \"Autopilot\" and \"Full Self-Driving\" features.

        "title": "Wall Street shrugs at Google’s legal setbacks isn't denial, it's pragmatism: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nIt’s been a tough week in court for Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nA day after a California judge ruled the company has to open Android to third-party app stores, the Justice Department, in another case, said it may propose that the tech giant sell off a part of its business, like the Chrome browser or Android, to break up its search dominance.\n\nAnd how did Wall Street react to a potentially seismic event that could forever reshape the tech landscape? With a shrug — Google shares sank less than 2% Wednesday after the DOJ’s breakup recommendation.\n\nPart of the muted reaction has to do with the sluggish pace of legal proceedings. Even if judges rule against Google in every subsequent decision, the ultimate adverse outcome is still years away. But Wall Street also wagers that such a drastic decision would be so difficult to implement and so destructive in its consequences that a more modest remedy is likelier.\n\nLike separating conjoined twins, cutting off Google’s intertwined businesses poses immense challenges, and it almost seems hard to believe. And many still don't.\n\n“The street is looking at this and thinking despite all the scary headlines and noise that the chances of a breakup are minimal,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.\n\nInvestors are largely looking past Google’s legal troubles, cleaving instead to Mountain View’s vision for growth, powered by its cloud business, AI initiatives, and advertising empire.\n\nIn a 32-page proposal, lawyers for the Justice Department outlined a framework of options for how the court should dismantle Google’s monopoly power in search. The potential remedies spanned from the harshest — breaking the company apart — to more limited plans, such as forcing Google into a data-sharing arrangement with rival search providers. But even as the most severe remedy is on the table, investors are still waiting for more guidance before making any big moves. In that reading, what may initially seem like denial reads pragmatic.\n\n“We think Google’s valuation at the moment largely discounts most of the associated regulatory risks but the market is looking for greater clarity on pending issues before bidding the stock in one direction over another,” said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. FILE - Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., May 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nGoogle’s year-to-date stock performance has lagged behind most of its Magnificent Seven peers, sitting in fifth place up about 15% and trailing the broader market’s gains of about 21%. So it may be that Wall Street has already priced in the regulatory risks. What’s more, an outcome that mandates Google change its business practices, rather than divest, could push the stock higher if investors see the ruling as a merciful punishment.\n\nStory continues\n\n“If regulators use a light touch on Google, it could act as a catalyst and help the company’s stock multiple,” said Zino.\n\nThe subdued market reaction also reflects a more cautious “wait and see” posture from investors. On Nov. 20, the DOJ is expected to provide a more detailed document outlining the remedies.\n\n“Overall, we do not believe the high-level framework changes much for Google shares near-term,” JPMorgan said in a note Wednesday, adding that over the next few weeks Wall Street’s focus will shift to earnings and to the more substantive November filing.\n\nGoogle will also get a chance to reply in court. For now, the company described the government’s proposals as “radical and sweeping,\" rife with unintended consequences that will hurt consumers and American innovation. Google Search is so enmeshed in how people use the web, it would be unthinkable to fundamentally alter it in the way the government suggests, the company's blog post seemed to say.\n\nA breakup is possible. But Wall Street doesn't believe it.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Google's Nobel prize winners stir debate over AI research",
        "content": "By Martin Coulter\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - The award this week of Nobel prizes in chemistry and physics to a small number of artificial intelligence pioneers affiliated with Google has stirred debate over the company's research dominance and how breakthroughs in computer science ought to be recognised.\n\nGoogle has been at the forefront of AI research, but has been forced on the defensive as it tackles competitive pressure from Microsoft-backed OpenAI and mounting regulatory scrutiny from the U.S Department of Justice.\n\nOn Wednesday, Demis Hassabis – co-founder of Google's AI unit DeepMind – and colleague John Jumper were awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry, alongside U.S. biochemist David Baker, for their work decoding the structures of microscopic proteins.\n\nFormer Google researcher Geoffrey Hinton, meanwhile, won the Nobel prize for physics on Tuesday, alongside U.S. scientist John Hopfield, for earlier discoveries in machine learning that paved the way for the AI boom.\n\nProfessor Dame Wendy Hall, a computer scientist and advisor on AI to the United Nations, told Reuters that, while the recipients’ work deserved recognition, the lack of a Nobel prize for mathematics or computer science had distorted the outcome.\n\n\"The Nobel prize committee doesn't want to miss out on this AI stuff, so it's very creative of them to push Geoffrey through the physics route,\" she said. \"I would argue both are dubious, but nonetheless worthy of a Nobel prize in terms of the science they’ve done. So how else are you going to reward them?\"\n\nNoah Giansiracusa, an associate maths professor at Bentley University and author of \"How Algorithms Create and Prevent Fake News\", also argued that Hinton’s win was questionable.\n\n\"What he did was phenomenal, but was it physics? I don't think so. Even if there's inspiration from physics, they're not developing a new theory in physics or solving a longstanding problem in physics.\"\n\nThe Nobel prize categories for achievements in medicine or physiology, physics, chemistry, literature and peace were laid down in the will of Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, who died in 1895. The prize for economics is a later addition established with an endowment from the Swedish central bank in 1968.\n\nDOMINANCE\n\nRegulators in the U.S. are currently circling Google for a potential break-up, which could force it to divest parts of its business, such as its Chrome browser and Android operating system, which some argue allow it to maintain an illegal monopoly in online search.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe profits derived from its leading position have allowed Google and other Big Tech companies to outpace traditional academia in publishing groundbreaking AI research.\n\nHinton himself has expressed some regrets about his life's work, quitting Google last year so that he could speak freely about the dangers of AI, and warning that computers could become smarter than people far sooner than previously expected.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference Tuesday, he said: \"I wish I had a sort of simple recipe that if you do this, everything's going to be okay, but I don't, in particular with respect to the existential threat of these things getting out of control and taking over.”\n\nWhen he quit Google in 2023 over his AI concerns, Hinton said the company itself acted very responsibly.\n\nFor some, this week’s Nobel prize wins underscore how hard it is becoming for traditional academia to compete. Giansiracusa told Reuters there was a need for greater public investment in research.\n\n\"So much of Big Tech is not oriented towards the next deep-learning breakthrough, but making money by pushing chatbots or putting ads all over the internet,\" he said. \"There are pockets of innovation, but much of it is very unscientific.\"\n\n(Reporting by Martin Coulter; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Alex Richardson)\n\nView comments",

In contrast, Meta Platforms stock is up 12% over the last three months for a year-to-date jump of 69% and a one-year bounce of 88%.\n\nThe two companies’ equally opposite three-month performances create a setup for an interesting matchup, as outlined below.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAt a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.5x, there’s no ignoring the fact that Alphabet is cheap. While concerns about generative AI could threaten the technology giant, the current P/E is just too cheap to ignore, suggesting a bullish view is in order.\n\nNotably, advertising still accounts for the lion’s share of Alphabet’s quarterly revenue, including $64.6 billion of the $84.7 billion in total revenue. Google Search alone accounted for $48.5 billion of total revenue. Thus, it’s easy to see why some might give credence to the concerns raised by a fund manager last week. However, I would suggest that his view might be a bit short-sighted, especially since Search revenue is still growing.\n\nAt the 2024 Quality-Growth Conference last week, Stephen Yiu of Blue Whale Capital explained why he’s bearish on Alphabet right now. He expects generative AI to significantly change Alphabet’s business model, although he does see some upside left in the near term.\n\nNonetheless, he maintains a negative view due to signs of a market share decline from Google Search, which once held a 90% share. Furthermore, Alphabet’s AI model, Gemini, has yet to meet the expectations set by competing models.\n\nDespite Yiu’s longer-term concerns for Alphabet, this looks like a buy-the-dip opportunity. On a P/E basis, the shares have been range-bound since about April 2023. However, they’re currently at the bottom of the valuation range, suggesting another leg up could be in the offing soon.\n\nEven if Alphabet does enter a period of struggle, as Yiu maintains, this company isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. In short, Alphabet is one of those stocks that’s good to buy and hold for the long term, although the size of the position in your portfolio might fluctuate based on valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, I would recommend a small position right now if you don’t already have one, potentially with plans to add a few more shares if you already have a position. After all, Alphabet has more than doubled over the past five years, rising 174%.\n\nAdditionally, should Gemini deliver positive surprises, Alphabet shares will rise further, potentially breaking out of their current range. We’re already starting to see signs of this with the integration into Google Search and the recent Gemini at Work event, which covered a range of AI use cases for enterprises.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for GOOGL Stock?\n\nAlphabet has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, nine Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $200.29, the average Alphabet stock price target implies upside potential of 21.85%.\n\nSee more GOOGL analyst ratings\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nAt a P/E of 30x, Meta Platforms is trading at a premium to Alphabet, and it’s on the rise after hitting bottom at around 25.5x in early August. Meta has been rangebound for about a year or so on a P/E basis and is approaching the middle of that range. Nonetheless, a long-term bullish view looks appropriate.\n\nMeta Platforms is less diversified than Alphabet, capturing 98% of its revenue from advertising in the second quarter. This could prevent a problem in the event that digital advertising goes south, though that looks doubtful.\n\nYiu also commented on Meta Platforms, picking it as his top Magnificent Seven stock aside from NVIDIA (NVDA). He believes that Meta has greater access to personal information than Alphabet, thanks to the interactions occurring across its various platforms. He noted that this provides more personal information about individuals than just searching for things on Google.\n\nFurther, Yiu mentioned that he believes ads on Meta Platforms will become more personalized through generative AI, which he expects to have a greater impact on Meta than on Alphabet. He argues that personal interactions are more likely to drive immediate purchase decisions compared to Google searches. Additionally, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg supported Yiu’s remarks, stating that AI will allow Meta to offer even more tailored advertisements.\n\nI would agree with Yiu on these points, but I don’t think Meta will enjoy greater benefits from AI than Alphabet, especially over the long term. Notably, Meta’s ad revenue growth rate reached 22% in the second quarter, double that of Google’s growth rate. However, it’s important to consider that Alphabet’s growth rate was based on a much larger scale versus Meta’s total revenue of $39.1 billion for Q2.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for META Stock?\n\nMeta Platforms has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $607.92, the average Meta Platforms stock price target implies downside potential of 2.54%.\n\nSee more META analyst ratings\n\nConclusion: Bullish on GOOGL and META\n\nAlthough both Alphabet and Meta Platforms receive bullish ratings, Alphabet is the clear winner here. Google Cloud revenues continued to rise sequentially, surpassing $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in the second quarter. The Cloud division accounts for Alphabet’s AI revenue, which is critical because AI is already starting to cover for the drop in ad revenue.\n\nOn the other hand, Meta Platforms is trading at a premium to Alphabet, and it’s verging on overbought territory with a Relative Strength Index of 69.4. Ultimately, I expect Alphabet and Meta to both capture significant AI revenues.\n\nHowever, Alphabet takes the crown this time around due to valuation and the fact that it was able to put an actual number on AI-related revenue, while Meta just talked about AI making a difference in its revenue growth.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google’s antitrust problems are coming home to roost.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums\n\nWhile the company has beat back European antitrust interventions by paying 6.5 billion euros ($7.1 billion), US enforcers are now flexing their muscles — and the most painful part for the Alphabet Inc. unit won’t be monetary fines, but blows to core businesses that bring in big revenue.\n\nIn a span of three days, a federal judge ordered the company to open up its lucrative app store to rivals and the Justice Department said it may seek to force the tech giant to spin off some of its services to remedy its monopolization of online search.\n\nWhile a breakup may be a hard sell to the Washington judge overseeing the Justice Department’s search case, Google is undoubtedly looking at changes to the way it has long operated, antitrust experts said.\n\nBreak Up Google? What’s at Stake in Antitrust Action: QuickTake\n\nThe Justice Department is trying to come up with “remedies that will not only reintroduce competition in search but make sure that as the market changes, Google doesn’t re-entrench itself,” Abiel Garcia, antitrust lawyer and partner at Kesselman Brantly Stockinger LLP. The remedies might cause Google “to rethink and reevaluate business strategy to some extent, but it’s not like we’re not going to have a Google anymore.”\n\nGoogle criticized the Justice Department’s initial proposal as “radical,” saying it would have “significant unintended consequences for consumers, businesses, and American competitiveness.”\n\nThe company’s shares have declined more than 15% since reaching an all-time record of $191.18 on July 10.\n\n“There is a clear overhang when it comes to the antitrust side of things and the scrutiny that Alphabet gets,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior tech industry analyst Mandeep Singh said on Bloomberg TV.\n\nDhaval Moogimane, a senior partner at consulting firm West Monroe, said forcing Google to share its index could aid not just search rivals, but AI companies seeking to enter the space.\n\nSharing the search data “certainly opens up competition, which is the intent here,” he said. “It is the secret sauce from a Google perspective.”\n\nVanderbilt Law School professor Rebecca Allensworth, who has closely followed the suit, says she thinks it is “very unlikely” that US District Judge Amit Mehta would go for a breakup. Much of the Justice Department’s case focused on Google’s $20 billion deal with Apple Inc. to be the search default on the iPhone, she said, not on Chrome or Android — the Google products that DOJ identified to be potentially spun off.\n\nStory continues\n\nMehta has very closely hewed to the Microsoft Corp. case, she said, where the Justice Department successfully sued the Windows maker in 1998 for monopolizing computer operating systems. The judge in that case initially decided Microsoft should be broken up before being overturned on appeal.\n\n“There is no way that judge is going to break up Google on this case,” Allensworth said of Mehta.\n\nJohn Kwoka, an economist at Northeastern University who has extensively researched antitrust remedies, said the breakup “ought to be on the table” at least as a “signal” to Google and other companies with monopolization cases pending that antitrust enforcers won’t accept a wimpy resolution.\n\nWith a conduct remedy, the company has the incentive to evade, and even mandatory data access can be tricky because of questions about who gets the data and how much, he said.\n\n“The track record on structural remedies is pretty good,” Kwoka said, noting the AT&T breakup occurred after years of unsuccessfully trying to fix the problems with conduct remedies. “There can be a lot of collateral damage if enforcers wait to bite the bullet.”\n\nBill Kovacic, an antitrust professor at George Washington University Law School, said the Justice Department’s filing was a “conscious effort at framing” the issue for the judge, “giving him a menu from milder to spicy hot.”\n\nNotwithstanding Google’s labeling of a breakup as a “radical” solution, Kovacic noted businesses today have “a lot of experience putting companies together and taking them apart.” And some of the Justice Department’s proposals – such as the requirement to share some of the company’s search data – are already in place in Europe as part of a rollout of new digital gatekeeper rules, he said.\n\nKwoka and Allensworth also agreed the Justice Department may be trying to use the breakup option as an opening gambit so Mehta is more inclined to pick another remedy they like, such as data-sharing.\n\n“That would be a really progressive remedy,” said Allensworth. “Sharing the index would be a nice, obvious way” to resolve the issues.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMusk Reveals Why He’s Jumping Into Trump’s Arms Lina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes) China Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space How Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession Rate Cuts Need Time to Work Their Way Through the Economy\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Revenue Growth: 27% overall growth with 5% organic growth. Recurring Revenue: Grew by 26% to EUR62 million, making up 62% of total group revenue. EBITDA: Flat at EUR29 million due to recent acquisitions. Debt Ratio: Maintained below guidance at 2 times net debt to EBITDA. Financing Agreement: Reestablished three-year financing agreement with a total committed facility of EUR319 million and a new EUR100 million accordion option. Acquisitions: Major acquisitions include Playmaker Capital, Playmaker HQ, and AceOdds.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with BTRCF.\n\nRelease Date: August 22, 2024\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nBetter Collective AS (BTRCF) achieved a strong revenue growth of 27% in Q2, with 5% organic growth, despite challenging market conditions. The company successfully integrated three major acquisitions: Playmaker Capital, Playmaker HQ, and AceOdds, which have enriched its foundation and provided a stronger base for future growth. Better Collective AS (BTRCF) maintained a low debt ratio and improved capital reserves, ensuring a robust financial position. The in-house adtech platform, AdVantage, has shown proof of concept and initial operational success, indicating potential for future revenue growth. Recurring revenue grew by 26% to EUR 62 million, making up 62% of total group revenue, signaling sustainable future growth.\n\nNegative Points\n\nThe performance of Playmaker HQ fell short of expectations, impacting North American operations and leading to a reduced acquisition price. The transition to revenue share in North America resulted in a decrease in revenue share earnings compared to Q2 2023. The company's North American sales were down 18% organically, with a 44% decrease in revenue share in the US. Google's policy revisions in early Q2 affected some media partnerships, impacting content rankings and audience scale. The integration of Playmaker Capital is still in progress, with limited contribution to Q2 earnings and margin dilution.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Can you explain the reasons behind the NDC development trends, particularly in Europe and Rest of World? A: Jesper Soegaard, CEO, explained that the NDCs were impacted by a 20% decrease in games in major European leagues and a slowdown in Brazil due to potential regulation. Despite these challenges, the company delivered 100,000 NDCs during the Euros, which was considered a strong performance.\n\nQ: What is the current status of Playmaker Capital's contribution and are you still on track for the EUR15 million EBITDA target? A: Flemming Pedersen, CFO, stated that the integration and performance of Playmaker Capital are going as planned, with early contributions being limited as expected. The company remains on track with its guidance and is pleased with the progress.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ: How is the transition to revenue share contracts progressing, and when can we expect to see significant results? A: Jesper Soegaard, CEO, noted that transitioning a media sales-based business like Playmaker Capital to revenue share takes time. The company is ahead of expectations in creating content and securing ranks, but it will take time before these efforts translate into net positive performance.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the impact of Google's policy changes on your media partnerships and search rankings? A: Jesper Soegaard, CEO, mentioned that while some media partnerships were affected, the company has learned to navigate these changes effectively. The diversified strategy has allowed them to maintain good performance, and they are confident in managing future changes.\n\nQ: What is the expected timeline for the rollout and revenue impact of the AdVantage platform? A: Jesper Soegaard, CEO, stated that while they are not providing specific guidance on AdVantage's revenue impact, they have seen incremental revenue growth on a small brand. The focus is on building the sales organization to support larger brand rollouts, with ongoing development expected.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI data center stocks.\n\nThe AI data center industry is experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the massive computational power they require. AI data centers are specialized facilities designed to handle high-intensity AI workloads, including machine learning, natural language processing, and neural network training. These facilities integrate advanced hardware and software to process large-scale data efficiently, creating a crucial infrastructure for the global digital economy. Leading technology companies are making substantial investments in AI data centers. For instance, Meta announced plans to invest $33 billion in data center expansion to support AI research and development. Google is also investing billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, committing $3.3 billion in just one region of the United States​. These investments highlight the significance of AI data centers in the broader tech ecosystem.\n\nAI workloads demand hardware that can process vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This need has led to the development of AI-specific chips, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These chips are essential components in AI data centers.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhile AI data centers are essential for technological progress, they consume enormous amounts of energy. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers worldwide account for about 1% of global electricity demand, a figure that could increase significantly with the rise of AI. Cooling systems, necessary to maintain optimal hardware performance, further contribute to this energy demand. To address this, companies are increasingly focused on building energy-efficient data centers. For example, Google has implemented machine learning algorithms to reduce energy use in its data centers by 30%.\n\nThe AI data center industry will continue to evolve as the demand for AI-driven applications grows. Experts predict a significant shift toward edge computing, where data centers are decentralized and located closer to the source of data generation. This reduces latency and improves performance for real-time AI applications such as autonomous driving and smart cities. Moreover, the integration of quantum computing into AI data centers could revolutionize the field. Quantum computers are capable of processing complex calculations at speeds unattainable by classical computers, making them ideal for AI and big data applications. Companies like IBM and Google are already exploring quantum technology in their AI research.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. The company has made several announcements regarding massive investments in AI data centers around the world.

At the end of August, Google had announced that it would be investing $850 million to open a data center in Latin America. In addition to these, the firm has also pledged billions towards building data centers in the United Kingdom, Singapore, the US, and Malaysia. The company has also used Arm designs to develop a data center chip that offers industry-leading performance and energy efficiency.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 6th on our list of the best AI data center stocks to buy.

        "title": "Marin Software Inc (MRIN) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Highlights: Strategic Partnerships and AI ...",
        "content": "Release Date: August 01, 2024\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nMarin Software Inc (NASDAQ:MRIN) renewed its strategic partnership agreement with Google for another three years, ensuring continued collaboration and revenue from Google. The company's Q2 non-GAAP operating loss was materially lower year-over-year, reflecting benefits from the restructuring and reduction in force plan implemented in July 2023. Marin Software Inc (NASDAQ:MRIN) introduced new AI-powered features, such as ChatGPT-powered anomaly detection reports and the Advisor tool, enhancing their platform's capabilities. The company reported a significant customer success story with EasyGo, achieving a 40% reduction in cost per conversion and a 41% increase in conversions using Marin's platform. Marin Software Inc (NASDAQ:MRIN) is seeing increased interest in its Ascend product, which is helping drive both new business and renewals, with nearly a quarter of its customers using Ascend's functionality.\n\nNegative Points\n\nQ2 2024 revenue was $4 million, at the low end of guidance and down approximately 7% year-over-year, primarily due to customer churn outpacing new bookings. The company is exploring opportunities to raise additional financing or engage in strategic transactions, indicating potential financial challenges. Despite restructuring efforts, Marin Software Inc (NASDAQ:MRIN) still reported a non-GAAP operating loss of $1.7 million for Q2 2024. The company's total cash balance decreased to $7.9 million at the end of Q2 2024, down from $8.6 million in the previous quarter. Marin Software Inc (NASDAQ:MRIN) expects continued non-GAAP operating losses in Q3 2024, with projected losses between $2.1 million and $1.9 million.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with MRIN.\n\nQ: Can you provide more details on the renewed strategic partnership agreement with Google? A: Christopher Lien, CEO, explained that Marin Software has renewed its strategic partnership agreement with Google for another three years starting October 1, 2024. Under this agreement, Google will continue to make payments to Marin based on the total paid search spend managed through Marin's platform across Google and other search publishers, with the same minimum quarterly payments as the current agreement.\n\nQ: What are the main reasons for the 7% year-over-year revenue decline in Q2 2024? A: Robert Bertz, CFO, stated that the revenue decline is primarily due to existing customer churn outpacing new bookings. However, the decline has moderated compared to previous quarters, indicating progress in improving customer retention and new bookings.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ: How has the restructuring plan impacted Marin Software's financials? A: Robert Bertz, CFO, noted that the restructuring plan, implemented in July 2023, is expected to reduce the pretax cost structure by approximately $10 million to $13 million annually. The plan included a reduction in force, which has already been completed, and the company is on track to achieve its savings targets.\n\nQ: What are the key features of Marin's Ascend product? A: Christopher Lien, CEO, described Ascend as a budget management, pacing, and forecasting solution that addresses fragmentation, forecasting, and frequency in performance marketing. It leverages AI-based optimization methodologies to deliver budget compliance and optimal spend allocation across campaigns, publishers, and channels.\n\nQ: Can you elaborate on the new AI features introduced in MarinOne? A: Christopher Lien, CEO, highlighted that MarinOne now includes ChatGPT-powered anomaly detection reports and an initial release of Advisor, a ChatGPT-powered teammate.

        "content": "Why Alphabet (GOOGL) Shares Are Sliding Today\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nShares of online advertising giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 2.5% in the morning session as the Department of Justice is reportedly exploring a breakup of the Google division along with other options.\n\nAccording to a government court filing, \"That would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features — including emerging search access points and features, such as artificial intelligence — over rivals or new entrants.\" This follows a federal judge ruling in August 2024 that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws.\n\nGoogle responded in a blog post, \"We believe that today's blueprint goes well beyond the legal scope of the Court's decision about Search distribution contracts. Government overreach in a fast-moving industry may have negative unintended consequences for American innovation and America's consumers. We look forward to making our arguments in court.\"\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Alphabet? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nAlphabet’s shares are quite volatile and have had 19 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nAlphabet is up 16.5% since the beginning of the year, but at $160.98 per share, it is still trading 15.8% below its 52-week high of $191.18 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Alphabet’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,678.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

        "content": "A bottle of the Zantac heartburn drug - Brendan McDermid/Reuters\n\nTens of thousands of Americans are in line to share $2.2bn (£1.7bn) after GSK agreed a settlement over claims its indigestion drug caused cancers.\n\nThe British drug giant has agreed to pay up to $2.2bn to settle tens of thousands of US lawsuits claiming it’s heartburn drug Zantac caused cancer.\n\nThe company said it had struck a settlement deal with 10 law firms that represent more than 90pc of legal claims related to the medicine.\n\nThe law firms have unanimously recommended that their clients accept the terms of the settlement. If endorsed, the settlement would resolve around 80,000 cases. It is expected to be implemented by the middle of next year.\n\nGSK said: “While the scientific consensus remains that there is no consistent or reliable evidence that ranitidine [the generic name for Zantac] increases the risk of any cancer, GSK strongly believes that these settlements are in the best long-term interests of the company and its shareholders as they remove significant financial uncertainty, risk and distraction associated with protracted litigation.”\n\nAs well as settling the majority of state court cases on Wednesday, GSK said it had also struck a deal to pay $70m to resolve a separate Zantac complaint.\n\nAs part of the settlement deals, GSK has not admitted any liability. It is expected to pay the costs of the settlements through its existing resources.\n\nThe Zantac dispute stems from 2019, when US watchdogs pulled it from sale because of “unacceptable levels” of probable cancer-causing ingredients in the medicine. At the time, GSK sold Zantac as a prescription drug in the UK but it stopped as a precaution following the US decision.\n\nGSK and other sellers of the medicine have always maintained that suggestions Zantac could cause cancer were “inconsistent with the science”. The British drug giant has pointed to past research by regulators in the EU and US that has failed to establish a causal association.\n\nHowever, GSK has been dogged by concerns over looming legal payouts for years.\n\nMorgan Stanley previously suggested the Zantac cases could cost GSK as much as $30bn to settle, although other analysts have since put the figure at somewhere between $2bn and $8bn.\n\nConcerns over Zantac have been blamed for keeping GSK’s share price depressed at a time of booming sales and profits at the British drugmaker.\n\nEarlier this year almost £7bn was wiped off GSK’s value in one day after a judge in Delaware ruled that 70,000 lawsuits against the company related to Zantac could move forward.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n07:09 PM BST\n\nSigning off...\n\nThanks for joining us today.\n\nStory continues\n\nChris Price will be back from around 7am to cover the latest in the markets but, in the meantime, you can read the full breadth of our business and economics reporting and commentary here.\n\n07:06 PM BST\n\nFed rate setters gain confidence over inflation, according to minutes\n\nMinutes of last month’s Federal Reserve rate-seting meeting have just been released.\n\nThey indicate that “almost all” of the participants were gaining stronger confidence on beating inflation. The minutes say:\n\nWith regard to the outlook for inflation, almost all participants indicated they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\n\nParticipants cited various factors that were likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation.\n\nThese included a further modest slowing in real GDP growth, in part due to the Committee’s restrictive monetary policy stance; well-anchored inflation expectations; waning pricing power; increases in productivity; and a softening in world commodity prices.\n\nThe minutes indicated that a “substantial majority” favoured a half a percentage point cut, which was implemented,\n\nEarlier in the day, Dallas Fed president Lorie Logan warned over cutting interest rates too quickly. She said:\n\nI continue to see a meaningful risk that inflation could get stuck above our 2pc goal ... the [Fed] should not rush to reduce the fed funds target to a ‘normal’ or ‘neutral’ level but rather should proceed gradually while monitoring the behavior of financial conditions, consumption, wages and prices.\n\n06:17 PM BST\n\nUS law firm to pay British trainees £70k a year amid talent war\n\nA US law firm will offer starting salaries of at least £70,000 to trainee solicitors at its London office as British rivals remain under pressure in the war for talent.\n\nDavis Polk, which is headquartered in New York, has increased salaries for its most inexperienced employees to £65,000 in their first year, jumping to £70,000 in their second year.\n\nIt marks an increase from the previous trainee salaries of £60,000 and £65,000, respectively. Davis Polk also promised to hand trainee lawyers a £100,000 pay rise upon qualifying, bringing their third-year salary to £170,000.\n\nThe hefty sums are in addition to Davis Polk’s trainee benefits package, which includes sponsorship through law school and a six months’ secondment in either New York or Brussels.\n\nThe latest pay rise has set a record for entry-level salaries in London, the news website Legal Cheek first reported.\n\nRead the full story...\n\n05:54 PM BST\n\nEuropean stocks bounce back from dismal Tuesday\n\nEuropean stocks settled higher on Wednesday, bouncing from losses in the previous session as investors focussed on upcoming interest rate cuts and a key U.S. inflation report later this week.\n\nThe continent-wide Stoxx 600 index was up 0.6pc, with the automobiles and parts sector, which has lagged for most of the year, among top gainers with a 1.1pc jump.\n\nOn the flipside, banks underperformed as Dutch lender ING dropped 2.5pc after Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to “hold”, calling 2024 a peak for capital returns and share buybacks.\n\nThe benchmark Stoxx 600 touched a two-week low on Tuesday, with China-exposed mining and luxury sectors taking a beating as investors were disappointed by a lack of fresh stimulus steps from Beijing.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of a stagnating economy, cooling price pressures and a softening labour market, the Stoxx 600 index along with equities in major regional stock markets are on track for gains this year.\n\nRichard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm, said:\n\nEurope is trading at a discount relative to the U.S. and even though (economic) growth is less than what you would want, corporate profitability is still holding up in aggregate terms.\n\nYou’re going to see interest rate cuts and then an acceleration in European growth over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\n05:46 PM BST\n\nWall Street rises ahead of release of Fed minutes\n\nThe main Wall Street stock indexes turned higher this afternoon as investors awaited the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8pc, the S&P 500 gained 0.6pc, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5pc.\n\nThe S&P 500 touched a fresh record high, with shares of Norwegian Cruise Line topping the benchmark index with a 10.8pc gain after Citi upgraded its rating to “buy”. Industry peer Carnival (which is also traded in London) jumped 7.5pc.\n\nTrading has been choppy through the week, with investors adjusting their rate-cut expectations, seeking new catalysts for a clearer market direction. Their attention will now turn to crucial inflation data on Thursday and the upcoming third-quarter corporate earnings season.\n\nMinutes from the Fed’s September meeting, when policymakers kicked off monetary policy easing with a half a percentage point cut, are due at 7pm (UK time).\n\nTim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder, said:\n\nThe Fed minutes are always interesting, but they may be a little bit more interesting this time given the last Fed meeting, though I don’t expect any surprises.\n\n05:25 PM BST\n\nBritish bosses in line for bumper paydays amid talent exodus fears\n\nInvestors have paved the way for higher pay at Britain’s biggest companies amid fears of a talent exodus to the US.\n\nThe Investment Association (IA), a trade body representing £9.1 trillion of funds, on Wednesday published a new set of pay guidelines giving shareholders more leeway to reward FTSE chief executives with higher pay.\n\nThe move represents a seachange in the City after years of shareholder rebellions over high pay. The rebellions were partly blamed on restrictive voting policies tying the hands of shareholders.\n\nChanging the policy could usher in a new era of bigger awards and fewer investor rebellions.\n\nUnder the plan, the IA will introduce three broad “principles” on pay,  giving investors greater flexibility to vote through large deals without falling foul of the guidelines.\n\nIt is hoped the new principles will allow fund managers to make decisions on a case-by-case basis and reward company chief executives who do well.\n\nThe change is driven by fears that London risks becoming a global backwater for talent because of the higher pay packages on offer in the US.\n\nRead the full story...\n\n05:18 PM BST\n\nBank of England will cut rates to 3pc by early 2026, say economists\n\nThe Bank of England will cut interest rates to 3pc by early 2026 as a result of inflation plunging to below its 2pc target, leading economists have said.\n\nCapital Economics said the fall will be bigger than traders’ predictions of rates falling from 5pc today to 3.75pc by 2026.\n\nThe economists added:\n\nIn the second half of 2025, we think CPI inflation will fall below the 2.0pc target and core inflation will ease from 3.6pc now to 2.0pc late in 2026 as the persistence of inflation fades.\n\nWe think this will prompt the BoE to cut interest rates quicker than the markets anticipate in the second half of 2025, perhaps to 3.00pc by early 2026 rather than to 3.75pc.\n\nWhile gilt yields have risen recently, we doubt it’s due to fiscal credibility concerns. If it was, sterling would have fallen more significantly, like it did after the ‘mini-budget’.\n\nIf we’re right that Bank Rate will be cut further than investors expect, 10-year gilt yields will soon fall again, from 4.2pc now to 3.5pc next year.\n\n05:07 PM BST\n\nFTSE closes up\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed up 0.7pc today.\n\nThe largest riser was paper giant Mondi, up 4pc, followed by British Gas owner Centrica, up 3.3pc.\n\nAt the other end of the index, housebuilder Vistry fell 2pc, while rival Persimmon fell 0.6pc.\n\nMeanwhile, the FTSE 250 rose 0.9pc.\n\nThe top riser was Carnival, up 8.3pc, followed by St James’s Place, up 5.9pc.\n\nThe biggest faller was investment trust Fidelity China Special Situations, down 1.8pc, followed by real estate investment trust PRS Reit, down 1.5pc.\n\n04:29 PM BST\n\nDollar pushes upwards as traders bet on smaller cuts to interest rates\n\nThe US dollar has been on an upward path today ahead of the release of records from the Federal Reserve’s September decision to slash interest rates by half a percentage point.\n\nIt reflects traders’ confidence that the central bank will not continue easing so aggressively.\n\nWhile the minutes from the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting could show how heated the debate was over the larger than expected cut, it will be somewhat out of date after last Friday’s robust non-farm payroll data caused markets to reprice near-term Fed rate cut expectations.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the pound and the euro, is up 0.21pc.\n\nTraders are also watching a parade of Fed speakers on Wednesday and keeping powder dry for Thursday’s release of September’s consumer price index (CPI).\n\n04:21 PM BST\n\nTikTok revenue surges amid heightened scrutiny\n\nTikTok’s European sales have surged to over £3.5bn as the video sharing app continued its breakneck growth despite heightened scrutiny from regulators in Britain and on the continent.\n\nRevenues at TikTok Information Technologies UK, which includes its UK, European and parts of its Latin American divisions, climbed 75pc to $4.6bn (£3.5bn)in the year ending December 2023, up from $2.6bn.

TikTok has insisted it has “pioneered features and settings to protect teens”.\n\nThe social media app is also facing the prospect of a ban in the US over national security fears thanks to its ties to China’s Bytedance.

Almost one business in every three said taxes were a growing challenge.\n\nA separate report from NatWest showed business activity slowed in almost every region of the country in September compared to August as the “Autumn Budget dominates [the] outlook”.\n\nMeanwhile, a survey by Which? found that consumer confidence has also been hammered, particularly by the decision to remove winter fuel payments from most pensioners.\n\nOnly 17pc of people believe the economy will get better over the next year, while just over half - 51pc - predict it will get worse, the consumer group found.\n\nThe gloom comes amid expectations of tax rises and public spending cuts at the upcoming Budget. The Chancellor, Rachel Reeves is widely expected to increase capital gains and inheritance tax in a Budget raid on business and wealth.\n\nSebastian Burnside, chief economist at NatWest, said businesses were waiting to see how taxes, spending and borrowing decisions affected the economy.\n\nHe said: “This is going to be a really big budget, both for the size of the fiscal hole the Chancellor says she needs to plug, and beyond the raw numbers we are going to learn a lot more about this Government’s approach to tackling the problems and issues it faces.

        "title": "Factbox-Google's antitrust woes mount in US cases over search, apps, ads",
        "content": "By Mike Scarcella\n\n(Reuters) - In the span of two days this week, Alphabet's Google was hit with a court order to open up its app store Play to rivals and learned that the U.S. Justice Department may soon ask a judge to split up the company to limit its hold over online searches.\n\nHere is a look at the U.S. antitrust cases that have Google playing defense and that could help shape the company's future.\n\nANDROID APPS\n\nU.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco on Monday ordered Google to overhaul parts of its Android app business, spelling big changes for consumers, developers and mobile device makers. For three years beginning in November, Google under the order must allow Android users to download rival app platforms and use competing in-app payment methods, and it cannot pay device makers to preinstall its app store Play.\n\nThe order came in a lawsuit that \"Fortnite\" video game maker Epic Games filed in 2020 accusing Google of monopolizing Android app distribution and payments. Google said it will appeal an underlying jury verdict in the case and challenge the court-ordered changes.\n\nGoogle in a related Play case said it will pay $700 million to resolve claims by consumers and U.S. states that it charged inflated prices for apps. That proposed settlement is pending before Donato, who has questioned whether the amount is sufficient.\n\nSeparately, Epic last month brought a new lawsuit accusing Google of unlawfully conspiring with device maker Samsung to protect Play from competition. Samsung and Google denied the claims.\n\nONLINE SEARCH\n\nGoogle's dominance over online search is the centerpiece of a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department in federal court in Washington in 2020. In that case, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled in August that Google had established an illegal monopoly by paying billions of dollars to rivals to make it the world's default search engine.\n\nThe Justice Department told the judge on Tuesday that it may seek an order breaking up parts of Google to remedy the company's antitrust violations. The government's specific proposals - such as potentially forcing Google to divest its Chrome browser and Android operating system - are due in November.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle is due to propose its own remedies in late December, and the judge is scheduled to hear arguments in April 2025.\n\nDIGITAL ADVERTISING\n\nBeyond search and apps, Google faces a trio of lawsuits challenging its dominance in the market for online display advertising. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia held a non-jury trial last month in a case filed last year by the Justice Department and a group of states. Google is accused of unlawfully dominating all sides of the ad market, forcing customers to use its products and using its size to crush rivals. Closing arguments are scheduled for late November.\n\nGoogle is also fighting two related cases in federal courts in Texas and New York.\n\nTexas is leading a group of states suing Google over digital ads in a case scheduled for a March 2025 trial. Publishers and advertisers are pursuing related claims challenging Google's advertising technology practices, alleging they have been overcharged and lost revenue.\n\n(Compiled by Mike Scarcella; Editing by David Bario and Will Dunham)",

        "title": "How Meta has become an AI behemoth",
        "content": "When you think of Meta (META), you might think of Facebook, Instagram, or, shudder, the metaverse. But the social media company has quickly become an artificial intelligence darling up there with the likes of OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nMeta’s AI success comes via its Llama family of models, which the company is infusing across its various social platforms — including its Meta AI assistant for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Businesses are also putting Llama to work. In August, Meta reported organizations ranging from Accenture (ACN) and DoorDash (DASH) to Goldman Sachs (GS) are using Llama to develop their own AI software.\n\nIt’s not just that Meta is implementing its AI into its own products, though. The company is also offering up its Llama models as open-source software. Open-source software is, generally, software that companies create and then allow developers to download and augment for free. That contrasts with, say, OpenAI, which uses a closed-source software approach for its GPT family of models.\n\nAll of that has helped to make Meta a formidable force in the AI space and a potential threat to its AI rivals.\n\n“If Llama did not exist, OpenAI and [Google’s] Gemini would be in a better position,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance. “There are undoubtedly some developers who, if not for Llama existing, would have been probably forced to go to Gemini or GPT.”\n\nBut the AI industry is still in its infancy, and there’s no telling which company will be the big winner in the long run.\n\nMeta is playing the long game\n\nMeta’s AI strategy should provide a number of benefits for the company in the near and long term. Out of the gate, the company is able to apply its Llama models to its products, helping to improve its own offerings while simultaneously proving the software’s worth in real-world scenarios.\n\nAfter all, if Meta is using its models in its own products, why shouldn’t third-party developers? And because the Llama family is open source, developers can take a look under the software’s hood, allowing them to address any flaws or risks over time.\n\n“Meta has been democratizing AI, open sourcing it, utilizing what they're building in their own platforms,” said Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman. “They've been doing it really at all the layers.” AI domination?

Vásquez) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nOf course, Llama won’t just help Meta improve its existing software and build goodwill among developers, it could also prove to be a steady revenue stream in the long run.\n\n“We want this to be open, but if you're someone like Microsoft or Amazon or Google and you're going to basically be reselling these services, that's something that we think we should get some portion of the revenue for,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during Meta’s third quarter 2023 earnings call. “So those are the deals that we intend to be making, and we've started doing that a little bit.”\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Zuckerberg said he doesn’t think those deals will contribute much to Meta’s revenue now, the CEO said he hopes it can in the long term.\n\nShares of Meta are up 85% over the last 12 months, compared to Microsoft and Google, which are up 25% and 18%, respectively. Analysts say the company’s shares are priced well relative to earnings, but the promise of how AI will boost the social media company’s own products could prove to be a tailwind.\n\nMeta’s competitors aren’t sitting idly by\n\nMeta’s open-source family of models may give it a competitive edge, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to knock OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, or any of the host of other companies fighting for position in the AI wars out of the game.\n\n“It's competitive in the sense that it's a great, cheap alternative for developers,” Munster said. “It's the most advanced, cheapest alternative.”\n\nAnd just as Meta’s models continue to evolve, so do its competitors'. Rivals OpenAI and Anthropic have funding deals with Microsoft and Amazon (AMZN), respectively, that give them the cash they’ll need to grow over the years.\n\nGoogle also has the benefit of being able to offer its Gemini platform on hundreds of millions of Android smartphones around the world, while OpenAI is expected to land on iPhones via Siri in the coming months.\n\nAnd although consumers will be able to use Meta’s AI services via its family of apps, users will find it easier to call on an AI assistant that’s built into their devices rather than having to open up a third-party app.\n\nStill, with more than 3.27 billion daily active users across its family of apps, Meta has plenty of opportunities of its own.

        "title": "DOJ considers Google breakup after internet search monopoly ruling",
        "content": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Tuesday said that it may ask Alphabet's Google to divest parts of its business that it says have been used to maintain an illegal monopoly in online search.\n\nA federal judge ruled in August that Google had built an illegal monopoly over internet searches, more than 90% of which are processed through Google. The DOJ's proposed remedies could have a significant impact on how Americans find information on the internet while shrinking Google's revenues and giving its competitors an opportunity to grow.\n\n\"Fully remedying these harms requires not only ending Google's control of distribution today, but also ensuring Google cannot control the distribution of tomorrow,\" the DOJ said.\n\nThe DOJ said that to address the monopoly, it may ask the court to require Google to divest its Chrome browser and its Android operating system. It also may request the court stop Google's payments to have its search engine pre-installed or set as the default on new devices, or require it to share search data with other competing providers.\n\nFederal Judge Rules Google Violated Antitrust Law A federal judge ruled this summer that Google maintained an illegal monopoly over internet search.\n\nProsecutors also signaled they will look to prevent Google from dominating the growing field of artificial intelligence (AI), potentially barring Google from entering into agreements that limit its AI rivals' access to content and allowing websites to opt out of Google using their content to train AI models.\n\nRead On The Fox Business App\n\nGoogle has made annual payments to Apple and other device manufacturers to ensure its search engine is the default on smartphones and web browsers to preserve its market share. In 2021, Google made $26.3 billion in such payments.\n\nThe company criticized the DOJ's proposal in a blog post on its website, arguing the \"government seems to be pursuing a sweeping agenda that will impact numerous industries and products, with significant unintended consequences for consumers, businesses, and American competitiveness.\"\n\nGoogle Faces Another Doj Antitrust Lawsuit Over Alleged Ad-tech Monopoly The Justice Department outlined possible ways that it may seek to curb Google's monopoly over internet search.\n\nGoogle said that a requirement to share data surrounding search queries, clicks and results with its rivals \"could create major privacy and security risks\" because it says those are currently protected by its \"strict security standards.\" It added that could lead to the creation of copycats and create a disincentive for other companies to innovate in search.\n\nIt warned that splitting off Chrome and Android off from Google \"would break them\" because Google currently offers them and their code for free on an open source basis.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Few companies would have the ability or incentive to keep them open source, or to invest in them at the same level we do,\" Google said, adding the change would have knock-on effects impacting a variety of apps and devices that harness those systems by making it harder to patch security bugs.\n\nGoogle Antitrust Ruling May Pose $20 Billion Risk For Apple Google pushed back on the DOJ's proposed monopoly remedies and will have an opportunity later this year to propose its own solutions.\n\nGoogle also defended its distribution contracts to promote Google Search, arguing that \"unreasonable restrictions\" would create friction for consumers and \"reduce revenue for companies like Mozilla (reducing its ability to invest in its own browser) and Android smartphone makers (potentially raising phone prices).\"\n\nThe tech giant also took issue with potential restrictions on its AI development, arguing those would hamper competition in a technology that's \"important for America's technological and economic leadership.\"\n\n\"Business models in AI, much less winners and losers, have yet to be determined, and competition globally is fierce,\" Google wrote. \"There are enormous risks to the government putting its thumb on the scale of this vital industry – skewing investment, distorting incentives, hobbling emerging business models – all at precisely the moment that we need to encourage investment, new business models, and American technological leadership.\"\n\nThe DOJ is expected to file a more detailed proposal with the court by Nov. 20, after which Google will have a chance to propose its own remedies by Dec. 20.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:DOJ considers Google breakup after internet search monopoly ruling\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Exclusive: Zoom’s future isn’t video, it’s AI for work, says CEO Eric Yuan–but can it challenge Microsoft and Google?",
        "content": "The AI boom sparked by ChatGPT has had one very clear impact on Zoom CEO Eric Yuan: He's once again working six days a week, a routine he hasn’t followed since the early days of the company, which was founded in 2011.\n\nAfter Zoom went public in 2019, Yuan had scaled back to a five-day workweek, but now he’s back to putting in extra time to help steer Zoom towards what he sees as its future: harnessing AI to boost productivity and, ultimately, enable people to work less—himself included. Despite the increased workload–for now–Yuan insists he’s no workaholic; he’s simply investing the time to ensure a more efficient, AI-powered future for all.\n\nOf course, he is also investing that time to ensure Zoom's success in its AI efforts, which aim to demonstrate that the company is no longer just the videoconferencing startup that took the pandemic world by storm in 2020, but struggled to maintain momentum after offices reopened. Zoom stock, after all, plummeted to near-IPO levels in 2022 and hasn’t budged much since.\n\n“We are way more than just meeting conferencing,” Yuan told Fortune in an exclusive interview in advance of the company’s Zoomtopia conference, which today unveiled a slew of new AI work and business features. These include upgrades to its Copilot-like ‘AI Companion’ that allow users, at no extra cost, to generate content and search across Zoom’s workplace platform and connect data from third-party apps including Microsoft Office and Google Docs, as well as ServiceNow, Glean, Workday, Box, Asana and Hubspot.\n\nThough he agreed the landscape of AI workplace tools is crowded, he insisted that Zoom’s AI moves and primary focus on the workplace position the company to challenge Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace for AI dominance in the office.\n\n“There's too many [other] things on their plates,” Yuan said of his competitors, touting Zoom’s speed of innovation and culture of customer care.\n\nSome analysts are doubtful\n\nBut some analysts are doubtful Zoom can take on Microsoft and Google’s massive resources and long history in work solutions. Daniel Newman, CEO and chief analyst at the Futurum Group, told Fortune that while Zoom’s platform and AI features may win when it comes to its user-friendly experience and service, “these are also companies that can build their own models, they can deploy data center infrastructure at incredible scale, and they own the office environment – processing email, spreadsheets.”\n\nOthers are prepared to give Zoom the benefit of the doubt, as it has shown it can focus on collaboration and can form relationships with makers of other Microsoft and Google competitors, including Salesforce and Slack, said said Ross Rubin, founder and principal analyst at Reticle Research. “Every company is feeling compelled to roll AI into their [products]; the next challenge will be how they work together to get out of their silos,” he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nDan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, added that Zoom has a big opportunity in AI work solutions because it is already installed and used on so many devices. “They’re in a very strong position to monetize,” hs said. “Over the coming years, they have to prove it out–but this is a big enough ocean for more than two boats.” NEW YORK, NY - APRIL 18: Zoom founder Eric Yuan poses in front of the Nasdaq building as the screen shows the logo of the video-conferencing software company Zoom after the opening bell ceremony on April 18, 2019 in New York City. The video-conferencing software company announced it's IPO priced at $36 per share, at an estimated value of $9.2 billion. (Photo by Kena Betancur/Getty Images)\n\nContrasting approaches to AI models\n\nOne of the biggest differences between Zoom’s approach to AI and that of Microsoft and Google is access to the most sophisticated frontier models. Both of the hyperscalers have their own powerful AI models to turn to–Google’s Gemini and Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI–as well as their own cloud and data center infrastructure.\n\nYuan says Zoom’s approach is different, in that while it uses a variety of models, including its own LLM and those from OpenAI, Anthropic (of which Zoom is an investor), and Meta. “Essentially, we have four models together to compete any of the single models,” he said, adding that this “federated” AI approach allows the company to choose the best model for each feature. For example, Zoom’s AI-generated meeting summaries are “much more accurate than any of our competitors,” he said.\n\nBut Newman, of the Futurum Group, said using multiple models will quickly become “table stakes.” After all, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and others all have the ability to use open source models, like Meta’s Llama or those from Mistral, or licensed closed models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.  “That’s a design choice,” he said.\n\nIves agreed that Zoom’s lack of its own frontier model could put it at a disadvantage: “that will be one of the uphill battles that they have to get around,” he said.\n\nZoom has faced other AI challenges\n\nZoom has faced other AI challenges over the past two years: There was blowback in 2023 over a change in the company’s Terms of Service that was widely interpreted to mean Zoom was training AI models on customer data, but it quickly published a blog post asserting that it “does not use any of your audio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments, or other communications like customer content (such as poll results, whiteboard, and reactions) to train Zoom’s or third-party artificial intelligence models.”\n\nYuan claimed Zoom was the first vendor to publicly make that commitment, but adds that not all users read or understand the terms of service, and that the company “learned a lesson” about improving communication. Zoom does train Zoom AI on meetings data, but only internal company meetings he said, and even that permission is not turned on by default. Zoom also partners with third-party vendors to gather data, he added, and also buys some data as well.\n\nBattling deepfakes is also a challenge for Zoom–one that has made media headlines, like when a deepfake caller posing as a Ukrainian official showed up on a Zoom call with Senator Benjamin Cardin, chairman of the US Foreign Relations Committee. But Yuan said the company is working on a feature to detect deepfakes: “We have high confidence that the problem will be fixed–hopefully very soon you will see some announcements,” he said. “Authentication is key.”\n\nJobs are not at risk with an AI-driven workplace, CEO says\n\nLike other tech CEOs touting their workplace AI solutions, Yuan maintains he does not believe jobs are at risk–even though more productivity may mean companies need fewer workers. Instead, he says employees will simply be able to do more in less time, and potentially work four days per week instead of five. Fears of widespread job loss did not pan out in the internet or smartphone eras, he noted. “As we further improve productivity, there is more time to do more meaningful things,” he explained, adding that in the future, multiple digital agents will take on many daily tasks.\n\nYuan did not shy away from previous comments he has made about the future potential for users to ultimately train a digital assistant on their own data and have a digital twin of themselves show up at their work meetings on Zoom.\n\n“Imagine Company A and Company B are working together to negotiate a contract and they send their lawyers’ digital twins to come up with a preliminary draft with 20-30 minutes,” he said. “And afterward the two CEOs look at the draft without any problem. That’s the future of work.”\n\nZoom may offer the better experience, said the Futurum Group's Newman, but that experience coexists with powerful alternatives. “Microsoft is not going to just lay down,” he explained. “Big companies have too many moats with how they can apply AI across the portfolio, and I think it's going to actually create a tougher, more challenging climate.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean Zoom is out of luck, he added. “It just means I think they're going to have to fight harder to win deals, despite whether they have some some advantages with individual features.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Reddit stock: Top 7 Bull vs Bear Debates",
        "content": "Reddit (RDDT) has become a main topic among investors, sparking debates over its growth prospects and challenges.\n\nIn a note to clients Wednesday, Needham&Company analysts outlined the top seven bullish and bearish arguments that investors are considering. Here’s a breakdown:\n\nBull Points\n\nLarge and Rapidly Growing User Base: The firm notes that as of June 2024, Reddit reported 342.6 million weekly active users (WAUq), a 57% increase year-over-year, and 91.2 million daily active users (DAUq). The growth is seen as signaling a healthy platform ecosystem, which investors see as a lead indicator for advertising revenue growth. Reddit’s expanding user base is expected to translate into ad monetization upside, with the company showing accelerating growth for the past five quarters.\n\nCommunity-Based Engagement Growth: Needham said Reddit hosts over 100,000 active subreddits, fostering highly engaged and authentic user communities. They believe the subreddits provide rich opportunities for targeted advertising and data licensing, creating a formidable barrier for competitors. Furthermore, investors are said to appreciate the unique structure, which they believe strengthens the platform's stickiness.\n\nData Licensing Upside: The firms noted that Reddit’s data licensing revenue surged over 690% year-over-year in Q2 2024, largely due to a deal with OpenAI and its ongoing partnership with Google’s Gemini. Needham believes Reddit’s conversation data is invaluable for AI language models, helping them understand human language better. The firm says the segment could reach over $500 million annually, up from $100 million estimated for 2024.\n\nMargin Expansion: Reddit’s operating leverage is seen as a key point of interest. With its fixed-cost business model, Reddit’s user growth is expected to drive revenue growth, potentially leading to a tripling of EBITDA margins from 16% in 2024 to over 40% by 2030.\n\n“Enormous TAM” (Total Addressable Market): Global advertising is projected to exceed $1 trillion in 2024, with Reddit capturing just 0.1% of that market. This is said to leave Reddit with substantial growth potential, as it aims to expand its advertising revenue.\n\nInternational Revenue Potential: With 50% of Reddit’s users outside the U.S. but only 19% of its revenue coming from these regions, the platform’s international growth presents a significant opportunity. Reddit is rolling out translation tools in 35 new countries, further unlocking potential revenue from non-English-speaking markets.\n\nAuthentic Human-Generated Content: Needham said Reddit is “widely respected for its authentic content,” making it a favored platform for market research and crisis monitoring.\n\nStory continues\n\nBear Points\n\nProfitability Concerns: On the other hand, Needham acknowledges that investors worry about potential disruptions to Reddit’s profitability due to rising competition, economic headwinds, and ad demand contraction.\n\nMonetization Challenges: They also state that despite recent success, Reddit’s monetization efforts are relatively new, and scaling them may be challenging, given that the platform was founded almost 20 years ago.\n\nReliance on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL): Reddit's traffic is seen as heavily dependent on Google Search, with 1.3 billion visits coming from search results in April 2024. Needham notes that reliance makes Reddit vulnerable to changes in Google’s search algorithms.\n\nConcentration Risk: Reddit’s top 10 advertisers accounted for 26% of its total revenue in 2023. The firm says this poses risks if any of these large clients reduce spending.\n\nMeme Stock Risk: Reddit’s communities have been involved in meme stock events, such as the GameStop (NYSE:GME) short squeeze, raising concerns about stock volatility and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nLate to the Video Space: Reddit’s entry into the video segment comes late, says Needham. Therefore, they feel building a competitive product in this space could increase costs and risks for the platform.\n\nModeration Challenges: Reddit’s unpaid subreddit moderators are both a strength and a weakness, according tot he firm. They explain that if they demand compensation or reduce their involvement, content moderation quality could suffer.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nReddit stock: Top 7 Bull vs Bear Debates\n\nRatan Tata, of India's Tata conglomerate, in hospital intensive care, sources say\n\nTurkey stocks higher at close of trade; BIST 100 up 0.97%\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- BMO Capital analysts believe Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are the top ad stocks heading into the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2025, citing their scale and advanced AI tools as key drivers.\n\nAccording to BMO’s recent checks with advertising industry experts, discussing key trends and observations across the US, UK, and Canadian advertising ecosystems, both companies are well-positioned to capture additional ad spend as their AI tools help advertisers optimize campaigns more effectively.\n\n“Specifically, our experts agree that META is best positioned to benefit from a TikTok ban, with YouTube and SNAP also benefiting to a lesser extent,” wrote BMO.\n\nThe experts are also said to have highlighted that Google’s Performance Max (PMax) is driving incremental ad dollars toward search ads, thanks to AI-driven improvements in return on ad spend (ROAS).\n\nHowever, YouTube has seen some headwinds due to competition from sports engagement for July in events like Copa America and UEFA European Cup. Despite these challenges, Google is still seen as a strong player in the digital ad space.\n\nBMO said Meta is expected to see revenue growth in the 10%-12% range for Q4 2024, with some experts predicting the lower end of this guidance due to a slowdown compared to the first half of the year.\n\nHowever, they explained that Meta is poised to benefit from increasing retail and social commerce, with in-app shopping ads generating higher CPMs.\n\nBMO’s experts foresee social commerce becoming a significant growth driver for Meta, with transaction-related ads expected to grow from 8.2% to over 40% of total spend over time.\n\nConnected TV (CTV) is also anticipated to play an important role in advertising growth, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) identified as the best-positioned platforms.\n\nThey note that Amazon’s Prime Video has shifted from experimental ad spending to committed budgets, while Netflix’s CPMs have fallen from $40 to $23, making it more attractive to advertisers.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThese 2 ad stocks are best positioned into Q4 says BMO\n\nAmazon targets faster deliveries and buying with new tech\n\nOpenAI sees increasing use of its AI models for influencing elections\n\nView comments",

        "title": "DOJ’s Google breakup remedy puts tech world on notice",
        "content": "The US Justice Department said in a new court filing that it may recommend a break up of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) as an antidote to unhealthy competition in the search engine market, showing just how far Washington is willing to go to rein in Big Tech.\n\nDOJ lawyers used a 32-page document to outline a framework of options for DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta to consider, including \"behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search.\"\n\nGoogle in a blog post said that \"DOJ’s radical and sweeping proposals risk hurting consumers, businesses, and developers.\"\n\nIts stock fell slightly in pre-market trading Wednesday.\n\nThe proposal is the first step from the Justice Department to break up a tech empire since it tried to do so more than two decades ago with Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nThat case — which the DOJ referenced in its Tuesday court filing — resulted in a 2002 settlement that opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market.\n\nThe move by DOJ also sends a signal to other tech giants currently facing antitrust cases from DOJ and other Washington regulators as part of a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries.\n\nThe administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly.\n\nThe case against Google targeting its dominance in search resulted in a landmark decision in August, where DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta sided with DOJ and concluded Google illegally monopolized the online search engine market and the market for search text advertising. DOJ said in a new court document that it is considering a breakup of Google, among other options, as potential remedies in a landmark antitrust trial. A judge has to make the final decision. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nMehta concluded that Google’s agreements with browser providers and devices powered by Google’s Android operating system stifled rivals from entering and growing within the markets.\n\nIt will now be up to Mehta to decide what should happen now in a separate \"remedies\" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025.\n\nDOJ is expected to provide a more detailed document by Nov. 20 outlining these remedies. But the 32-page document filed late Tuesday offers several points of focus beyond forcing Google to sell parts of its business.\n\nOne has to do with contracts that secure Google’s search engine as a default on internet browsers and internet-connected devices that use Google’s Android operating system.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle pays as much as $26 billion per year to maintain its position on mobile devices like Apple (AAPL) and Samsung smartphones.\n\nJustice Department lawyers said to prevent further harm they may seek to limit or terminate Google’s use of those contracts that use Chrome, Play and Android to advantage Google search, as well as \"other revenue-sharing arrangements related to search and search-related products, potentially with or without the use of a choice screen.\" Judge Amit Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) (Mark Wilson via Getty Images)\n\nThe DOJ could also ask the judge to force Google to share with rival browsers and search providers the data that it uses to refine its search algorithms, and limit the company's dominance over search text ads.\n\nDOJ suggested the judge should also consider blocking Google from illegally monopolizing related markets, in addition to the search and search text advertising markets.\n\nIt may ask the judge to force Google to give websites more ability to \"opt out\" of \"any Google-owned artificial-intelligence product.\"\n\nGoogle pushed back on the DOJ's suggestions.\n\n“We believe that today’s blueprint goes well beyond the legal scope of the Court’s decision about Search distribution contracts,” Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post.\n\nGoogle has promised to appeal. And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google's behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.’s Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal.\n\nAnd even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored.\n\nGoogle faces antitrust challenges on other fronts. It is currently defending itself in a separate lawsuit from DOJ alleging a monopoly in the technology used to but and sell online ads.\n\nAnd earlier this week another federal judge ordered Google to open up its app store as part of the resolution of a suit brought by Epic Games Inc.\n\nDOJ cited that ruling in its Tuesday court filing that outlined a Google breakup as one possible remedy, noting that the judge in the Epic Games case said remedies should \"bridge to moat\" to combat network effects.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google might get broken up after its big antitrust loss",
        "content": "The Department of Justice could consider breaking up Google (GOOGL), after a federal judge ruled in August that the tech giant monopolized the online search engine market.\n\nTo address Google’s monopoly, the Justice Department said in a court filing Tuesday that it will find remedies that would prevent and restrain any present and future maintenance of its dominance in the search market.\n\nThis would include “behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features—including emerging search access points and features, such as artificial intelligence—over rivals or new entrants,” the agency said.\n\nOther restrictions include limiting or prohibiting default agreements, preinstallation agreements, and other revenue-sharing arrangements related to its search and search-related products.\n\nThe DOJ sued Google in 2020 for allegedly monopolizing digital search, pushing out competitors. In his decision, federal judge Amit Mehta said Google’s exclusive agreements with companies like Apple allowed it to hike prices for advertisers without any blowback.\n\nMehta wrote “there is no evidence that any rival constrains Google’s pricing decisions” and that those unconstrained pricing decisions “have fueled Google’s dramatic revenue growth and allowed it to maintain high and remarkably stable operating profits.” The judge noted that nearly 90% of all search queries went through Google in 2020.\n\nThis was the first major tech antitrust lawsuit since U.S. v. Microsoft (MSFT), a 1998 case that found Microsoft monopolized computer operating systems and ultimately led to the demise of Internet Explorer. This case has been heavily referenced in recent legal filings given its similarities to the Google lawsuit.\n\nArtificial intelligence is also an area of concern for DOJ, which “will likely become an important feature of the evolving search industry,” particularly given Google’s ability to exclude competitors using its existing muscle in the search industry.\n\n“Google’s ability to leverage its monopoly power to feed artificial intelligence features is an emerging barrier to competition and risks further entrenching Google’s dominance,” the agency said.\n\nWhile AI won’t be a substitute for search, the DOJ said it is looking to ensure that any limits it imposes on Google also prevent it from establishing future dominance in the space.\n\nIn July, Google chief Sundar Pichai said Google Search’s new AI tool, AI Overviews — which had some hiccups in its initial rollout — saw “great progress” and boosted user engagement for 18- to 24-year-olds.\n\nThe company has announced a range of new and updated AI products, including new versions of its ChatGPT rival Gemini, as well as a universal AI assistant.\n\nGoogle is also facing its second major federal antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. this year, focusing on its dominance in the advertising market. That case stems from a 2023 DOJ lawsuit, alleging that the tech giant engaged in “anticompetitive, exclusionary, and unlawful conduct to eliminate or severely diminish any threat to its dominance over digital advertising technologies.”\n\nThat lawsuit specifically targets Google’s adtech stack, specifically its Ad Manager, the platform that helps publishers and advertisers manage and buy and sell advertising on sites. The federal government’s complaint proposes the divestiture of the Google Ad Manager Suite, but doesn’t target any of the other areas of Google’s adtech stack.\n\nThe Justice Department estimated that Google’s share of the adtech market was between 40% and 90%, as of 2022.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): A Promising AI Stock According to Analysts",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising AI Stocks According to Analysts.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other promising AI stocks.\n\nThe General Outlook for Tech and AI is Positive\n\nWhile 2024 has been a solid year for defensive stocks and utilities, the technology sector, on the other hand, experienced significant headwinds. However, the general outlook for technology and AI is starting to improve as we near the end of 2024. On October 9, Dominic Rizzo, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his thesis for the AI industry.\n\nMost investors were disappointed after they failed to generate higher returns for their investments in AI during the second quarter of 2024. While Rizzo expects the theme to prevail for the next few quarters, he suggests that the technology and AI sector is on track to earn better returns, especially companies using artificial intelligence to improve their businesses.\n\nAs for the Magnificent Seven, while all companies have distinct business models and offerings, these companies have grown at a 50% to 100% faster rate than the rest of the market, making it reasonable to group them. Overall, Rizzo reiterates that while the group has been under immense pressure, it is well-positioned to leverage AI to its benefit.\n\nRizzo believes that AI is an innovation that is here to stay rather than a mere disruptive technology, meaning that companies using it to their benefit will most likely perform better than the ones that are not. Therefore, most if not companies have no other option but to direct investments in AI chips and GPUs. He expects the AI chip market to reach $400 billion by 2027.\n\nJamie Dimon is Not Worried about AI Taking Over Jobs\n\nTechnology has been altering the world since humans came into being. On October 8, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan CEO appeared in an interview on Bloomberg Television where he discussed the role of artificial intelligence, initial public offerings, and the easing cycle by the Fed.\n\nAccording to Dimon, technology was previously limited to certain regions and countries, but now we have tech centers in almost every part of the world including Berlin, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. According to Dimon, the acceleration in technology is great and he is glad that innovation is taking precedence, especially in Europe.\n\nSpeaking of AI, Dimon suggests that artificial intelligence is going to change a lot of things that are common elements of our world. As far as job losses go, technology has always been changing the job market and is mostly responsible for taking away jobs. However, he emphasizes the need to look at the bigger picture.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, Dimon suggests that jobs will likely be more enhanced and researched-oriented. As for sectors like finance, people have been using it to detect fraud and minimize risk already. Similarly, AI has limited a lot of marketing jobs but at the same time, it has left a positive impact on productivity. Dimon shares he is not worried about AI changing the job landscape and that we should focus on re-training and re-educating workers losing their jobs as new technologies keep springing.\n\nNow that we have studied the outlook of the AI industry, let's take a look at the most promising AI stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the most promising AI stocks according to analysts, we sifted through multiple ETFs, our own rankings, and similar rankings on the internet. We then ranked the most promising AI stocks based on the Analyst upside as of October 9, 2024. We also included the hedge fund sentiment for each stock. It is to be noted, that we only considered stocks with a market capitalization of over $1 billion, as of October 9, 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nAnalyst Upside as of October 9, 2024: 26%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the most promising AI stocks according to analysts. The company owns a range of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo. Some of its AI products include Vertex AI, Gemini, Vision AI, Document AI, and Contact Center AI, to name a few.\n\nThe company is relentlessly working to improve the Gemini experience and is also actively involved in developing AI hardware, having launched its NVIDIA chip rival in May. While Google’s tensor processing units (TPU) only account for almost 20% of the market, its advancements promise higher market shares. It is to be noted that the company intends to spend $50 billion by the end of 2024 to enhance its position in AI.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) logged revenue worth $85 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, driven by the growing momentum in cloud and search. Additionally, over 60% of generative AI startups and 90% of generative AI unicorns are customers of the Google Cloud. One can infer that the technology giant is well-positioned to exploit the next wave of artificial intelligence and innovation, making it a solid investment.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on GOOGL and their 12-month median price target of $204 points to a 26% upside from current levels. Overall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). According to the Insider Monkey database, Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $8.86 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\"\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 7th on our list of the most promising AI stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley andJim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Morning Bid: Braced for Milton as oil recoils, China retreats",
        "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\n\nWall St stocks roared back on Tuesday just as China doubts re-emerge - but a scattergun week now has investors navigating the impact from a potentially devastating hurricane in Florida and a recoiling oil price in the face of Middle East tensions.\n\nAdding to this heavy and sometimes conflicting newsflow, the U.S. Justice Department late Tuesday said it may ask a judge to force Alphabet's Google to divest parts of its business, such as its Chrome browser and Android operating system - claiming they sustain an illegal monopoly in online search.\n\nDespite the breakup call, Alphabet's stock was steady in Frankfurt on Wednesday - but the antitrust move may be serve as a shot across the bow to Big Tech megacaps that once again led Tuesday's broader rally. Stock index futures were marginally in the red ahead of today's open.\n\nThe moves paled in comparison to the wild swings in China's markets, where growing doubts about the success of last month's slightly frantic economic stimulus measures saw the biggest one-day losses in mainland indexes there since the pandemic in 2020.\n\nStocks in Shanghai and the blue-chip CSI300 closed down 6.6% and 7.1% respectively on Wednesday - snapping a 10-day winning streak. Hong Kong added another 2% fall to its near 10% slide on Tuesday.\n\nClearly jarred by the sudden about face on markets, China's finance ministry said it will detail plans on a fiscal stimulus to boost the economy at a news conference on Saturday. But the market fizz has certainly disappeared after the original announcements.\n\nDespite U.S. hurricane fears and trepidation about what happens next between Israel and Iran, murmurs of ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and fresh the Chinese demand doubts saw oil prices fall back sharply on Tuesday - as crude clocked its biggest one-day drop of the year.\n\nThat's helped defuse anxiety about another energy price hit to the global disinflation process, with rates traders now focussed on Thursday's release of the September U.S. consumer price report.\n\nStory continues\n\nU.S. crude steadied on Wednesday just under $74 per barrel after a 4.5% slump in the previous session. Annual oil price moves continue to clock losses of about 14% year-on-year.\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts reckon the oil market risk premia they look at had dissipated considerably, with options markets pricing in a roughly 5% probability of a $20/bbl price jump.\n\nGoldman reckons that sort of price jump roughly corresponds to a 2 million barrels per day 6-month interruption without an OPEC offset, occurring within the next month.\n\nWith $39 billion of 10-year Treasury notes under the hammer later, 10-year yields fell back slightly today but continued to cling to a new-found 4% handle. The dollar remained pumped up and nudged higher to build on last week's surge.\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday releases minutes of its September policy meeting - where it began cutting interest rates with an outsize half point cut. But much of the thinking since then has changed due last week's robust employment report.\n\nThe short-term economic effects of Category 5 Hurricane Milton - which is due to make landfall on Wednesday and has already displaced more than million people from coastal areas - are harder to assess.\n\nDisruptions to economic data over the next month from this and the most recent hurricane Helene are likely at least.\n\nAirlines, energy firms and a Universal Studios theme park were among the companies beginning to halt their Florida operations as they braced for the huge storm.\n\nWhatever the hit, the strength of the economy more broadly looks able to absorb it.\n\nAfter the latest jobs and trade numbers, the Atlanta Fed's real-time 'GDPNow' estimate was again revised up sharply to 3.2% for the current quarter.\n\nWith less than a month to go before the U.S. election, fiscal jitters are also starting to re-emerge in bond markets.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated on Tuesday a U.S. federal deficit of $1.834 trillion for fiscal 2024, the highest in the post-COVID era, as debt interest costs jumped sharply and outlays rose for Social Security, Medicare and health insurance tax credits.\n\nNeither candidate in the election has plans to rein that deficit in and Republican Donald Trump's plans are expected to see twice the deterioration to the budget than that of Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nElsewhere, the once-hawkish New Zealand central bank announced its second interest rate cut of the year - a hefty half point reduction with promise of more to come. The kiwi dollar fell after the decision.\n\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:\n\n* Mexico September inflation\n\n* Federal Reserve releases minutes of Sept policymaking meeting\n\n* Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Dallas Fed boss Lorie Logan, Boston Fed chief Susan Collins, Richmond Fed chief Thomas Barkin, Chicago Fed chief Austan Goolsbee and Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic all speak\n\n* US corporate earnings: CostCo\n\n* US Treasury auctions $39 billion of 10-year notes\n\n(By Mike Dolan; Editing by Toby Chopra; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)",

The Fed is still scrambling to catch up with inflation slowing in the U.S. and started cutting rates late, but expectations about the pace of easing may be set by the minutes,\" said Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\nCommentary from a number of Fed officials including Philip Jefferson, Thomas Barkin, Raphael Bostic and Mary Daly are also expected through the day.\n\nInvestors are overwhelmingly pricing in a 25-basis-point cut at the Fed's November meeting, with some now seeing a slight chance the central bank will keep rates on hold, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nPrior to the release of strong employment data last week, markets were leaning towards an outsized 50-bps cut in November.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, shares of Arcadium Lithium soared 31.3% after Rio Tinto said it would acquire the miner for $6.7 billion. Rio Tinto's U.S.-listing slipped 1.2%.\n\nU.S.-listed shares of Chinese firms dropped for a second day, tracking a slide in domestic stocks as investors continued to question if China would announce new stimulus measures.\n\nAlibaba Group fell 3%, PDD Holdings lost 3.6% and JD.Com dropped 4.2%\n\nInvestors were also watching for the impact of Category 5 Hurricane Milton as well as the escalating conflict in the Middle East.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Mattackal in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Jefferies analysts initiated research coverage on Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $90, which implies over 27% upside from the last closing price.\n\nThe firm said the valuation is based on $65 per share for Advertising and $25 per share for Data Licensing.\n\nReddit shares rose 3% in premarket trading Wednesday.\n\nJefferies estimates that the company's EBITDA will more than double in the next two years to approximately $450 million, which is 12% above the 2026 consensus. This growth is expected to be driven by a significant increase in users and an opportunity to close the monetization gap compared to peers.\n\n“RDDT is combining AI-driven product enhancements with a robust archive of contextual content to spur trial and engagement, resulting in recent user growth accelerating to the highest level in 2+ years,” analysts said in a Wednesday note.\n\nA major factor contributing to this growth has been Reddit's deeper integration into Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search and the rollout of a faster web platform in May 2023. This, along with investments in AI and machine learning, have improved recommendation algorithms and user experience on the platform, leading to an increase in logged-in users.\n\nJefferies notes that Reddit's revenue per user (ARPU) in the U.S. is currently approximately 75% and 45% lower than that of its peers Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) and Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP), respectively. However, the investment bank predicts that the company’s continued innovations in ad formats, targeting, automation, and partnerships will lead to an expanded advertiser base and increased spending.\n\n“We estimate RDDT maintains 20%+ revenue growth through '27, as accelerating ARPU growth helps offset decelerating user growth. We consider upside to ARPU the key driver of potential upside to our revenue estimates,” it noted.\n\nLastly, Jefferies highlights the value of Reddit's extensive database of user-generated content, which has attracted significant interest from third-party developers of generative AI models.\n\nReddit has secured approximately $325 million in non-exclusive contract licensing revenue over the next three years, with major contributors including Google and OpenAI.\n\n“We believe expanding use-cases for Gen AI over time will attract new partnerships, resulting in additional high margin revenue streams and upside to consensus,” the firm’s analysts continued.\n\nThey project the company will achieve approximately 50% EBITDA compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next three years (2024-2027), the highest within Jefferies’s coverage. This translates to a 7% and 12% upside to 2025 and 2026 consensus estimates, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven stronger EBITDA growth is anticipated for the standalone Advertising segment.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nReddit stock rises as Jefferies starts coverage at Buy\n\nUS stock futures slip lower ahead of Fed minutes; Google faces break-up\n\nUS bank profits to shrink on interest income, focus shifts to Fed cuts\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The US Department of Justice is considering asking a federal judge to force Google to sell parts of its tech empire to combat its online search monopoly.\n\nThe US government had filed court papers saying it is considering asking a court to introduce remedies that could include “structural requirements” to stop Google maintaining its market dominance, in a move that could fundamentally shift how one of the world’s biggest companies operates.\n\nThe announcement comes after a landmark court ruling in August that found Google’s search engine had been illegally exploiting its dominance to hold back competition and stifle innovation.\n\nThe US government said it was now considering suggesting remedies that would “prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google Search and Google Search-related products”.\n\nIn its court papers, federal prosecutors said: “For more than a decade, Google has controlled the most popular distribution channels, leaving rivals with little to no incentive to compete for users.\n\n“Fully remedying these harms requires not only ending Google’s control of distribution today but also ensuring Google cannot control the distribution of tomorrow.”\n\nLee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, said in response to the filing that the Department of Justice was “already signalling requests that go far beyond the specific legal issues” in this case.\n\nShe added: “Government over-reach in a fast-moving industry may have negative unintended consequences for American innovation and America’s consumers.”\n\nIt could be years before any resolution in the case is reached, as Google has already said it plans to appeal the initial ruling, but the tech giant must wait until Judge Amit Mehta finalises his remedies through a trial currently planned for next spring, with a decision then due by August 2025.\n\nGoogle’s planned appeal process could then take as long as five years, according to George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the US Justice Department’s antitrust division for most of the 1970s. The US government is considering remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome to advantage Google Search (Andrew Matthews/PA)\n\nBen Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot said it would be a “long drawn-out process” but the US government’s decision was a “shot across the now” of Google and its parent firm, Alphabet.\n\n“The Department of Justice in the US has delivered its first strike in its attempt to curb Alphabet’s search engine power,” he said.\n\n“It has cast the net fairly wide in its list of potential remedies but for now the detail remains incredibly shallow. The share price was unmoved on the news, as the proposed range of remedies was in line with fears.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Ultimately this is the opening salvo and the more extreme elements proposed may or may not remain.\n\n“Ultimately the Department of Justice is looking to level the playing field in search, and given Google’s scale it is no surprise to see things such as divestment and opening up data on the cards for change.\n\n“If these changes were to take effect it would be a huge change in how people and businesses use and interact with the internet in their daily lives, so this is clearly a high-stakes game of poker just now.\n\n“But for now not a lot changes, and this will put a lid on investor enthusiasm for Alphabet for this year and most of next, until more is known. Next month sees the next stage of the process with the Department of Justice’s final remedy package revealed before it goes before judges in April.\n\n“Simply put this will be a long drawn-out process with lots of negotiation still to take place. However, the DoJ has fired a shot across the bow of Alphabet.”\n\nThe announcement is the latest clampdown on Google in the US.\n\nEarlier this week, a judge in a separate case ordered the company to open up its app store to rivals to remedy what the court called an “illegal monopoly” in that sector.\n\nOther US tech giants, including Meta, Amazon and Apple are also facing lawsuits in their home country as the government looks to strengthen competition in the sector.",

        "title": "US considers asking court to break up Google as it weighs remedies in the antitrust case",
        "content": "The U.S. Department of Justice is considering asking a federal judge to force Google to sell parts of its business in order to eliminate its online search monopoly.\n\nIn a late court filing on Tuesday, federal prosecutors also said the judge could ask the court to open the underlying data Google uses to power its ubiquitous search engine and artificial intelligence products to competitors.\n\n“For more than a decade, Google has controlled the most popular distribution channels, leaving rivals with little-to-no incentive to compete for users,” the antitrust enforcers wrote in the filing. “Fully remedying these harms requires not only ending Google’s control of distribution today, but also ensuring Google cannot control the distribution of tomorrow.”\n\nTo that end, the department said it is considering asking for structural changes to stop Google from leveraging products such as its Chrome browser, Android operating system, AI products or app store to benefit its search business. Prosecutors also seem to center on Google's default search agreements in the filing and said any remedy proposals would seek to limit or ban these deals.\n\nLee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, said in response to the filing that the Department of Justice was “already signaling requests that go far beyond the specific legal issues\" in this case. “Government overreach in a fast-moving industry may have negative unintended consequences for American innovation and America’s consumers.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled in August that Google's search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. He has outlined a timeline for a trial on the proposed remedies next spring and plans to issue a decision by August 2025.\n\nGoogle has already said it plans to appeal Mehta’s ruling, but the tech giant must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so. The appeals process could take as long as five years, predicts George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department’s antitrust division for most of the 1970s.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The US Justice Department told a federal judge it is considering recommending that Google be forced to sell off parts of its operations to alleviate the harm caused by its monopolization of the online search market, in what would be a historic antitrust breakup.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums Singapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters?\n\nIn a court filing Tuesday, antitrust enforcers said Judge Amit Mehta could also force the Alphabet Inc. unit to provide access to the underlying data it uses to build its search results and artificial intelligence products.\n\nThe Justice Department “is considering behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features — including emerging search access points and features, such as artificial intelligence — over rivals or new entrants,” the agency said in the filing.\n\nThe filing represents Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. The 32-page filing lays outs a framework of potential options for the judge to consider as the case moves to the remedy phase.\n\nAntitrust enforcers said Google gained scale and data benefits from its illegal distribution agreements with other tech companies that made its search engine the default option on smartphones and web browsers.\n\nThe Justice Department said it may seek a requirement that Google allow websites more ability to opt out of its artificial intelligence products. The agency said it is also considering proposals related to Google’s dominance over search text ads such as requirements that the company provide more information and control to advertisers over where their ads appear.\n\nThe agency may also request that Google be restricted from investing in search competitors or potential rivals. The agency said it will provide a fuller proposal on remedies next month.\n\nGoogle didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMehta, who ruled this summer that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets, plans to hold a trial on the proposed remedy next spring and issue a decision by August 2025. Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta’s decision, but must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle’s Android business encompasses the operating system used on smartphones and devices as well as apps.\n\nOn Monday, a different federal judge ordered Google to open up its app store for the next three years to resolve a separate antitrust case brought by Epic Games Inc. related to its dominance of app distribution on Android smartphones. The company also plans to appeal that decision.\n\n(Updates with more details from filing)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMusk Reveals Why He’s Jumping Into Trump’s Arms Rate Cuts Need Time to Work Their Way Through the Economy How Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession Hamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "title": "Ray Dalio Says Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) Was a Top Contributor in the Second Quarter",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list titled 7 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio. In this article, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks among the best cheap stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio.\n\nBorn in 1949, Ray Dalio bought his first stock, Northeast Airlines, at the age of 12. Later, the investment manager graduated from Long Island University in 1971. Before going to Harvard Business School, he spent some time as a clerk on the NYSE. In 1973, he became Director of Commodities at Dominick & Dominick LLC. After working there for 1 year, he then spent one-year trading futures at the brokerage firm of Shearson Hayden Stone before founding Bridgewater Associates. He has been serving as co-CIO, a position he shares with Robert Prince and Greg Jensen.\n\nAs of now, Bridgewater Associates is being tagged as a premier asset management firm, which is focused on delivering unique insight and partnership for the most sophisticated global institutional investors. The firm’s investment process revolves around understanding how the world markets and economies work, leveraging cutting-edge technology to validate timeless and universal investment principles.\n\nUnderstanding Ray Dalio’s Investment Philosophy\n\nThe broader understanding of the “Economic Machine ” influences Ray Dalio’s investment philosophy. The investment manager believes that understanding the working of the economy forms the fundamental part of successful investing. According to him, the economic cycle is divided into 3 main phases: 1) Inflationary, 2) Disinflationary, and 3) Deflationary. The investors must adapt their strategies after considering where the economy is in this cycle. Ray Dalio’s deep understanding of the broader global economy led him to correctly predict Mexico’s 1980s financial crisis, reflecting that he can spot risks and opportunities. He also believes that debt cycles have an important role to play in shaping economic and market conditions.\n\nRay Dalio realized that the economy tends to move in cycles, fluctuating between periods of growth and decline. This led to the development of the “All Weather” portfolio at Bridgewater Associates, which targets to minimize volatility throughout market environments. According to him, assets like stocks, bonds, and currencies respond differently to broader conditions. This is known as inverse correlation. Therefore, Dalio emphasizes that diversification remains a key in managing risk in an investment portfolio.\n\nNext, Ray Dalio believes in systematic decision-making. At the time of research, his principles use a very data-driven approach. This means that he conducts research using historical pricing, financial figures, and economic indicators so that market direction can be accurately predicted. He continues to focus on maintaining principle-based decision-making processes, algorithms, and data-driven analysis.\n\nStory continues\n\nRay Dalio’s investment principle of “Strategic Selling for Maximum Profit” focuses on the idea of making informed decisions regarding when to sell investments in a bid to maximize the returns while, at the same time, managing risk. As of the end of Q2 2024, Bridgewater Associates has ~21.7% exposure to the services industry, ~19.6% to the technology sector, and ~12.1% to the consumer goods business.\n\nBridgewater Associates’ View on US Equities\n\nSince 2010, while the broader tech sector saw an outsized impact, the US outperformance was broad-based throughout sectors. The US outperformance concerning sales and margin growth was roughly half because of the US tech sector and half as a result of other sectors, while the impact on P/E expansion remained even higher for tech. In contribution terms, Bridgewater Associates stated that technology made up for ~54% of the total 74% US equity outperformance since 2010 as compared to the developed world.\n\nThe investment firm believes that some of the largest drivers of US equity outperformance should not be relied upon moving forward. The direction of the markets depends on the ability of the US tech to deliver and Al to unleash productivity throughout sectors. This is for both (a) the US Big Tech directly, which now makes up over ~30% of the index and increased expectations, and (b) how the Al/ML technology will help the companies and how much of it gets captured as margins by these companies across the various non-tech sectors.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo list the 7 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio, we sifted through Bridgewater Associates’ Q2 2024 13F portfolio. After extracting the list of his holdings, we chose the stocks that are trading at a forward earnings multiple of less than ~23.52x (since the broader market trades at a forward earnings multiple of ~23.52x, as per WSJ) and selected the 7 best cheap stocks to buy. Finally, the stocks are ranked in ascending order of the fund’s stakes in them.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nBridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $827,010,363\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of 4 October: 18.94x\n\nWall Street believes that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s growth momentum is expected to be aided by Google’s Search and Cloud services. Moreover, its innovation in Al and infrastructure leadership should continue to aid its revenues and earnings. The company remains focused on re-engineering its cost base.\n\nThe analysts have seen positive trends throughout the engagement, Al-embedded Search, and GCP. Experts opine that ads business momentum and the growth of its subscriptions business should continue to act as principal tailwinds. Investments will be made towards technical infrastructure and cloud growth.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s strong competitive positioning, supplemented by its dominant core search business, is expected to further strengthen user inclination moving forward. The company’s prospects are further cemented by its potential to lead in consumer Al assistant use, considering the widespread global device presence. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s prowess in Al and its financial strength enable it to provide greater financial incentives to handset manufacturers to go for default Al placement.\n\nWall Street believes that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains well-placed to achieve healthy financial growth and generate a reasonable Al return on invested capital (ROIC), even if the development of Al revenue-generating applications might take longer than expected. Recently, the company highlighted that new products and features in Google Cloud and YouTube continue to attract partnerships and increase paid subscribers.\n\nWolfe Research initiated coverage on the shares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on 16th July. The firm gave an “Outperform” rating with a price target of $240.00.\n\nPatient Capital Management, a value investing firm, released its second quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 1st on our list of best cheap stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Trust in robotaxis is higher among users, J.D. Power study finds",
        "content": "There's some good news for robotaxi operators: People who have ridden in robotaxis really like them.\n\nAccording to a new study by automotive research firm J.D. Power, robotaxi passengers rated the experience an 8.53 out of 10, with the leading contributor of the experience being “vehicle technology.”\n\nJ.D. Power also found that “consumer confidence” when riding in a robotaxi — defined as a fully automated, self-driving vehicle — was 56% higher among those who have ridden in one (76%), compared to those who have not (20%). J.D. Power noted that non-riders in cities with robotaxis also saw higher consumer confidence than the average non-rider, at 34%.\n\nJ.D. Power researchers said these are indications that “experience continues to be a main driver of trust and acceptance.”\n\n“The robotaxi segment is still anyone’s game, given that most people are not familiar with robotaxi brands and haven’t formed a clear associative imagery,” said Kathleen Rizk, senior director of user experience benchmarking and technology at J.D. Power, in the report. “Industry leaders like Cruise and Waymo, along with lesser-known companies such as Zoox, May Mobility, and Motional, need to look beyond their deployment markets and find ways to educate and build trust with all consumers.”\n\nJ.D. Power conducted its Robotaxi Experience Study — now in its second year, based on responses from 3,773 respondents comprising 773 consumers living in cities with robotaxi services (Dallas, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco), as well as a national sample of 3,000 consumers.\n\nThe low sample size is indicative of the state of the robotaxi market, which is small but growing. Alphabet’s Waymo expanded its offerings to Austin and Atlanta recently via its partnership with Uber. Pedestrians exit a Waymo self-driving car in front of Google's San Francisco headquarters, San Francisco, California, June 7, 2024. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) (Smith Collection/Gado via Getty Images)\n\nCruise, operated by GM, restarted its service in May of this year in Phoenix and Dallas with supervised rides and also signed a deal with Uber to have its vehicles summoned on Uber’s app. Zoox, owned by Amazon, is currently testing its robotaxis and said its service will be available soon for public riders in Las Vegas.\n\nAnd then there's Tesla. The EV giant is holding its robotaxi event, dubbed “We, Robot,” on Thursday night, where the company is expected to reveal a fully autonomous cybercab EV that will be the basis for its robotaxi. Tesla is also expected to unveil a software service that would enable current Tesla EVs with full self-driving to be added to a robotaxi fleet for ridesharing.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has basically said Tesla is a bet on autonomous driving, AI, and robotics. With the portion of the general public who ride in robotaxis seemingly accepting of them, at least according to J.D. Power, the valuation for Tesla’s robotaxi ambitions could be validated.\n\nStory continues\n\nMusk has said the robotaxi business could be a $5 trillion market. While that sounds ambitious, analysts at RBC Capital say it could still be worth a robust $1.7 trillion globally by 2040.\n\nWhat’s more, RBC sees the margins as much higher than the typical 5% to 10% seen in the automotive sector, making it that much more of an attractive business for a Tesla that sees itself as more than just an automaker.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "A self-driving truck startup wants Waymo, Cruise, and others to follow its lead on safety",
        "content": "Self-driving truck startup Gatik on Thursday announced plans for what it calls the “most rigorous” third-party review of an autonomous driving system. And it wants others to follow its lead.\n\nGatik, which calls itself the leader in autonomous middle-miles, works with companies such as Walmart (WMT), Tyson Foods (TSN), and Kroger (KR) to move products on short routes between distribution centers and other locations. The company’s trucks have driven “hundreds of thousands” of miles without a driver and have carried out thousands of deliveries with its partners in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nGatik is also one of, if not the only, self-driving startup with a perfect safety record — thanks to its cautious software that prioritizes avoiding difficult areas, such as roads near schools or hospitals. But according to CEO Gautam Narang, that’s not enough for Gatik to feel comfortable launching autonomous deliveries across North America.\n\n“In the U.S., there are no specific standards when it comes to proving safety for autonomous vehicles,” Narang said, noting every company uses its own framework for safety. That’s “very important, very helpful, but we believe we can do better. The industry can do better.”\n\nThe company has hired two third-party research firms — Edge Case Research and TÜV SÜD — to audit Gatik’s technology and deployment across more than 700 safety portfolios. As the tests are conducted, Gatik said it will be providing public updates on its progress.\n\n“Our Safety Case approach is tangible, comprehensive, and leverages the benefits of Gatik’s [business-to-business] short haul use-case to safely scale across our freight networks,” Gatik’s head of safety, Adam Campbell, said in a statement. He noted that the company has chosen to go “far beyond” the voluntary assessment established by regulators.\n\n‘Incredibly high expectations’\n\nThis isn’t the first time an autonomous vehicle company — or group — has tried to set up core guidelines around safety for ethical reasons or to alleviate consumer concerns. Sixty-six percent of drivers fear self-driving vehicles, while 25% are uncertain, according to a March study from AAA.\n\nThe Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association — an industry group most major players, including Gatik, are part of — has what it calls the “TRUST” principles, which focus on transparency and a safety-first culture. In 2019, 11 companies banded to try and standardize safety, afraid that one bad actor could collapse the market.\n\nBut, by and large, most companies take different approaches to safety.\n\nSome, such as Waabi or Wayve, take an artificial-intelligence-first approach to predict how vehicles move or learn from human behavior. Others, such as Google’s Waymo (GOOGL) or Tesla (TSLA), focus on collecting data from vehicles already on the road. Waymo recently published a series of datasets demonstrating its vehicles’ impact in four markets where the company operates.\n\nAs companies such as Waymo, Amazon’s Zoox (AMZN), and General Motors’ Cruise (GM) continue to expand their operations and aim to remove drivers from their cars, scrutiny has increased. Federal regulators launched investigations into Waymo, Zoox, Ford Motor Co., and Tesla earlier this year over issues related to their technologies.\n\nMeanwhile, Cruise is still trying to shake off some consumer and regulatory concerns after a devastating incident almost exactly a year ago.\n\nOn Oct. 2, 2023, a human-driven vehicle struck a pedestrian in California, knocking her into the path of a Cruise robotaxi that then dragged the person about 20 feet forward. Last week, the company paid a $1.5 million penalty for failing to properly report the incident.\n\nSince then, Cruise has undergone a series of leadership changes, established an executive board overseeing safety, published a third-party audit, and — for a time — suspended operations, among other things. The company has started to put its cars back on the streets in Houston, Dallas, Phoenix, and California’s Bay Area with a driver behind the wheel. Before returning to commercial operations, Cruise plans to commission another third-party audit.\n\n“We recognize that our communities hold incredibly high expectations for the performance of [autonomous vehicles] on their roads - even higher than the current status quo performance of human drivers,” Cruise Chief Safety Office Steve Kenner said in a statement. “Safety is inextricable from community trust and transparency - in fact it is foundational to establishing that trust - which is why we have raised the bar on ourselves to be a ‘Role Model Driver.’”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

Wood in an interview with Yahoo Finance predicts this could translate into a staggering “trillion-dollar-plus revenue opportunity for Tesla in the next five years.”\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.

ARK Invest has been among the firms investing in OpenAI, signaling Wood’s broader bet on the AI sector.\n\nWood identified OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Alphabet Inc‘s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) as companies “stealing the march” in the AI space.\n\nShe expressed optimism about the development of agentic AI, which she believes will pave the way for increased profitability as companies can charge premium rates for more advanced AI capabilities.\n\nTesla’s \"We, Robot\" event is scheduled for Thursday at 10 p.m. EDT, with investors hoping that the event will give a lift to the stock.\n\nSee Also: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.

This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy It Matters: Addressing concerns about OpenAI’s recent executive departures, Wood praised the leadership of CEO Sam Altman and CFO Sarah Friar. She noted that rapid growth often necessitates management changes, stating, “What we witness in companies that are growing very quickly from startup into scaling is you need a different kind of management team.”\n\nOn the topic of AI companies potentially going public, Wood observed a trend of firms staying private longer. She cited regulatory burdens and short-term investor mindsets in public markets as deterrents. However, she suggested that lower interest rates and increased investor patience for long-term strategies could make public offerings more attractive in the future.\n\nTurning back to Tesla, Wood addressed the company’s long-promised autonomous driving capabilities. “It’s no longer a question of if, but when, for Tesla,” she said, pointing to Google-owned Waymo’s progress as evidence that autonomous driving is becoming a reality.\n\nWood’s firm has published a model on its website and GitHub, allowing investors to explore various scenarios for the autonomous vehicle market’s growth. According to their research, the platform opportunity for companies hosting autonomous networks could represent a “$4 to $5 trillion revenue opportunity over the next 5 to 10 years.”\n\nThe ARK Venture Fund agreed to invest at least $250 million in OpenAI’s historic funding round. This investment marks ARK’s second in the AI firm, which has been pivotal in the generative AI space since launching ChatGPT.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

        "title": "Pinterest Is Emerging From Selloff as a New Wall Street Favorite",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- After a volatile summer, Wall Street is taking another look at Pinterest Inc. So far, analysts like what they see.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Singapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums What Do US Vehicle Regulators Have Against Tiny Cars? For a Master of Brutalist Provocations, a Modest Museum Appraisal\n\nThe social-media company has received positive commentary from Goldman Sachs and Oppenheimer, among others, with analysts touting its growth potential and ability to better monetize its user base, including through artificial intelligence. A partnership with Amazon.com Inc., announced in August, and the recent Pinterest Presents advertiser summit have solidified the view that the stock could be an underappreciated bargain in the sector.\n\n“The reason Pinterest is getting all this new attention is that it potentially has massive tailwinds, but it’s not really expensive,” said Conrad van Tienhoven, portfolio manager at Riverpark Capital. “Improving ad targeting is a natural use for AI, and the partnership with Amazon is a match made in heaven, as close as a game changer as you can get.”\n\nPinterest shares are still recovering from a steep July selloff after its lackluster third-quarter revenue forecast disappointed investors. While the stock has rallied about 13% over the past month, it’s still down 12% this year, underperforming an exchange-traded fund that tracks social media companies, which is up 12% year-to-date.\n\nBut Pinterest analysts are getting more positive. Goldman Sachs added the stock to its Americas Conviction List last week, citing the potential for revenue growth and adjusted Ebitda margin expansion. RBC Capital Markets also added the company to its top 30 global ideas for 2024.\n\n“The company has historically undermonetized its platform, which new management seems to be addressing, and it is growing and ramping margins more quickly relative to the overall space,” the RBC analysts wrote. Pinterest named Google and PayPal Inc. veteran Bill Ready as chief executive officer in 2022.\n\nThose calls followed two initiations at buy-equivalent ratings. Analysts at Oppenheimer cited upside to engagement and an attractive valuation, while peers at Deutsche Bank called Pinterest “increasingly indispensable” for advertisers.\n\nOverall, the stock now has a recommendation consensus — a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings — of 4.47 out of five. That’s above the highs it saw for that metric during the pandemic, when stay-at-home orders accelerated user growth and engagement.\n\nStory continues\n\nPinterest’s average analyst price target points to upside above 30% over the coming 12 months, the strongest return potential among US social media peers. That kind of gain would return Pinterest to near a multi-year high hit in June, erasing the recent selloff.\n\nThe summer share-price slump has left Pinterest trading at less than 20 times estimated earnings, below its three-year average multiple and cheaper than peers like Snap Inc. and Reddit Inc. Still, it’s not much less expensive than Meta at around 24.5 times, and the Facebook parent is seen by some as a less risky choice.\n\n“It’s an additional leap of faith to buy Pinterest rather than Meta, and while I’m not saying it won’t work, until it shows that its improvements are sustainable, we just have more comfort in Meta,” said Tom Plumb, chief investment officer of Wisconsin Capital Management.\n\n“Pinterest has a good setup in terms of revenue and margins, but Meta offers similar growth and a similarly attractive multiple, along with market dominance and more diverse revenue sources. When you have that, Pinterest isn’t a play we’re willing to make.”\n\nStill, others are willing to make the leap, especially given that revenue is expected to grow 19% this year and hold near or above a double-digit pace through 2027. Even faster growth trends are seen for the company’s net earnings.\n\n“If it shows that kind of execution, more people will come around to recognizing its potential,” Van Tienhoven said.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nHon Hai Precision Industry Co. plans to boost server capacity to meet stronger-than-anticipated demand for Nvidia Corp. chips used to develop AI, reflecting its expectations that spending on artificial intelligence will stay high. Salesforce Ventures-backed quantum technology startup Q-Ctrl raised $59 million from investors including Lockheed Martin Ventures, the latest sign of growing interest in quantum’s possible military applications. Samsung Electronics Co. issued an apology to investors for disappointing results, admitting that the once-dominant memory chip giant is grappling with a potential crisis after losing its way. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund disclosed it’s sold down its stake in Nintendo Co., days after a senior executive said it was weighing deploying more capital into the Kyoto-based games company. Alphabet Inc. must lift restrictions that prevent developers from setting up rival marketplaces and billing systems that compete with its Google Play Store, a judge ruled, upending the search giant’s dominance in the lucrative Android app market and probably denting its revenue.\n\nEarnings Due Tuesday\n\nIDT\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "content": "By Jody Godoy\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice is expected to outline on Tuesday what kind of actions Alphabet's Google could be ordered to take to restore competition in online search, potentially including a breakup of the Big Tech company.\n\nAfter a federal court in August ruled Google controls an illegal monopoly in online search, smaller rivals want the court to force Google to spin off its Chrome browser, or at least prohibit it from continuing to pay billions of dollars to make its search engine the default on devices such as Apple's iPhone.\n\nThe broad DOJ proposals are the next step in a landmark case that has the potential to reshape how Americans find information on the internet after a judge found Google, which processes 90% of U.S. internet searches, had built an illegal monopoly.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta's ruling in Washington was a major win for antitrust enforcers who have brought an ambitious set of cases against Big Tech companies over the past four years.\n\nGoogle has said it plans to appeal, and that its search engine has won users through its quality. Google said it faces robust competition from Amazon and other sites where users go directly to search for goods or services, and that users can choose other search engines as their default.\n\nSome companies that compete with Google have called for a breakup.\n\nReviews site Yelp, which sued Google over search in August, says spinning off Google's Chrome browser and AI services should be on the table. Yelp also wants Google to be prohibited from giving preference to its own local business pages, which compete with Yelp, in search results.\n\nAdam Epstein, president and co-CEO of search ad company adMarketplace, said the threat of ordering Google to sell off parts of its business could be used as a way to enforce less drastic remedies.\n\n\"Google is not going to have the incentive to comply unless they have the Damocles' sword of divestiture hanging above them,\" he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nRival search engine company DuckDuckGo has called for the court to require Google to license its search results to competitors who could then build and improve their own products.\n\nMicrosoft, which operates rival search engine Bing, and Apple, which receives billions of dollars annually from Google, declined to comment.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

        "title": "What's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy If Kamala Harris Wins in November?",
        "content": "The stock market has performed pretty well as the Biden-Harris administration draws to a close. Despite the steep decline in 2022, the S&P 500 has soared nearly 50%. Much of this performance was driven by huge gains for the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nCould this momentum continue in a Kamala Harris administration? And, if so, what's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Harris wins in November? Kamala Harris. Official White House photo by Lawrence Jackson.\n\nHarris' proposals that could affect the Magnificent Seven\n\nHarris has unveiled a wide range of economic proposals. Her campaign released an 82-page document outlining what she'd like to do to create what she calls \"an opportunity economy.\" Not all of the proposals in this document affect the Magnificent Seven, but several could.\n\nThe vice president's plan to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% has received significant media attention. Although this is a large increase, it's still lower than the maximum corporate tax rate of 39% that was in place before former President Donald Trump's tax cuts went into effect in 2018.\n\nAnother Harris proposal is to quadruple the tax rate on corporate stock buybacks. The rationale behind this plan is \"to encourage businesses to invest in growth and productivity.\"\n\nHarris also wants the federal government to invest in industries that are important to the country's economic and national security. Her plan specifically identifies the following types of businesses that would be eligible for tax credits:\n\nAerospace companies Artificial intelligence (AI) data centers Automobile manufacturers Biotechnology companies Clean energy manufacturers Semiconductor manufacturers Steel and iron producers\n\nEvaluating the impact of these proposals\n\nIn theory, the members of the Magnificent Seven -- Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) -- would be affected equally by Harris' proposed corporate tax rate increase. However, in practice, this change could impact the big companies differently.\n\nThe following table shows the effective tax rates paid by the Magnificent Seven in their most recent fiscal years:\n\nCompany Effective Tax Rate Alphabet 13.9% Amazon 9.73% Apple 14.7% Meta Platforms 17.6% Microsoft 18% Nvidia 12% Tesla (50% Tax Benefit)\n\nData sources: Company 10-K filings. *Tesla received more tax benefits than it paid in taxes in 2023.\n\nAs you can see, none of the Magnificent Seven companies paid the full 21% corporate tax rate. Microsoft and Meta had the highest effective tax rates of the group. However, all of the companies have been adept at using the tax code to their advantage.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat about stock buybacks? Most of the Magnificent Seven members have repurchased shares in significant amounts. Apple has by far spent the most money on stock buybacks -- $70.6 billion in the nine months ended July 1, 2023. Increased taxes on stock buybacks could cause Apple and others to change their capital deployment strategies. However, I don't expect this would significantly impact their stock performance or underlying businesses.\n\nEach of these companies could benefit from the tax credits for AI data centers proposed by Harris. As the three largest cloud services providers, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet might be the biggest winners on this front. However, Nvidia could also be helped quite a bit because its GPUs are used heavily in AI data centers. In addition, Nvidia and Tesla could potentially receive tax credits offered to semiconductor makers and automakers, respectively.\n\nThe best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Harris wins\n\nSo what's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Harris wins the presidential race? The honest answer is that there's insufficient information to know which stock might benefit the most from the aforementioned policies proposed by the vice president. Furthermore, it's uncertain if she would be able to implement all of her plans should she be elected. The U.S. Congress advances legislation; the president only signs the bills into law.\n\nThat said, many economists believe that Harris' economic policies would help control inflation, while Trump's plans (especially his proposed tariffs) could cause inflation to rise. If these economists are right, interest rates would more likely be lower during a Harris administration than they would otherwise be.\n\nWhile all the Magnificent Seven stocks should benefit from a lower-rate environment, I think the best pick of the group is Amazon. The company has a substantial debt load, which makes it a potentially bigger beneficiary of lower rates than the other Magnificent Seven members. Lower interest rates could also boost consumer and corporate spending, helping Amazon's e-commerce, advertising, and cloud services businesses.\n\nRegardless of which person occupies the White House over the next four years, Amazon should benefit from the shift of IT spending to the cloud from on-premises. This migration will likely be accelerated by AI advances.\n\nSurprisingly, Amazon stock has only climbed around 12% during Harris' time as VP. I suspect it could deliver much greater gains if she becomes president and interest rates decline further.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,006!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $42,905!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $388,128!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 7, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "Google has been ordered to open up its app store to rivals following a major court case in the US.\n\nLast year, a federal judge ruled the tech giant was running an illegal monopoly in how it controlled the distribution of apps on its Android operating system and via the Google Play Store.\n\nNow, in the final ruling on the case, Judge James Donato has ordered Google to open up the Google Play store in the United States for three years, including allowing third-party app stores to be distributed from within Google Play, and giving third-party app stores access to the full catalogue of Google Play apps, unless developers choose to opt out individually.\n\nBeginning in November, Google is also being forced to stop requiring its own payment system be used for apps on the Play Store, as well as allow developers to tell users about about other ways to pay from within the store, let developers link to other ways to download their apps outside of Google’s app store, and let developers set their own prices for apps.\n\nIn addition, the tech giant has been told that it can’t offer developers money or perks to launch their apps on the Play Store first or exclusively or to not launch on rival stores.\n\nThe company has been told it also cannot offer money or perks to device makers or mobile carriers to preinstall the Play Store.\n\nThe remedies are in response to the verdict delivered in the Epic Games v Google case in December last year, when a jury found that Google had monopoly power in the Android app distribution market and engaged in anticompetitive behaviour to maintain that monopoly.\n\nThe case had been brought by Epic, the maker of popular battle royale game Fortnite, over in-app purchases fees it said were unfair to third-party app developers.\n\nEpic Games has recently filed a new lawsuit in the US against Google and Samsung, claiming that Google is now compelling Android customers – such as Samsung – to put barriers up between users and third-party app stores as a well of getting around the court ruling against Google.\n\nResponding to the judge’s remedies in a post on X, Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said: “The Google Play Store injunction lasts for three years.\n\n“This means all app developers, store makers, carriers, and manufacturers have three years to build a vibrant and competitive Android ecosystem with such critical mass that Google can’t stop it.”\n\nIn a blog post, Google’s vice president for regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland, said the technology giant would appeal the verdict and ask the courts to pause implementing the remedies.\n\nStory continues\n\n“As we have already stated, these changes would put consumers’ privacy and security at risk, make it harder for developers to promote their apps, and reduce competition on devices,” she said.\n\n“Ultimately, while these changes presumably satisfy Epic, they will cause a range of unintended consequences that will harm American consumers, developers and device makers.\n\n“These Epic-requested changes stem from a decision that is completely contrary to another court’s rejection of similar claims Epic made against Apple – even though, unlike iOS, Android is an open platform that has always allowed for choice and flexibility like multiple app stores and sideloading.\n\n“We are appealing that underlying decision and we will ask the courts to pause Epic’s requested changes, pending that appeal.”",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Among Seth Klarman’s Top Stock Picks",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Seth Klarman Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other stocks in Seth Klarman's portfolio.\n\nSeth Klarman, the founder and CEO of Baupost Group, is a prominent figure in the investment industry, with his hedge fund ranking as the 12th largest globally. Renowned for his insightful investment strategies, Klarman is also the author of Margin of Safety, a highly respected book that outlines his philosophy on value investing and is known for its scarcity and high resale value, often fetching prices over $1,500.\n\nAfter earning his MBA from Harvard Business School, Klarman was recruited by his professor, Bill Poorvu, to help manage investments, marking the beginning of a successful career in finance. His approach emphasizes thorough analysis and a disciplined perspective, setting him apart in a competitive market. Poorvu, along with his partners, Howard Stevenson, Jordan Baruch, and Isaac Auerbach, formed the company name Baupost from their last names. This decision did not reflect a desire to exclude Klarman but rather preserved the initial branding of the firm. When Baupost launched in 1982, it had an impressive initial capital of $27 million, a substantial sum at the time.\n\nThe founders initially intended to distribute this capital among multiple money managers; however, they struggled to find other conservative managers who fit their investment style, leading to Klarman being entrusted with the entire amount. His approach to investing was distinctly conservative, which later became a hallmark of his strategy. Klarman is also the author of the influential book Margin of Safety, which provides insights into his investment principles and has become highly sought after by investors, with copies sometimes selling for over $1,500.\n\nNavigating the Everything Bubble: Seth Klarman on Investment Risks and Opportunities in a Disrupted Market\n\nSeth Klarman observes that the current investment landscape resembles an \"everything bubble,\" characterized by an influx of money across various asset classes. This phenomenon has been fueled by historically low interest rates, some even hitting zero. Alongside this, technological advancements have accelerated, leading to disruptions in numerous industries, which presents both challenges and opportunities for investors. He appeared on CNBC in June 2023 where he said:\n\n\"The first thing is, I think we've been in an everything bubble. A lot of money has flowed into virtually everything. Historic low interest rates, even zero rates, have precipitated that bubble. You’ve also had a lot of changes in the business world; technology has accelerated if anything, and you’ve seen disruption in all kinds of businesses, which creates challenges and opportunities for investors.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nKlarman noted that certain asset classes, particularly private credit, have gained significant attention during this period. He highlights that speculation has surged in various areas, from cryptocurrencies to meme stocks and SPACs, emphasizing the need for investors to be mindful of the risks associated with speculation and to understand the context of the current environment.\n\n\"Some asset classes have become increasingly popular; private credit has had its day in the sun. You've had speculation during that bubble in all kinds of things, from crypto to meme stocks to SPACs, in a way that has some important reminders for people about the dangers of speculation and the importance of remembering what kind of environment you’re in.\"\n\nUnderstanding Value Investing: The Need for a Dynamic Approach in an Ever-Changing Market Landscape\n\nSeth Klarman believes that the traditional academic definition of value investing, which focuses on buying the cheapest stocks based on numerical analysis, is too simplistic. Instead, he views the market through a broader lens. He suggests that all stocks can have value, but they can also be overvalued. To navigate this complexity, investors need a clear framework or set of guidelines to assess the value of various assets and businesses, helping them identify which ones are mis-priced. Here are some comments from his CNBC interview from back in Q2 2023:\n\n\"The academic definition of value is to buy the stock that’s cheapest by the numbers... The way I think about the market is not that there are growth stocks and value stocks, but rather that all stocks may hold value but that all stocks also could potentially be overvalued. You have to have a mechanism, a rubric, for figuring out the value of different kinds of assets, different kinds of businesses to identify which ones are trading particularly mispriced.\"\n\nIn today's rapidly changing market, Klarman emphasizes the importance of looking beyond current earnings. He warns that today's earnings may not be sustainable; a business could face disruption or even become obsolete, but conversely, its value could increase significantly. Therefore, a forward-thinking approach is crucial for investors, allowing them to adapt to evolving market conditions while identifying long-term opportunities.\n\n\"In a world that’s changing as fast as this one, it’s really important to think about not just what are the earnings today. The earnings may not be here tomorrow. the business might be disrupted. the business may be gone, or they could be 50% to 100% more.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article examines the top 10 stock holdings of Baupost Group for the second quarter of 2024, detailing the fund's investments and the number of other hedge funds involved with these companies during the same period. The stocks are organized in ascending order based on the stake Baupost Group held in each, as of June 30, 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has 53% of His Hedge Fund's $10.6 Billion Portfolio Invested in Just 3 Stocks",
        "content": "Bill Ackman is one of the best-known billionaire investors in the world. His hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital, focuses on a few high-quality businesses where Ackman feels the stock has become mispriced, relative to its value. He will then buy shares and use his influence to unlock shareholder value.\n\nAs an activist investor, he can focus on only so many businesses at once. That means he only swings at what he thinks are his biggest opportunities. As a result, Pershing Square has a highly concentrated portfolio, and just three stocks account for more than 53% of the entire $10.6 billion in public equity holdings.\n\n1. Hilton Worldwide (19.7%)\n\nHilton Worldwide(NYSE: HLT) has grown to become Ackman's largest position for Pershing Square. The investor first accumulated shares of the largest hotelier in the world in 2016, but it wasn't until 2018 that he had an opportunity to establish a significant position in the stock during the market downturn.\n\n\"Hilton's extensive and growing network of brands and properties offers a significant and self-reinforcing value proposition to both guests and hotel owners, which creates a strong competitive moat around the business,\" Ackman wrote to investors in 2018.\n\nThat moat has only gotten stronger as Hilton expanded its brand count to 24 and counts over 7,700 participating hotels. Its loyalty program has grown from 80 million, when Ackman invested in 2018, to over 195 million today. The two create a network effect: As more hotels join the Hilton portfolio, it attracts more customers to the loyalty program, and vice versa.\n\nHilton has been growing quickly to support its expansion. Revenue per available room grew 3.5% in the second quarter, and management expects full-year growth between 2% and 3%. It also has a pipeline of 508,300 more rooms in development. As Hilton expands its management operations, it should see nice margin expansion as it increases revenue per room.\n\nWhile Ackman sold some Hilton shares to make room for smaller new positions in the second quarter, his firm still holds about 9 million shares worth $2.1 billion. That makes it his largest position. At its current price, it trades near the high end of its historical enterprise value-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) range, excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Investors may want to review Hilton more carefully before following Ackman's lead.\n\n2. Alphabet (18.2%)\n\nWhile many saw artificial intelligence (AI) as a major threat to Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) main Google search business, Ackman saw the opportunity for the company to take advantage of recent innovations in AI. He bought shares of the company in the first quarter of 2023, just as the AI boom was getting started. He has since added to his position and now holds 7.5 million C shares and nearly 4 million A shares. Combined, they're worth about $1.9 billion.\n\nGoogle's position as one of three big public cloud platforms has resulted in strong operating results for its Google Cloud business. It surpassed $10 billion in quarterly revenue in the second quarter, up from $7.3 billion at the end of 2022.\n\nAlphabet is spending heavily on AI to support the growth of Google Cloud and build new AI features in Google Search. The efforts have paid off as management says its new AI overview feature in search has increased engagement and satisfaction with search results. That said, the company has cut expenses in other areas, leading to an expanding operating margin.\n\nThe stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of around 20. Meanwhile, analysts expect AI and other trends to drive earnings growth at Alphabet above 20%, on average, for the next five years. That makes Alphabet a very attractive stock at its current price.\n\n3. Chipotle Mexican Grill (15.5%)\n\nAckman established an initial position in Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) in 2016 after food safety concerns led to a huge sell-off for the stock. He gobbled up 2.9 million shares by the end of that year. While he's sold about 80% of that position since then, Chipotle remains one of Pershing Square's largest holdings, worth about $1.6 billion.\n\nHe cited Chipotle's strong brand, differentiated product, and substantial scale as reasons for believing the company could recover from its food safety challenges of the previous year. He saw an opportunity for the chain to double its store count from approximately 2,200 at the end of 2016.\n\nToday, traffic has more than recovered, and Chipotle operates 3,530 restaurants. Management said it envisions opening 7,000 locations long term.\n\nChipotle is seeing strong performance from existing stores, even as it opens new locations at a strong pace. Same-store sales increased 11% in its most recent quarter, driven by both transaction volume and average ticket sizes. It's also building on its Chipotlanes drive-thru concept, which includes about 80% of new-store openings.\n\nThese can help drive higher same-store sales growth. Strong same-store sales have led to improved restaurant-level operating margins, which climbed to 28.9% in the second quarter, up 140 basis points year over year.\n\nChipotle recently lost its CEO Brian Niccol to Starbucks. As CEO since 2018, he was largely responsible for much of the recovery and success at the company since Ackman took a position in late 2016. However, Chipotle has an excellent playbook for success and a long runway for continued growth.\n\nThat said, the stock's valuation has grown to reflect the company's strong prospects. Shares currently trade at 44 times earnings estimates for next year. With that kind of premium, investors may be better off waiting for a pullback before placing their next order for Chipotle stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Hilton Worldwide right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Hilton Worldwide, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Hilton Worldwide wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Federal judge orders Google to open its Android app store to competition",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge on Monday ordered Google to tear down the digital walls shielding its Android app store from competition as punishment for maintaining an illegal monopoly that helped expand the company's internet empire.\n\nThe injunction issued by U.S. District Judge James Donato will require Google to make several changes that the Mountain View, California, company had been resisting. Those include a provision that will require its Play Store for Android apps to distribute rival third-party app stores so consumers can download them to their phones, if they so desire.\n\nThe judge’s order will also make the millions of Android apps in the Play Store library accessible to rivals, allowing them to offer up a competitive selection.\n\nDonato is giving Google until November to make the revisions dictated in his order. The company had insisted it would take 12 to 16 months to design the safeguards needed to reduce the chances of potentially malicious software making its way into rival Android app stores and infecting millions of Samsung phones and other mobile devices running on its free Android software.\n\nThe court-mandated overhaul is meant to prevent Google from walling off competition in the Android app market as part of an effort to protect a commission system that has been a boon for one of the world's most prosperous companies and helped elevate the market value of its corporate parent Alphabet Inc. to $2 trillion.\n\nGoogle said in a blog post that it will ask the court to pause the pending changes, and will appeal the court’s decision.\n\nDonato also ruled that, for a period of three years ending Nov. 1, 2027, Google won't be able to share revenue from its Play Store with anyone who distributes Android apps or is considering launching an Android app distribution platform or store. It also won't be allowed to pay developers, or share revenue, so that they will launch an app in the Google Play Store first or exclusively, and can't make deals with manufacturers to preinstall the Google Play store on any specific location on an Android device. It also won't be able to require apps to use its billing system or tell customers that they can download apps elsewhere and potentially for cheaper.\n\nThe Play Store has been earning billions of dollars annually for years, primarily through 15% to 30% commissions that Google has been imposing on digital transactions completed within Android apps. It's a similar fee structure to the one that Apple deploys in its iPhone app store — a structure that prompted video game maker Epic Games to file antitrust lawsuits four years ago in an effort to foster competition that could help drive down prices for both app makers and consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nA federal judge mostly sided with Apple in a September 2021 decision that was upheld by an appeals court. Still, a jury favored Epic Games after the completion of a four-week trial completed last year and delivered a verdict that tarred the Play Store as an illegal monopoly.\n\nThat prompted another round of hearings this year to help Donato determine what steps should be taken to restore fair competition. Google argued that Epic Games was seeking some extreme changes, saddling the company with costs that could run as high as $600 billion. Epic contended Google could level the playing field for as little as $1 million. It's unclear how much the changes ordered by Donato will cost Google.\n\nAlthough Epic lost its antitrust case against Apple, Donato's ruling could still have ripple effects on the iPhone app store as another federal judge weighs whether Apple is making it easy enough to promote different ways that consumers can pay for digital transactions. Apple was ordered to allow in-app links to alternative payment systems as part of U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' decision in that case, but Epic contends the provision is being undermined with the creation of another commission system that stifles consumer choice.\n\nThe forthcoming Play Store shakeup could be just the first unwelcome shock that antitrust law delivers to Google. In the biggest antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department in a quarter century, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in August declared Google's dominant search engine to be an illegal monopoly, too, and is now getting ready to start hearings on how to punish Google for that bad behavior. Google is appealing Mehta's ruling in the search engine case in hopes of warding off a penalty that could hurt its business even more than the changes being ordered in the Play Store.\n\n“Provided the ruling survives the appeals process, Google will almost certainly take a revenue hit,” said Emarketer analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. “No doubt some of the largest app developers like Epic Games will start encroaching on Google Play Store’s market share, meaning Google will lose out on its usual cut of subscription and in-app purchases.”\n\nThe analyst added that, while the Google Play Store will likely continue to benefit from brand recognition since it was the default Android app store for so long, “some consumers may defect if they can get better deals on their favorite apps elsewhere.” And app developers will likely take advantage of the opportunity to let consumers know about direct downloads.\n\n“So Google may see fewer Play Store revenues even among the Android users that stick to the default,” Mitchell-Wolf said.\n\nAlphabet's shares fell $4.08, or 2.4%, to close Monday at $162.98.\n\nView comments",

The ruling, which sent Alphabet’s shares down more than 2%, comes after the maker of the popular video game Fortnite convinced a jury that Google abused its power in the Android app market with its Google Play store policies.\n\nEpic had argued that Google Play rules and fees stifled competition and blocked app marketplaces launched by developers. The judge’s decision is likely to accelerate the weakening of app store controls held by tech giants Google and Apple Inc. that have been under fire from regulators and lawmakers around the world.\n\nUS District Judge James Donato issued an injunction that takes effect Nov. 1 which bars Google from paying developers to exclusively use its app store or prohibit them from telling customers about how to directly download apps for the next three years. Google also cannot force developers to use its billing features during that time.\n\nThe company must also let rival app stores have access to its catalog for the next three years in a bid to help them develop.\n\nDonato said that Google can take “reasonable measures” to ensure the security of its platform, and ordered the parties to recommend three people for a committee to review the technical aspects of those requirements. Developers who find that Google’s security measures are too stringent can challenge them, with the tech giant responsible for proving they are necessary.\n\nRepresentatives of Alphabet and Epic didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn August, Google lost an antitrust case in which the US Justice Department accused the the company of illegally monopolizing online search and advertising markets.\n\n--With assistance from Rachel Graf.\n\n(Updates with details from court order)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "content": "By Mike Scarcella\n\n(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday ordered Alphabet's Google to overhaul its mobile app business to give Android users more options to download apps and to pay for transactions within them, following a jury verdict last year for “Fortnite” maker Epic Games.\n\nThe injunction by U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco outlined the changes Google must undertake to open up its lucrative app store, Play, to greater competition, including making Android apps available from rival sources.\n\nDonato said at an earlier hearing that he would establish a three-person compliance and technical committee to implement and monitor the injunction.\n\nEpic’s lawsuit, filed in 2020, accused Google of monopolizing how consumers access apps on Android devices and how they pay for in-app transactions.\n\nThe Cary, North Carolina-based company persuaded a jury in December 2023 that Google unlawfully stifled competition through its controls over app distribution and payments, paving the way for Donato's injunction.\n\nGoogle had urged Donato to reject Epic’s proposed reforms, arguing they were costly, overly restrictive and could harm consumer privacy and security. The judge mostly dismissed those arguments during an August hearing.\n\n“You’re going to end up paying something to make the world right after having been found to be a monopolist,” he told Google's lawyers.\n\nIn a separate antitrust case in Washington, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta on Aug. 5 ruled for the U.S. Justice Department and said Google had illegally monopolized Web search, spending billions to become the internet’s default search engine.\n\nGoogle also began a trial in September in Virginia federal court in a Justice Department lawsuit over its dominance in the market for advertising technology.\n\nGoogle has denied the claims in all three cases.\n\n(Reporting by Mike Scarcella in Washington; Editing by David Bario and Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google DeepMind exec says AI has increased efficiency so much the company’s legal department uses it for 50% of info requests",
        "content": "Since AI burst onto the scene, employees have wrestled with the question of whether the technology would take their jobs or make them more efficient.\n\nEmployees in Google DeepMind’s legal department might have found an answer to AI’s existential query. Google DeepMind is now using its Gemini AI model to handle roughly 40% to 50% of information requests sent to its legal department, Google DeepMind director of strategic initiatives Terra Terwilliger said at Fortune’s COO Summit in Middleburg, Va., on Monday. Google DeepMind is an AI research lab and subsidiary of Google.\n\nThe legal department at Google DeepMind uses AI for “finding information that you know you have somewhere, but you can't put your hand on it right then,” Terwilliger said. While it’s “the basic use case of simply retrieving and finding that information,\" she said, \"it saves a remarkable amount of time.”\n\nGoogle isn’t the only company using AI for rote tasks involving paperwork. Bayer’s chief operating officer of its global pharmaceuticals division, Sebastian Guth, said the company regularly uses AI to fill out parts of the reams of regulatory filings it is required to compile as part of the research and development process for its medications. Guth estimated the company used AI to fill out between 70% and 80% of these dossiers required by regulators around the world.\n\nWhile the particulars of these two examples might be different, both Bayer and Google principally use AI to make their organizations run more smoothly. Guth termed these “workflow efficiencies” during his on-stage interview.\n\n“There is plenty of paperwork to be automated so that high-skill people can go do more high-value tasks,” Terwilliger added.\n\nImplementing AI into work flows\n\nGetting employees up to-speed on new AI use cases won’t happen overnight. That means companies will have to make an effort to train employees on how to best use AI, even in more straightforward instances. Terwilliger urged the audience of COOs to remember that training employees to use AI will require time and effort.\n\nCOOs should “make sure we’re valuing the time that people are putting in to learn how to use these systems and rewarding them for doing so,” she said.\n\nGuth had his own word of caution. “In large organizations, there's at times a risk to using technology for technology's sake,” he said. “In my mind, at the end of the day, it's a means to an end.”\n\nThe end goal for Bayer is to develop drugs and medicines faster than had previously been possible, he added. “It's not about chasing shiny toys just for the sake of chasing them,” Guth said.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, these early forays into AI won’t mean the technology will slowly replace scientists and researchers that work in the pharmaceutical industry, according to Guth.\n\n“I actually don't think that AI is going to steal jobs, because, hey, unpacking 3 billion years of evolution in a cell is pretty damn difficult,” he said. “It will continue to require human capacity and the art of science.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) the Top Pick in Leon Cooperman’s Stock Portfolio?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list titled Leon Cooperman Stock Portfolio: Top 12 Picks. In this article, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks among other stocks in Leon Cooperman’s portfolio.\n\nOmega Advisors, Inc., an investment firm based in New York, specializes in providing advisory and portfolio management services. The firm focuses on domestic public equity and employs hedging strategies to protect its investments. Leon Cooperman, the chairman and CEO, follows a value-oriented investment strategy that emphasizes value equities and utilizes a top-down approach to select sectors for investment. His methodology integrates fundamental analysis to manage both long and short positions, which helps in constructing diversified portfolios. These portfolios are assessed against the S&P 500 index to gauge their performance effectively.\n\nLeon G. Cooperman is a billionaire investor known for his significant contributions to the investment landscape. He is the first in his family to earn a college degree, graduating from Hunter College, where he was active in the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. After completing his education, Cooperman began his career as a quality control engineer at Xerox in 1965 and later earned an MBA from Columbia Business School in 1967. He is also a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), which reflects his deep knowledge of investment analysis and portfolio management.\n\nLeon Cooperman Warns of Rising National Debt\n\nIn a recent CNBC interview on September 25, Leon Cooperman expressed significant concerns about two main issues affecting the economy. He highlighted the national debt, which has surged from $20 trillion in 2017 to $34 trillion in 2024, growing at a rate that far outpaces the economy. He warns that this increase could lead to serious problems in the future, especially since candidates running for office are not addressing the deficit.\n\n“I’m very concerned about two things. One is the debt buildup. We have two candidates running for office, and neither one talks about the deficit or the buildup of debt. In 2017, I think our national debt was $20 trillion. Seven years later, it’s $34 trillion. That’s a growth rate far in excess of the growth rate of the economy, and it’s going to be a problem one day.”\n\nWhen asked if the Fed’s rate cuts have led him to invest more in stocks, Leon Cooperman replied that he is already fully invested, primarily in various assets. He has allocated about 20% of his portfolio to bonds and believes the government’s conduct is disappointing. Additionally, he has around 15% in energy investments, seeing potential in that sector due to current events in the Middle East. He noted that while the Fed is cutting short-term rates, he anticipates long-term rates will rise, particularly for ten-year bonds.\n\nStory continues\n\nCooperman was also asked about the Fed’s rate cuts and their impact on the economy. He responded that short-term rates are currently too high compared to historical standards. He explained that the yield on the ten-year government bond should align with GDP growth, which he estimates at around 5% (2.5% real growth plus 2.5% inflation). He believes that at a 5% yield, the ten-year bond is undervalued and anticipates rates will rise.\n\nLeon Cooperman Thinks “Stocks Are The Place To Be”\n\nLeon Cooperman expressed concerns about the potential future problems with government debt, suggesting that issues may arise unexpectedly. At 81 years old, he reflected on his experience during past market bubbles in 2000 and 1972, emphasizing his belief that stocks remain the best investment choice while avoiding bonds.\n\n“I may be too old. Take me out behind the barn and shoot me. I’m 81 years old. I’ve been through a couple of bubbles—the 2000 bubble and the 1972 bubble… I think stocks are the best place to be. I would avoid bonds.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article reviews the top 12 stock holdings of Omega Advisors as of the second quarter of 2024, highlighting the number of hedge funds also invested in these companies. The stocks are organized in ascending order based on Omega Advisors’ stake as of June 30, 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nTotal Number of Shares Owned: 650,000\n\nTotal Value of Shares Owned: $118,397,500\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 216\n\nIn FQ2 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported impressive revenue of $84.7 billion, which represents a 14% increase year-over-year, exceeding analyst expectations. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) net income also rose significantly to $23.6 billion, up from $18.3 billion the previous year, while earnings per share (EPS) of $1.89 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of surpassing revenue and earnings forecasts.\n\nA key driver of this success is the performance of Google Cloud, which surpassed $10 billion in revenue for the first time, highlighting the increasing demand for cloud services among enterprise clients. Meanwhile, Google Search continues to be a major revenue source, generating $48.5 billion. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s commitment to AI is another significant factor in its bullish case. CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s ongoing innovations across its AI offerings, positioning it well for future growth in this area, particularly within its cloud services and advertising platforms.\n\nAdditionally, YouTube’s advertising revenue reached $8.66 billion, underscoring its crucial role in Alphabet Inc.

Given its consistent financial success and strategic investments in AI and cloud technology, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) presents an attractive opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on growth in the tech sector.\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon, Texas Instruments and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Media and technology company Alphabet also continued delivering strong results in its search, YouTube advertising, YouTube subscription and cloud businesses. Shares rose amid an environment that continues favoring mega-cap technology companies.”\n\nOverall GGOGL ranks 6th on our list of top picks in Leon Cooperman’s stock portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s dominance in the $300 billion search advertising market is under pressure as emerging rivals like TikTok and AI startups mount challenges, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal on Monday.\n\nThe publication said that while Google has long been the unchallenged leader, new developments in artificial intelligence and social media search capabilities are beginning to erode its lead.\n\nTikTok, the fast-growing short-form video platform, recently introduced a feature allowing brands to target ads based on users' search queries, directly competing with Google's core search business.\n\nMeanwhile, Perplexity, an AI-powered search startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is set to introduce advertisements alongside its AI-generated answers. Perplexity, which already generates revenue from a $20-a-month subscription, could further shift the balance in the search advertising landscape, noted the WSJ.\n\nAccording to the WSJ, citing research firm eMarketer, Google's U.S. search ad market share is forecast to fall below 50% for the first time in more than a decade by 2024.\n\nThey note that competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has steadily increased its share, are also chipping away at Google's dominance. Amazon is expected to capture 22.3% of the market this year, up from 17.6% in 2022.\n\nDespite the challenges, Google continues to evolve its search platform, incorporating AI-generated summaries and ads into its mobile searches.\n\n\"We're confident in this approach to monetizing our AI-powered experiences,\" Brendon Kraham, Google's vice president overseeing search ads, told the WSJ.\n\nNevertheless, they note that advertisers are increasingly looking for alternatives.\n\nThe WSJ also quoted digital advertising executive Nii Ahene, who told them that \"for the first time in probably 15 years, we will have viable alternatives to Google.\"\r\n\r\nThe increasing competition, coupled with Google's ongoing legal battles, paints a complex picture for the future of the search giant's grip on the market.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoogle search share slipping on AI, TiKTok challenges - WSJ\n\nChevron to sell assets for $6.5 billion to Canadian Natural Resources\n\nUS Supreme Court denies Uber, Lyft bid to avoid California driver suits\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is about to find out what the Justice Department believes should be done to dismantle the tech giant’s dominance of the online search market.\n\nProsecutors are expected to submit a document as early as Tuesday in federal court outlining potential remedies after successfully arguing in a landmark trial that Google acted as an illegal monopoly.\n\nIt will be up to District of Columbia District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who sided with DOJ’s monopoly argument, to decide what should happen now in a separate \"remedies\" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025.\n\nPotential remedies range from an outright breakup of Google, to making its search engine data available to competitors, to ending agreements that secure its search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers. Judge Amit Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, will decide what remedies Google should face. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) (Mark Wilson via Getty Images)\n\n\"I think it's going to be more complicated coming up with injunctive relief than it was finding the liability,\" antitrust attorney Carl Hittinger said.\n\nGoogle has promised to appeal. And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google's behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.’s Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal.\n\nAnd even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored.\n\nA breakup\n\nCertainly, a breakup of Google’s empire — the most rare of antitrust remedies — has the most potential to reorder the tech universe.\n\nThat could include divestitures of its Android operating system, Chrome browser, or AdWords platform — all of which steer users into Google search.\n\nAny one of the three solutions would rip away a multibillion-dollar revenue stream from the tech giant, plus cut off data that fuels its broader search and advertising ecosystem.\n\nLegal experts disagree about whether this will actually happen. Hittinger said it’s unlikely because Judge Mehta must select a remedy that best serves the public interest.\n\n\"You can't just yank the rug out from under the American public that's been using Google's service, now ingrained in our culture, without a substitute,\" Hittinger said. \"Unless other competitors have a platform which is the same or better than Google, what's the public supposed to use in the meantime?\"\n\nA divestment of Android away from Google could have consequences for devices aside from those installed on devices used for internet search.

Airplane manufacturers use it to power video screens, and supermarkets use it to run their consumer kiosks.\n\nStory continues\n\nDevelopers also rely on Google to maintain Android’s ability to work across platforms.\n\nHittinger expects Judge Mehta to fashion a remedy similar to the one imposed against Xerox (XRX) in 1975 to end its dominance of the office copier market.\n\nThe company was no longer allowed to configure its copiers so that ink cartridge suppliers and other third-party components could not run on its machines.\n\nBut Bill Baer, former attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division, said he could foresee Judge Mehta requiring Google to divest Android or Chrome.\n\n\"The judge, in order to make this remedy meaningful, is going to have to do something that allows competition to flourish,\" Baer said.\n\n\"Because they're a monopolist, they charge the advertisers, who in turn charge us, a whole lot more than if the market were competitive.\"\n\nExclusive contracts\n\nOne likely scenario, antitrust lawyers said, is for the judge to put an end to agreements that secure Google’s search engine as a default on internet browsers and internet-connected devices that use Google’s Android operating system.\n\nGoogle pays as much as $26 billion per year to maintain its position on mobile devices like Apple (AAPL) and Samsung smartphones.\n\nProskauer antitrust lawyer Colin Kass said he suspects Judge Mehta to be particularly receptive to remedies that undo those contracts because their anti-competitive effects were at the heart of the ruling.\n\n\"This was a relatively narrow complaint and an even narrower ruling,\" Kass said.\n\nRepresentatives from Apple and other companies that benefit from the contracts testified that they chose Google for the quality of its search engine. Competing evidence from the DOJ showed Microsoft's Bing search engine attracted more users on its Edge browser when Google was not the default option.\n\nAn end to these revenue-sharing contracts would have considerable consequences for Google and Apple.\n\nThe contracts — which require Apple to install Google Search as the default across its Safari browser, Spotlight Search, and Siri — bring in an estimated $20 plus billion for Apple each year.\n\nTargeted search platforms like Yelp (YELP) and Amazon (AMZN) could also benefit from fewer search users being automatically directed to Google. CEO of Apple Tim Cook. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nTim McGinn, an antitrust litigation attorney with Gunster, said device manufacturers and browser services could choose Google as a default even if a court blocks Google from default placement agreements.\n\nPlus, he said, it's possible that the court could still allow Google to secure default placements for search but under new non-exclusive contracts that don’t raise antitrust concerns.\n\nIf Google can't get default placement any longer, it could also be required to give consumers a choice of search provider.\n\nMcGinn predicted the DOJ would ask that mobile devices, browsers, and wireless carriers give consumers a choice between search providers.\n\n\"It’s possible we’ll eventually see more phones and browsers pre-programmed to use another search engine,\" McGinn said.\n\nLast year, the European Union’s antitrust regulator, the European Commission, required Google to give a choice screen based on its determination that the lack of choice violated its antitrust law.\n\nSharing data with rivals\n\nThe DOJ could also ask the judge to force Google to share with rival browsers and search providers its “click and query” data that it uses to refine its search algorithms.\n\nSpecifically, the data includes Google’s intellectual property that tracks and learns from information that its search engine users type into its search field and links they choose by clicking on query results.\n\nRival US search providers include Microsoft (MSFT) Bing, Yahoo Search, and DuckDuckGo. International search providers include Russia’s Yandex and China’s Bidau.\n\nA spokesman for DuckDuckGo told Yahoo Finance before the trial that the company hoped the case would result in Google having to share its click and query data.\n\nThe data could help more privacy oriented browsers like DuckDuckGo and search engines compete against Google.\n\nThe spokesman said it can be more difficult for DuckDuckGo to attract advertisers because, unlike Google, it does not assemble user search profiles or search histories and then use that data to target users with advertisements.\n\nAnother remedy that some legal experts expect to be on the DOJ’s list is for Google to temporarily open up its internet index data to rival browser providers, such as Microsoft’s Edge, Apple’s Safari, Mozilla’s Firefox, Brave, and Opera.\n\nAI\n\nEven if Google were forced to divest search-related entities, or unravel contracts for default placement, these moves may not have a dramatic effect on the company, according to Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill.\n\nIts bigger threats, Thill said, are from new AI-assisted search engines and recent gains made by rival Meta in attracting advertisers.\n\n\"I don't think spinning off a browser or an Android operating system is going to have a dramatic impact on the company,\" Thill said.\n\nJudge Mehta, however, may have to consider how remedies to restore competition in the traditional search engine market may impact competition in the emerging market for AI-assisted search.\n\nOne concern, legal experts said, is that Google's search dominance could unfairly entrench its position in the market for next generation search.\n\nAt the same time, these fresh threats may work to Google’s advantage in the remedies trial, allowing it to argue that its overall search dominance is already under threat.\n\n\"If a violation is found, Google will say the market is already solving itself,\" said former US Federal Trade Commission Chairman and George Washington University antitrust law professor William Kovacic.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Apple stock downgraded by Jefferies, which says 'serious AI' smartphones are 2 years away",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) was snubbed by investment firm Jefferies (JEF) late Sunday. Jefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded Apple stock from Buy to Hold, citing concerns over inflated expectations for its new AI-enabled iPhones.\n\nLee said smartphone hardware is not yet advanced enough to accommodate the kind of high-tech artificial intelligence analysts and iPhone consumers are hoping for.\n\n“Near-term expectations for iPhone 16 and even 17 are too high,\" Lee wrote in a note to investors Sunday night.\n\nBig Tech companies have raced to innovate generative artificial intelligence technologies and secure their footing in an AI-dominated market. Up until this summer, Wall Street worried if Apple could catch up to rivals such as Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), which rushed to release new AI chatbots and chips, while Apple CEO Tim Cook remained elusive about the iPhone maker's AI plans. Now that Apple set into motion its AI vision with the upcoming release of Apple Intelligence, its next hurdle — like its competitors — is proving that it can monetize those artificial intelligence plans.\n\nApple stock ticked down 0.8% Monday morning on the news.\n\n“Unlike AI servers, smartphones lack high-speed memory and advanced packaging tech that allow fast data transfer between AP and memory, thus limiting their AI capabilities,” Lee said, adding, “To expect an accelerated smartphone replacement cycle now due to AI is premature, in our view.”\n\nLee said that it will take two to three more years for manufacturers like Apple to create smartphone hardware that's capable of running artificial intelligence software as smoothly as consumers expect.\n\nApple unveiled its suite of artificial intelligence tools, called Apple Intelligence, at its Worldwide Developer Conference in June. Apple’s long-awaited AI debut, in addition to its reveal of a partnership with OpenAI, boosted the stock to record highs. It more than alleviated investor concerns over Apple’s barrage of bad news earlier in the year — from struggling iPhone sales and layoffs to clashes with antitrust regulators at home and abroad. Bank of America (BAC) analyst Wamsi Mohan predicted a future in which Apple’s AI-enabled “intelliphones” dominate the market. The Apple iPhone 16 is on display at the Apple Fifth Avenue store in New York. (AP Photo/Pamela Smith) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut Apple’s initial launch of its iPhone 16, equipped with hardware to run its Apple Intelligence features that begin rolling out this month, has so far disappointed Wall Street. Analysts say demand for Apple’s latest smartphone is weaker than it was after past iPhone launches, citing shipping times as a metric. While both new and existing Apple customers are looking to buy the iPhone 16 for its faster connectivity, fewer cited Apple’s upcoming AI features as a motivating factor, according to JPMorgan's (JPM) most recent consumer survey.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo be sure, Lee said Apple is well positioned to lead the AI smartphone market in the future. Lee said Apple “is the only hardware-software integrated player that can leverage proprietary data to offer low-cost, personalized AI services.”\n\n“We believe AAPL is the leader in mobile AI tech, and its chip-OS-AI integrated ecosystem puts it far ahead of the fragmented Android competition.”\n\nSome 65% of Wall Street analysts covering Apple recommend buying the stock and see shares rising around 9% to nearly $245 over the next 12 months. Lee expects the stock to drop about 6% to $213.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Alphabet Inc. (GOOG): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +10.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 7.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.63 points to a change of +31.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $72.78 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $292.21 billion and $325.72 billion estimates indicate +13.9% and +11.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other the Bill Ackman's Stock Portfolio.\n\nBill Ackman is an investor whose portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from the economic environment’s improvement as interest rates trend down. In addition to being vocal about investment opportunities especially when there is a high risk reward, Ackman also does not shy away from giving his opinion on what he thinks is wrong. In September he took on the Brazilian Supreme Court justice on its decision to block Elon Musk’s social networking app. The billionaire investor reiterated that the decision could end up driving away investors and harming the country.\n\nThe “illegal shut down of X and account freeze at Starlink put Brazil on a rapid path to becoming an uninvestable market,” Ackman said in a post on X. “China committed similar acts leading to capital flight and a collapse in valuations. The same will happen to Brazil unless they quickly retreat from these illegal acts.”\n\nIt is not the first time that the legendary investor has echoed his opinion having already withheld a huge donation from Harvard University because of purported anti-Semitism. He also played a role in bringing down President Claudine Gay.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows and 7 Worst Beaten Down Stocks to Invest In.\n\nCan Geopolitical Tensions and Inflation Impact Ackman’s Portfolio?\n\nAckman stands out among the top echelons because he focuses on high-quality large-cap companies with limited downside potential. Over the past five years, the billionaire investor has generated a 31% annualized return, affirming why he is one of the most revered investors on Wall Street.\n\nThe fundamental value investor has made a name for himself in investing and pushing for strategic changes in companies in a bid to increase shareholder value. Ackman’s investment strategy focuses on holding a limited number of companies, mostly eight to 12, for the long term in his portfolio.\n\nAs one of the sharpest investors on Wall Street,  Bill Ackman’s stock portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from an improving investment environment. The US Federal Reserve cutting interest rate by 50 basis points is increasingly emerging as a key catalyst poised to push the overall market higher.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 was already up by more than 15% before the interest rate cut, it is currently flirting with record highs with more than 20% gains. The rally came on growing optimism that the lower interest rate environment would support the US economy, which was struggling, as depicted by weakness in the labor market and slow manufacturing.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile an accommodative interest rate environment is a must-welcome factor that could drive Ackman’s portfolio higher, a combination of regional conflict in the Middle East and rising inflation could curtail the gains. According to Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center, a completely blown conflict in the Middle East could trigger inflationary risks even as central banks start easing monetary policy.\n\nRoach expects the markets to whipsaw back and forth amid heightened volatility in response to the geopolitical tensions. Kelvin Tay, regional chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, has already warned that Israel’s response to Iran’s attack could throw the Fed’s 50 basis point rate cut off track.\n\nBill Ackman’s portfolio could feel the effects of escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East on the investment environment turning jittery.  The portfolio suffered one of its biggest losses in July as it erased most of its 2024 gains. The portfolio lost 4.7% in the month, fueled by losses in one of Ackman’s investments in a large record label.\n\nThe string of negative losses persisted, with Ackman struggling to generate interest in his plan for one of his investment firms in the market. After failing to garner enough investor interest, the planned launch of Pershing Square USA (PSUS) IPO, which Bill Ackman once claimed could raise $25 billion, was canceled.\n\nAckman confirmed the withdrawal, reiterating that they will revisit the IPO once they are ready to launch a revised transaction. The pullback comes on investors raising concerns about the proposed fund’s structure and where he knew cash would be invested given that the market is at an all-time high with valuations getting out of hand. With that, let’s dig deeper into Bill Ackman’s stock portfolio.\n\nSource: Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through Pershing Square’s Q2 2024 13F filings and picked the hedge fund’s top 8 stock picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of Pershing Square’s stake in them, as of June 30. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 216\n\nPershing Square’s Equity Stake: $1.38 Billion\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has to be Ackman’s biggest holding in the technology sector while offering exposure to the artificial intelligence frenzy. While many investors were worried about how AI would affect Alphabet’s core Google business, Ackman’s firm purchased more shares. His fund holds 7.55 million shares of the company, as of Q2 2024.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s core business is well-positioned to benefit from AI. Google Cloud’s revenue growth is already accelerating, reaching a $10 billion quarterly revenue run rate thanks to artificial intelligence.\n\nSeveral well-known AI companies use Google Cloud to train and implement their AI models and services. Conversely, chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT don’t seem to have impacted core Search ad revenue thus far. In the latest quarter, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s primary product saw a 14% increase in revenue. Nevertheless, it observed some weakness in the growth of YouTube ad revenue.\n\nIn the age of artificial intelligence (AI), Ackman has stated that he believes Alphabet has a competitive advantage due to the data it generates from search and related products. The gamble has paid off thus far, as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has outperformed the S&P 500. The company has also dismissed worries that chatbots like ChatGPT will eventually disrupt search.\n\nGoogle is reducing expenses across the board even as it keeps making significant investments in its data centers to increase its AI inference and training capacity. Because of this, the operating margin is rising swiftly and contributing to the bottom line’s growth. For the next five years, analysts currently project earnings per share growth of more than 20% annually from Alphabet.\n\nIn addition to the robust growth, Alphabet remains one of Ackman’s top holdings, yielding 0.48% on dividends while trading at a discount with a price-to-earnings multiple of 19. There were 216 hedge funds long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $35.31 billion.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We also added to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI. During the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI Superstars According to Goldman Sachs.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nUS technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk.\n\nWhile tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nThis has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave — particularly in software and cloud services.\n\nStory continues\n\nTheir scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants.\n\nLet's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds and hedge fund sentiment is an important indicator that we pay a lot of attention to at Insider Monkey.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. Waymo, the autonomous driving technology company led by Google, recently announced that it had entered into a deal with carmaker Hyundai to get the IONIQ 5 EV, developed by the latter, as part of the Waymo robotaxi fleet. In the first phase of the deal, the two companies will integrate the sixth-generation fully autonomous technology, named the Waymo Driver, into the IONIQ 5 SUV, which will be added to the Waymo One fleet. The report predicts that the initial on-road testing with Waymo-enabled IONIQ 5s will start before the end of next year. The Hyundai SUV will be manufactured in the US.\n\nLatest reports, published by news platform TechCrunch, indicate that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) intends to start showing ads in AI Overviews, the AI-generated summaries it presents for certain Search prompts, and will also add links to relevant web pages or some of those summaries. Per the reports, the company is also launching AI-organized search results pages in the US this week.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 6th on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) the Best Stock to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio. In this article, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks among the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio.\n\nRay Dalio was born in 1949 and graduated from Long Island University in 1971. After a brief stint as a clerk on the New York Stock Exchange, he attended Harvard Business School and earned his MBA in 1973. That same year, he became the Director of Commodities at Dominick & Dominick LLC and later traded futures at Shearson Hayden Stone for a year. Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates in 1973 in his apartment. In July 2011, he stepped down as CEO but continued to work as a co-CIO alongside Robert Prince and Greg Jensen, taking on the title of “Mentor.”\n\nBridgewater Associates is notable for its focus on transparency and accountability. The firm promotes a culture where team members take responsibility for mistakes and learn from them. It encourages questioning and alignment, ensuring everyone regularly evaluates the validity of their ideas. This approach is crucial to the firm’s management style and investment strategies.\n\nRay Dalio Warns of U.S. Decline\n\nRay Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, emphasized that since 1945, the United States has been the dominant global empire, but it is now in a state of relative decline. This decline isn’t just an opinion, it’s supported by concrete measures such as the nation’s share of global GDP, military strength, and the quality of its education system. These factors indicate that the U.S. is losing its position.\n\nIn addition to these, Dalio points out two other key elements that often disrupt world order: natural events like droughts, floods, and pandemics, which have historically caused more damage and upheaval than wars, and human creativity and technological innovation, which bring about substantial changes. Dalio believes all five factors are influencing the U.S. today. However, he stresses that the most critical issue is how people manage these challenges together.\n\nThe ability to address them intelligently and without creating further conflict is essential. If conflict arises, it could lead to a devastating outcome. But if people can come together and handle the situation effectively, the country can navigate these issues successfully. For Dalio, how society deals with one another is the number one factor in determining the future.\n\nChina Faces Economic Challenges and Urgent Need for Restructuring After Four Years of Change\n\nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Ray Dalio also highlighted significant issues in China that have emerged over the past four years. He explained that China is in need of a major restructuring, as a large portion of individual spending, around 70%, was invested in real estate. With the decline in real estate, stocks, and salaries, people have become more cautious, reducing their spending and holding onto cash. In a deflationary environment, cash has become a relatively safe asset. This situation is affecting both households and businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nDalio also pointed out that the government sector is facing serious challenges. Local governments, responsible for 83% of public spending, previously relied on land sales to generate revenue. With land sales drying up, these governments have accumulated significant debt, and now they’re struggling to pay it off. The key question is how to inject money into these local economies to keep them functioning. Dalio compared the situation to Japan’s struggles in 1990, noting that China’s challenges are even more severe and will require deep restructuring to resolve.\n\nIn addition to economic concerns, Dalio raised questions about property ownership and values. He referenced Deng Xiaoping’s famous statement, “It’s glorious to be rich,” and wondered if that sentiment still holds true in China today. The overall environment in the country is becoming more complex and difficult, as these economic and political issues intensify.\n\nDalio also emphasized the importance of being cautious when investing in China. He made it clear that every country goes through economic cycles, experiencing both highs and lows. According to Dalio, it’s crucial not to invest too heavily in any one country, including China, to avoid having it dominate your portfolio. Despite the challenges China faces, Dalio continues to invest there, but he stressed that the key consideration is the size and structure of the investment. Overall, his experience investing in China has been positive, though careful management is essential.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through Bridgewater Associates’ Q2 2024 13F portfolio and picked the top 10 stocks held by the fund.

The Google Cloud division also saw impressive growth, increasing by 27% to $8.9 billion, showing Alphabet Inc.

        "content": "OpenAI is considering transitioning from a nonprofit into a for-profit company, and its deep-pocketed benefactor, Microsoft (MSFT), has a lot to gain if the ChatGPT developer gets the green light to act more like a startup.\n\n\"Anything that frees up OpenAI to focus on profit is likely to benefit Microsoft's investment in the company,\" said Sarah Kreps, director of the Tech Policy Institute in the Brooks School of Public Policy at Cornell University.\n\nA reconfigured business structure would give Microsoft an opportunity to renegotiate its already generous profit cap, as well as discard a provision that denies Microsoft an interest in OpenAI-created general artificial intelligence (GAI), according to another observer.\n\n“[OpenAI] is clearly saying that the nonprofit will no longer be in control, so presumably that means Microsoft and other investors will have more say about what OpenAI does,\" said Rose Chan Loui, founding executive director of the University of California Los Angeles's Lowell Milken Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofits. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, right, speaks as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman looks on during the OpenAI DevDay event last November in San Francisco. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nBut there are potential snags for Microsoft as OpenAI attempts to shed its charitable cloak.\n\nOpenAI's huge valuation, labyrinth of for-profit subsidiaries, and potentially risky technology make a for-profit switch legally and publicly complicated — and could invite pushback from regulators.\n\nStill, OpenAI's investors see plenty of upside. On Wednesday, the company announced it raised some $6.6 billion in its latest funding round, valuing the Sam Altman-helped firm at $157 billion. However, that valuation is largely contingent on OpenAI becoming a for-profit entity.\n\nWhirlwind of change\n\nOpenAI is in the midst of a whirlwind of change.\n\nIt is experiencing an extended executive exodus including, most recently, the departure of chief technology officer Mira Murati. It also faces increased competition from rivals including Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon-backed (AMZN) Anthropic.\n\nThe reclassification to a for-profit structure would be yet another seismic shift for OpenAI, upending the way it was established nearly a decade ago.\n\nIt began in 2015 as a nonprofit under the name OpenAI Inc., a nod to its mission of advancing humanity instead of pursuing profits.\n\n“The corporation is not organized for the private gain of any person,” OpenAI’s certificate of incorporation stated in its organizing documents, along with a promise to keep its technology as open source for public benefit.\n\nThings evolved in 2019 when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and his team created a for-profit subsidiary to raise outside venture capital — including billions from Microsoft.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was structured in such a way that the for-profit subsidiary, technically owned by a holding company owned by OpenAI employees and investors, remained under the control of the nonprofit and its board of directors while giving its biggest backer (Microsoft) no board seats and no voting power.\n\nThe inherent tension between these two parts of the enterprise is what contributed to a dramatic boardroom clash in 2023, when Altman was ousted by the board and then brought back five days later.\n\nIn the aftermath, Microsoft took a non-voting observer position on OpenAI’s board, only to relinquish that seat this year as both OpenAI and Microsoft came under more regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThe idea of upending the current structure has already attracted interest from US and European regulators and exacerbated an ideological divide between scientific and business leaders who warn that machine learning technologies like those developed by OpenAI should remain accessible to the public.\n\nThe technology, they argue, poses an existential threat to humankind and, therefore, should be operated in a way that's subject to public scrutiny.

(Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Bill Clark via Getty Images)\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft are also part of an ongoing inquiry by the US Federal Trade Commission over concerns that AI market consolidation is “distorting innovation and undermining fair competition.”\n\nAnd multiple calls have been made for California’s attorney general to probe the legality of OpenAI’s business structure. One came from Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI with Altman. He sued OpenAI, Altman and 21 named OpenAI subsidiaries.\n\nMusk said the defendants fraudulently promised that his $100 million in OpenAI investments would be used for public benefit.\n\nA transition by OpenAI to for-profit status could also attract the attention of the Internal Revenue Service, given that OpenAI was granted tax-exempt status as a charitable organization.\n\n'Did they get fair market value?'\n\nOne unknown question is to what extent Microsoft will be able to directly extract profits from its investments.\n\nBy law, a nonprofit must use its assets only for its stated charitable purposes. And OpenAI's assets, which include all of OpenAI's subsidiaries, may not be sold for anything less than fair market value.\n\nThe question regulators will want to confirm is, \"Did they get fair market value for the asset at the time?\" said Gene Takagi, a principal at NEO Law Group.\n\nChan Loui added that regulators would require OpenAI to realistically value its assets, including residual interest. And she suspects that figure may be in excess of OpenAI's latest valuation.\n\n“I think the greatest sensitivity probably is with how they remove the nonprofit's control,” she said. \"And I think their best shot of avoiding conflict relating to restructuring is to compensate the nonprofit enough,” Chan Loui said.\n\n“I think that's the best way for them to get the public on their side, the states on their side, and the IRS on their side.\" Elon Musk looks on during the Milken Conference in May. REUTERS/David Swanson/File Photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nWhat OpenAI is expected to do as part of its transition is register as a public benefit corporation.\n\nSuch entities are like traditional corporations but with more freedom to spend on civically minded initiatives, according to Rick Alexander, a veteran corporate structuring lawyer and founder of the Shareholder Commons,\n\n\"It's a permission structure,\" Alexander said.\n\nOther public benefit corporations include Elon Musk's xAI, Warby Parker (WRBY), Allbirds (BIRD), Lemonade (LMND), and Etsy (ETSY).\n\nAnd based on the success of Musk's xAI, OpenAI could benefit handsomely from the change. In May, xAI raised $6 billion.\n\n\"This type of transition can generate considerable investor interest quickly,\" Kreps said. \"This is such a capital-intensive industry, so anything OpenAI can do to attract investment will act as a positive feedback loop and accelerate its advantages.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has long touted autonomous vehicles as the future of the company.\n\nAt his shareholder meeting in June, Musk said the technology alone would boost the company’s value by at least tenfold.\n\nBut with Musk set to unveil details on Oct. 10 about an autonomous taxi fleet he has teased for years, skeptics caution that robotaxis may be years away from becoming a profitable venture.\n\n“It might be a little difficult to get crazy excited,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan said about the potential stock reaction for Tesla. “This is far into the future, so we just don't know how big it’s going to impact [the business].”\n\nTesla’s entry into the market would put the company in direct competition with Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo, which has been operating its self-driving taxi fleet in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Phoenix, with an expansion scheduled in Austin.\n\nWhile the timeline for any autonomous taxi from Tesla remains uncertain, analysts point to Waymo’s business model as proof of challenging economics.\n\nUnlike Uber (Uber) and Lyft (LYFT), which utilize vehicles owned and operated by individual drivers, autonomous taxi firms must own their entire fleet. That means overseeing the cost of maintenance, car insurance, charging infrastructure, and cleaning.\n\nIt all amounts to an operational cost of $0.42 per mile per vehicle, according to a report by Lux Research. Chris Robinson, senior director of the energy team and author of the report, said that amounts to two to three times the cost of car ownership.\n\n“You need to drive down the cost of offering those services to be competitive with car ownership,” Robinson said. “That's why I don't think we'll see car ownership fundamentally displaced more so than services like Uber and taxi drivers that would be displaced by robotaxis.” Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego arrives in a Waymo self-driving vehicle on Dec. 16, 2022, at the Sky Harbor International Airport Sky Train facility in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Matt York, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nOperational costs are compounded by the process of automating the vehicles. Waymo’s current fleet is made up of Jaguar I-PACE electric vehicles that are equipped for human drivers but retrofitted with high-tech sensors and computers to achieve full autonomy.\n\nWhile parent company Alphabet doesn’t specifically break out revenue data for its self-driving service, its business unit that includes Waymo posted an operating loss of roughly $2 billion in the first half of the year. Robinson estimates that equipment costs alone surpass $40,000 per vehicle today.\n\nAmazon’s (AMZN) Zoox is attempting to change that calculation with a vehicle built in-house specifically for autonomous use. The company’s vehicles, shaped like toasters, have no steering wheel, no pedals, and no driver’s seat. The ride operates bidirectionally, which means it can drive both ways.\n\nStory continues Amazon's self-driving company Zoox is testing its autonomous vehicle near its headquarters in Foster City, Calif., on May 24, 2024.

Co-founder and chief technical officer Jesse Levinson said Zoox would not have survived and made it to market without backing from Amazon, which acquired the company in 2020.\n\n“Making a car is an expensive endeavor in general, but this is a new type of vehicle,” he said. “[You need to] build the autonomy stack, integrate it with this custom robotaxi, you need to collect many, many millions of miles of data. You need to do tons of simulation, you need to develop all kinds of firmware and AI algorithms and the glue to connect it all together. Then you have to validate it out in the field and prove that it's actually safer than a human. Doing all that takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of capital.”\n\nConsulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimated the global autonomous taxi market could generate as much as $1.3 trillion in revenue by 2030.

But the company has yet to prove that its self-driving technology can operate on its own, and Musk has yet to provide details on how any autonomous fleet would work.\n\nRegardless of a delayed timeline, Narayan said he expects Tesla’s autonomous fleet to contribute to the company’s revenue in a meaningful way. In his latest note, he said robotaxis and full self-driving subscriptions would account for half of Tesla’s valuation.\n\n“I’m a big believer in the robotaxi concept,” he said.

        "title": "Should You Forget Apple and Buy These 3 Tech Stocks Instead?",
        "content": "Right now, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the world's largest company by market cap. However, investors need to be aware of some problems under the hood.\n\nInstead of Apple, I think there are much better buys right now, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). These three provide significant long-term upside that should allow them to outperform Apple.\n\nWhat's going on with Apple?\n\nApple reached the top of the rankings of the world's largest companies with shockingly low revenue growth. Sales of iPhones haven't increased meaningfully since the pandemic began, and investors put a lot of hope into the iPhone 16 being the generation that turns it around, mainly because of its Apple Intelligence integration. But the latest reports say that its sales are below expectations, which could spell disaster for the stock.\n\nIt trades at 34 times trailing earnings and 31 times forward earnings. That's a premium investors would expect to pay for a company that's growing rapidly. AAPL PE Ratio Chart\n\nIn Apple's latest quarter, however, sales only grew by 4.9% and earnings per share (EPS) by 10.2%. Those aren't figures that support the stock's lofty valuation.\n\nThe immediate future looks slightly better, but not enough to justify today's price. In fiscal 2025, ending Sept. 30, 2025, Wall Street expects 8% higher revenue and 17% EPS growth. Compared to the following three options, Apple stock doesn't look attractive.\n\nThese tech stocks look to outperform Apple over the next few years\n\nInstead, I would urge you to consider Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms (and many other companies as well).\n\nLet's start with Nvidia. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering artificial intelligence (AI), and demand doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon.\n\nAlphabet is Google's parent company, and its market dominance among search engines allowed it to capitalize on advertising in one of the most lucrative areas on the internet.\n\nMeta Platforms is the parent of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram, and it also generates a lot of its money from ads on its platforms.\n\nAll three of these companies are far outperforming Apple in revenue and EPS growth. NVDA Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nDespite doing substantially better than Apple, two of them don't hold a premium in comparison to it, while Nvidia isn't that much more expensive. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAs an investor, I'm looking for companies with sustainable business models, faster growth, and lower stock valuations. Compared to Apple, both Meta and Alphabet achieve that, so buying those two instead makes a lot of sense.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia isn't cheaper now, but its prospects are far more lucrative. While its days of increasing revenue at a triple-digit pace are over, if it keeps up its current rate, it will still post impressive growth.\n\nIn its 2025 second quarter (ending July 28), Nvidia grew revenue 15% sequentially, and its third-quarter projections indicate sales will rise another 8.3% over the previous period. Apple can't muster this kind of increase year over year, yet Nvidia is doing it one quarter after another.\n\nIf the stock price doesn't move, this will rapidly drive down Nvidia's valuation. However, with AI being such a hot investment topic, the stock will continue to be strong and will likely maintain its premium over other tech stocks.\n\nAs a result, its stock performance will be closely tied to its revenue and EPS growth, which will easily allow it to outperform the iPhone maker.\n\nApple is a great company, but it isn't the juggernaut it used to be. Investors should start looking for other investment opportunities.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 30 AI News Investors Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) data centers are one of the hottest topics on Wall Street as companies across the industrial spectrum compete in a race to deploy AI technologies in their operations. The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers are the largest in the industry, typically developed by technology giants based in the US, and offer massive networking capacity and often consume as much power as a big city or even a small country.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAs technology stocks stage a comeback on the back of Fed rate cuts and AI optimism, the news coming from the commerce department in the US has buoyed investors further. The US government said earlier this week that it plans to award nearly $100 million to boost the use of artificial intelligence in developing new sustainable semiconductor materials. The funding is part of the more than $52 billion in US chip manufacturing and research grants promised by US President Joe Biden. The latest funding would go towards helping universities, national laboratories, and the private sector develop AI-powered autonomous experimentation for sustainable semiconductor manufacturing.

Latest reports, published by news platform Nikkei, claim that Google is considering buying electricity from nuclear power plants to power AI data centers. The report quotes Google CEO Sundar Pichai from an interview with Nikkei where he also stressed that his company would increase its investment in solar and thermal power. Per the CEO, for the first time in history, there was this one piece of underlying technology which cut across everything, in reference to generative AI, and the opportunity to do well in this field was something Google was leaning into.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "You don't have to take high risks to profit from the $184 billion artificial intelligence (AI) market. AI is bringing massive improvements to business productivity and more personalized services for consumers. Leading tech companies that you already know are among the ones that are best capitalizing on these trends. Here are two such stocks to buy today.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has more than doubled over the last five years and is currently up about 23% year to date in 2024. And the e-commerce leader still offers excellent return prospects over the next decade, particularly given its investments in AI.\n\nMost consumers will know Amazon first as a retail operation, but it's also the No. 1 enterprise cloud service provider, where Amazon Web Services (AWS) today controls more than 30% of a $297 billion market, according to Synergy Research. Revenue from AWS is accelerating -- it rose 19% year-over-year in Q2 -- as more enterprises are using AI services.\n\nFor example, Ferrari is using generative AI from AWS to help design cars faster and deliver personalized experiences to customers. Many other leading companies have chosen AWS for AI, especially to take advantage of Amazon Bedrock, which helps them build custom AI applications.\n\nAmazon has been using AI in its e-commerce business for years to deliver personalized recommendations to customers based on their interests. It's also using AI to drive content recommendations to viewers of Amazon Prime Video. However, Amazon is still in the early stages of implementing generative AI in the shopping experience. It recently launched Rufus, a conversational shopping assistant that can answer questions about products. Over the long term, it has the potential to significantly reduce shopping time and convert more sales.\n\nConsidering the attractive growth opportunities ahead for the tech titan, analysts expect Amazon's earnings to grow at a 22% annualized rate over the next several years. Assuming the stock is still trading at the same price-to-earnings multiple a decade from now, that would be enough growth for the stock to reach $1,350 by 2034. At a minimum, Amazon investors should expect the stock to outpace the average return of the stock market indexes.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is one of the most AI-focused companies in the world. It drives everything that is important to the company's growth, including its digital advertising business, search, content recommendations on YouTube, and Google Cloud. Its shares have nearly tripled over the last five years and are up about 17% so far this year.\n\nAlphabet has been heavily investing in AI since 2015, when it launched TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning system that made AI research more accessible for other organizations. But the company made a big splash with the launch of Gemini in December. More than 1.5 million developers are using Gemini, making it one of the most widely used AI models, and it's also powering Google's products.\n\nAdvertising generates about half of Alphabet's total revenue, and one of the biggest opportunities the company has with AI is to use the technology to drive more ad sales. Google is already seeing positive results from its rollout of its AI Overviews, a new feature that helps people get information about complex topics and is driving higher search frequency.\n\nAlphabet is also seeing growing demand for AI services in Google Cloud, where Gemini is helping developers build applications faster. Google Cloud offers a large selection of open-source and third-party AI models. Growing demand is boosting Google Cloud's profitability -- the segment's operating profit improved from $395 million in Q2 2023 to more than $1.1 billion in Q2 2024.\n\nAlphabet stock offers great value to investors right now. The shares are trading 15% off their recent high after the company in early August lost an antitrust case over anticompetitive behavior in the search market. It's uncertain what the consequences of litigation will be, but analysts still expect the company to grow its earnings at an annualized rate of 16% over the next several years. Assuming the stock keeps trading at the same price-to-earnings ratio it is now, with growth at that rate, shareholders could potentially double their investments by 2030.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Will Alphabet (GOOG) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nThis company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 14.50%.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Alphabet was expected to post earnings of $1.85 per share, but it reported $1.89 per share instead, representing a surprise of 2.16%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.49 per share, while it actually produced $1.89 per share, a surprise of 26.85%.\n\nFor Alphabet, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nAlphabet currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.13%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 20 Trending AI News And Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) startups have taken the finance world by storm in the past few months. This interest was sparked by the blockbuster launch of ChatGPT by California-based OpenAI in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has raised tens of billions of dollars in new funding and reached a valuation of over $150 billion. OpenAI revealed earlier this week that it had secured more than $6.6 billion in new funding through a financing round led by prominent names including Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures, and Tiger Global, among others.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPerhaps one reason the startup is so popular is that it is projecting more than $3.5 billion in revenue this year and over $11 billion in 2025. AI startups in general have been quicker at making revenues than previous technology booms, according to an analysis of payment information by fintech firm Stripe. The report underlines that top AI groups are reaching millions of dollars in sales within a year. This timeline is far faster in the life cycle of a startup than comparable non-AI tech groups. The report relies on annual revenue data for the 100 highest-grossing privately held AI companies using Stripe, compared with a comparable basket of prominent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) start-ups as of July 2018.\n\nThe report has gained a lot of traction since Stripe customers include OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, GitHub and Midjourney, among others. Stripe claims, per Financial Times, that AI start-ups took a median 11 months to hit $1 million in annual revenue after their first sales on Stripe, compared with 15 months for the previous generation of SaaS companies. AI start-ups that have scaled to more than $30 million in annual revenue achieved the milestone in 20 months — five times faster than past SaaS companies. Emily Sands, the head of information at Stripe, highlights that unlike past generations of software companies, AI companies paid compute costs straight out of the gate, and were under pressure to build monetisation faster.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

(NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. Latest reports, published by news publication Bloomberg, reveal that the tech giant is rapidly developing artificial intelligence models capable of mimicking human reasoning. Per Bloomberg, Google teams were building software capable of solving complex and multi step problems. The new technology utilized chain-of-thought prompting which caused the software to sort through various responses and choose the best one before responding to a prompt. The reports come weeks after OpenAI, an AI startup backed by Google rival Microsoft, introduced a new series of AI models designed for solving complex problems.\n\nWells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski recently lowered the price target on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock to $182 from $190 and kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares ahead of quarterly results. In a research note, the advisory underlined that as regulatory headlines abated, attention was returning to fundamentals, and Wells continued to lean cautious on search growth despite a better-than-expected first half of the year.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of the trending AI stocks now. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Is Emerging as an AI Winner",
        "content": "Oracle (ORCL) has been an under-the-radar high-flyer stock in 2024 and has just caught the attention of Wall Street. Shares are up 61% year-to-date, and the stock is still selling at a reasonable price. The company is emerging as an AI winner after it posted a beat and raise in the most recent quarter, driven by strong performance in its AI-related business.\n\nOracle is a well-run legacy business, known for its database software products that are popular among businesses worldwide. Companies use Oracle’s software products to organize and manage their data more efficiently. Think software for Enterprise Resource Planning, Customer Relationship Management, and Human Capital Management, among other types of software. Oracle does it all, and much more.\n\nI am bullish on Oracle because of strength in its AI-related business, its strong cash generation capabilities, and its current valuation even after the surge in its stock price.\n\nOracle’s Latest Quarterly Results Hint at Its AI Potential\n\nOracle’s recent beat and raise for FQ1 2025 is key to my bull case for the stock, as they clearly show how it’s gaining traction in the AI investment theme. The company earned $1.03 per share on revenue of $13.3 billion, up 6.86% year-over-year. While these are decent numbers, the most impressive aspect is the 21% year-over-year increase in its Cloud Services revenue, showing that hyperscalers are buying Oracle’s products.\n\nMoreover, Oracle logged a record-high Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) of $99 billion, up 53% year-over-year. This shows that business is booming for the software giant, and investors can look forward to this unearned revenue. As I mentioned, Oracle is gaining traction in the AI space, with the key highlight being its MultiCloud agreement with Amazon’s (AMZN) cloud business, AWS. This partnership joins others, like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), in leveraging Oracle’s database offerings in the cloud.\n\nTherefore, the growth in RPOs and Oracle securing a MultiCloud deal with another large cloud services provider was well-received by investors. The stock is breaking out on the news, and I see this uptrend lasting longer as the company continues to gain popularity among CSPs for cloud implementations of its database products. For Fiscal 2025, the company is aiming for double-digit revenue growth and accelerated growth in its cloud infrastructure business.\n\nOracle Is Good at Cash Generation\n\nAnother reason I’m bullish on Oracle is its cash generation capabilities. In FQ1 2025, the company’s operating cash flow was $7.42 billion, up from $6.97 billion a year ago. This is why I am not too worried about its balance sheet. As of August 31, 2024, Oracle has about $75.3 billion in long-term debt versus about $23 billion in current assets. While this shouldn’t go unnoticed by investors, it doesn’t bother me because of the cash generation and strength in RPOs.\n\nAdditionally, Oracle turns its profits into free cash flow. In the most recent quarter, its net income was $2.9 billion, and its free cash flow was $5.1 billion. Looking at the trailing twelve months (TTM), Oracle’s net income was $10.9 billion, while its TTM free cash flow was $11.2 billion. This gives it a TTM FCF-to-net income ratio greater than 1. Even as it continues to ramp up CapEx to meet demand for its products from hyperscalers, I see Oracle thriving, not struggling, as long as it continues to generate strong cash flow.\n\nOracle Stock Is Fairly Valued Despite the Run-Up\n\nAnother thing I like about Oracle is its current price, as I believe the stock is fairly valued. It’s not cheap, but it’s not expensive either. It’s trading at 26.5 times this year’s earnings estimates, and while that’s a slight premium to its sector, I see the company at the cusp of a multi-year growth cycle driven by AI. Analysts on Wall Street expect earnings to grow by 24% this year, and I would rather pay 26.5 times earnings for 24% growth than 23.6 times earnings for 15% growth (estimates for the S&P 500).\n\nIn addition, management expects the strength in RPOs to drive growth throughout Fiscal 2025. If this momentum continues (my bet), Oracle’s sales might grow well beyond this year. Who knows, we might even see an upward revision for growth estimates. While I can’t put an exact multiple or earnings growth rate estimate on Oracle for the long term, I believe the new AI opportunity looks promising enough to justify the current P/E multiple.\n\nMoreover, Oracle gave revenue guidance for Fiscal 2026 and Fiscal 2029 of $66 billion and $104 billion, respectively, driven by its improving cloud infrastructure business. At a market cap of $465 billion, Oracle is currently trading at 4.4 times management’s Fiscal 2029 revenue estimate. Again, I wouldn’t call it cheap, but I wouldn’t call it expensive either. What I will say is that this stock has the potential to go higher as its cloud infrastructure story plays out similarly to what management and investors are expecting.\n\nAnalysts’ Take on Oracle Stock\n\nOn the Street, Oracle stock sports a consensus Moderate Buy rating based on 17 Buy and 11 Hold recommendations. The average ORCL price target of $178.50 represents an upside of 6.4% from current levels.\n\nSee more ORCL analyst ratings\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nOracle is a well-run software business with improving fundamentals. The company’s cloud infrastructure business is going to propel it to new highs as more cloud services providers turn to it for cloud implementations of its database products. With its AI story just getting started, the stock’s current valuation does not suggest that it’s overpriced. Instead, it reflects a fair price for a company with improving fundamentals and a multi-year growth opportunity. I remain bullish on Oracle for the long term, but I would wait for a slight pullback before buying it.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy IBM Stock?",
        "content": "This isn't your great-grandfather's IBM(NYSE: IBM) anymore. It's still a great long-term investment, though.\n\nIBM's pioneering history\n\nThe former maker of punch-card calculators evolved into an industrial computing powerhouse, a personal computing innovator, and then an all-you-can-eat buffet of information technology products. And just when everyone else started to copy Big Blue's successful business model, the company took a sharp turn into cloud computing, consulting services, data security, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nIt was a tough business transformation, but it's starting to pay off for longtime investors. About ten painful years after the newfound focus on AI and cloud services, ChatGPT came along to launch a marketwide fascination with AI.\n\nMost investors didn't see IBM as a player in that explosive market at first, because it wasn't launching splashy consumer-facing AI apps or showing skyrocketing sales growth. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow IBM captures corporate clients in the AI boom\n\nIBM aims squarely for enterprise-class corporate customers. Other companies can chase consumers all they want, but this company always wants long-term contracts with deep-pocketed clients.\n\nThese deals take time, since the potential clients in this class often have to go through many layers of management approvals and technical testing. For that reason, it wasn't surprising to see other tech giants sprinting ahead of IBM in the AI boom's early days.\n\nBut the approvals have started to come in and IBM is recording robust sales in the AI market. The watsonx generative AI platform has only been around for one year but already has more than $2 billion of signed contracts.\n\nThe watsonx service includes the same large language model (LLM) technology as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Gemini, but it's paired with a large array of machine learning tools. The resulting AI system combines IBM's decades of market-leading machine learning research with the user-friendly flexibility of LLMs, and the whole bundle connects to the client's proprietary business data.\n\nWhile most AI experts wanted to bring something to market as soon as possible, IBM didn't launch watsonx until it had trackable data sources, ironclad security, and other business-friendly features. This is the solution for companies with valuable operating data and customer information.\n\nI expect that order book to swell in the coming quarters and years. IBM is the AI leader you forgot about, poised to make a mint as the AI market matures.\n\nStory continues\n\nBig Blue's future prospects\n\nThat's just one piece of IBM's technology puzzle. The company also provides enterprise-class data security tools. A wide range of consulting services sets Big Blue apart from other tech titans. It's even a front-runner in the emerging field of quantum computing with active quantum data centers in the U.S. and Germany.\n\nThe times, they are a-changing. IBM is always ready to roll with the punches and explore whatever the next big idea might be. Doubling down on AI years before the ChatGPT boom is one great example of this flexible attitude. IBM's quantum computing research is another.\n\nThe stock has gained a market-beating 56% over the last year, but it still trades at a modest 16 times free cash flow (FCF). By comparison, the average price/FCF ratio among S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stocks is a beefy 26x.\n\nSo you can buy into a proven innovator with leading roles in high-growth markets such as AI, cloud computing, and quantum computing -- all at a very low price. And whatever twists and turns might come in the road ahead, IBM will see them coming and probably already started planning for the next sea change.\n\nIn other words, you're not too late to invest in IBM at all. This stock should deliver solid returns in the long run, often leading the way into new eras and unheard-of technologies.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meta Unveils AI Video Generator, Taking On OpenAI and Google",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. debuted a new artificial intelligence tool that can generate or edit videos based on a simple text prompt, elevating competition with rivals like OpenAI and Google in the race to develop the world’s most advanced AI technology.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Corner Store Comeback NYC Schools Reverse Course on Cell-Phone Ban After Parents Balk Roofs of Mexico City’s Massive Food Market Will Power Public Buses Mexico City Restricts Airbnb Rentals to Curb ‘Gentrification’ A Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda’s Capital City\n\nMeta’s product, Movie Gen, can create a new video up to 16 seconds long based on a text prompt. It can also use such prompts to generate audio for or edit an existing video, or even use a photo to create a customized video featuring a real person.\n\nMovie Gen is only available for some internal employees and a handful of outside partners, including some filmmakers, though the social media company — which also owns Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger — plans to build the product into its existing apps sometime next year.\n\nExecutives are still discussing how best to implement this integration, but the aim is for Movie Gen to encourage more people to create or edit video posts, said Connor Hayes, a Meta vice president focused on generative AI products. It will be “fun to use, helpful for creators, good for overall engagement in the apps, but we don’t have a concrete product plan of what it will look like at this point,” he said.\n\nThe social networking leader is one of many major tech companies pushing into AI models focused on generating videos, which are more complicated and expensive to build than those that return AI-generated text. Microsoft Corp.-backed OpenAI has its own video generation tool, called Sora, that debuted earlier this year and can create videos up to a minute in length, though that technology isn’t available to the public yet. DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, also has a video generation tool, called Veo, which was unveiled earlier this year.\n\nMeta is waiting to roll out Movie Gen for several reasons, including the technology’s efficiency. It currently takes “tens of minutes” to generate a video based on a text prompt — too long for general consumers, who are likely to use this on their phone, Hayes said.\n\nBut Meta is also “sorting out a bunch of really important problems around safety and responsibility,” Hayes said, including how to handle personalized videos so that a user can’t create an inappropriate or unflattering video featuring another person without their consent. “That’s going to be probably the most important problem to solve before we would make the personalization capability available to folks broadly.”This type of technology has been used in the past to create misleading so-called deepfakes of famous people, including US President Joe Biden and pop star Taylor Swift, though Meta executives have said they’re working on ways to “watermark” these creations so that people can tell they’re AI-generated.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta has made AI advancements a key priority for the entire company, and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly talked about AI as a driver of user and revenue growth. In the short term, Zuckerberg has credited AI for helping improve the company’s content algorithms by showing people more relevant posts and advertisements. Eventually, Zuckerberg has said he believes AI will play an even larger role in powering its apps and other futuristic wearables Meta is producing, like smart glasses.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAdam Neumann’s Latest Project Is a WeWork Competitor How Bogg Bags, the Crocs of Totes, Won Over America’s Moms Rotting Rice in India Fuels Discontent About Modi’s Food Policy Elon Musk’s Role in Reanimating the Far-Right Term ‘Remigration’ The Great €3 Billion Shipping Container Heist\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Google said Friday it will stop linking to New Zealand news content and will reverse its support of local media outlets if the government passes a law forcing tech companies to pay for articles displayed on their platforms.\n\nThe vow to sever Google traffic to New Zealand news sites — made in a blog post by the search giant on Friday — echoes strategies the firm deployed as Australia and Canada prepared to enact similar laws in recent years.\n\nIt followed a surprise announcement by New Zealand’s government in July that lawmakers would advance a bill forcing tech platforms to strike deals for sharing revenue generated from news content with the media outlets producing it.\n\nThe government, led by center-right National, had opposed the law in 2023 when introduced by the previous administration.\n\nBut the loss of more than 200 newsroom jobs earlier this year — in a national media industry that totaled 1,600 reporters at the 2018 census and has likely shrunk since — prompted the current government to reconsider forcing tech companies to pay publishers for displaying content.\n\nThe law aims to stanch the flow offshore of advertising revenue derived from New Zealand news products.\n\nGoogle New Zealand Country Director Caroline Rainsford wrote Friday that the firm would change its involvement in the country’s media landscape if it passed.\n\n“Specifically, we’d be forced to stop linking to news content on Google Search, Google News, or Discover surfaces in New Zealand and discontinue our current commercial agreements and ecosystem support with New Zealand news publishers,” she wrote.\n\nGoogle’s licensing program in New Zealand contributed “millions of dollars per year to almost 50 local publications,” she added.\n\nThe News Publishers’ Association, a New Zealand sector group, said in a written statement Friday that Google’s pledge amounted to “threats” and reflected “the kind of pressure that it has been applying” to the government and news outlets, Public Affairs Director Andrew Holden said.\n\nThe government “should be able to make laws to strengthen democracy in this country without being subjected to this kind of corporate bullying,” he said.\n\nAustralia was the first country to attempt to force tech firms — including Google and Meta — to the bargaining table with news outlets through a law passed in 2021. At first, the tech giants imposed news blackouts for Australians on their platforms, but both eventually somewhat relented, striking deals reportedly worth 200 million Australian dollars ($137 million) a year, paid to Australian outlets for use of their content.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Belinda Barnet, a media expert at Swinburne University in Melbourne, said Meta has refused to renew its contracts with Australian news media while Google is renegotiating its initial agreements.\n\nAs Canada prepared to pass similar digital news bargaining laws in 2023, Google and Meta again vowed to cease their support for the country’s media. Last November, however, Google promised to contribute 100 million Canadian dollars ($74 million) — indexed to inflation — in financial support annually for news businesses across the country.\n\nColin Peacock, an analyst who hosts the Mediawatch program on RNZ, New Zealand’s public radio broadcaster, said Google “doesn’t want headlines around the world that say another country has pushed back” by enacting such a law.\n\nWhile Google pointed Friday to its support of local outlets, Peacock said one of its funding recipients – the publisher of a small newspaper – had told a parliamentary committee this year that the amount he received was “a pittance” and not enough to hire a single graduate reporter.\n\nMinister for Media and Communications Paul Goldsmith told The Associated Press in a written statement on Friday that he was still consulting on the next version of the bill.\n\n“My officials and I have met with Google on a number of occasions to discuss their concerns, and will continue to do so,” he said.\n\nGoldsmith said in July that he planned to pass the law by the end of the year.\n\n——\n\nAssociated Press writer Rod McGuirk contributed reporting from Melbourne, Australia.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Abhirup Roy\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet's Waymo will add electric vehicles from South Korea's Hyundai Motor to its robotaxi fleet, the companies said on Friday, as Waymo expands in the United States.\n\nOn-road testing for IONIQ 5 SUVs - assembled at Hyundai's Georgia facility and equipped with Waymo's autonomous technology - will begin by late 2025, they said.\n\nWaymo has about 700 vehicles in its fleet and is the only U.S. firm operating uncrewed robotaxis that collect fares.\n\nThe partnership with Hyundai comes days before Tesla CEO Elon Musk is set to unveil plans for a robotaxi product that is expected to use a custom-built vehicle. Musk may also discuss plans for his company to run a ride-hailing platform that will allow Tesla owners to list their vehicles when not in use.\n\nWaymo now uses I-PACE vehicles from Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India's Tata Motors. Waymo is also testing its technology using vehicles from Zeekr, the EV brand of China's Geely. A spokesperson for Waymo said the Hyundai partnership will not directly replace any of its current vehicle platforms.\n\nThis year, Waymo opened its service to everyone in San Francisco, without the need to join a waitlist, while expanding its operations in metro Phoenix. It also extended services to the San Francisco Peninsula and to certain parts of Los Angeles.\n\n\"The team at our new manufacturing facility is ready to allocate a significant number of vehicles for the Waymo One fleet as it continues to expand,\" Jose Munoz, global COO of Hyundai Motor said in a statement. \"We are actively exploring additional opportunities for collaboration.\"\n\nDespite widespread skepticism, tight regulatory scrutiny and federal investigations on AV technology, Alphabet said this year it was planning a multi-year $5 billion investment in Waymo.\n\nIn August, Waymo said it had doubled its paid rides to 100,000 per week in just over three months as it expanded its areas of service and allowed more people to ride its robotaxis.\n\nOthers in the race include General Motors' Cruise, which is testing cars with human safety drivers after an accident last year led it to pull all vehicles from the road, and Amazon's Zoox, which is expanding testing for its vehicles built without steering wheels and pedals.\n\n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Peter Henderson and Jacqueline Wong)",

        "title": "What's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy With the Fed Cutting Rates?",
        "content": "Interest rates are at long last coming down as the Federal Reserve announced a significant 0.5% rate cut in September. More reductions in the interest rate are likely on the way.\n\nLower rates are usually viewed as good news for smaller businesses. However, they benefit huge corporations, too, including the market-leading group known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. What's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy with the Fed cutting rates?\n\nHow rate cuts could benefit the Magnificent Seven\n\nLet's first look at how lower interest rates could help the members of the Magnificent Seven. Three ways are the most important, in my view.\n\nFirst (and most obvious), lower interest rates reduce Magnificent Seven companies' borrowing costs. This makes it cheaper to refinance maturing debt. They also enable companies to fund new projects that could lead to future growth.\n\nSecond, lower rates can boost customer spending. This can happen whether the customers are individual consumers or organizations.\n\nThird, lower interest rates can lead to a weakening of the U.S. dollar. This benefits Magnificent Seven companies that export to other countries by making their products more competitive in international markets.\n\nEvaluating the Magnificent Seven\n\nRate cuts should help all of the Magnificent Seven stocks. However, some will benefit more than others.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has the most debt on its books in the group -- $157.8 billion. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) trail behind with debt of $101.3 billion and $97.8 billion, respectively. Lower rates could help these companies the most when it comes to reducing interest expenses when their debt matures (assuming rates are still lower at that point).\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) are in the middle of the pack, with debt totaling nearly $38 billion and $28.7 billion, respectively. Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) debt load is only $12.5 billion, while Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) debt of $10 billion is the lowest of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nI suspect that increases in customer spending fueled by lower interest rates would likely be most pronounced for the companies with the most expensive products. Tesla's electric vehicles can cost in the ballpark of $40,000 at the lowest, with the pricey models costing over $113,000.\n\nCompanies spend significant amounts to buy Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), too. Lower rates could especially help start-ups and smaller businesses afford to expand their artificial intelligence (AI) development efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft operate cloud service platforms that could benefit from increased customer spending, driven by lower rates. All three companies market consumer products that could see sales increase, as well. It's the same story for Apple and, to a lesser extent, Meta.\n\nApple and Tesla would arguably be helped the most by a weaker U.S. dollar. Sales outside the U.S. are greater for both companies than their U.S. sales. However, all of the other Magnificent Seven also have significant international sales.\n\nThe best Magnificent Seven stock to buy with falling rates\n\nI think that Amazon and Tesla will probably be helped the most by the Fed's rate cuts. Which is the better stock to buy? I'd go with Amazon.\n\nTesla is much more expensive than Amazon based on forward earnings multiples and facing increasing competition. Even worse, consumer interest in electric vehicles seems to be waning.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon's AWS cloud platform has a massive AI tailwind at its back. Advertising on Prime Video has become an important new growth driver for the company. Amazon's technology investments should continue to pay off in increased profitability for its e-commerce business. Project Kuiper, a new satellite internet service, is poised to be another new source of growth.\n\nAll of these would be positives for Amazon without lower interest rates.

        "content": "By Lucy Craymer\n\nWELLINGTON (Reuters) - Google said on Friday it will stop linking to New Zealand news articles and ditch the agreements it has with local news organisations, if the country’s government goes ahead with a law to force tech giants to pay a fair price for content that appears on their feeds.\n\nThe New Zealand government in July confirmed it would progress legislation started by the previous Labour Party-led government that ensures fair revenue sharing between operators of digital platforms and news media entities. The proposed legislation is still in review and is likely to see changes including some to bring it more in line with Australian legislation.\n\nCaroline Rainsford, Google New Zealand Country Director said in a blog post that if the bill as it currently stands becomes law, Google would be forced to make significant changes to its products and investments.\n\n\"We’d be forced to stop linking to news content on Google Search, Google News or Discover surfaces in New Zealand and discontinue our current commercial agreements and ecosystem support with New Zealand news publishers,\" Rainsford said.\n\nGoogle, which is owned by Alphabet Inc , is concerned that bill is contrary to the idea of the internet being open, that it will be harmful to small publishers and that the uncapped financial exposure provides business uncertainty.\n\nNew Zealand Minister for Media and Communications Paul Goldsmith said he was considering the range of views in the sector.\n\n“We are still in the consultation phase and will make announcements in due course,” he said in a statement. “My officials and I have met with Google on a number of occasions to discuss their concerns, and will continue to do so.”\n\nAlthough minority government coalition partner ACT does not support the legislation, it is likely to find enough cross party support to pass once finalised.\n\nAustralia introduced a law in 2021 that gave the government power to make internet companies negotiate content supply deals with media outlets. A review released by the Australian government in 2022 found it largely worked.\n\n(Reporting by Lucy Craymer; editing by Lincoln Feast.)\n\nView comments",

CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized that maintaining productivity while working remotely is key to continuing the current flexible work arrangement, reported Business Insider.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement.

Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\nAmazon’s recent decision to require employees to return to the office five days a week has sparked concern among its workforce and competitors. Google employees, who currently work in the office three days a week, sought reassurance about their hybrid work model during a “TGIF” all-hands meeting.\n\nJohn Casey, Google’s vice president of global compensation and benefits, informed staff that the existing system remains effective, according to the report. However, he stressed the importance of being in the office at least three days weekly. Pichai reiterated the need for productivity during remote work to maintain policy flexibility.\n\nDespite these reassurances, some Google employees remain apprehensive about potential future changes. Google has implemented measures like hot-desking and “neighborhoods” in some offices to adapt to the hybrid model. Meanwhile, other companies, like Dell Technologies Inc., have followed Amazon’s lead, requiring more in-office presence.\n\nA Google spokesperson confirmed the statements made by Pichai and Casey, according to the report.\n\nTrending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nWhy It Matters: Amazon’s decision to enforce a full-time return to the office has led to significant unrest among its employees. A survey revealed that 73% of Amazon workers are considering leaving their jobs due to the new policy, with 80% aware of colleagues contemplating the same move. This shift has affected morale, especially among parents.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the return-to-office mandates have impacted housing markets, with cities like San Jose experiencing a surge in housing prices. This trend is attributed to the increased demand for housing near office locations.\n\nAdditionally, some companies have used RTO mandates as a strategy to encourage voluntary turnover, as revealed in a survey by Bamboo HR. This tactic has been part of the broader “Great Resignation” phenomenon, where employees have opted to leave rather than return to traditional office settings.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

        "title": "Big AI thins out the competition as startups quit the race to build large language models",
        "content": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI! In this edition…Big tech increasingly squeezes startups out of the generative AI market; an AI-discovered cancer drug begins clinical trials; another OpenAI cofounder joins Anthropic; and spend on LLMs booms (though still only represents a fraction of the AI model market).\n\nThe market for large language models lost another contender yesterday, while at the same time, its leader—OpenAI—closed a massive $6.6 billion funding round that represents the largest VC raise in history and will give it practically unrivaled resources to compete.\n\nAI startup Character.AI said it’s abandoning its efforts to build LLMs because it’s gotten “insanely expensive” to compete with the big guys, mainly Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Dominic Perella, the company’s new interim chief executive, told the Financial Times that training frontier models has become “difficult to finance on even a very large start-up budget.”\n\nThe market for generative AI models is barely two years old, and yet big tech has already eliminated much of the competition.\n\nA new kind of acquisition thins out the model market\n\nCharacter.AI secured $150 million in funding at a $1 billion valuation last year, but the respectable funding is only a dent in what’s needed to build expensive and resource-intensive models—let alone compete with companies like Google and OpenAI. This isn’t the only reason Character.AI is where it is today, however. The company is the latest AI startup to be kinda-sorta acquired by Big Tech.\n\nIn August, Character.AI and Google struck a deal in which cofounders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas rejoined Google (where they worked until 2021), as well as around 30 of the startup’s researchers. Character.AI still stands but said it will use external models and focus on developing its consumer chatbots that simulate conversations with celebrities and characters.\n\nThe structure of the deal mirrors the ones Microsoft made with Inflection and Amazon struck with both Adept and Covariant earlier this year. Critics have blasted these types of deals as a way for Big Tech to skirt antitrust scrutiny that could block a full acquisition deal. While Covariant will continue developing models for various customers, it’s still linked up with a tech giant in a big way. In other cases, like with Adept, what’s left of the startup is also ceasing to develop models (its deal with Amazon is now under FTC scrutiny). Overall, the result is a much thinner competitive market for model development and boosts for the largest players in the game.\n\nStory continues\n\nWho can make a model?\n\nAt the same time Character.AI became the latest startup to throw in the towel on making AI models, OpenAI announced it had secured unprecedented funds while Nvidia released a new massive open-source model it says rivals OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Nvidia, of course, is among the few other big tech players with the resources to truly compete—thanks to the piles of money it makes selling the chips used for AI models. The timing of it all underscores who can compete in the LLM market and who barely stands a chance.\n\nAs if OpenAI scoring the largest funding round in history (with an eye-popping $157 billion valuation) isn’t enough, the company is going a step further to make it more difficult for its competitors to raise funds. According to the Financial Times, CEO Sam Altman asked investors to not back rivals like Anthropic or Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nIn January, I published an issue of Eye on AI that asked “Where did all the models go?” It discussed how enterprises aren’t making their own AI models anymore because it’s so resource-intensive to do so, and because plugging into a model developer’s API is so much easier. For customers, it’s a reasonable and strategic approach. But when it doesn’t even make sense for the startups that just recently poured millions of dollars and expert hours into developing models to continue doing so, well that says a whole lot about the state of competition in this market.\n\nNow, here’s more AI news.\n\nSage Lazzarosage.lazzaro@consultant.fortune.com\r\nsagelazzaro.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is bringing some big AI updates to its main Search platform and Google Lens visual search software. On Thursday the company announced it will start rolling out AI organized search results pages for users in the U.S. The tech giant also says it’s bringing the ability to search for information about live videos you shoot to its Lens app. Google says Lens is one of its fastest growing types of search and is especially popular with users between 18 and 24.\n\nImportantly for both investors and advertisers, Google also said it’s adding ads to its AI-powered AI Overview in Search, as well as an updated look for AI Overview that the company says will improve traffic to linked websites.\n\nThe updates are part of Google’s broader effort to further monetize its vast investments in generative AI technologies.\n\nGoogle says its AI organized search results will be available to users with queries related to open-ended answers or responses without one true correct response. That, at first, will begin with recipes and meal inspiration in mobile search.\n\nGoogle says the feature provides more “content and perspectives from across the web” and that in testing users found AI-generated search results to be more helpful in general. Google will begin organizing some search results using its AI technologies. (Image: Google) (Google)\n\nGoogle’s Lens update is similarly interesting, with Google saying you’ll be able to open the app, hold down the shutter button, and ask questions using voice about moving objects you see in front of you. In one example Google says you’ll be able to point your phone’s camera at a school of fish and ask why they’re all swimming in a circle.\n\nThe company previewed the technology at its I/O developer conference in May, showing how you’d be able to point your phone’s camera at a record player and ask it why its arm keeps moving off of the record. In the pre-recorded demo, Lens pulled up an AI Overview response explaining what might be wrong with the player and standard search results identifying its model number.\n\nThe feature is only available for Search Lab users via the Google app and only supports English questions for now. But if it proves reliable when it’s released to a wider user base, it’s easy to see how Lens with video could be useful for users who want to ask simple questions about things like home repairs and more.\n\nLens is also getting some updates for its shopping feature including access to Google’s Shopping Graph, which the company says will provide users with prices of items you take photos of using the app, reviews of those products, and where you can buy them.\n\nVisual search is one of the next major AI battlegrounds for tech companies. Google’s Lens app has been around for years. The company debuted its Circle to Search function, which lets you snap a picture and circle an item or object you want to learn more about, earlier this year.\n\nStory continues Google is bringing ads to its AI Overview feature. (Image: Google) (Google)\n\nApple (AAPL) is also looking to get in on the visual search game later this year with its visual intelligence feature for iPhones with the new Camera Control button. Like Google Lens and Circle to Search, visual intelligence will identify objects and places you view using your phone’s camera, though Apple doesn’t mention if it will work with video.\n\nIn addition to updates to Search and Lens, Google says it’s officially bringing ads to U.S. AI Overview users. The company says it’s seen positive feedback in testing ads in AI Overview and that they’ve helped users quickly connect with businesses related to their search queries.\n\nThat’s sure to keep investors and advertisers happy, as both groups were initially hesitant about how AI Overview might impact how Google displays its ads in search results. Advertising is still Google’s biggest business, despite gains in its cloud computing segment, and is likely to continue to dominate as its biggest revenue stream for the foreseeable future.\n\nGetting ads right in AI Overview is of the utmost importance for Google, as it continues to expand its generative AI technologies across its various platforms. Search is still Google’s most popular business, but adding gen. AI to apps like YouTube will also need careful consideration so as not to annoy users or advertisers.

        "content": "Google has announced a number of artificial intelligence-powered updates to its search engine, calling them “some of our most significant Search updates to date”.\n\nFrom Thursday in the UK, users of the Google app on both Android and iOS will be able to use their voice to ask a question as they point their phone camera at an object or subject.\n\nThe technology giant has also confirmed that it would begin rolling out a similar tool to ask questions while recording a video to early testers on its Search Labs programme, saying its AI tools would be able to “make sense of the video and your question put together” before producing an AI Overview, the firm’s AI-generated query responses, as well as helpful resources from the web.\n\nThe updates continue the ongoing arms race between the world’s biggest tech firms to introduce new and compelling generative AI-powered tools to keep existing users engaged, as well as to draw in new ones.\n\nOn Wednesday, OpenAI, the firm behind generative AI chatbot ChatGPT confirmed its latest funding round had raised 6.6 billion US dollars (£4.97 billion) – the largest ever – and valuing the company at more than 150 billion dollars (£112 billion), a sign that the frenzy around AI remains.\n\nIn its update, Google also said it would begin rolling out new, AI-organised search results pages, starting in the United States, and beginning with recipes and meal inspiration-related searches on mobile.\n\nGoogle said: “You’ll now see a full-page experience, with relevant results organised just for you. You can easily explore content and perspectives from across the web including articles, videos, forums and more — all in one place.”\n\nElsewhere, the company said it would start, from Thursday, adding prominent links to supporting webpages directly within the text of AI Overviews, which have started to appear at the top of Google search results in recent weeks.\n\nGoogle said that in testing, it had seen this “improved experience” had “driven an increase in traffic to supporting websites compared to the previous design”.\n\nSome critics had previously suggested that placing AI Overviews above listed search results could have an impact on publishers and advertisers, who could see clicks through to their webpages drop if they were moved further down the page.\n\nGoogle said it had found that the addition of links within Overviews meant “people are finding it easier to visit sites that interest them”.\n\nIn a further move to help businesses who use Google Search, the tech giant also confirmed that it was introducing ads within AI Overviews, starting in the US on mobile.",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Ken Fisher’s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024. Since Alphabet Inc  (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Ken Fisher regularly shares his investing wisdom on his YouTube channel, sharing market insights and lessons he’s learned over the decades. Commenting about the Fed’s rate cut, Fisher recently advised investors not to focus on what the central bank is doing and instead pay attention to long-term investing.\n\n“The fact is, and I’ve said this for a long time, I won’t live forever, but I hope to live a long time and keep saying it: central bankers are crazy. Throughout my life, central banks have operated on flawed ideas and groupthink, which is an inefficient way to manage markets.”\n\nFisher gave an example of how you could end up losing money following the herd mentality when it comes to central bank moves.\n\n“If you had followed the common belief that when the Fed and other central banks hike rates, you should get out of stocks, that would have worked for a couple of months in 2022. By the middle of the summer of 2022, during the height of rate hikes, you would have been on the wrong side of the market. From June 2022 onward, as the Fed hiked rates by 75 basis points nearly every month, the market was just a few months away from rising, leading to the bull market we’re in now, in 2024.\n\nThe basic belief that central bank hikes are bad for stocks was wrong from the start because it was already priced in. As soon as central bank hikes were visible, the market had already accounted for them. We saw a bull market begin in October 2022, which has continued despite repeated rate hikes.”\n\nFor this article, we scanned Ken Fisher’s hedge fund’s Q2 holdings and picked its top AI investments. We have analyzed the AI-related growth catalysts for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Defies Search Concerns with Strong Q2 Growth\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nBillionaire Ken Fisher’s Stake: $8,856,226,893\n\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels.  With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market. According to StatCounter report, Bing search engine’s market share only increased from 3.03% in August 2023 to 3.91% in August 2024. This shows MSFT has not been able to make any notable dent in Google’s market share.\n\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet’s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts’ forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)  is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\n\nPershing Square Holdings stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, delivered stellar business results in the first half of 2024. Revenues grew 14% powered by Google’s dominant position in the fast-growing digital advertising market as well as certain company-specific tailwinds including the increasing adoption of AI automation tools by advertisers and YouTube’s continued success in the Connected TV Medium. Strong revenue growth coupled with cost control initiatives and stable staffing levels (headcount has remained flat year-to-date), resulted in strong operating leverage. Operating profit margins expanded approximately 340 basis points, excluding one-time severance and real estate charges. In the second quarter, the company’s Cloud segment outpaced its major competitors with 29% revenue growth and achieved 11% profit margins, after first reaching profitability just 18 months ago.\n\nAmidst solid financial performance, Google is achieving notable milestones in its AI product development roadmap. At its annual developer conference in early May, the company unveiled the broad rollout of “AI Overviews”, which are AI-powered summary responses for certain types of queries. Early results from AI Overviews highlight how thoughtful integration of AI into Search not only improves the user experience, leading to more frequent and detailed queries, but also creates opportunities for greater ad monetization through context-rich responses and higher conversion rates…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Ken Fisher’s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Continues Adding to Her Portfolio. Here Are 6 Stocks She Just Bought.",
        "content": "With the dog days of summer behind us, temperatures are starting to dip as we approach sweater weather. But something that has refused to cool down is the stock-buying activity of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican from Georgia.\n\nComplementing a variety of stock buys from earlier in September, Greene continued to build out her portfolio, reporting in a recent regulatory filing that she bought Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG), (NASDAQ: GOOGL), BerkshireHathaway(NYSE: BRK.A), (NYSE: BRK.B), Intel(NASDAQ: INTC), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), SouthernCopper(NYSE: SCCO), and UnitedParcelService(NYSE: UPS). The exact amount that Greene invested in each of the stocks was not disclosed; however, her regulatory filing acknowledges that each transaction was valued between $1,001 and $15,000.\n\nWheels keep on turning with AI investments\n\nLike so many investors, Greene exhibited considerable enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past few months. Alphabet, for example, consistently appears on Greene's buy list. The most recent purchase of Alphabet stock on Sept. 20 is the third such purchase since she first picked up shares of Google's parent company on Aug. 21.\n\nSimilarly, Greene recently added to her Intel position (one that she initiated in August) with a Sept. 20 purchase of the semiconductor stock. So far, the investment has proven to be profitable as Intel stock rose nearly 10% since her most recent purchase. Rounding out Greene's AI investments is Microsoft. After picking up shares in April, Greene bought Microsoft stock again in late September. In addition to AI exposure, the Microsoft investment will provide an increase in passive income as the company announced a 10% increase to its dividend on Sept. 16.\n\nMore familiar names find their way into the portfolio\n\nIt wasn't only AI-related positions that Greene decided to add to on Sept. 20. For one, the Peach State representative chose to pick up more shares of Berkshire Hathaway, a stock that she had previously bought in April. A stellar long-term investment, Berkshire Hathaway helps Greene to offset some of the volatility that she may experience with the tech stocks that she purchased. Over the past 30 years, for example, the S&P 500 rose 789%, while Berkshire Hathaway soared about 1,870%.\n\nUPS is another stock in which Greene has steadily grown a position. Greene first bought UPS stock in July 2024 and twice in September 2024. In addition to gaining increasing exposure to a leading supply chain stock, Greene is generating a more robust passive income stream as UPS stock currently has a 4.9% forward-yielding dividend.\n\nStory continues\n\nA new face in the crowd\n\nGreene doesn't often buy materials stocks, so the fact that Southern Copper popped up on her list of recent buys was a little surprising. Well, maybe not so surprising. The company is a premier investment opportunity for exposure to -- you guessed it -- copper. And copper is in high demand as the AI boon continues since the metal is critical to the data centers where AI computing occurs. According to metal-producing powerhouse BHP Group, for example, annual global copper demand will rise to 52.5 million tons by 2050, a notable increase over 30.4 million tons in 2021.\n\nWith Greene espousing such strong enthusiasm for AI through her other investments, her interest in buying Southern Copper stock is clearly not that unexpected.\n\nShould you follow Greene's lead and make the same buys?\n\nLike monitoring the stock picks of billionaires and industry insiders, keeping eyes on politicians' stock choices is an excellent tactic. Yet experienced investors would advise you that simply copying their stock moves -- or any individual's stock trades for that matter -- is foolhardy and not a recommended investing strategy.\n\nIn the case of Greene's recent purchases, though, investors motivated to gain AI exposure would be smart to consider Alphabet, Intel, and Microsoft -- all three of which are industry leaders. And Southern Copper is also a worthwhile consideration for a different approach to the burgeoning AI industry.\n\nSimilarly, it's hard to argue against following Greene into a Berkshire Hathaway investment considering Buffett's reputation as one of the most successful investors of all time. With regards to UPS, the threat of a longshoreman strike may pressure the stock and lead to some volatility in the near term. For those with longer time horizons, this may present a good opportunity to scoop up a quality stock at a discount.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nGlobal management consulting firm Bain & Company recently released a report on the artificial intelligence industry, highlighting that AI was driving an unprecedented wave of technological change, with the market for AI products and services projected to reach between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Per the research done by Bain, major cloud services providers were at the forefront of AI research and development, pushing the boundaries of larger models, advanced infrastructure, and energy efficiency. These hyperscalers were focusing on the development of larger, more complex models that demanded significant computational power and resources, leading to the need for data centers with energy capacities up to gigawatts, potentially straining energy grids and supply chains.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockand AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nBain underlined that while the big players dominated the high end of the market with expansive models and enormous data centers, innovation was also thriving in smaller models. These smaller, domain-specific models were being deployed at the edge, where they were more cost-effective, energy-efficient, and capable of addressing real-time processing needs, particularly in applications like autonomous driving. The proliferation of models like Llama, Claude, and Gemini illustrated how AI was evolving rapidly beyond just a few proprietary models, with many options now open-source or specialized for particular tasks.\n\nThe research further detailed that the rapid growth in AI workloads, particularly with data-heavy applications, was also reshaping the technology landscape. The need for increased storage, computing power, and memory was driving innovations in data center design, networking, and storage technologies. Per Bain, chip companies and particularly GPU makers were expanding beyond their core graphics processing units to include integrated solutions that improved the efficiency of AI models, with their products now combining compute, memory, and networking capabilities. The competition was also spurring the development of vertically integrated AI solutions, where tech companies designed everything from hardware to software to optimize AI performance.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

JMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone has an Outperform rating on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock with a price target of $200. The analyst closely followed the developments at the Gemini at Work event hosted by Google recently, highlighting for investors a 35x increase in Gemini usage as 75% of daily Gemini for Workspace users said AI improved the quality of work. The analyst further underlined that AI adoption was beginning to inflect across Enterprise, with Google offering 185 real-world examples on how enterprises were integrating AI.\n\nIn a notable development, Reuters recently reported that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is planning to construct a large data center in Vietnam. Data centers are critical to the ongoing AI revolution in the tech industry. To date, no hyper-scaler has announced plans to build a data center outside the US. According to Reuters, internal discussions are underway, and the facility could be operational by 2027.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have been looking for smart ways to play the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has swept the global financial markets over the past two years. Most of the attention in this regard has been confined to obvious choices in semiconductors, software, and biotechnology. Even within these sectors, prominent companies and their AI initiatives have dominated headlines. However, there are several hidden gems within these sectors that offer the same bang for the buck, given present macro context, but are not in limelight as such. For example, Bernie Ahkong, an analyst at UBS, recently noted that the first phase of AI was interest towards chipmakers. In the second phase, investors moved towards the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centers. The present tilt towards utility and power firms is quite possibly the third phase of this AI focus.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nA recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "title": "Google's search engine's latest AI injection will answer voiced questions about images",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google is injecting its search engine with more artificial intelligence that will enable people to voice questions about images and occasionally organize an entire page of results, despite the technology's past offerings of misleading information.\n\nThe latest changes announced Thursday herald the next step in an AI-driven makeover that Google launched in mid-May when it began responding to some queries with summaries written by the technology at the top of its influential results page. Those summaries, dubbed “AI Overviews,” raised fears among publishers that fewer people would click on search links to their websites and undercut the traffic needed to sell digital ads that help finance their operations.\n\nGoogle is addressing some of those ongoing worries by inserting even more links to other websites within the AI Overviews, which already have been reducing the visits to general news publishers such as The New York Times and technology review specialists such as TomsGuide.com, according to an analysis released last month by search traffic specialist BrightEdge.\n\nBut Google's decision to pump even more AI into the search engine that remains the crown jewel of its $2 trillion empire leaves little doubt that the Mountain View, California, company is tethering its future to a technology propelling the biggest industry shift since Apple unveiled the first iPhone 17 years ago.\n\nThe next phase of Google's AI evolution builds upon its 7-year-old Lens feature that processes queries about objects in a picture. The Lens option is now generates more than 20 billion queries per month, and is particularly popular among users from 18 to 24 years old. That's a younger demographic that Google is trying to cultivate as it faces competition from AI alternatives powered by ChatGPT and Perplexity that are positioning themselves as answer engines.\n\nNow, people will be able to use Lens to ask a question in English about something they are viewing through a camera lens — as if they were talking about it with a friend — and get search results. Users signed up for tests of the new voice-activated search features in Google Labs will also be able to take video of moving objects, such as fish swimming around aquarium, while posing a conversational question and be presented an answer through an AI Overview.\n\n“The whole goal is can we make search simpler to use for people, more effortless to use and make it more available so people can search any way, anywhere they are,” said Rajan Patel, Google's vice president of search engineering and a co-founder of the Lens feature.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough advances in AI offer the potential of making search more convenient, the technology also sometimes spits out bad information — a risk that threatens to damage the credibility of Google's search engine if the inaccuracies become too frequent. Google has already had some embarrassing episodes with its AI Overviews, including advising people to put glue on pizza and to eat rocks. The company blamed those missteps on data voids and online troublemakers deliberately trying to steer its AI technology in a wrong direction.\n\nGoogle is now so confident that it has fixed some of its AI's blind spots that it will rely on the technology to decide what types of information to feature on the results page. Despite its previous bad culinary advice about pizza and rocks, AI will initially be used for the presentation of the results for queries in English about recipes and meal ideas entered on mobile devices. The AI-organized results are supposed to be broken down into different groups of clusters consisting of photos, videos and articles about the subject.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) wants you to talk to your computer. No, not by swearing at it when your boss schedules another 8 a.m. meeting. Rather, the tech giant wants you to have actual back-and-forth conversations with your laptop.\n\nDubbed Copilot Voice and available as part of Microsoft’s latest Copilot AI platform update, the software feature is designed to let you speak directly to your PC and for it to talk back to you.\n\n“We think that Copilot Voice is going to be really a big unlock in terms of how you interface with technology,” Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi told Yahoo Finance.\n\n“We now have the most advanced AI models that are really fast. So this is not like the old ‘Hey Siri’ or ‘Hello, Alexa,’” Mehdi said, explaining that Copilot’s AI offers more impressive voice recognition capabilities.\n\nIn addition to voice, Microsoft is working on a feature called Copilot Vision that will allow Copilot to see what you’re doing on your screen and answer questions and make suggestions based on the content you’re viewing. Copilot Vision is only available to select Copilot Pro subscribers for the moment, but Microsoft plans to roll it out to all users in the future. Microsoft's new Click to Do option provides you with a context-sensitive toolbox for taking actions related to what you're viewing on your screen. (Microsoft) (Microsoft)\n\nTaken together, Copilot Voice and Copilot Vision hold the promise of a major shift in how we use our PCs and a means for Microsoft to potentially boost PC sales as it continues to ramp up its consumer AI push via its Copilot+PC effort.\n\nBut the company is facing ever-growing competition from longtime rivals Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL), which already offer or are preparing to debut their own AI features. And if Copilot doesn’t catch on among consumers, it could leave an enormous blemish on Microsoft’s efforts to be the go-to AI company.\n\nA computer that can see what you see\n\nBeing able to chat with an AI assistant isn’t exactly a wildly new feature. Apple and Google already offer AI helpers that you can speak to, as does Amazon. And with their latest upgrades, Apple's and Google’s offerings should provide the kind of natural-sounding responses that Microsoft’s Copilot does.\n\nBut it’s Copilot’s ability to see what you’re doing on your screen and then talk about that content with you that’s truly intriguing. Copilot Vision is designed to work with Microsoft’s Edge browser and allow you to have discussions with your computer about what new shows to watch when you’re bored.\n\nIn a demo Microsoft showed off, Copilot and an off-screen user talked about the available shows and movies on the website Rotten Tomatoes and which ones the user might enjoy. The conversation seemed natural enough, though how well the feature works in the real world versus a quick demo remains to be seen.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, it’s easy to see how Copilot Voice and Copilot Vision could change how you use your PC. Imagine dropping a few numbers into a spreadsheet and telling Copilot to put them into an attractive chart or playing an Xbox game and asking Copilot how to get past a particularly difficult boss. That’s the direction Microsoft is heading with these technologies.\n\nAnd while talking to your computer should prove useful, the company says it has no plans to get rid of the classic keyboard and mouse. Rather, Microsoft says the new features will complement the trusted input devices.\n\nMicrosoft isn’t just giving Copilot a voice and vision, though. According to Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, the company wants to give its AI the ability to take actions on your behalf.\n\n“It might proactively reach out to you with a reminder or a word of encouragement on your big day. It might help schedule something for you. It might proactively buy something,” Suleyman explained during a press event announcing Copilot Vision on Tuesday.\n\n“Fundamentally, all of these interfaces are about to be represented by different kinds of conversational AI. And so that's the big paradigm shift we're making,” Suleyman added.\n\nMicrosoft has major competition, and one big disadvantage\n\nBut as interesting as Microsoft’s AI features are, they’re largely meant for the PC. Yes, Microsoft offers a Copilot app for smartphone users, but Android and Apple’s iPhone have their own native AI helpers. And chances are users will stick with those rather than download the Copilot app. Apple's rival Apple Intelligence running on an iPhone. (Apple) (Apple)\n\nThat puts Microsoft at a significant disadvantage in the AI wars. That’s because consumers use their smartphones far more than they use their laptops or desktops. Heck, chances are you’re reading this very article on your smartphone.\n\nThat means users will spend more time interacting with Apple's and Google’s offerings than Microsoft’s Copilot. Microsoft will undoubtedly benefit from the fact that its Copilot software is also built into its enterprise offerings, but on the consumer side, it will face an uphill battle when it comes to taking on Google’s Gemini and Apple’s Apple Intelligence.\n\nGoogle is also aiming to roll out its own AI vision software called Project Astra that will allow users' smartphones to see and understand the world around them. Apple is also working on a similar feature. But Apple’s AI platform is still in its early stages, with the company set to roll out more features in the coming months and across 2025.\n\nMicrosoft also has the benefit of its relationship with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, which will help boost the Windows maker’s portfolio of AI offerings. But the company will need to ensure its AI efforts take off among consumers before Google or Apple steal the spotlight.\n\nIf it can’t do that and it doesn’t deliver on its promises of making your laptop speak, its AI services could end up in danger of going the way of another famous Microsoft helper: the long-gone Clippy assistant for Microsoft Office.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI has completed a deal to raise over $6.5 billion in new funding, giving the artificial intelligence company a more than $150 billion valuation, and bolstering its efforts to build the world’s leading generative AI technology.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai’s Sky-High Rents Gang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon’s Fast-Growing Cities A Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda’s Capital City New Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century The Corner Store Comeback\n\nThe deal is one of the largest-ever private investments, and makes OpenAI one of the three largest venture-backed startups, alongside Elon Musk’s SpaceX and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd., according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The size of the investment underscores the tech industry’s belief in the power of AI, and its appetite for the extremely costly research powering its advancement.\n\nThe funding round was led by Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm headed up by Josh Kushner, Bloomberg previously reported, along with other global investors.\n\nThe massive funding round follows a turbulent year for OpenAI. Last November, the company’s board fired and then quickly rehired its Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman. In the following months, the company has remade its board, hired hundreds of new employees and lost several key leaders, including Sutskever and Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAdam Neumann’s Latest Project Is a WeWork Competitor The Great €3 Billion Shipping Container Heist Investors Hot on India Shrug Off Adani Short Seller Attack Sports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought How a Short Seller’s Attack Threatens This Spanish Family Company\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google is taking its rivalry with OpenAI to another level",
        "content": "Google (GOOGL) reportedly wants to bring its artificial intelligence rivalry with OpenAI to the next level of AI models: those that can “reason.”\n\nTeams at Google have made progress in recent months on software for AI models that resembles humanlike reasoning abilities, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Google has long focused on “reasoning” capabilities in large language models (LLMs), including in its work on chain-of-thought prompting.\n\nWith this technique, which people told Bloomberg that Google is using, LLMs can solve multistep problems using “a series of intermediate reasoning steps,” similar to the way a human would. Models with this software take a longer time to respond to inquiries because they consider similar prompts that are summarized into a response. The chain-of-thought technique gives models the ability to solve more complex math- and computer-programming-related inquiries.\n\nOpenAI is also using chain-of-thought prompting for its new o1 model. After the model, which was internally called Strawberry, was released in September, some employees in Google’s DeepMind unit were worried the company had fallen behind, a person told Bloomberg. However, they added that employees are no longer concerned now that Google has unveiled more competitors to OpenAI’s products.\n\nUnlike in the current version of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s new model doesn’t have some of its “useful” features yet, such as browsing the web and file and image uploads. The o1 series models are “designed to spend more time thinking before they respond,” the company said. The models, the first of which are available in preview in ChatGPT and through the company’s API, can “reason” through more complex tasks and problems in science, coding, and math than earlier OpenAI models can.\n\nGoogle is also working on improving its Gemini chatbot’s “reasoning” abilities. In July, Google made its fastest, most cost-efficient model, 1.5 Flash, available in the unpaid version of Gemini. With 1.5 Flash, Gemini will have “quicker and more helpful responses,” Google said, adding that users will notice improvements to Gemini’s reasoning and image processing abilities.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) to Invest $3.3 Billion in South Carolina for Two New Google Cloud Data Centers, Expanding Global Network",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News Investors Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nCompanies are investing heavily in AI infrastructure to meet the growing demands of machine learning, data processing, and AI-driven applications. This spending is largely concentrated on building data centers, acquiring specialized hardware, and optimizing cloud infrastructure. According to a report by McKinsey, global AI infrastructure spending could reach up to $500 billion by 2027, highlighting the critical role it plays in the future of AI development. A large part of this investment is focused on AI-specific hardware like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are crucial for training and deploying AI models. NVIDIA, a dominant player in AI chips, has seen demand for its GPUs soar, largely due to their centrality in deep learning tasks. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the firm, has remarked that the AI boom is underpinned by massive infrastructure needs, and the market is just at the beginning of this growth curve.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nData centers are another focal point for AI infrastructure spending. AI workloads are highly demanding, requiring specialized facilities that can support high-density computing environments. Blackstone’s $16 billion acquisition of AirTrunk, a leader in AI-driven data centers, underscores the increasing importance of such infrastructure. The deal will add 800 MW of data center capacity, with projections to grow beyond 1 GW, a testament to the rising demand for infrastructure to support AI-driven applications. Cloud infrastructure is also a major area where companies are pouring resources. Cloud giants are increasing their investments in AI infrastructure. These companies are developing new AI-optimized cloud services to cater to businesses adopting AI. Gartner predicts that by 2026, cloud AI infrastructure spending will surpass $200 billion, as enterprises increasingly shift from on-premise AI deployments to scalable cloud-based solutions.\n\nThomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, recently remarked that AI is unlocking entirely new revenue streams for enterprises, and cloud infrastructure is the backbone enabling this transformation. Beyond just hardware, organizations are also investing in data management platforms and storage solutions to handle the massive amounts of data AI systems require. In fact, estimates suggest that the global AI data infrastructure market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18%, driven by increased data volumes and the need for real-time data processing capabilities. Companies are significantly ramping up their investments in AI infrastructure, focusing on hardware, data centers, and cloud computing. With projections showing continued growth in AI workloads, this spending will only increase in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said recently that the tech giant is investing $3.3 billion in South Carolina to break ground on two new data centers. The move is part of a larger plan to expand cloud and data center infrastructure, create local jobs, and support economic activity in the area.\n\nAccording to reports, the two new data centers are being built in Dorchester County, which is northwest of Charleston. The South Carolina centers comprise part of a 40-region global network for Google Cloud, which covers more than 200 countries and territories around the globe. The Cloud service marketed by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the third biggest cloud service in the world, trailing Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Google breached TV company trademark through YouTube Shorts service, court told",
        "content": "A television company is in a High Court legal battle with Google over the use of the word “shorts” on YouTube.\n\nShorts International Limited (SIL), which runs a TV channel dedicated to short films, claims that Google infringed its trademarks by launching the YouTube Shorts service in 2020.\n\nThe YouTube service allows users to share videos of up to 60 seconds online and on the platform’s app, but lawyers for SIL claim that the word “short” does not “stretch” to include the media format.\n\nGoogle denies the claims, stating that “short” covers a wide range of productions, and that the SIL trademarks should be revoked.\n\nIn written submissions for a trial which began on Wednesday, Simon Malynicz KC, for SIL, said: “Remarkably, Google contends strongly for the meaning of ‘Shorts’ being descriptive of ‘short films’, while at the same time contending that the word is descriptive of its platform for the creation, viewing and interaction with user-generated content.\n\n“That cannot be right because the word ‘Short’ even in the field of entertainment does not stretch so far.\n\n“Google’s use is not in accordance with any previously known or understood or accepted meaning of the word ‘Shorts’ and it is notable that none of the other platforms call their videos ‘Shorts’ – only Google.”\n\nMr Malynicz told the court in London that SIL operates an international TV channel called ShortsTV, launched in 2007, which he said was “the first, and now the largest and best known, TV channel devoted exclusively to short films”.\n\nThe channel’s content can be watched on various platforms, including YouTube, and it owns the trademarks for “SHORTSTV” and “SHORTS” in “word and/or device form”.\n\nGoogle then launched the YouTube Shorts service in 2020, which became available in the UK the following year, but SIL claims that the service causes “a risk of confusion” with its own trademarks.\n\nBut in her written arguments, Lindsay Lane KC, for Google, said that there was “extensive evidence” that the word “is not limited to cinematographic films, but encompasses all forms of short-form entertainment content whether on film, video, television or online”.\n\nShe added that it was “common sense” that a company could not trademark a “purely descriptive word or words that are widely used in a particular field”, and that SIL’s trademarks had not been infringed and were “invalid”.\n\nStory continues\n\nMs Lane said: “It is a classic example of a party seeking to monopolise an ordinary descriptive word which is commonly used by traders.”\n\nShe continued: “SIL cannot complain, having chosen a descriptive word that is commonly used in this market, that descriptiveness will be reinforced by Google’s use.\n\n“The word ‘shorts’ was descriptive long before the use complained of commenced, and it will continue to be so.”\n\nThe hearing before Michael Tappin KC, sitting as a High Court judge, is due to conclude on October 11, with a judgment expected in writing at a later date.",

        "title": "YEXT and Berry have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – October 2, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares YEXT YEXT as the Bull of the Day and Berry BRY as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and Adobe Inc. ADBE.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks.\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nYEXT is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that has a D for Value and a B for Growth. Yext provides digital media technology services. It offers advertising, monetization, phone and directory services which includes business listings on search sites and real-time reputation management. Let’s explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.\n\nDescription\n\nYext offers a cloud-based digital knowledge platform, which allows businesses to manage their digital knowledge in the cloud such as financial information, resources and performance of these resources on a consolidated basis and sync it to other application such as Apple Maps, Bing, Cortana, Facebook, Google, Google Maps, Instagram, Siri, and Yelp. It offers the Yext Knowledge Engine package on a subscription basis, which has an access to Listings, Pages, Reviews and other features.\r\n\r\nThe Listing feature provides customers with control over their digital presence, including their location and other related attributes published on the used third-party applications. The Pages feature allows customers to establish landing pages on their own websites and to manage digital content on those sites, including calls to action. The Reviews presence enables customers to encourage and facilitate reviews from end consumers. The company was founded by Howard Lerman, Brent Metz, and Brian Distelburger in 2006 and is headquartered in New York, NY..\n\nEarnings History\n\nWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.\n\nYext has a solid earnings history with the company topping the Zacks Consensus in three of the last four quarters.\n\nOver the course of the last four quarters the average positive earnings surprise works out to be 48%.\n\nEarnings Estimates Revisions\n\nEarnings estimates revisions is what the Zacks Rank is all about.\n\nAnnual Estimates are moving higher for YEXT.\n\nThis quarter has decreased from $0.15 to $0.13.\n\nNext quarter has also slid from $0.16 to $0.15.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe full year fiscal 2025 has increased from $0.40 to $0.41 over the last 30 days.\n\nNext year has seen a slight decrease from $0.66 to $0.64 over the last 30 days.\n\nGrowth\n\nFor fiscal 2025 the company is expected to show 4% growth with $420 million in sales. Next year that number grows to $463 million for a 10.2% increase.\n\nValuation\n\nThe forward earnings multiple for YEXT comes in at 17x which is right around this historic market multiple. It should be noted that the current market multiple is at 23x. The price to book multiple comes in at 5.4x and being a mostly asset slim model that gives this metric plenty of room to run. Price to sales comes in at 2.2x and that number will improve next year as revenue growth accelerates.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nBerry is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) after the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate when the last reported on August 9 of this year. Berry is an independent upstream energy company which focuses on the conventional, long-lived oil reserves principally in the San Joaquin basin of California. This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as it is the Bear of the Day.\n\nDescription\n\nBerry Corp. is an energy exploration company, which engages in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of domestic oil and natural gas reserves. It operates through the Exploration and Production (E&P) and Well Servicing and Abandonment segments. The E&P segment consists of the development and production of onshore, low geologic risk, long-lived conventional oil and gas reserves, primarily located in California, as well as Utah. The Well Servicing and Abandonment segment is involved in the wellsite services in California to oil and natural gas production companies, with a focus on well servicing, well abandonment services and water logistics. The company was founded by C. J. Berry in 1909 and is headquartered in Dallas, TX.\n\nEarnings History\n\nWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.\n\nIn the case of Berry, I see four straight misses of the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the last year. The most recent quarter was the miss with the company posting $0.18 when the consensus was calling for $0.20. This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn’t make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.\n\nThe Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.\n\nEarnings Estimates\n\nThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower. For BRY I see annual estimates moving lower of late.\n\nThe current fiscal year consensus number moved lower from $0.84 to $0.63 over the last 60 days.\n\nThe next year has moved from $0.87 to $0.59 over the last 60 days.\n\nNegative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nIt should be noted that a lot of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions. That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nAdditional content:\n\n3 Stocks with Extensive AI Applications to Hold Tight for Now\n\nThe astonishing rally in U.S. stocks that started at the beginning of 2023 was predominantly driven by the technology sector. An unprecedented adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology across the world was the prime factor.\n\nLately, a section of market analysts and financial researchers have raised concerns about the potential profitability of massive investments in generative AI by several technology giants. We believe that AI applications will continue to gather pace in the coming years, buoyed by the rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet.\n\nAt this stage, investors should keenly watch three technology behemoths with extensive applications of generative AI. These companies are - Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Adobe Inc.\n\nThese stocks have double-digit price upside in the short term. In the long term, these stocks have a higher earnings per share (EPS) growth rate than the broad-market S&P 500 index, which should drive their stock prices in the next 3 to 5 years. Each of these stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\n3 Tech Giants with Extensive AI Applications in Focus\n\nFocus on these three technology bigwigs for handsome returns in both the short and long terms.\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nA deepening focus on generative AI technology is a major positive for GOOGL in this data-driven world. Google has been well-poised to capitalize on the growing proliferation of generative AI-backed chatbots on the back of Bard, which enables users to collaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support and app integration.\n\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered with Gemini Pro in order to deliver enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\n\nIn addition, GOOGL’s Vertex AI enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models. These generative AI capabilities are aiding Google in enhancing search results, accelerating Android development, boosting healthcare reach and delivering enhanced cloud experience.\n\nHuge Price Upside Potential for GOOGL Stock\n\nAlphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14% and 31.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 60 days. Alphabet has a long-term (3-5 year) earnings growth rate of 17.5%.\n\nThe average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 23.3% from the last closing price of $165.85. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $170-$225.\n\nAmazon.com Inc.\n\nAmazon is pushing well with its devices strategy. Alexa powered Echo devices are going great guns and help the company sell products and services. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven Alexa has already been integrated into a host of everyday devices for the digital home, which has converted the nascent smart home market into a potential area of growth in a very short time.\n\nMoreover, AMZN is benefiting from an increasing number of Alexa-compatible smart devices. AMZN is racing to build an ecosystem around Alexa and it’s safe to say that it has taken an early lead over Google's smart assistant.\n\nAmazon is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure as a service to enterprise customers. The expanding customer base of Amazon Web Services (AWS) driven by its strengthening cloud offerings, will continue to aid AMZN’s dominance in the global cloud space.\n\nImpressive Price Upside Potential for AMZN Shares\n\nAmazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.4% and 63.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3% over the last 60 days. Alphabet has a long-term (3-5 year) earnings growth rate of 27.4%.\n\nThe average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 19.9% from the last closing price of $186.33. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $200-$265.\n\nAdobe Inc.\n\nAdobe has extensively implemented AI applications across its flagship products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Premiere. Earlier this year, ADBE introduced generative AI-driven Adobe Firefly. Moreover, Adobe Acrobat and Reader AI Assistant help users to summarize documents and answer questions, which can save time and help users accomplish tasks faster.\n\nUsing its new AI-driven cloud-based platform, ADBE is also diversifying into digital marketing services, offering data mining services, which help businesses measure page views, purchases and social media sites. Adobe Marketing Cloud enables marketers to deliver personalized web experiences across multiple devices, manage multichannel campaigns and optimize media monetization.\n\nThese services help businesses streamline marketing and products for targeted consumer groups, including chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers, advertising agencies, publishing executives and digital marketers.\n\nADBE has launched Adobe Express, an application for quick editing effects. Leveraging generative AI, this tool is useful for short-form video content like Instagram Reels. Adobe also launched an AI-based Express app for iOS and Android.\n\nSolid Price Upside Potential for ADBE Shares\n\nAdobe has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.5% and 13.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last 30 days. Alphabet has a long-term (3-5 year) earnings growth rate of 13.1%.\n\nThe average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 19% from the last closing price of $517.78. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $450-$703.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Google Is Working on Reasoning AI, Chasing OpenAI’s Efforts",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google is working on artificial intelligence software that resembles the human ability to reason, similar to OpenAI’s o1, marking a new front in the rivalry between the tech giant and the fast-growing startup.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda’s Capital City Gang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon’s Fast-Growing Cities A 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai’s Sky-High Rents The Corner Store Comeback New Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century\n\nIn recent months, multiple teams at Alphabet Inc.’s Google have been making progress on AI reasoning software, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Such software programs are more adept at solving multistep problems in fields such as math and computer programming.\n\nAI researchers are pursuing reasoning models as they search for the next significant step forward in the technology. Like OpenAI, Google is trying to approximate human reasoning using a technique known as chain-of-thought prompting, according to two of the people. In this technique, which Google pioneered, the software pauses for a matter of seconds before responding to a written prompt while, behind the scenes and invisible to the user, it considers a number of related prompts and then summarizes what appears to be the best response.\n\nGoogle declined to comment on the effort.\n\nGoogle and OpenAI have been locked in an intense fight for dominance in AI, particularly since the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a popular chatbot that some investors worry will eventually obviate the need for Google search. Google has taken various steps to regain its lead, including merging its premier research labs to form the Google DeepMind unit and fortifying relationships between researchers and product teams. Yet the search giant continues to move more slowly when it comes to releasing AI products, pausing to consider ethical problems, the need to live up to the public’s expectations of trust in its brand, and the competing interests of multiple similar efforts in the vast organization.\n\nSince OpenAI unveiled its o1 model, known internally as Strawberry, in mid-September, some in DeepMind have fretted that the company had fallen behind, according to another person with knowledge of the matter. But employees are no longer as concerned as they were following the launch of ChatGPT, now that Google has debuted some of its own work, the person said.\n\nDespite the slower pace of Google’s product rollouts, it remains a formidable player, said Oren Etzioni, a veteran AI researcher who founded TrueMedia.org, a nonprofit dedicated to combating political disinformation.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Technically it’s always been the case that Google’s capabilities were top notch. They were just more conservative in rolling things out,” Etzioni said. “It’s a marathon, and it’s anybody’s race to win.”\n\nIn July, Google showcased AlphaProof, which specializes in math reasoning, and AlphaGeometry 2, an updated version of a model focused on geometry that the company debuted earlier this year. The programs aced four of the six problems featured in the International Mathematical Olympiad, an annual competition in which students tackle topics such as algebra and geometry, Google said in a blog post.\n\nAt its developer conference in May, Google offered a glimpse of an AI assistant, Astra, which can use a phone’s camera to see the world around it and answer questions, such as telling a user where she had left her glasses. Google said some features of assistant may come to its flagship AI model, Gemini, toward the end of this year.\n\n“Advanced mathematical reasoning is a critical capability for modern AI,” Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis wrote in a post on social network X in July.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAdam Neumann’s Latest Project Is a WeWork Competitor The Great €3 Billion Shipping Container Heist Sports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought How a Short Seller’s Attack Threatens This Spanish Family Company Investors Hot on India Shrug Off Adani Short Seller Attack\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): One of the Most Widely Held Stocks by Hedge Funds",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Widely Held Stocks by Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other widely held stocks.\n\nTwo 25 Point Cuts May be the Most Likely Outcome\n\nThe last trading day of September is upon us and so are many questions about the market. On September 30, Dana D’Auria, Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the financial market.\n\nD'Auria regards employment data to be a major concern at the moment. Since inflation rates are subsiding, employment data is something investors should be on the lookout for, along with other data points including GDP and consumer confidence. She suggests that to ensure a soft landing, the Fed must initiate larger rate cuts, and that recessionary conditions are out of the picture.\n\nSeptember is notoriously volatile along with October, and, with elections in another 35 days, the conditions may be slightly different or even more turbulent. According to D'Auria, the 50 basis point cut is a catch-up for July, and expecting a 50 basis point cut in November is borderline questionable.\n\nOverall, she believes that the market has been overshooting and we may have to settle for two 25 basis point cuts before the end of 2024. She reiterates that the job market is crucial and investors must get out of their comfort zone to invest in non-cash opportunities. Investors concerned about low-risk options may consider equities in the defensive sectors that are innately low volatile.\n\nThe Market is Broadening\n\nWall Street is heading to close September and Q3 on a high note and stocks have experienced their best September in over a decade. On September 30, Kevin Gordon, harles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis.\n\nGordon believes that stocks in the utilities and defensive sectors have caught up to tech stocks amid the AI boom, compared to their financials at the end of FY 2023. However, he does acknowledge that sectors like industrials, financials, and materials are performing relatively well, calling it a case of market broadening.\n\nIn terms of market breadth, most sectors are experiencing an upward trajectory. Almost 81% of the S&P 500 members are experiencing an uptrend, despite the quality bias investors may have towards certain stocks. According to Gordon, large-cap quality stocks will continue to perform well despite the volatility and the Fed's decisions. Speaking of smaller-cap stocks, he believes that some stocks may struggle a bit especially when it comes to earnings growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 10 most widely held stocks by hedge funds, we sifted through Insider Monkey's database that tracks over 900 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. We ranked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. The company owns a range of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo.\n\nThe company is relentlessly working to improve the Gemini experience and is also actively involved in developing AI hardware, having launched its NVIDIA chip rival in May. While Google’s tensor processing units (TPU) only account for almost 20% of the market, its advancements promise higher market shares. In addition to that, its six-generation chips are 67% more energy efficient compared to the previous generation of processors. It is to be noted that the company intends to spend $50 billion by the end of 2024 to enhance its position in AI.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) logged revenue worth $85 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, driven by the growing momentum in cloud and search. Additionally, over 60% of generative AI startups and 90% of generative AI unicorns are customers of the Google Cloud. One can infer that the technology giant is well-positioned to exploit the next wave of artificial intelligence and innovation, making it a solid investment.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on GOOGL and their 12-month median price target of $204.5 points to a 24% upside from current levels. Overall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). According to the Insider Monkey database, Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $8.86 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\"\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley andJim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "The Southeast Asian country of Malaysia is getting another multi-billion dollar investment from U.S. Big Tech, the latest in the region's drive to capitalize on the AI boom.\n\nOn Wednesday, Oracle announced it would invest at least $6.5 billion towards a public cloud region in Malaysia. A cloud region is the real-world location where cloud facilities are located. Oracle said the new facilities would allow its customers in Malaysia to leverage AI services, and help Malaysian organizations modernize their digital applications.\n\n“Malaysia offers unique growth opportunities for organizations looking to accelerate their expansion with the latest digital technologies,” said Garrett Ilg, Oracle's executive vice president and general manager for Japan and Asia Pacific in a statement.\n\nMalaysia's minister of investment, trade and industry said Oracle's investment will support the country's ambitious plan to create 3,000 smart factories by 2030.\n\nOracle's cloud investment follows a similarly sized pledge from Amazon. In late August, the U.S.'s company's cloud computing division promised $6.2 billion in investment for Malaysia. Microsoft and Google have also announced multi-billion dollar investments in Malaysian cloud infrastructure.\n\nMalaysia is working to position itself as a tech hub in Southeast Asia. In addition to data centers, Malaysia is also courting semiconductor investments in a bid to move up the chip supply chain.\n\nThe country is working on a national cloud office and AI strategy, Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Tuesday at the groundbreaking ceremony for Google's new $2 billion data center complex. The U.S. company claims the investment will create 26,500 jobs and generate $3.2 billion in economic activity by 2030.\n\nSoutheast Asia cloud investments\n\nOther Southeast Asian economies are attracting cloud-related investments.\n\nIn May, Amazon pledged to invest $9 billion into its existing cloud infrastructure in Singapore by 2028. The Southeast Asian city-state has been a regional data hub for the U.S. company since 2010.\n\nOn Monday, Google said it will invest $1 billion in Thailand to build a new data center and expand the country's cloud infrastructure. Microsoft also says it has a \"significant commitment\" to build new cloud and AI infrastructure in Thailand, according to CEO Satya Nadella in May.\n\nMicrosoft is also promising $1.7 billion in cloud- and AI-related investment in Indonesia.\n\nThe investment in Southeast Asia's data centers is part of a global push to invest in computing capacity to fuel new AI services. Last month, a consortium of companies including Microsoft and BlackRock pledged to mobilize $100 billion in capital to invest in new data centers.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Danial Azhar\n\nKUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Oracle plans to invest more than $6.5 billion to set up its first public cloud region in Malaysia, the company said on Wednesday, the latest major investment by a global tech firm into the Southeast Asian country.\n\nTechnology giants including Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet unit Google and China's ByteDance have announced billions of dollars worth of digital investments into Malaysia since last year, mostly in cloud services and data centres, powering an infrastructure boom driven by growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nA cloud region is the physical, geographic location where a company's public cloud facilities are located. Oracle's venture is set to be one of the largest single tech investments so far, outpacing the $6.2 billion planned spending by Amazon's cloud unit AWS announced last year.\n\nThe planned public cloud region will help organisations in Malaysia modernise their applications, migrate their workload to the cloud, and innovate with data, analytics and AI, the U.S. firm said in a statement.\n\nIt would also allow the firm's Malaysian customers which include government agencies, financial institutions, and airline and hospitality companies, to use cloud services based in the country, rather than those based externally, said Oracle's Executive Vice President for Japan and Asia Pacific Garrett Ilg.\n\n\"Those customers look to Oracle to support their innovation ... to move into standardised processes to be faster, to be more controlled and be more cost-effective,\" Ilg told Reuters in an interview.\n\nThe cloud region in Malaysia would be Oracle's third in Southeast Asia, after its two existing facilities in Singapore. It currently has 50 public cloud regions across 24 countries, according to its website.\n\nOracle last month raised its fiscal 2026 revenue forecast and said it expects to cross $100 billion in revenue in fiscal 2029, indicating rising demand for its cloud services.\n\nThe company also wants to continue its expansion across Asia, with more data centres and infrastructure projects planned \"from Japan all the way down to New Zealand... all the way to India,\" Ilg said.\n\nChris Chelliah, Oracle's senior vice president for technology and customer strategy in Japan and Asia Pacific, said Malaysia provided further growth potential and market opportunities for the company as part of a broader AI and data centre development push in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn the past year, Microsoft has announced cloud services investments worth $1.7 billion in Indonesia, while Amazon has announced plans to invest $9 billion in Singapore and $5 billion in Thailand.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle on Tuesday broke ground on a $2 billion data centre in Malaysia, part of investments that it said would contribute more than $3 billion to the country's economy by 2030.\n\n(This story has been corrected to change the name of Oracle's executive vice president for Japan and Asia Pacific to Garrett, not Garret, in paragraph 5)\n\n(Reporting by Danial Azhar; Editing by Rozanna Latiff and Miral Fahmy)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Overview of Recent Transaction by David Abrams (Trades, Portfolio)\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 12 Warning Signs with CWH.\n\nOn September 27, 2024, Abrams Capital Management, led by David Abrams (Trades, Portfolio), executed a significant transaction involving the sale of 2,000,000 shares of Camping World Holdings Inc (NYSE:CWH). This move reduced the firm's holding by 39.15%, leaving Abrams Capital with a total of 3,108,808 shares in the company. The shares were sold at a price of $24.53 each, impacting the firm's portfolio by -0.96%. Following this transaction, Camping World Holdings Inc now constitutes 1.51% of Abrams Capitals portfolio, with the firm holding a 6.90% stake in the company.\n\nProfile of David Abrams (Trades, Portfolio) and Abrams Capital Management\n\nDavid Abrams (Trades, Portfolio), the CEO and portfolio manager of Abrams Capital Management, founded the firm in 1999 after a decade of working with Seth Klarman (Trades, Portfolio) at Baupost. Based in Boston, Abrams Capital is known for its opportunistic, value-oriented investment strategy, focusing on long-term investments in a concentrated portfolio of assets. The firms approach emphasizes fundamental analysis and includes investments across various asset classes such as stocks, debt, and distressed securities. Currently, Abrams Capital manages an equity portfolio worth approximately $5.12 billion, with top holdings in major companies like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL). David Abrams Reduces Stake in Camping World Holdings Inc\n\nIntroduction to Camping World Holdings Inc\n\nCamping World Holdings Inc, headquartered in the USA, operates as a retailer of RVs and related products and services. Since its IPO on October 7, 2016, the company has expanded to include services such as emergency roadside assistance and vehicle insurance, alongside its RV and outdoor retail segment.

Since the transaction, the stock price has decreased by 2.16% to $24.00. This price adjustment could be a market reaction to the sale or broader market movements. The stock's performance metrics, such as a Profitability Rank of 7/10 and a Growth Rank of 2/10, suggest mixed signals about its financial health and growth prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nImplications for Investors\n\nThis transaction by Abrams Capital Management could signal to other investors that there may be concerns about the intrinsic value or growth potential of Camping World Holdings. Investors might interpret this move as a cue to reevaluate their positions in CWH, especially in light of its current market performance and valuation metrics. As market conditions evolve, the investment community will closely watch Abrams Capitals future transactions for further insights into their strategy adjustments.\n\nOverall, this significant reduction in Camping World Holdings by David Abrams (Trades, Portfolio)s firm could have broader implications for the stocks perception among value investors, potentially influencing its market performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "Mark Cuban says his puppy is ‘smarter than AI is today’",
        "content": "Forging an unlikely friendship between shark and dog, Mark Cuban recently praised canines as catching on faster than Silicon Valley’s latest darling. Tech’s most recent puppy, generative AI, has some house-training to do, according to the billionaire investor.\n\n“I think smart puppies are smarter than AI is today or in the near future,” Cuban said in a Wiredinterview to assumedly wagging tails.\n\nCuban asked the interviewer, Lauren Goode, if she’d trust a seeing-eye dog or a self-driving car more to take her three blocks on the condition that she was blind. It’s perhaps one of the lesser-known hypothetical scenarios. His response: “I would trust the dog.”\n\nHe explains that “a dog can sense issues,” whereas a self-driving car cannot wrap its mind around what is adversarial. And Cuban’s not alone in his skepticism. A whopping 93% of Americans report concerns about said vehicles, citing safety and technology malfunctions as main concerns in a Forbes Advisor survey by OnePoll of 2,000 individuals. Indeed, like cans on a “just married” car, smart vehicles leave a trail of recalls in their wake. Sharing the road with humans, these inventions struggle to navigate the chaos and often stop in their tracks when encountering an issue, per the Conversation.\n\nEven so, self-driving cars have found themselves a little enclave in the Bay Area. Waymo, formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project, has slowly rolled out its product over the course of 15 years, writes David Meyer for Fortune. Weekly rides reached 50,000 in L.A., Phoenix, and San Francisco, according to company data. But that incremental success has not come without bumps in the road, adds Meyer. As of this spring, U.S. regulators are investigating 22 reported accidents involving Waymo cars, as the vehicles crash into stationary objects and ignore road signs.\n\nAI simply might not be the good boy that Cuban’s dog is. Citing his own mini Australian shepherd Tucks, Cuban praises his natural adaptability. “I can take Tucks and just drop him in a situation, and he’ll figure it out quick,” he says. “I take a phone with AI and show it a video, it’s not going to have a clue. And I don’t think that’s going to change for a long time.” That long time is at least a decade, he adds.\n\nDespite AI’s persistent hallucinations and stoking of fear regarding obsoletism, investors and C-suite executives are rushing to implement and back said invention before competitors do. Even if he thinks Tucks is wiser, Cuban acknowledges that this AI race is high stakes.\n\n“Our military dominance, our place in the world depends on our ability to invest in AI. Period. End of story,” he told CNBC late September. “Whoever wins AI has the best military. There’s no question about it.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCuban seems to still be baking his opinions regarding AI. While critical, he did an ad for Google’s Gemini AI feature, Wired’s Goode points out. That meant nothing though, he claims, and was only to promote Cost Plus Drugs. While doubting the true adaptability of self-driving cars, he dismisses the idea that companies like OpenAI are overhyped. Rather, he predicts they will be oversaturated one day, as people create competing and cheaper models.\n\nEither way, it’ll likely take time for AI to catch up to humans, or at the very least, dogs. “Because wisdom doesn’t come with text,” according to Cuban.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Before Mira Murati’s surprise exit from OpenAI, staff grumbled its o1 model had been released prematurely",
        "content": "When OpenAI debuted its latest AI model, GPT4-o, in a slick live webcast this past May, it was Mira Murati, the company’s chief technology officer, not the company’s better known CEO, Sam Altman, who emceed the event.\n\nMurati, dressed in a gray collared T-shirt and jeans, helped show off the software’s ability to interact through voice and image prompts, as well as its skill at simultaneous translation, math, and coding. It was an impressive live demo, timed to steal the thunder from OpenAI’s rival Google, which was set to unveil new features for its own AI chatbot, Gemini, later that week.\n\nBut behind the scenes, things were far from smooth, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal workings. Relentless pressure to introduce products such as GPT-4o, and a newer model, called o1, which debuted last month, were straining the abilities of OpenAI’s research and safety teams to keep pace. There was friction between teams dedicated to ensuring OpenAI’s products did not pose undue risks, such as the ability to assist with producing biological weapons, and commercial teams dedicated to getting new products into the market and making money.\n\nMany OpenAI staff thought that o1 was not ready to be unveiled, but Altman pushed to launch it anyway to burnish OpenAI’s reputation as a leader in AI. This is the first time details of this debate over o1 have been reported publicly.\n\nMurati was often stuck in the middle of arguments between the research and technical teams she oversaw and the commercial teams that were eager to push products out. She was also having to deal with complaints about the leadership style of OpenAI cofounder and president Greg Brockman, and lingering resentment over the role she played in the brief ouster of Altman in a boardroom coup in November 2023.\n\nThese pressures seem to have taken a toll on Murati, who on Wednesday announced she was leaving OpenAI after six years, setting off shockwaves across the tech industry. She had played such a critical role in OpenAI’s meteoric rise that many speculated about the potential damage of her exit to the company’s future. A spokesperson for Murati disputed this account, saying burnout or issues related to management struggles did not factor in her decision to leave.\n\nThe same day Murati said she would be going, two other senior staffers, Bob McGrew, chief research officer, and Barret Zoph, vice president of research who had appeared along with Murati in the GPT4-o launch webcast, also announced they were stepping down. From the outside, it looked as though the company was once again at risk of imploding at a time when it wanted to sell investors on the idea that it was maturing into a more stable, if still fast-growing, organization.\n\nStory continues\n\nAltman, in a note to staff that he later posted to social media platform X, tried to quell the firestorm by saying the three had reached their decisions to leave “independently and amicably.” The company had decided to announce the departures on the same day, he said, to allow for “a smooth handover to the next generation of leadership.” He acknowledged that such transitions are not normally “so abrupt,” but said “we are not a normal company.”\n\nThe three senior resignations add to a growing list of long-serving researchers and staff members who have left OpenAI in the past six months. Some of them have openly expressed concern at how the company’s culture and priorities have changed amid its rapid growth from a small non-profit lab dedicated to ensuring superpowerful AI is developed for “the benefit of all humanity,” to a for-profit company expanding at a breakneck pace.\n\nIn just nine years since its founding, OpenAI has pushed to the forefront of the AI revolution, striking fear into Big Tech companies like Google, Facebook parent Meta, and Amazon that are racing to dominate the latest technology. But OpenAI has also been convulsed by in-fighting and executive upheaval that threatens to slow the company just as its rivals gain momentum.\n\nThe latest chaos comes as OpenAI pushes to achieve three critically important business milestones. The company, which is collects billions of dollars annually from the paid versions of its AI models, is trying to reduce the reported billions of dollars it’s also losing due to high staff costs and the cost of the computing power needed to train and run its AI products.\n\nAt the same time, OpenAI is trying to complete a new venture funding round, raising as much as $7 billion in a deal that would value the company at $150 billion, making it among the most highly-valued tech startups in history. The internal drama may frighten away investors, potentially leading to a lower valuation.\n\nIn part to make itself more attractive to investors, Altman has told staff that the company plans to revamp its current convoluted corporate structure, which has a non-profit foundation controlling its for-profit arm. In the new arrangement, the for-profit would reportedly no longer be controlled by the non-profit.\n\nThe tensions among OpenAI’s staff flared most publicly in November 2023, when OpenAI’s non-profit board abruptly fired Altman, saying he had “not been completely candid” with its members. Altman’s firing precipitated five days of spectacle, ending with Altman’s rehiring and the resignation of several board members. An outside law firm later engaged by a newly-constituted board to investigate Altman’s firing concluded that there had been a fundamental breakdown in trust between the board and Altman, but that none of his actions mandated his removal. OpenAI staffers internally refer to the episode as “the Blip” and hoped to assure the outside world that the drama was behind them.\n\nBut Murati’s resignation alongside those of McGrew and Zoph indicate that the tensions that have roiled OpenAI may be far from fully quieted.\n\nThe reporting for this article is based on interviews with current and former OpenAI employees and people familiar with its operations. They all requested anonymity for fear of violating nondisclosure clauses in employment or exit agreements.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company disagreed with many of the characterizations in this article but did “recognize that evolving from an unknown research lab into a global company that delivers advanced AI research to hundreds of millions of people in just two years requires growth and adaptation.”\n\nRushed development and safety testing\n\nAmid intense competition with rival AI companies and pressure to prove its technological leadership to potential investors, OpenAI has rushed the testing and rollout of its latest and most powerful AI models, according to sources familiar with the process behind both launches.\n\nThe GPT4-o launch was \"unusually chaotic even by OpenAI standards,” one source said, adding that “everyone hated the process.\" Teams were given only nine days to conduct safety assessments of the model, forcing them to work 20-hour plus days to meet the launch date, according to another source familiar with the rollout. “It was definitely rushed,” this source said.\n\nSafety teams pleaded with Murati for more time, the source said. In the past Murati had sometimes intervened, over the objections of OpenAI’s commercial teams, to delay model debuts when safety teams said they needed more time for testing. But in this case, Murati said the timing could not be changed.\n\nThat deadline was largely dictated by another company: Google. OpenAI, the sources said, knew Google was planning to introduce a host of new AI features, and tease a powerful new AI model with similar capabilities to GPT-4o, at its Google I/O developer conference on May 14. OpenAI desperately wanted to steal attention away from those announcements and derail any narrative that Google was pulling ahead in the race to develop ever more capable AI models. So it scheduled its live debut of GPT-4o for May 13.\n\nIn the end, OpenAI’s safety testing was not entirely concluded or verified by the time of the launch, but the safety team’s preliminary assessment was that GPT-4o was safe to launch. Later, however, the source said, a safety researcher discovered that GPT-4o seemed to exceed OpenAI’s own safety threshold for “persuasion”—how effective the model is at convincing people to change their views or perform some task. This is important because persuasive models could be used for nefarious purposes, such as convincing someone to believe in a conspiracy theory or vote a certain way.\n\nThe company has said it will not release any model that presents a “high” or “critical” risk on any safety metric. In this case, OpenAI had initially said GPT-4o presented a “medium” risk. Now the researcher told others internally that GPT-4o might actually present a “high” risk on the persuasion metric, according to the source.\n\nOpenAI denies this characterization and says its release timelines are determined only by its own internal safety and readiness processes. An OpenAI spokesperson said that the company “followed a deliberate and empirical safety process” for the release of GPT-4o and that the model “was determined safe to deploy” with a “medium” rating for persuasion. The company said higher ratings for the model found after it rolled out were the result of a methodological flaw in those tests and did not reflect GPT-4o’s actual risk. It noted that since the model’s debut in May, “it has been safely used by hundreds of millions of people,” giving the company “confidence in its risk assessment.”\n\nAspects of this timeline were reported previously by The Wall Street Journal, but were confirmed independently to Fortune from multiple sources.\n\nIn addition, Fortune has learned that similar issues surrounded the debut of OpenAI’s latest model, o1, which was unveiled on September 12, generating considerable buzz. It’s more capable at tasks that require reasoning, logic, and math than prior AI models and is seen by some as another significant step towards AGI, or artificial general intelligence. This milestone, long the Holy Grail of computer scientists, refers to an AI system matching typical human cognitive abilities. AGI is OpenAI’s stated goal.\n\nBut the launch of the model—which so far is only publicly available in a less capable “preview” version as well as a “mini” version tailored to math and coding—caused friction among the company’s senior executives, one source familiar with the matter said. Some OpenAI staffers felt the model was both too inconsistent in its performance and not safe enough to release, the source said.\n\nIn addition, Woijceich Zarembra, an OpenAI researcher and cofounder, in a post on X in response to the departures of Murati, McGrew, and Zoph, alluded to clashes among staff earlier in the development of o1. He acknowledged that he and Zoph had “a fierce conflict about compute for what later became o1,” but he did not elaborate on the specifics of the argument.\n\nAfter o1 was trained, Altman pushed for the model to be released as a product almost immediately. The CEO insisted on a speedy roll out, the source who spoke to Fortune said, largely because he was eager to prove to potential investors in the company’s latest funding round that OpenAI remains at the forefront of AI development, with AI models more capable than those of its competitors.\n\nMany teams who reported to Murati were convinced o1 was not ready to be released and had not really been shaped into a product. Their objections, however, were overruled, the source said.\n\nEven now a team known as “post-training”—which takes a model once it has been trained and finds ways to fine-tune its responses to be both more helpful and safer—was continuing to refine o1, the source said. Normally, this step is completed before a model’s premiere. Zoph, who announced he was leaving on the same day as Murati, had been in charge of the post-training team.\n\nIn response to Fortune’s questions about o1, OpenAI provided a statement from Zico Kolter, a Carnegie Mellon University computer scientist, and Paul Nakasone, a former director of the U.S. National Security Agency, who serve on the Safety and Security Oversight Committee of OpenAI’s board. Kolter and Nakasone said the o1 model release “demonstrated rigorous evaluations and safety mitigations the company implements at every step of model development” and that o1 had been delivered safely.\n\nA spokesperson for Murati denied that stress related to the headlong rush to get models released or management headaches played any role in her decision to resign. “She worked with her teams closely and, coming off big wins, felt it was the right time to step away,” the spokesperson said.\n\nLingering questions about Murati’s loyalty\n\nConflicts over the release of AI models may not have been the only source of tension between Altman and Murati. Some sources familiar with the company said among OpenAI employees there was speculation Altman viewed her as disloyal due to her role in his brief ouster during “the Blip.”\n\nAmong OpenAI staff, suspicions about Murati’s loyalty surfaced almost immediately after Altman’s firing in November, one source said. For one thing, the old board had appointed Murati as interim CEO. Then, at an all-hands meeting the day of Altman’s dismissal, shocked employees quizzed senior staff on when they first learned of the board’s decision. All of the executives said they had only found out when the decision was announced—except Murati. She said the board had informed her 12 hours before the decision was announced. Stunned, some Altman loyalists thought she should have warned Altman, who was surprised by his ouster.\n\nAt the meeting, Murati told employees she would work with the rest of the company’s executives to push for Altman’s reinstatement. Days later, the board replaced her as interim CEO with veteran tech executive Emmett Shear. Murati resumed her role as CTO when Altman returned as CEO, five days after his firing.\n\nMurati may have played a larger role in Altman’s brief ouster, however, than she has let on. The New York Times reported in March that Murati had written a memo to Altman expressing concerns about his leadership style and that she later brought these concerns to OpenAI’s board. It also reported that her conversations with the board had factored in their decision to fire Altman.\n\nMurati, through a lawyer, issued a statement to the newspaper denying that she had reached out to OpenAI’s board in an effort to get him fired. But she later told staff that when individual board members had contacted her, she provided “feedback” about Altman, adding that Altman was already aware of her views since “I have not been shy about sharing feedback with him directly.” She also said at the time that she and Altman “had a strong and productive partnership.”\n\nDespite her assurances, within OpenAI some questioned whether Murati’s relationship with Altman had been irrevocably damaged, sources said. Others speculated that investors who are pouring billions into OpenAI did not like the idea of a senior executive whose loyalty to Altman was less than total.\n\nBrockman ruffled feathers, Murati had to clean up the mess\n\nOver the past year, Murati also had to deal with clashes between Brockman, the OpenAI cofounder and president, and some of the teams that reported to her. Brockman, a notorious workaholic, had no specific portfolio, sources said. Instead, he tended to throw himself into a variety of projects, sometimes uninvited and at the last minute. In other cases, he pushed staff to work at his own brutal pace, sometimes messaging them at all hours of the day and night.\n\nBrockman’s behavior riled staffers on those teams, with Murati often brought in to either try to rein in Brockman or soothe bruised egos, sources said.\n\nEventually, Brockman was “voluntold” to take a sabbatical, one source said. The Wall Street Journal reported that Altman met with Brockman and told him to take time off. On August 6, Brockman announced on social media that he was “taking a sabbatical” and that it was his “first time to relax since co-founding OpenAI 9 years ago.”\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said Brockman’s decision was entirely his own and reiterated that he would be returning to the company “at the end of the year.”\n\nBrockman may also not have been the only personnel headache that weighed on Murati and those who reported to her. In his post on X, Zarembra also wrote that he had been reprimanded by McGrew “for doing a jacuzzi with a coworker” setting off a speculation on social media about a corporate culture with few limits. Zarembra did not provide additional details.\n\nA spokesperson for Murati emphasized that managing staff conflicts is a typical part of a senior executive’s job and that burnout or stress in no way factored in Murati’s decision to resign. “Her rationale for leaving is, after a successful transition, to turn her full attention and energies toward her exploration and whatever comes next,” the spokesperson said.\n\nA shifting cultureBrockman’s sabbatical and Murati’s departure are part of a widespread transformation of OpenAI in the past 10 months since Altman’s brief ouster. In addition to the senior executives who announced their departures last week, Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI cofounder and its former chief scientist, left the company in May.\n\nSutskever had been on OpenAI’s board and had voted to fire Altman. Following Altman’s rehiring, Sutskever—who had been leading the company’s efforts to research ways to control future powerful AI systems that might be smarter than all humans combined—never returned to work at the company. He has since founded his own AI startup, Safe Super Intelligence.\n\nAfter Sutskever’s departure, Jan Leike, another senior AI researcher who had coheaded the so-called “superalignment” team with Sutskever also announced he was leaving to join OpenAI rival Anthropic. In a post on X, Leike took a parting shot at OpenAI for, in his view, increasingly prioritizing “shiny products” over AI safety.\n\nJohn Schulman, another OpenAI cofounder, also left in August to join Anthropic, saying he wanted to focus on AI safety research and “hands on technical work.” In the past six months, nearly half of OpenAI’s safety researchers have also resigned, raising questions about the company’s commitment to safety.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI has been hiring at a frenetic pace. During Altman’s brief ouster in November, OpenAI staff who wanted to signal their support for his return, took to X to post the phrase “OpenAI is nothing without its people.” But increasingly, OpenAI’s people aren’t the same ones who were at the company at the time.\n\nOpenAI has more than doubled in size since “the Blip,” going from fewer than 800 employees to close to 1,800. Many of those who have been hired have come from big technology companies or conventional fast-growing startups as opposed to the niche fields of AI research from which OpenAI traditionally drew many of its employees.\n\nThe company now has many more employees from commercial fields such as product management, sales, risk, and developer relations. These people may not be as motivated by the quest to develop safe AGI, as they are by the chance to create products that people use today and by the chance for a giant payday.\n\nThe influx of new hires has changed the atmosphere at OpenAI, one source said. There are fewer “conversations about research, more conversations about product or deployment into society.”\n\nAt least some former employees seem distressed at Altman’s plans to revamp its corporate structure so that the company’s for-profit arm is no longer controlled by OpenAI’s non-profit foundation. The changes would also remove the existing limits, or cap, on how much OpenAI’s investors can earn.\n\nGretchen Kreuger, a former OpenAI policy researcher who resigned in May, posted on X on September 29 that she was concerned about the proposed changes to OpenAI’s structure.\n\n“OpenAI’s non-profit governance and profit cap are part of why I joined in 2019,” Kreuger wrote, adding that removing the caps and freeing the for-profit from oversight by the non-profit, “feels like a step in the wrong direction, when what we need is multiple steps in the right direction.”\n\nSome current employees, however, say they are not unhappy about the changes. They hope internal conflict will be more infrequent now that colleagues who they call too academic or overly worried about AI safety, and therefore reluctant to ever release products, are increasingly choosing to leave.\n\nAltman told staff in the memo that he would, for the time being, oversee OpenAI’s technical staff personally. In the past, Altman had been primarily focused on public speaking, meeting with government officials, key partnerships, and fundraising while leaving technical developments to other executives.\n\nOf OpenAI’s 11 original cofounders, only Altman and Zarembra remain at the company full-time. Zarembra, in his post on the departure of Murati, McGrew and Zoph, noted that Altman “for all his shortcomings and mistakes, has created an incredible organization.” Now Altman will have to prove that organization has the depth of talent to continue to succeed without many of the senior leaders who helped him get to this point—and without further drama.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Epic Games Starts A New Battle With Google And Samsung",
        "content": "Epic Games Starts A New Battle With Google And Samsung\n\nThe video game maker Epic Games kicked off the week with a lawsuit against Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Google and Samsung, accusing them of conspiring to block third party competition on Samsung devices. This is Epic’s second lawsuit against Google.\n\nMore precisely, Epic Games accused Samsung and Google of violating antitrust laws in application distribution on Samsung devices. With Samsung’s “Auto Blocker” feature that is turned on by default, Epic Games accused the two for only allowing for apps from authorized sources, such as the Samsung Galaxy Store or Google Play Store, to be installed. This feature can be changed in a phone’s settings, but Samsung argues that it is a tool for blocking malicious activity as it prevents installation of applications from unauthorized sources.\n\nEpic claims that the Auto Blocker violates the December’s jury verdict.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Epic Games decided to file the lawsuit in order to prevent Google from “negating the long overdue promise of competition in the Android App Distribution Market,”. Last year, Epic won its first antitrust lawsuit against Google as the jury also found that Google protected its Android app store with competitive barriers that harmed both smartphone consumers and software developers. Epic now claims that Samsung designed the “Auto Blocker” feature in coordination with Google to preemptively undermine the jury’s verdict from December.\n\nFour years after Epic went after the mighty Google for running an illegal app store monopoly, a battle which it won in December, Epic is suing again. Like in the previous lawsuit, Epic insists it is fighting on behalf of all developers, not just for its personal interest. Samsung made it clear it will vigorously contest Epic Games’ baseless claim, while a spokesperson from Google, Dan Jackson, described the lawsuit as being meritless, with Google denying collusion. Epic Games does not have evidence that Google and Samsung colluded on the Auto Blocker feature that it claims has cemented Google’s dominance, its hopes that evidence of anticompetitive behavior would surface during the document discovery process. Like last time, Epic is asking for a jury trial. In addition, Epic has another ongoing legal battle with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). Apple was due to submit approximately 1.3 million documents related to recent App Store changes on Monday. The ongoing dispute is result of Epic Games‘ deliberate violation of App Store rules back in 2020, which caused Apple to remove it from the platform. While this battle continues, Apple was forced to update its AppStore rules in Europe, now allowing other payment methods. Therefore, whatever happens, titans like Apple and Google are facing an evolving landscape, with outcome of these disputes and regulatory action threatening to significantly weaken their dominance, possibly setting new precedents in their ecosystems.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "PayPal: Time to Dive Back in for Value?",
        "content": "Over the past few years, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been a popular choice for investors due to its high business quality and strong growth prospects. As one of the companies best positioned to benefit from the surge in e-commerce and peer-to-peer payments, PayPal's stock traded at elevated levels for several years, reflecting its perceived value as a high-growth business.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with PYPL.\n\nHowever, despite the anticipated increase in competition, which put pressure on the company's take rate, PayPal's fortunes changed.\n\nFollowing the abrupt end of the hyper-bullish pandemic-driven scenario, the stock fell into a period of underperformance, becoming what many saw as a value trap.\n\nToday, the investment thesis for PayPal is different, centered on moderate growth and an attractive valuation relative to its return potential. In this article, I will explore the reasons behind the extended bearish sentiment on PayPal and how recent results suggest a gradual shift in investor outlook.\n\nWhy PayPal's Stock Took a Nosedive\n\nSince peaking in 2021, PayPal shares have experienced a staggering 75% decline. A few years ago, during the COVID-19 pandemic, PayPal positioned itself as a major beneficiary, with revenues rising by 20% and 18% between 2020 and 2021, while operating income grew by 22% and 25%, respectively. PayPal: Time to Dive Back in for Value?\n\nHowever, everything changed after July 2021, when PayPal shares began a significant sell-off. The company's revenue growth slowed, particularly as the e-commerce boom driven by the pandemic began to normalize. Throughout 2021, PayPal reported several earnings misses and lowered its forward guidance, raising investor concerns about headwinds such as increased competition and slowing consumer spending in digital payments.\n\nThe digital payments industry became highly competitive, with players like Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Pay, and emerging fintech companies (such as Adyen (ADYEY) and Square (SQ)) gaining market share. This competitive pressure cast doubt on PayPal's ability to maintain its market dominance. In 2022, PayPal's revenues declined by 2%, and in 2023, it managed to grow by only 1%.\n\nAll of this occurred while PayPal was trading at inflated valuations, including a P/E ratio exceeding 90x, as illustrated in the graph below. It became evident that PayPal, once valued as a high-growth stock, no longer aligned with a bullish investment thesis. Consequently, a massive sell-off in PayPal shares ensued and continues to this day. However, circumstances may be changing now.\n\nStory continues PayPal: Time to Dive Back in for Value?\n\nSource: YCharts\n\nWhere Does PayPal Stand Today?\n\nInvestor confidence in PayPal has slowly been returning over the last twelve months. The company is currently trading at a market cap of $79.9 billion, with an enterprise value of $75.7 billion when accounting for cash, debt, and investments on the balance sheet.\n\nOver the past year, PayPal generated $31 billion in revenue, $4.4 billion in net income, and $6.7 billion in free cash flow. As a result, PayPal's stock is now valued at under 16x earnings and just 10.8x free cash flow. This level of valuation is typically associated with companies that are not experiencing growth; however, PayPal is indeed growing, albeit at a slower pace than during the pandemic.\n\nIn its most recent quarter reported in August (Q2), PayPal reported revenue growth of 8%. Additionally, the company's adjusted earnings per share, which now includes stock-based compensation, is projected to grow by 10% this year. At first glance, this suggests that PayPal stock is strongly undervalued. If earnings continue to grow at this rate, the payback period would be under nine years. However, several challenges must be considered.\n\nThe first challenge is that PayPal's recent growth has been supported by an aggressive cost-cutting strategy. Operating expenses fell by 10% last year and another 2% in the first half of this year. It is unlikely that PayPal can continue cutting costs significantly, meaning operating expenses will likely begin to rise, putting pressure on earnings once again.\n\nThe second challenge concerns the impact of interest rates. According to management, interest income accounted for about half of the transaction margin growth in the first half of the year. This growth is expected to decline sharply as the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, which will pose a headwind through 2025.\n\nHowever, perhaps the biggest challenge PayPal faces is the increasing competition in the payments industry. Transaction take rates are expected to weaken over time, raising uncertainty about PayPal's ability to outperform its competitors. For instance, Adyen reported a growth rate of 23% in the past twelve months, significantly higher than PayPal's 8%.\n\nNonetheless, sentiment around PayPal appears to be improving. When examining long-term moving averages, PayPal is trading well above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), indicating that the stock's long-term uptrend has been solid. PayPal: Time to Dive Back in for Value?\n\nSource: YCharts\n\nIs PayPal a Deep Value Play or Just a Value Trap?\n\nExamining PayPal's trading chart over the last five years reveals that many investors who bought shares at the end of 2019, viewing the company as a deep value opportunity, ended up facing significant losses in subsequent years. But is PayPal still a value trap in the current scenario? In my opinion, it is not; quite the opposite.\n\nFirst, let's define what I consider to be \"value.\" A company that maintains a consistent track record of generally increasing earnings per share (EPS) without any negative earnings years meets my first criterion. In the last decade, PayPal's EPS has grown from $1.12 in 2016 to $4.13 in the last twelve months, with gradual increases in all but 2022, which was the company's worst performing year. Notably, it never approached a net loss. PayPal: Time to Dive Back in for Value?\n\nSource: StockRover\n\nThe second point worth discussing is PayPal's balance sheet. As a highly cash-generative business, PayPal's operationsdriven by strong transaction volumes and solid growth in digital paymentshave provided enough cash flow to fund its growth and strategic initiatives without relying heavily on borrowing. Until 2019, the company had virtually no debt. After that, PayPal began using debt to finance acquisitions and enhance its market position, such as its $4 billion acquisition of Honey in 2019. Over the last twelve months, PayPal reported long-term debt of $9.72 billion. However, this figure is manageable, especially when compared to its annual earnings; over the same period, PayPal reported a net income of $4.43 billion, meaning its indebtedness is below 2.5 times its earnings.\n\nTwo additional points that characterize PayPal as a deep value investment relate to profitability metrics like return on equity (ROE) and return on invested capital (ROIC). Over the last decade, PayPal's ROE has remained above 14% between 2019 and 2023, except for 2022 when it dipped to 12%. Meanwhile, ROIC stayed above 10% for most of the last decade, peaking at 17% in 2020 and registering 15.5% in the trailing twelve months. Even during its challenging period in 2022, ROIC was a solid 8.5%. This consistency indicates that the company has generated returns substantially higher than its cost of capital, demonstrating the robustness of its management.\n\nHowever, none of these indicators of value matter if PayPal is trading at a valuation that reflects its reality. To assess this, I consider the earnings yield, which shows how much profit a company generates relative to its market price. Currently, PayPal has an earnings yield of 5.3% over the last twelve months, which exceeds the 10-year Treasury yield of 3.7%. This difference suggests that the market may not yet fully recognize PayPal's growth potential and cash generation capabilities. If the company can maintain or increase this earnings yield, it will provide a strong argument for its future valuation.\n\nFinal Remarks\n\nPayPal's stock has suffered significant declines in recent years, primarily due to its overvaluation and industry pressures that have slowed both revenue and profit growth. However, the company's fundamentals remain solid, with recent performance reflecting trends consistent with its historically high-value trajectory.\n\nWhile it may be unlikely for PayPal to reach its previous highs above $300 per share in the near future, its strong fundamentals and attractive metrics, such as earnings yield, suggest there is substantial value yet to be unlocked. Therefore, I view PayPal not as a value trap but as a company with considerable upside potential.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Pivotal Research Group initiated coverage of Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with a Buy rating, highlighting the company's strong competitive position and potential for growth in cloud computing and AI.\n\nGoogle, which holds about 90% of the global search market share outside of China, is also recognized for its dominance in video/audio streaming through YouTube and its leading web browser, Chrome.\n\nGoogle's search business was deemed a monopoly in August, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) and a judge are considering remedies that could significantly impact the company's ability to leverage its market position.\n\nDespite this, Pivotal views the current valuation of Google as reflecting conservative post-2027 search revenue declines. Potential regulatory outcomes are not expected to be resolved soon, but Pivotal suggests that a Kamala Harris victory could lead to more favorable settlements for Google.\n\nIn a separate note, Pivotal also initiated coverage of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) with a Buy rating, setting a year-end 2025 target price of $780.\n\nMeta, known for its extensive portfolio of social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram, is praised for its management's ability to innovate and respond to competition.\n\n“Looking forward we see a strong revenue growth outlook from increased usage/new products/better targeting/higher prices boosted by cost efficiencies (enabled by AI) and eventually materially declining Reality Labs losses combined with what appears to be an attractive valuation at 24X ’25 EPS,” Pivotal analysts said in the note.\n\nThe firm also acknowledges risks such as potential regulation and market dominance investigations, as well as the challenges posed by Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in AI. Nevertheless, the investment firm believes that Meta's positives, including its aggressive management and attractive valuation, outweigh the potential negatives.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPivotal starts Google, Meta stock coverage at Buy\n\nUS stocks fall sharply amid fears of Middle East escalation\n\nBerkshire Hathaway buys full control of its energy unit\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Microsoft Shares Lag as ‘AI Fatigue,’ High Multiple Curb Rebound",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. shares have lost their luster in the past few months, with some investors cooling on the artificial-intelligence trade and looking for better value elsewhere in the sector.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai’s Sky-High Rents Gang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon’s Fast-Growing Cities A Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda’s Capital City New Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century Climate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World’s Megacities\n\nShares in the software company dipped lower by less than 1% over the past six months, compared with an almost 10% gain for the Nasdaq 100 Index. With a drop of 0.6% on Tuesday, the stock is nearly 9% below its all-time high, while an exchange-traded fund that tracks software firms closed at a record on Monday. The underperformance has come as Microsoft reported mixed results in its latest quarter and as AI more generally loses steam as a driver of stock gains.\n\n“There’s some AI fatigue when it comes to companies like Microsoft, given the incredible run they’ve had,” said Neville Javeri, senior fund manager at Allspring Global Investments. Investors “need to see additional proof points about demand for AI products and services for the rally to hold.”\n\nAnalysts at D.A. Davidson have also turned more cautious on Microsoft.\n\n“Competition has largely caught up with Microsoft on the AI front, which reduces the justification for the current premium valuation,” analyst Gil Luria wrote in a note last week, citing cloud rivals Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. A diminished lead in AI “will make it hard for MSFT to continue to outperform,” Luria said, downgrading the stock to neutral from buy.\n\nMicrosoft trades at 31 times estimated earnings and almost 11 times projected revenue. While both multiples are down from recent peaks, they’re well above their 10-year averages. The Nasdaq 100 trades at less than 26 times forward earnings and under 5 times sales.\n\nThe stock has also gathered some unfavorable comparisons to Oracle Corp., which has emerged as a popular alternative for software investors after its latest results showed robust AI tailwinds of its own. Oracle offers a lower multiple, trading at 26 times projected earnings, prompting several firms to upgrade the stock over the past month.\n\n“Oracle is sort of the new kid on the block, because it is more in the first innings of the growth curve,” said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. “More investors are rolling up their sleeves to look at it, whereas with Microsoft, they’re sharpening their pencils as they focus on Azure growth and when it will see more of a return on its capex.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft’s July earnings, in contrast, revealed a slowdown in its Azure cloud-computing service. While it showed growth attributable to AI, that figure was lower than some had hoped, underlining concerns about when Microsoft will see a more pronounced return on investments in AI.\n\nEven after a weaker couple of months, Microsoft shares remain up 14% this year — and the recent underperformance follows a 57% gain in 2023. The vast majority on Wall Street remain bullish, with more than 94% of analysts rating Microsoft stock a buy, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe company’s long-term prospects are also still viewed favorably. Revenue is expected to rise 14.5% in the 2025 fiscal year and accelerate for the next few years, reaching a 19% pace by 2028. Net earnings per share are also seen growing at a double-digit clip for the next several years.\n\nWith that backdrop, investors like Allspring’s Javeri and Logan Capital’s Ouimet remain positive on the shares in the long-term, despite short-term challenges.\n\n“It’s never surprising to see a stock take a pause, especially after doing well and with the market rally broadening, but it’s hard to find a company of this size and quality that’s going to grow at this level for the next several years,” Ouimet said. “Microsoft is so well positioned that the more it pulls back, the more attractive it looks.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. shares just closed out the third quarter with a 13.5% advance, marking their seventh straight quarter of gains. That’s the longest such streak for the Facebook parent since 2016. The stock is up more than 375% over the seven-quarter surge, with recent strength reflecting the company’s potential to benefit from AI. The shares are up more than 60% this year.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nDirecTV and Dish have agreed to combine in a deal that will create the biggest pay-TV provider in the US with about 18 million subscribers. DirecTV will acquire Dish TV and Sling TV from EchoStar Corp. for a nominal consideration of $1 plus the assumption of about $9.75 billion of debt, according to a statement that confirmed previous Bloomberg News reporting. Apple Inc. must face class claims from people who purchased certain iPhones and iPads in California with software that took up a significant chunk of storage preinstalled, but the company defeated buyers’ bids for two nationwide classes Monday. Dell Technologies Inc. founder and Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell on Thursday sold 10 million shares of his namesake company’s stock worth $1.22 billion, his second significant sale in September, according to filings. Alphabet Inc.’s $350 million settlement of securities claims that it didn’t disclose a Google social network security flaw is reasonable, as is an investor request for 19% of the total in legal fees, a federal court said Monday. Ravi Ahuja will replace Tony Vinciquerra as the chief executive officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment, the Hollywood arm of Tokyo-based Sony Group Corp., in January.\n\nEarnings Due Tuesday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Great €3 Billion Shipping Container Heist Investors Hot on India Shrug Off Adani Short Seller Attack Military Veterans Help Plug Worker Shortages at EV, Battery Plants Sprouting Up in the US Sports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought The Presidential Election Isn’t Stopping International Students From Coming to America\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Meta, Alphabet initiated: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nMoffettNathanson upgraded Roku (ROKU) to Neutral from Sell with an $80 price target. The firm has advised clients to sell Roku's stock over much of the past three years due to a strong conviction that consensus was mismodeling the drivers of Platform revenues, compounded by \"incredibly poor financial disclosure,\" but it has softened its view as it looks into the second half of 2024 and 2025. DA Davidson upgraded Datadog (DDOG) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $140, up from $115. The firm's proprietary developer data showed a strong positive inflection point for Datadog, which gives the firm confidence in the trajectory of demand. Wedbush upgraded Dine Brands(DIN) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $47, up from $34. The firm believes the company's current sales challenges are well understood and reflected in the stock's \"depressed valuation.\" Susquehanna upgraded Coherent (COHR) to Positive from Neutral with a price target of $120, up from $80. The firm believes new CEO Jim Anderson, and his platform optimization program, will \"ultimately transform the company's long-term financial model,\" potentially providing the company with over 1,000 basis points of net margin expansion. Goldman Sachs upgraded Ford (F) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $13, up from $12. There is a margin opportunity driven by the company's more profitable commercial business - Ford Pro, with mid-teens EBIT margins - and growing software and services mix, and the management's cost actions in internal combustion vehicles and EVs can help to offset industry headwinds, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nRaymond James downgraded Disney (DIS) to Market Perform from Outperform. The firm sees demand moderating at the company's amusement parks after a strong post-COVID surge and says the shares are expected to remain range bound as it contends that consumers are still digesting price increases taken in the past roughly four years. Wells Fargo downgraded General Dynamics(GD) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $317, down from $334, as the firm is cautious on the company and Boeing (BA) into the Q3 results. General Dynamics' 2024 guidance looked tough to hit at mid-year, and since then G700 deliveries appear to be well behind plan, Wells tells investors in a research note. Citi downgraded Hologic (HOLX) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $85, down from $95. The firm believes current fiscal 2025 estimates are too high and will likely need to be lowered, driven by normalization of demand. Citi downgraded HP Inc. (HPQ) to Neutral from Buy with an unchanged price target of $37. The firm cites a more cautious view of the PC recovery in the second half of 2024 for the downgrade. Oppenheimer downgraded Global Payments (GPN) to Perform from Outperform following analyst coverage transfer. Despite the recent stock pullback, the firm remains cautious on Global Payments, particularly as the acquiring industry remains \"intensely competitive.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nPivotal Research initiated coverage of Meta Platforms(META) with a Buy rating and $780 price target. The firm sees a \"strong\" revenue growth outlook from increased usage, new products, better targeting and higher prices, boosted by cost efficiencies and eventually materially declining Reality Labs losses combined \"with what appears to be an attractive valuation.\" Pivotal Research initiated coverage of Alphabet (GOOG) with a Buy rating and $215 price target. If \"the status quo holds,\" Alphabet appears to be in a \"very strong competitive position with a deep moat\" around its dominant core search business model and an \"obvious path\" to leverage its global device presence, strong artificial intelligence platform and \"financial might\" to increase financial incentives to handset manufacturers for default AI placement, the firm tells investors in a research note. Oppenheimer initiated coverage of SharkNinja (SN) with an Outperform rating and $120 price target. The firm notes the company's management team has executed quite well delivering consistent and well above expectation results in recent quarters, even in difficult U.S. consumer durables backdrop. Piper Sandler initiated coverage of Labcorp (LH) with a Neutral rating and $235 price target. The firm sees LabCorp as leading the industry in diagnostics services for decades, but with the stock's run over the last six months, Piper thinks the risk/reward is balanced at these levels. Argus initiated coverage of Snowflake (SNOW) with a Hold rating. The company is in a building phase as it invests in new product enhancements, particularly around AI/machine learning which are not generating near-term revenue, even though they may begin to payoff sometime in the future, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks With Extensive AI Applications to Hold Tight for Now",
        "content": "The astonishing rally in U.S. stocks that started at the beginning of 2023 was predominantly driven by the technology sector. An unprecedented adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology across the world was the prime factor.\n\nLately, a section of market analysts and financial researchers have raised concerns about the potential profitability of massive investments in generative AI by several technology giants. We believe that AI applications will continue to gather pace in the coming years, buoyed by the rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet.\n\nAt this stage, investors should keenly watch three technology behemoths with extensive applications of generative AI. These companies are - Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and Adobe Inc. ADBE.\n\nThese stocks have double-digit price upside in the short term. In the long term, these stocks have a higher earnings per share (EPS) growth rate than the broad-market S&P 500 index, which should drive their stock prices in the next 3 to 5 years. Each of these stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\n3 Tech Giants With Extensive AI Applications in Focus\n\nFocus on these three technology bigwigs for handsome returns in both the short and long terms.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of three stocks in the past three months. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\nA deepening focus on generative AI technology is a major positive for GOOGL in this data-driven world. Google has been well-poised to capitalize on the growing proliferation of generative AI-backed chatbots on the back of Bard, which enables users to collaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support and app integration.\n\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered with Gemini Pro in order to deliver enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\n\nIn addition, GOOGL’s Vertex AI enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models. These generative AI capabilities are aiding Google in enhancing search results, accelerating Android development, boosting healthcare reach and delivering enhanced cloud experience.\n\nHuge Price Upside Potential for GOOGL Stock\n\nAlphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14% and 31.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 60 days. Alphabet has a long-term (3-5 year) earnings growth rate of 17.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 23.3% from the last closing price of $165.85. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $170-$225.\n\nAmazon.com Inc.\n\nAmazon is pushing well with its devices strategy. Alexa powered Echo devices are going great guns and help the company sell products and services. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven Alexa has already been integrated into a host of everyday devices for the digital home, which has converted the nascent smart home market into a potential area of growth in a very short time.\n\nMoreover, AMZN is benefiting from an increasing number of Alexa-compatible smart devices. AMZN is racing to build an ecosystem around Alexa and it’s safe to say that it has taken an early lead over Google's smart assistant.\n\nAmazon is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure as a service to enterprise customers. The expanding customer base of Amazon Web Services (AWS) driven by its strengthening cloud offerings, will continue to aid AMZN’s dominance in the global cloud space.\n\nImpressive Price Upside Potential for AMZN Shares\n\nAmazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.4% and 63.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3% over the last 60 days. Alphabet has a long-term (3-5 year) earnings growth rate of 27.4%.\n\nThe average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 19.9% from the last closing price of $186.33. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $200-$265.\n\nAdobe Inc.\n\nAdobe has extensively implemented AI applications across its flagship products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Premiere. Earlier this year, ADBE introduced generative AI-driven Adobe Firefly. Moreover, Adobe Acrobat and Reader AI Assistant help users to summarize documents and answer questions, which can save time and help users accomplish tasks faster.\n\nUsing its new AI-driven cloud-based platform, ADBE is also diversifying into digital marketing services, offering data mining services, which help businesses measure page views, purchases and social media sites. Adobe Marketing Cloud enables marketers to deliver personalized web experiences across multiple devices, manage multichannel campaigns and optimize media monetization.\n\nThese services help businesses streamline marketing and products for targeted consumer groups, including chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers, advertising agencies, publishing executives and digital marketers.\n\nADBE has launched Adobe Express, an application for quick editing effects. Leveraging generative AI, this tool is useful for short-form video content like Instagram Reels. Adobe also launched an AI-based Express app for iOS and Android.\n\nSolid Price Upside Potential for ADBE Shares\n\nAdobe has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.5% and 13.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last 30 days. Alphabet has a long-term (3-5 year) earnings growth rate of 13.1%.\n\nThe average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 19% from the last closing price of $517.78. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $450-$703.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG): How AI Expansion and Financial Stability Make It a Must-Buy",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 15 AI Stocks That Are On Sale. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks that are on sale.\n\nBig Tech: The Best Performing Sector of Q2?\n\nBig tech, specifically artificial intelligence, is the sector that many are starting to consider as the best-performing sector of the market in the second quarter of 2024. The concentration of the major players in this space has been in the large-cap companies since your ability to fully develop AI and benefit from its profitability really depends on the scale of your business. Basically, the bigger a company is, the better it will be positioned within the AI-led market this year. Because of this phenomenon, big tech companies, with all the money in the world to invest in AI development, are ensuring that this revolutionary tech drives the overall tech sector to record highs in 2024.\n\nAccording to Alex Kantrowitz, Founder of Big Technology, these trends can be expected to lift up other sectors in the market that have a strong relationship with AI. One such sector is energy, which, according to Kantrowitz, is going to be seeing a lot more demand from customers that are developing AI and creating and training Large Language Models. While many players in the AI space today are also working on finding ways to use energy for AI development more efficiently, the general consensus seems to be that there’s a need to tap into more existing sources of energy until such methods are found. Because of this, the markets may see demand for nuclear energy rise to unprecedented levels as well.\n\nAI in Digital Advertising\n\nAnother sector that might catch the AI draft and be propelled higher is digital advertising. With the rise of AI-powered marketing clouds, many advertisement-focused businesses are beginning to see immense increases in their return on investment. According to David Steinberg, the CEO of Zeta Global, AI is leading to immense growth within the advertising ecosystem, with Steinberg expecting growth in low double-digits this year. He noted that the launch of ChatGPT was the “big renaissance moment” for AI, which changed our perception of this technology from being a figment of science fiction to something serious enough to be discussed in company board rooms. Because of this, Steinberg believes that every company out there in advertisement and retail is pivoting its business to incorporate high-quality enterprise AI usages in its operations.\n\nPart of the reason why AI is taking over the market in this manner is the promise it makes – efficiency coupled with revenue growth. By focusing on AI development and integration, businesses across the globe can increase their efficiency while also generating higher profits for themselves and their shareholders. Considering this, and the fact that AI stocks have been performing exceptionally well in the second quarter, we have compiled a list of some AI stocks on sale that investors may wish to consider for their portfolios this year.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe first compiled a list of 40 AI stocks by sifting through ETFs and online rankings, including our own rankings. We then selected the 15 stocks with P/E ratios lower than the S&P 500’s P/E of 24.1 as of September 27 (according to data from WSJ) and with expected EPS growth for this year. The stocks are ranked based on their P/E ratios, from the highest to the lowest. We also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock, as of the second quarter.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nExpected Earnings Growth: 31.9%\n\nP/E Ratio: 21.6\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a big tech company offering interactive media and communication services. It is based in Mountain View, California. The company is an active player and pioneer in the AI space is also behind Gemini, a major Large Language Model. Moreover, its Google Cloud Platform is among the top choices for enterprises and developers for building AI and ML applications.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a company with immense financial fortitude since it has managed to generate significant profits since its IPO 20 years ago. The company reported $23.5 billion in net income in the second quarter alone, which translated to a net profit margin of 28%. With this much financial stability, the company’s involvement in the AI space has made many investors consider it among the top AI stocks to buy.\n\nToday, almost all of Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) products and services have AI integrated into them. A few examples of its existing AI-enhanced offerings include Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail, and the Google Cloud. With plans to invest at least $12 billion per quarter on capital expenditures, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is expected to take its AI integration even further to its own and its shareholders’ benefit.\n\nConsidering these factors, the company’s current valuation and P/E ratio of merely 23.5 points makes Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) quite a steal in the AI market today.\n\nThere were 165 hedge funds long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $22.01 billion.\n\nDiamond Hill Capital mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second-quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon, Texas Instruments and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Media and technology company Alphabet also continued delivering strong results in its search, YouTube advertising, YouTube subscription and cloud businesses. Shares rose amid an environment that continues favoring mega-cap technology companies.”\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 14th on our list of AI stocks that are on sale. While GOOG is an exceptional investment, we believe that AI stocks hold promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG and which trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Magnificent Stocks to Buy in October",
        "content": "With the fourth quarter of 2024 officially arriving, some investors may already be looking ahead to 2025. However, that's still three months out, and investors shouldn't squander the opportunity to pick up shares of some stocks that look like great values.\n\nIf you're looking to buy stocks this October, I think you'll be hard-pressed to find better picks than these three.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC, is one of the world's most important companies. It manufactures custom chips for nearly every big tech player and is a key reason why artificial intelligence (AI) technology is advancing rapidly.\n\nIt offers the most advanced chip technology available on the market and already has new designs in the pipeline that will introduce more capabilities than ever before.\n\nBecause of its neutral position as a chip manufacturer, it is slated to benefit from the general trend toward more powerful digital devices. This is why management believes it will grow revenue at a compound annual rate of 15% to 20% over the next several years.\n\nIt's rare for a company that size to deliver that level of growth, but the environment is shaping up for TSMC to do that. If it delivers on that projection, then it's a no-brainer buy if the stock can be purchased at a fair price.\n\nThe stock is trading at 28 times forward earnings, so it's not cheap, but it's still at a reasonable level at which investors can expect solid market outperformance over the long term.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is better known as Google's parent company. The Google family of products is quite large, and it generates huge revenue from this family through ads. With ad revenue making up about three-quarters of Alphabet's total revenue in the second quarter, it's a critical part of the investment thesis.\n\nAd revenue rose 11% in Q2, which is solid growth considering how mature this business is. The profits from ads allow Alphabet to fund its AI research, which has created one of the best generative AI models available, Gemini. While this platform hasn't been monetized well yet, it has been integrated into several of Alphabet's ad products, which keeps it on top of the game for the best places to advertise.\n\nAlphabet also has a thriving cloud computing business, Google Cloud. Cloud computing has seen an uptick in usage as companies look for ways to find computing power to train their AI models. Renting this computing power instead of outright buying it is a far less cash-intensive process, and it is a reason why Google Cloud is excelling.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, Alphabet's revenue rose 14% in Q2, and earnings per share (EPS) rose 31%. These phenomenal results should give Alphabet a premium over the market. However, Alphabet is fairly cheap and trades for only 21 times forward earnings versus the S&P 500 index's 23 times forward earnings.\n\nThis is a significant value investing opportunity, making Alphabet a screaming buy.\n\nPayPal\n\nWhile the market has done well since 2022, PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) has been a disastrous investment. The stock has fallen nearly 60% although it has risen about 20% in the past two months.\n\nPayPal is a textbook turnaround story as it has a fairly new CEO and is focused on cost-saving initiatives. There is a lot to work with at PayPal as it is still posting healthy 8% revenue growth and grew its payment volume by 11% to $417 billion in Q2. However, the market is convinced that PayPal is a failing company, which is why it trades at such a cheap valuation. PYPL PE Ratio Chart\n\nPayPal's management is taking advantage of this incredible value and using much of its cash flow to repurchase shares. This boosts PayPal's EPS growth and is the primary reason why PayPal's EPS rose 17% in Q2.\n\nManagement also boosted its fiscal-year 2024 guidance, increasing its EPS target from $3.65 to $3.93. This indicates that the company turnaround is going strong and that PayPal's stock may be on the brink of a huge bull rally.\n\nEven though the turnaround has started, PayPal still offers plenty of value, making it a great stock to consider buying in October.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Serve Robotics, which delivers food for Uber Eats using sidewalk robots, said it would partner with Alphabet-owned Wing Aviation to use drones, extending the operational range to more than six miles.\n\nThe pilot, announced on Tuesday, would take place in Dallas, Texas, and mark Serve's entry into the market. The tie-up will have Serve's robots pick up food from restaurants and transfer it to Wing drones for aerial delivery.\n\nThe company's operations have so far focused on Los Angeles, where it delivers food and groceries for convenience retailer 7-Eleven and Shake Shack, in addition to Uber Eats.\n\nMulti-modal delivery will expand Serve's reach, enabling 30-minute autonomous delivery citywide, Serve's CEO Ali Kashani said.\n\nWhile drones were once touted to be the future of package and food delivery, their adoption has been limited by a lack of spaces for takeoff and landing in cities. Unlike them, sidewalk delivery robots are designed to navigate urban environments, making them a more practical solution.\n\n\"Through this pilot partnership, Wing hopes to reach more merchants in highly congested areas while supporting Serve as it works to expand its delivery radius,\" Wing CEO Adam Woodworth said.\n\nServe, spun off from Postmates in 2021 a year after its acquisition by Uber, said merchants would not have to make any changes to their workflow or facilities to accommodate robot-to-drone deliveries.\n\nThe Alphabet unit, which started as a project within incubator Google X, has completed more than 400,000 commercial deliveries across three continents, Woodworth added.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Vijay Kishore)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple (AAPL)\n\nThe world's most valuable company, Apple, closed near its all-time high on Monday. The stock ended the previous session 2.3% higher at $233 (£175) per share, just below the high of $234.82 it hit in July.\n\nThis took the tech giant's market capitalisation up to $3.5tn.\n\nUS markets more broadly notched fresh records on the final day of the quarter, with the S&P 500 closing 0.4% in the green.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European markets cautious as Israel starts ground invasion in Lebanon\n\nLooking at Apple specifically, Barron's reported that a Morgan Stanley note on Monday referred to stabilising lead times for some iPhone 16 models.\n\nThere had been some concern, following the launch of the new iPhone in September, that early demand for the latest model was lagging 2023 levels.\n\nOther megacap tech companies also ended Monday's session in positive territory, with Google-owner Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) up more than 1% and social media giant Meta Platforms (META) up nearly 1%.\n\nGreggs (GRG.L)\n\nShares in sausage roll-maker Greggs dipped 5% on Tuesday morning, after it reported a slowdown in underlying sales growth in the third quarter.\n\nThe food-on-the-go retailer said like-for-like sales in this latest quarter were up 5%, versus 6.5% year-to-date, and slower than the 7.4% growth it reported in the first half.\n\nHowever, Greggs said that it was \"acknowledging ongoing economic uncertainty, [and] the board expects the full year outcome to be in line with its previous expectations\".\n\nThe British baker also said it expected the overall level of cost inflation for the year to be towards the lower end of the 4% to 5% range that it previously mentioned.\n\nRead more: The top gold funds to invest in as prices soar\n\nIn terms of new products, Greggs said it had launched a pumpkin spiced doughnut as part of its autumn menu. The chain said it was also on track to open between 140 and 160 net new shops in 2024.\n\nMamta Valechha, retail equity analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"We continue to like Greggs; the group ranks highly on price perception and quality among coffee shops and quick service restaurants. There is significant growth potential in London and south-east England, and Greggs remains second only to McDonald’s in monthly active app users.\"\n\nDespite Tuesday's fall in share price, Greggs is still up 14% year-to-date.\n\nStellantis (STLAM.MI)\n\nCarmaker Stellantis tumbled in Monday's session, after it cut its outlook for the full-year.\n\nThe company warned adjusted operating income (AOI) margins were now expected to be between 5.5% and 7%, down from the double digits it had previously forecast.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Roughly two-thirds of the reduced AOI margin is driven by corrective actions in North America,\" Stellantis said. \"Other contributors include lower than expected sales performance in the second half of the year across most regions.\"\n\nRead more: What are share buybacks?\n\nThe carmaker also said it now expected to see negative cashflow for the year of between €5bn (£4.2bn) and €10bn.\n\nThe company also reportedly said on Monday that it was recalling 194,000 plug-in hybrid jeeps over fire risk.\n\nStellantis wasn't the only European carmaker to fall in the previous session, as Aston Martin (AML.L) also slumped after warning on profits.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\n\nTechnology company Super Micro Computer underwent a 10-for-1 stock split following the market close on Monday.\n\nStock splits increase the number of shares in circulation, which reduces the share price, broadening accessibility to a wider range of investors.\n\nA number of companies have announced stock splits this year, including chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and retailer Walmart (WMT).\n\nRead more: Funds set to benefit from falling interest rates\n\nShares in Super Micro fell sharply last week after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US Department of Justice is investigating the company over alleged accounting irregularities.\n\nIn August, the company announced that it would be delayed in filing its annual report. A day prior to that announcement, Hindenburg Research disclosed it had taken a short position in the company and claimed it had found \"fresh evidence of accounting manipulation\".\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): A Cheap Internet Stock to Invest In Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Cheap Internet Stocks To Invest In Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other cheap Internet stocks.\n\nWhat’s Happening with China’s Stock Market\n\nRecently, China’s stock market has seen a sharp rally, driven by some aggressive measures by the government to revive the economy. China is the world’s second-largest economy and one of the key players in the technology industry. This huge economy has faced a series of challenges for the past few years in the shape of a sharp property market downturn and a lack of consumer confidence.\n\nThe government measures include interest rate cuts and liquidity injection into the market. On September 24, Reuters reported China’s central bank cut bank reserve requirement by 50 basis points and it also reduced interest rate by 20 basis points to 1.5%. Moreover, the bank also plans to issue 2 trillion yuan in special sovereign bonds.\n\nThese measures resulted in the CSI 300 index trading higher. The index closed 4.5% higher after the announcement whereas the Hong Kong Index gained 3.6%. This move by the Chinese central bank is said to have a positive effect around the globe. Analysts in the United States are already discussing the news as “China Boost”. While many analysts are calling this boost to be short-lived, others are confident that this is a positive mood and will benefit the market in the long term.\n\nDavid Tepper, Appaloosa Management founder and president and Carolina Panthers owner joined CNBC for an interview recently to talk about the global impact of the Chinese stimulus.\n\nWhile drawing a comparison between the Chinese and the United States stock markets, Tepper pointed out that Chinese stocks have been trading at single-digit multiples with earnings expected to grow in double digits for major stocks at least. On the other hand, the United States S&P average is sitting at more than 20 times.\n\nTepper believes that China has exceeded expectations with the recent move and while quoting the government officials of China he pointed out that they are willing to do more if needed. He further emphasized that the central bank is encouraging buybacks of stocks and they are even lending money to do that at very cheap rates. This is an internal stimulus that is going to encourage consumption and Tepper believes that the Chinese government is doing everything it can to revive the economy.\n\nWhile talking about the global impact of this move, Tepper mentioned that the European market is already making cuts, the United States market has seen one cut already with more expected during the year, and with the Chinese making cuts Japan is expected to follow suit. Tepper thinks this is a very good scenario for undervalued stocks in China and around the world in general. As an American investor as well, Chinese stocks look cheap when compared to the market average. Moreover, Tepper thinks that the United States is not a cheap market currently, he thinks it is slightly overvalued. Though it is a tough comparison, if you compare the price-to-earnings ratio of global stock markets, the United States will find itself slightly overvalued.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of 7 cheap internet stocks to invest in now we used the Finviz stock screener and ETFs. Using these sources we aggregated a list of 15 internet stocks. From these stocks we selected stocks that are trading below the Forward Price-to-Earning ratio of 23.98 (the market’s forward P/E as per the Wall Street Journal) and earnings expected to grow during the year. Once we had the list of cheap internet stocks, we then ranked them based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them in Q2 2024, which we took from Insider Monkey's database of over 900 hedge funds. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nForward P/E Ratio: 21.14\n\nEarnings Growth This Year: 31.90%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the leaders when it comes to internet stocks. At its basics, the company is an international technology hub with operations running in cloud computing, internet search, artificial intelligence, software development, and hardware as well. Its search engine Google has gone on to become a synonym for internet search engine.\n\nWhile Google continues to maintain it's market-leading position with more than 91% market share, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is continuously developing its AI technology. The company has launched its large language model Gemini to compete in the generative AI race. And has plans to invest more than $50 billion in AI development. The company also runs YouTube, which is a video streaming platform.\n\nApart from this, its cloud business is also soaring with more than 60% of GenAI startups using its Google Cloud. The cloud revenue of the company grew 28.8% year-over-year during the second quarter of 2024. Overall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was able to grow its revenue by 14% to reach $84.7 billion.\n\nBy the end of the year, management anticipates the company’s revenue to reach $100 billion. What’s truly impressive is its cheap valuation. GOOGL is trading at a forward P/E of 21 and analysts expect its earnings to grow by 32% during the year, making it one of the cheapest internet stocks to invest in now.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 1st on our list of the cheap Internet stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a promising AI stock that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Louis Dreyfus Co. raised its offer for Namoi Cotton Ltd. after acquiring nearly half of the Australian company’s shares, outbidding Olam Agri Holdings Ltd., which is still waiting for regulatory approval.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai’s Sky-High Rents Gang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon’s Fast-Growing Cities New Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century Climate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World’s Megacities Vanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion\n\nLDC increased its bid to A$0.77 ($0.53) a share and said it now owned 47.66% of Namoi, according to an exchange filing on Tuesday. The offer, which values the cotton processor at A$158 million, is scheduled to close on Oct. 9. Samuel Terry Asset Management, Namoi’s biggest shareholder, had accepted its offer, Dreyfus said.\n\nNamoi shares rose as much as 8.8% to A$0.7725 at 12:53 p.m. in Sydney. The stock has rallied 61% this year.\n\nThe rival crop traders have been jostling to buy Namoi since January to gain a bigger foothold in Australia, the world’s sixth-largest cotton producer. Dreyfus’s most recent offer has set it up to close the deal, and made an Olam takeover substantially less likely.\n\nOlam’s most recent bid of A$0.75 a share was recommended by Namoi’s independent directors and major shareholders last month, but is still conditional on pending approval from Australia’s regulatory watchdog, which has raised competition concerns. It also requires support from more than half the company’s shareholders, which is likely to pose a challenge given Dreyfus now controls almost half of Namoi.\n\nOlam, Dreyfus and Samuel Terry all declined to comment, while Namoi didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\n--With assistance from Harry Brumpton.\n\n(Updates with share price and additional details from second paragraph.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Australian retail sales rose by more than expected in August as tax cuts and warmer weather encouraged households to spend more on dining out and on clothing and footwear, reinforcing the case for interest rates to remain on hold for the time being.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai’s Sky-High Rents Gang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon’s Fast-Growing Cities New Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century Climate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World’s Megacities Vanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion\n\nSales advanced 0.7% from the prior month, exceeding a 0.4% estimate in the biggest monthly increase since January, official figures showed on Tuesday. The outcome follows an upwardly revised 0.1% result in July.\n\nIn response, the currency and yields on policy-sensitive three-year government bonds edged higher.\n\n“More people were out dining at cafes and restaurants enjoying the warm end to the winter months,” said Robert Ewing, ABS head of business statistics. “This year was the warmest August on record since 1910.”\n\nRetail sales can be an important consideration in policy decisions given consumption accounts for more than half of gross domestic product. The Reserve Bank has repeatedly highlighted the outlook for household spending as a key uncertainty following 13 rate hikes between May 2022 and November 2023.\n\nTuesday’s data showed retail sales rose 3.1% from a year earlier, compared with 1.7% in August 2023. The improvement comes as the government’s tax cuts and energy rebates kicked in on July 1. The household savings ratio has also fallen.\n\nThe RBA meets again in November, with economists and markets predicting its next move will be down. The rate-setting board has set a high bar to tightening further, while saying it’s still premature to consider cuts.\n\nThe consensus among economists is that the RBA will hold rates at 4.35% this year, though some believe a cut in November can’t be ruled out, particularly if third-quarter inflation at the end of this month surprises on the downside.\n\nTuesday’s retail data also showed:\n\nDepartment stores led the gains, up 1.6%, followed by clothing, footwear and personal accessories Cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services climbed 1% as people took advantage of the warmer weather, the ABS said Household goods retailing, down 0.3%, was the only industry to fall\n\n(Adds further details from report.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Great €3 Billion Shipping Container Heist Military Veterans Help Plug Worker Shortages at EV, Battery Plants Sprouting Up in the US Sports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought The Presidential Election Isn’t Stopping International Students From Coming to America Apple Rolls Back Its Big Plans to Release Movies in Theaters\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",
